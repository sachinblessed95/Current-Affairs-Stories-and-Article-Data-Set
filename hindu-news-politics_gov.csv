Government seeks EC nod on appointment of new Army chief
","Amid questions raised by the BJP on the competence of the UPA government to choose the next Army Chief in the middle of election process, the Defence Minister A.K. Antony has said that the matter has been referred to the Election Commission for its advice.
For some days now the principal opposition party has been questioning the propriety of the government to make new appointments including that of the new Army Chief on the plea that it would be against the letter and spirit of the Election Commission’s Model Code of Conduct (MCC) in operation since the announcement of the General Election scheduled on March 5.
However in a communication to the Defence Secretary on March 27 the Commission had said that the Code is not applicable to any matter pertaining directly to the defence forces, be it the recruitments/promotions for defence forces, all service matters pertaining to them, defence purchases of all kinds, tenders relating to the matter of the defence forces and consequently no reference need be sent to the Commission pertaining to model code in these matters.
“These instructions shall be treated as standing instructions of the Commission and will be applicable for all elections in future. This may be brought to the notice of all concerned for future guidance”.
Despite the EC communication, on April 19 the BJP Legal Affairs Cell wrote a letter to the Election Commission asking the poll body to direct the government to refrain from making `major appointments’ including those related to armed forces.
“This is to seek your intervention in the tendency that seems to be on the increase in the government to make major appointments during the election process itself. You are aware of the undue haste with which the naval Chief was appointed. We learn that something similar is cooking in respect of the Army Chief where the present incumbent is due to superannuate in July 2014. We also hear that there is some hurried activity in hastening the selection process of the Lok Pal. It may be recalled the process of selection got aborted by the exit of the eminent jurists and as such the whole selection process currently stands vitiated”, the BJP letter had said.
The Defence Minister suggested that the government had sought counsel of the Commission as it wanted to strictly follow all the procedures before taking any final decision on the issue.
The present Army Chief Gen. Bikram Singh is due to retire on July 31 after the retirement of present Army chief Gen Bikram Singh. Traditionally, the appointment of chief of services has been made two months before the retirement of the incumbent.
However, in the case of Gen Bikram Singh, the appointment was done three months before the retirement of Gen V K Singh, who was engaged in a
> long-drawn battle with the government over his age issue.

Gopal Kanda launches party in Haryana
","Former Haryana Minister and Independent MLA from Sirsa City, Gopal Goyal Kanda, who withdrew support to the Bhupinder Singh Hooda Government in Haryana two days back, launched a political party on Friday.
Named Haryana Lokhit Party, Kanda termed it as an alternative to the existing political system, and assured that his party would work to end “dynasty rule, casteism and regionalism in politics” and work for the development of state.
46—year—old Kanda, who is also the president of the party, said Haryana was deprived of development even after five decades of formation and despite its proximity to the national capital.
“The state is lagging behind in the field of education, healthcare and trade,” he said.
Kanda said “dynastic politics of few parties has become biggest hurdle in Haryana’s development” and asserted that his party would provide people a clean alternative which would be free from caste politics.
“The people of Haryana are looking for a viable alternative. The state’s politics has been under the control of two or three political families. We want to change this,” he said.
HLP is headquartered in Gurgaon in the same building as his MDLR airlines, whose operations had been suspended earlier.
Kanda, who is facing trial in the suicide case of air—hostess Geetika Sharma and is currently out on bail, had on Wednesday, withdrawn support to the Hooda government.
The legislator, who was state’s Home Minister, had earlier this week accused the chief minister of betraying him during crises and also charged the state government with tapping the phones of its Ministers and MLAs. However, the state government had denied the phone tapping charges.

NIA team going to Chennai to collect blast data
","The Centre has asked the National Investigation Agency (NIA) to collect data about the twin blasts in a train at Chennai Central railway station on Thursday that left one woman dead and 14 injured.
The Centre's decision to rush a NIA team was taken after the Tamil Nadu Government was assured that the central probe agency would be only collecting data about the blasts as it was probing several cases pertaining to terrorism in that region.
Union Home Minister Sushilkumar Shinde said a team of NIA was being sent to the spot for collecting data.
“We wanted to send the NIA team but the State government told us that CB—CID will probe the matter. Until the State government allows us for a NIA probe, we can’t take the matter in our hands. But we are sending the NIA team for data collection,” Shinde said.
The comments of Shinde come a day after the Tamil Nadu Government had refused any help from the Centre and made it clear that the case would be handled by the CB—CID of the State police.
In the meantime, security agencies were examining the CCTV footage at the Bangalore railway station and also examining those present in the S—4 and S—5 coaches of Bangalore—Guwahati Express to get some lead about the person who planted the explosive material under the seat.
The explosive material was strong but the brunt of its impact was neutralised by the iron seats as well as the flooring of the coaches that were examined by NIA as well as Bomb Data Centre of NSG.

CBI files charge sheet in Nido Tania case
","Four of the seven persons accused of assaulting Arunachal Pradesh student Nido Tania at a Lajpat Nagar market in South Delhi on January 29 have been charged by the Central Bureau of Investigation with culpable homicide not amounting to murder.
“Following a thorough probe, we have come to the conclusion that the accused assaulted Nido, which led to his death. However, the investigators did not come across any evidence to suggest that the attack was premeditated with an intention to kill. The assault on the victim was apparently the fallout of a sudden fight between him and the accused persons and only a stick was used as a weapon,” said a CBI official.
Accordingly, the CBI on Friday filed a charge sheet against four of the adult accused persons - Pawan, Sunder, Farman and Sunny Uppal - under Sections 304 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder), 342 (wrongful confinement), 201 (destruction of evidence), 34 (common purpose) and relevant provisions of the SC/ST Prevention of Atrocities Act.
Proceedings against the three other juvenile accused would be initiated in the Juvenile Justice Board.
According to Nido’s family, the incident took place after he approached a shopkeeper for directions to his friend’s house and was mocked by the bystanders over his hair style. In a fit of rage, Nido - son of a Congress MLA - allegedly smashed the glass counter of the shop, which led to a heated exchange and then the accused persons assaulted him. Nido died the next day. The post-mortem report revealed that he died due to internal injuries in the brain and lungs.
The incident triggered a >series of protests by the victim’s friends and members of the North Eastern communities living in the Capital. It also drew sharp reactions from political parties and human rights organisations.
The victim’s relatives alleged that after the police were called in to intervene, they took him to the police station and dropped him again at the scene of crime, following which he was again assaulted. However, the police denied the charges stating that he was not assaulted a second time.
The case was >transferred to the CBI after Nido’s parents met Union Home Minister Sushilkumar Shinde and Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi in February. The Delhi Police had by then arrested the four adult accused and apprehended two of the juveniles for suspected involvement in the case.

Seemandhra stoic as Sonia speaks
","Low turnout greeted Congress president Sonia Gandhi at the Andhra Muslim College grounds on the Ponnuru road here when she arrived to address a campaign rally Friday, apparently reflecting the anger of the people of >Seemandhra region over state’s bifurcation.

Chidambaram played fraud on budgets: Yashwant Sinha
","The spat between Union Finance Minister P. Chidambaram and BJP Leader Yashwant Sinha deepened on Friday. “I may have been the worst Finance Minister after 1991, but I did not commit fraud,” Mr. Sinha said in a statement on Friday. “Mr. Chidambaram has been the cleverest Finance Minister since 1991 and has played fraud on the budget not only this year but always.”
Mr. Sinha was reacting to >Mr. Chidambaram’s comments at a press briefing at Congress headquarters on Thursday where he had said that the BJP leader’s performance as Finance Minister “was such that he had to demit the office on July 1, 2002”. “I may point out that 2000-01 and 2002-03 were the worst years since liberalisation in terms of growth and Prime Minister Vajpayee was forced to replace the Finance Minister,” Mr. Chidambaram had said. “I thought Mr. Sinha would be happy to remain a distant memory for the people of India, however, he seems determined to remain relevant in his party.”
Earlier, in April, Mr. Sinha and Mr. Chidambaram had made similar remarks about each other’s tenures as Finance Minister. The two sparring Finance Ministers have been debating amongst other issues the true fiscal deficit, or excess of government expenditure over its income, for India.
In Friday’s statement, Mr. Sinha clarified remarks he made earlier this week in a newspaper interview about Mr. Chidambaram: “I said that the seeds of the present economic crisis were sown by Mr. Chidambaram himself in 2008-09…. I also added that the liberties which were taken with the fiscal then were still bothering us and that Mr. Chidambaram’s claim that he had restricted the fiscal deficit to 4.6 per cent of the GDP in 2013-14 was questionable”.
He stated that he had also added that Mr. Chidambaram “had played fraud in the interim budget and that the next government should come out with a white paper to expose his lies”. Mr. Sinha further stated that Mr. Chidambaram had in his 1997-98 budget targeted a fiscal deficit of 4.5 per cent of the Gross Domestic Product, however, the target was missed and the figure had ballooned to 5.8 per cent in the subsequent year’s budget.
The expenditure figures released by The Comptroller General of Accounts of the Ministry of Finance for April – February 2013-14 show that in actual numbers the fiscal deficit has exceeded Mr. Chidambaram’s revised estimates presented in February 2014 by a “whopping” Rs. 74,760 crore (from Rs. 524539 crore to Rs. 599299 crore), Mr. Sinha said. “Within six weeks the veracity of the figures presented by Mr. Chidambaram has been questioned by his own agency. Instead of challenging me on facts, Mr. Chidambaram has decided to attack me personally,” Mr. Sinha stated.

Deploy adequate forces in east UP: BJP tells EC
","The BJP on Friday asked the Election Commission to ensure adequate deployment of central security forces on all polling booths in eastern Uttar Pradesh for a “free and fair” election.
“BJP very earnestly requests the Election Commission to deploy adequate number of central forces on all booths of UP’s Poorvanchal region (eastern region) so that a free and fair election may get conducted here,” said BJP leader Ravi Shankar Prasad at a press conference here.
Hitting out at the Congress, Mr Prasad said they lodge complaints before the EC against Mr Modi like “kids with petty excuses”.
According to the Representation of People Act, a person can canvass at above a distance of 100 metres after casting votes. Mr Modi did the same thing as he spoke to the media at a distance permissible by the EC, the BJP leader said.
Replying to a query that the EC ordered the FIR against Mr Modi with a biased approach, Mr Prasad said, “we have full respect for EC but the poll body should have first enquired about the incident and then ordered for registering an FIR”.
“When leaders like Abu Azmi and Azam Khan gives hate speeches and remarks, why doesn’t this Congress complain to the Election commission,” he asked.
Leaders like Mulayam Singh Yadav, Lalu Prasad, Mayawati, Nitish Kumar, and Arvind Kejriwal are campaigning only against Mr Modi and speaking against him, he claimed.

HC rejects Adarsh Society plea opposing MoD title suit
","The Bombay High Court on Friday rejected an application made by scam-tainted Adarsh Housing Society opposing the title suit filed by the Union Ministry of Defence claiming ownership on the land in South Mumbai where the plush building stands.
The Defence Ministry had in December 2012 filed a title suit in the High Court stating that the land in Colaba where the 31—storey Adarsh building is constructed belongs to them (Defence Ministry) and possession should be handed back to them.
The Defence Ministry alleged that the Adarsh building has been constructed “illegally and unlawfully”. It further states that MoD is the sole owner of the land and that the land was transferred to Adarsh Society by fraud, collusion and connivance on the part of the society members, ministers and bureaucrats of the state government.
The Society had, however, filed an application opposing the title suit on the ground that only the Defence Estate Officer (DEO) can file title suits on behalf of the Defence Ministry.
The Society relied on an order passed by the General Governor Council and the Government of India in 1930.
“The Society also relied on the military land manual which says that only the defence estate officer is authorised to file and conduct a title suit in court on behalf of the Ministry of Defence,” Society lawyer Saket Mone from Vidhi law firm argued.
The Defence Ministry refuted this and argued that the Ministry is empowered to file and conduct title suits.
Justice Roshan Dalvi on Friday heard arguments from both sides and rejected the Society’s application.
Meanwhile, in a related development, a division bench of Justices P V Hardas and A S Gadkari refused to hear a public interest litigation filed by former journalist Ketan Tirodkar alleging that the CBI has failed to arraign as accused, the family members of several politicians who own flats in the society under benami names.

Congress desperation showing in ‘stoop-gate’: BJP
","Asserting that it had nothing to fear, the BJP on Friday lashed out at the Congress over the 'snoopgate' probe issue, accusing it of “stooping low” in “desperation” and said the next government would be within its rights to review the “malafide” last—minute decision.
As the UPA Government declared that a judicial commission to probe ‘snoopgate’ allegedly involving Narendra Modi will be in place before the Lok Sabha poll process comes to an end on May 16, the BJP accused the Congress of “deliberately” diverting the attention of the people from the real issues of unemployment, price rise and corruption.
“They are trying desperately to get at least one Judge to agree to head the ‘snoopgate’ commission. I doubt very much if any of these moves is likely to succeed. Even if it did, the future government would be well within its legitimate rights to review such a malafide last—minute decision of the UPA,” BJP leader Arun Jaitley said.
BJP leader Ravi Shankar Prasad said, “It is not snoopgate, it is stoop-gate. The Home Minister of India is stooping to this level. I can see the desperation.... No judge is willing to inquire into it, but they are insisting. We don’t fear you.”
He wondered if the ruling party was trying to “pressurise” the judiciary in appointing a judge to the snoopgate commission.
Prasad said while his party had no fear about the snoopgate probe, “I am concerned about the diginity of the office of a judge.”
“Are you going to pressurise the judiciary for your collateral, extraneous purposes. This is utter desperation, nothing else,” he said.
“We are fighting the election on the issue of growth, on the issues of price rise, unemployment, on stinking corruption. They have no response to that and therefore deliberate diversion is being done on the so—called snoopgate. Kapil Sibal and Sushilkumar Shinde are stooping to this level,"".
He said, ""No judge is willing to inquire into it, but they are insisting, when after 10 days a new government is going to be in power led by Narendra Modi. This is desperation, helplessness, irritation of the Congress and I can understand it because the people are not giving them any indulgence during their campaign and Congress is going to have its lowest ever performance,” he said.

Army chief appointment issue referred to EC: Antony
","Amid strong opposition by the BJP to the appointment of the next Army chief, the Government on Friday said the matter has been referred to the Election Commission and any decision will be taken only after getting its nod.
“The matter is before the Election Commission. We want to strictly follow all the procedures before taking any final decision on the issue,” Defence Minister AK Antony said when asked about the status of appointing the next Army chief.
The matter was sent to the Election Commission by the Defence Ministry earlier this week though the poll panel has already said that appointments, promotions, tenders and procurements are not covered under the Model Code of Conduct in the ongoing elections as well as any other election in the future.
On why the Ministry has sent the matter to the Election Commission despite its March 27 order, highly-placed Defence Ministry sources said such matters are important and it was felt that nod of all authorities concerned should be taken before proceeding.
The BJP has been opposing the appointment of the next Army chief by the UPA Government, arguing that there was no hurry to do so and the matter should be left to the next government.
Army Vice Chief Lt Gen Dalbir Singh Suhag is the frontrunner for appointment to the top post which will fall vacant on July 31 after the retirement of present Army chief Gen Bikram Singh.
Traditionally, the appointment of chief of services has been made two months before the retirement of the incumbent.
However, in the case of Gen Bikram Singh, the appointment was done three months before the retirement of Gen V K Singh, who was engaged in a long—drawn battle with the government over his age issue.

Effective measures against money laundering essential: President
","President Pranab Mukherjee on Thursday said effective measures against money laundering and terror financing were essential in today’s global economic and security environment, as they fostered a more business friendly setting, facilitating legitimate investments and financial flows.
“India too has put in place a strong anti-money laundering legislation, the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, said Mr. Mukherjee at the “Enforcement Day” organised by the Enforcement Directorate on Thursday.
Commending the agency for its achievements, the President said: “I understand that the Directorate has been making rapid strides in investigating cases under the Act, attaching the laundered proceeds of crime, and launching prosecutions against the offenders. In some cases, the Directorate has succeeded in tracing and restraining the laundered proceeds in jurisdictions outside our territory limit. These attachments of laundered proceeds of crime have bolstered public confidence in them.”
Mr. Mukherjee also emphasised on the need for international cooperation in the fight against cross-border money laundering and terror financing. “Multilateral fora such as the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), the Eurasian Group on Combating Money Laundering and Financing of Terrorism, and the Asia Pacific Group on Money Laundering (APG) also need to be optimally utilised by the Enforcement Directorate for bilateral exchanges and follow up with counterpart enforcement agencies for better mutual cooperation,” he said.
Among the dignitaries present on the occasion were Vladimir Nechaev of the Russia Federation, president of the FATF; Mario Michel Affentranger of the Federal Office of Justice, Swiss Confederation; Rajiv Takru, Secretary Revenue, Ministry of Finance; and ED Director Rajan Katoch.
Last fiscal, the ED recorded the highest ever attachment of “proceeds of crime” valued at about Rs.1,759 crore. It made 127 attachments compared to 65 in 2012-13 and 127 in 2005-2012.
The ED, for the first time, also traded into still-untouched penal legislations such as Trade Marks Act, Customs Act and the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act.

Modi claim of friendship a complete lie: Ahmed Patel
","The controversy over Narendra Modi’s interview to Doordarshan intensified on Friday with Sonia Gandhi’s political aide Ahmed Patel refuting the BJP prime ministerial candidate’s claims of closeness between them, saying the remarks were “baseless” and “a complete lie.“
He said Modi’s “ridiculous” claims of their meeting or the two sharing friendship were a “political stunt” to create “confusion” in the midst of election and offered to quit public life if there was any proof that he had taken favours from the Gujarat Chief Minister.
“This is a political stunt to create confusion and create a cloud of doubt in the midst of elections. How can Modi be able to make friendship with me when he has never been able to strike friendship within his own party?”, he said.
Insisting that he never had any meeting with Modi either in his office or at his residence, Patel insisted that he had not taken any favour from the Gujarat Chief Minister. He said that Modi did come to his place for lunch when he was BJP general secretary in the eighties.
Besides that, “I never had any one—to—one meeting with Modi before or after the communal riots in Gujarat in 2002.”
Modi, in an
> interview to Doordarshan, had said: “Ahmedbhai has been one of my very good friends in Congress. He is not so now. Perhaps he is having some difficulty now and he avoids me as he does not take even my phone calls.
“I used to go to his residence to dine with him. It was a good friendship and I believe that personal friendship should remain,” he said.
“We never used to call him Ahmedbhai. For years, we used to call him Babubhai. This is not known outside. For us Ahmedbhai was Babubhai. But in public life he has to be given respect. It will not look good if I call him Babubhai. Calling him Mian Sahab is very honourable and I use this honourable word,” he said responding to questions, including as to why he used to call Patel ‘Mianbhai’
Responding to this, Patel said: “I do not know who are and who are not his friends in Congress, but if somebody is saying that I was very close to him or is very close friend....It is all to create doubts in the midst of elections. It is all baseless and ridiculous, a complete lie. If he proves that I ever visited his house or his office or taken any favour, I will quit public life”.

Snoopgate probe: Announcing judge not in violation of poll code, says Shinde
","The government on Friday said that a judge will be appointed to conduct probe into Gujarat ‘snoopgate’ before counting of votes in Lok Sabha polls and rubbished BJP leader Arun Jaitley’s claim that no judge will “lend” himself to the “political and malafide” exercise targeting Narendra Modi.
“The Cabinet had taken the decision to appoint a Commission of Inquiry to probe the incident of snooping on a woman in Gujarat. We will soon appoint the judge... before May 16,” Union Home Minister Sushilkumar Shinde told a press conference in Shimla.
Asked whether the appointment of a judge in the midst of Lok Sabha elections would not amount to violation of the Model Code of Conduct, Mr. Shinde said, “It will not” as the decision had been taken more than four months ago by the Union Cabinet.
“I am worried. The way the Chief Minister of Gujarat had snooped into the life of a woman, I am really worried what will happen to the women of the country if he becomes the Prime Minister,” he said.
In New Delhi, Law Minister Kapil Sibal rubbished >Mr. Jaitley’s claim that no judge will “lend” himself to the “political and malafide” exercise targeting the BJP’s prime ministerial candidate.
“You will get a snoopgate judge before May 16. I don’t know why these people are so worried? Why leaders of BJP are worried and why they are making public statement that no judge should join this commission?” he said.
Mr. Sibal said that Mr. Modi against whom accusations have been made in the controversy will be investigated.
The Congress leader said the BJP is worried as its leaders know the fact that “once the commission is set up there is no saving for Narendra Modi”.
Reacting the government’s move, BJP leader Ravi Shankar Prasad said it was nothing but a reflection of arrogance of the UPA government, which, he claimed, would be voted out of power.
Mr. Prasad said, “The two honourable Ministers... along with the entire Congress party would be defeated conclusively after 10 days and yet the arrogance of having the inquiry.
“I would expect that so many judges have refused in the past and the sanctity and dignity of the judiciary will not be compromised for ulterior motive of the Congress party.”
Mr. Sibal claimed that there was documentary evidence of what Mr. Modi had done and how he had snooped the activities of the young woman.
“...They are worried about the national commission set up by the Centre and I think, they should continue to be worried because the commission will be set up and he will be investigated and he will be brought to book,” he said.
The Centre had on December 26, 2013 decided to set up a Judicial Commission of Inquiry to probe charges of spying on a woman in 2009 allegedly at the behest of the Gujarat Chief Minister.
The government had announced that the commission, to be headed by a retired Supreme Court judge or a retired Chief Justice of a High Court, will also look into charges of snooping on Himachal Pradesh Chief Minister Virbhadra Singh by the previous BJP government when he was in the opposition as well as the leaking of the call data records (CDR) of Mr. Jaitley in Delhi.
The Union Cabinet took the decision under the Commissions of Inquiry Act under which the Modi government had already set up a similar panel.
However, even after four months, the government could not appoint anyone to conduct the probe as no retired judge came forward to take up the assignment.
There were reports that as no retired judge was willing to head the probe commission, the UPA government was mulling the option of changing the terms of reference for the commission by incorporating a provision that will allow the government to appoint a sitting judge of a High Court.

“I have come to know that at places where my public meetings are scheduled some books are thrown a night before in which dirty and false things are written about my family.
Those indulging in such activities are cowards,” she said at Shahgarh Shaheed Chowk in Gauriganj Assembly area.
“If they have to say something, they should come in front of me and talk. Indulging in such activities at midnight is not justified,” she said.
Blaming Opposition for the absence of proper power supply here, Priyanka said her “hands are tied” because of a court case in the matter.
Addressing an election meeting attended mostly by women in Amethi, she said the party has made many efforts to provide 24 hours power supply but despite that it could not do so.
“Power supply is the state government’s responsibility. After Mulayam Singh government assumed power in UP, Soniaji and Rahulji approached him for continuous power supply in Rae Bareli and Amethi. Mulayam Singh decided immediately to provide power to these areas.
In a veiled attack on BJP’s Smriti Irani, she charged, “A candidate has come here. Her party people filed a case and got round-the-clock power supply stopped.”
“It was asked in the case as to what was special about these two areas that power should be supplied for 24 hours. That is why the case is stuck here and our hands are tied. Until the case is resolved, 24-hour power supply cannot be resumed,” she said.
Targeting women voters, she said, “This is election time and one should say what can be done for women empowerment.” She also said the election fight should be done on “principles” and it should be done openly and not in a clandestine manner.
In a bid to strike an emotional chord with voters, she said, “I will not ask for your votes. I want your love. You have stood by our side in good times and bad times. We will be with you all the time.”
“This is Amethi. I am coming here since childhood and I will keep coming when I will become old also,” she said.

Govt to name ‘snoopgate’ judge before May 16: Sibal
","The UPA government will name a judge for investigating the Gujarat ‘snoopgate’ before May 16, Law Minister Kapil Sibal on Friday said and rubbished BJP leader Arun Jaitley’s claim that no judge will “lend” himself to the “political and malafide” exercise targeting Narendra Modi.
Mr. Sibal also said that Mr. Modi against whom accusations have been made in the controversy will be investigated.
“You will get a snoopgate judge before May 16. I don’t know why these people are so worried? Why leaders of BJP are worried and why they are making public statement that no judge should join this commission?” he said in New Delhi.
The Congress leader said BJP is worried as its leaders know the fact that “once the commission is set up there is no saving for Narendra Modi”.
“Because there is documentary evidence of what he (Mr. Modi) has done and how he has snooped the activities of a young girl,” he said.
”....They are worried about the national commission set up by the Centre and I think, they should continue to be worried because the commission will be set up and he will be investigated and he will be brought to book,” Mr. Sibal said.
The Minister also questioned the Gujarat government-appointed snoopgate probe panel, saying, “It will never move forward” as it was appointed “by the Chief Minister who is sought to be prosecuted”.
“It will never move forward, just like the Nanavati Commission. Twelve years have passed. We have not got any report. This is really the track record of the Gujarat government. So we don’t expect anything from the state government,” he said.
Mr. Sibal’s statement comes a day after Mr. Jaitley hoped that no judge will “lend” himself to the “political and malafide” exercise keeping in view the cause of judicial dignity.
He had said that all the judges approached by UPA have refused to be part of the “desperate” exercise as the new government will be in place in a fortnight.

Tamil Nadu rejects NIA probe, takes NSG help
","The Tamil Nadu government on Thursday rejected the Centre’s offer to order a National Investigation Agency (NIA) probe into the twin blasts in the Bangalore-Guwahati Express at the Chennai Central station, making the Centre “stand-down” a team of detectives preparing to leave for Chennai, the Home Affairs Ministry said.
Director-General of Police (in charge of Elections), Tamil Nadu, Anoop Jaiswal said there was no Centre-State confrontation on the issue, wondering how two agencies could investigate one case. The CB-CID was confident of achieving a breakthrough soon.
Ministry sources expressed the apprehension that the decision could make other State governments also resist Central intervention in terrorism-related cases, opening the way for a damaging Centre-State row.
Mr. Jaiswal said National Security Guard (NSG) experts would assist the Tamil Nadu Police. An NSG team from New Delhi would arrive in Chennai on Friday.

T.N. ‘no’ to NIA help may derail anti-terror efforts

Union Home Ministry sources said here on Thursday that acts such as Tamil Nadu’s refusal to allow a National Investigation Agency probe into the train blasts at the Chennai Central railway station could lead to a confrontation between the Centre and the States.
Union Finance Minister P. Chidambaram, meanwhile, said: “It is an uncoordinated action of State governments which is creating gaps in the fight against terrorism.” The setting up of the National Counter-Terrorism Centre, blocked by State governments, could have plugged key “loopholes in intelligence.”
Earlier, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said no efforts should be spared to bring the perpetrators of the train blasts to justice, and added that the Centre would provide the Tamil Nadu government all assistance. Union Home Minister Sushilkumar Shinde told presspersons that the Centre had offered Tamil Nadu full assistance.
Mr. Jaiswal, said: “It is not a clueless case ... we are following some leads. We will be able to crack the case on our own.” Investigators would develop computer-aided portraits of the accused based on the account of eyewitnesses and CCTV footage, he said.
In 2012, Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Jayalalithaa opposed the creation of the NIA, saying it was “clearly a case of the Centre usurping the powers of the States.” She wanted the agency, set up after the 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks, wound up, saying it would lead to “an autocracy consisting of a government of the Centre, by the Centre, for the Centre.”
Intelligence Bureau sources told The Hindu that no intelligence advice was there on a possible attack, but noted that Tamil Nadu had seen increased activity by Islamist groups in recent years. Earlier this week, the Chennai Police arrested an alleged Inter Service Intelligence operative, Mohammad Sakir Hussain, on charges of plotting to attack diplomatic missions in the region.
Top Indian Mujahideen commander Muhammad Ahmad Zarar Siddibapa is reported to have stayed in Chennai as a fugitive, and two men linked to the group were arrested from the city in 2011.

Congress, BJP condemn Pakistan Army chief’s remark on Kashmir
","The BJP and the Congress condemned Pakistan Army chief General Raheel Sharif’s comments that Kashmir was the “jugular vein” of Islamabad.
Terming General Sharif’s comments as “provocative and aggressive,” the BJP on Thursday said Jammu and Kashmir was an integral part of India. “A unanimous resolution of the Indian parliament has stated in no uncertain words that the entire J & K, inclusive of those parts which are under illegal occupation by Pakistan, belong to India,” BJP spokesperson Nirmala Sitharaman said.
The BJP cautioned the Pakistan government against the use of “hawkish” statements that have the tendency to derail peace in the region.
“It is for the elected civilian government of Pakistan to speak up to ensure there is peace in the region. The government should ensure that it focusses its attention on building a peaceful Pakistan and not allow its army to pose threat and issue alarm calls against peace in the region,” Ms. Sitharaman said.
The Congress, too, asserted that Kashmir remained an integral part of India. “J&K is an integral part of India and the people of the State have just voted in the elections also. We don’t need to respond to statements like these,” said Finance Minister P. Chidambaram.
Reminding Pakistan that the entire State was acceded to India by the Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir, Union Minister and Congress leader Manish Tewari said: “The fact is that Kashmir is an inalienable part of India.”

Addressing a road show here, he asked how the State and Central governments forgot Polavaram, Pulichintala and Handri-Neeva projects, which were beneficial to thousands of farmers.
Terming late Chief Minister Y.S. Rajashekara Reddy’s tenure as the “golden era”, the YSRC chief asked as to what the State had achieved when the TDP had stitched up an alliance with the BJP earlier.
Alleging that the BJP’s prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi and TDP chief N. Chandrababu Naidu were trying to wrest the maximum number of seats in Andhra Pradesh by forging an unethical alliance, he said the two parties had no interest in people’s welfare.
Launching an attack on Mr. Naidu, the YSR Congress president blamed the Telugu Desam for lifting ban on liquor and encouraging belt shops in the State. “The TDP president is announcing sops which could not be implemented,” he said.
He appealed to electors to vote for YSRC candidates. YSRC Vijayawada Parliamentary constituency candidate Koneru Rajendra Prasad participated.

Addressing public meetings at Itchapuram, Palasa and Patapatnam, he said anarchy would prevail if the YSRC was voted to power in residuary Andhra Pradesh and added that only his party could ensure secure future to people.
He also took a dig at TRS president K. Chandrasekhar Rao and said that the latter was warned against ‘loose talk’ about Seemandhra people.

In the same vein, he said that a protective mechanism would be put in place to curb crime against women. “The TDP will implement loan waiver at any cost and make agriculture lucrative. We will waive DWACRA loans and also work for women empowerment,” he added. He assured enhancement of pension up to Rs. 1,500 to differently-abled persons and senior citizens.
“Our priority will be people’s welfare. The new government will create more jobs and ensure decent life to youngsters,” said Mr. Naidu.
Party Srikakulam MP candidate Kinjarapu Rammohan, who took part in the meetings, exuded confidence that the TDP would will all the 10 Assembly seats and a Lok Sabha seat with comfortable majority. He said the people were fed up of poor administration and therefore were supporting the Telugu Desam.

People’s concerns sidelined, says Yechury
","Irony of current discourse is that it totally ignores the basic issues concerning people, says CPI (M) polit bureau member Sitaram Yechury.
The issues like health, education and employment are pushed to the backseat and serious discussion is being held in the national media on Modi calling Priyanka ‘daughter’ and Priyanka hitting back at him. This titillating discussion is carried as if it is of national relevance, Mr. Yechury said, speaking to The Hindu here after a gate electioneering meeting in favour of party candidate for Gajuwaka Assembly segment Ch. Narsing Rao.
The governments have abdicated their constitutional obligation to provide health, medicare and education facilities to people and are implicitly encouraging their privatisation. By not allowing these subjects to come in the discussion, they are tacitly empowering the corporate sector to take over them, he noted with alarm. In other words, the ruling class is allowing the private sector to focus on profit maximisation with little concern to its social responsibility, he added.
It’s ironical that the UPA delivered on its constitutional obligation like the Right to Education, that too under pressure from the Left, he pointed out.
There is a little difference between the BJP and the Congress on these subjects. It is in this context that there is a need for an alternative policy direction without which one cannot address people’s concerns. The third front has been created with the sole purpose to ensure that people’s rights are protected and that nation’s resources are used for their benefit.
For instance, the government stopped encouraging small savings. The interest earned on post office deposits has been cut, forcing people into the hands of private and unorganised players like chit funds. The small savings formed the main component of capital investment taken up by the government, he explained. Today, these funds are being taken by large corporates for their investment.

If Mr. Naidu takes up campaigning in his constituency, he would be breaking a long tradition. The last time he undertook poll campaign in Kuppam was in 1994. In the past two decades, during nomination filing in 1999, 2004, 2009 and 2014, Mr. Naidu stayed away from making personal appearance, prompting his spouse and son to file on his behalf. He also strictly stayed away from campaigning in the constituency, though he campaigned in other constituencies in the home district.

He worked as Sarpanch of Rameswaram village and said to have good contacts which he had developed during his Praja Rajyam days.

Sitting MLA Rapaka Varaprasad (Congress), who had switched loyalty to the BJP, resigned immediately after the TDP decided to give the ticket to Gollapalli Suryarao as per the understanding over the seat sharing. He is now in the fray as an independent. All the four candidates are confident of winning the elections.
Razole Assembly constituency in Konaseema region of East Godavari District is reserved for Scheduled Castes and the Congress has been winning this seat for the past four elections.

The Finance Commission award would be in force till March 31, 2015, and thereafter the financial award of the 14th Finance Commission would come into effect from April 1 and be in force for five years, till March 31, 2020.
The 14th Finance Commission was constituted in January this year and it would submit its report and recommendations by October 31 for approval. However, when the terms of reference were notified for the new Finance Commission headed by Dr.Y.V. Reddy, Andhra Pradesh was a united State.
The Union Cabinet which met on Thursday therefore approved the proposal for insertion of additional term of reference in the notified terms of reference of the 14th Finance Commission. The Cabinet resolved that the Commission would also take into account the resources available to the two States post appointed day and make separate awards for Telangana and Andhra Pradesh.

The Finance Commission would make recommendations for the devolution of tax revenue from the Centre to the States and grants, basically to the panchayats and municipalities. Under the 13th Finance Commission, the united Andhra Pradesh had been allocated about Rs.20,000 crore under the tax devolution and another Rs.5,000 crore through grants for the current fiscal.

Past experience in those areas make it amply clear that those TDP leaders would never allow the presence of polling agents of other parties in those polling stations.

An indication to that effect was given to AICC general secretary Digvijaya Singh subtly that the party may not be able to come to power on its own strength going by the polling trends.
TPCC president Ponnala Lakshmaiah, who called on Mr. Singh on Thursday, is believed to have given the feedback that the party might cross the 50-seat mark, short by 10 to touch the magic figure of 60 to form the first government in Telangana with simple majority.
Sources said the two leaders have analysed district-wise polling and came to the conclusion that it would be neck and neck race between the Congress and TRS in several constituencies. “After taking feedback from the district Congress leaders, the TPCC chief told Mr. Singh that Congress is confident of winning at least 54 Assembly and eight Lok Sabha seats,” a senior Congress leader told The Hindu.
The Congress chief told Mr. Singh that the TRS tally would not cross 40 with its candidates faring well only in North Telangana. He is also understood to have dismissed the claims of TRS chief K.Chandrasekhar Rao that TRS would sweep the polls.
The TPCC leadership has also analysed that the TDP-BJP combine is set to make some gains in the twin cities, Ranga Reddy and Mahabubnagar districts. Further, the TPCC president informed Mr. Singh that BJP might spring a surprise in Nizamabad, Warangal and Mahabubnagar districts, party sources said.
District-wise information gathered by the TPCC indicate that it may not be easy going for bigwigs such as former Deputy Chief Minister C. Damodar Raj Narasimha, the TPCC chief, working president N. Uttam Kumar Reddy, former Ministers – K. Jana Reddy, D. Sridhar Babu, J.Geetha Reddy, V. Sunitha Laxma Reddy, Baswaraj Saraiah and former PCC president D. Srinivas.
Officials engaged in the polling exercise in a few South Telangana districts also indicated that several big names may have tough time in retaining their seats. “Mood of the electorate on Wednesday was pointing towards such upheavals”, a polling official in Nalgonda district stated.
The Congress would be left with two options if the mandate is fractured. “The party may seek support of MIM and other friendly parties like CPI, if its gets past 50 seats, to form the government. In case its tally is on a par with TRS with 40 to 45 apiece, the post-poll alliance between the two is a certainty”, party sources pointed out.
A senior Congress leader maintained that the TRS would woo MIM and CPI if it manages to win over 50 seats to form the government, instead of banking on Congress.

Government control over Sosale Vyasaraja Math pays dividends
","The 13th century Sosale Sri Vyasaraja Math is now firmly under the control of the Karnataka government, and pilferage from the temples and other infrastructure of the math has been checked even as efforts are on to recover some of the immoveable assets which are said to be in the possession of some people.
The government-appointed administrator of the math, K. Jairaj, told The Hindu that while all the properties of the math in Karnataka had been identified, there were still vast properties in Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh and efforts were on to take control of them even as identification of the properties and their valuation was in progress.
The State government appointed an administrator for the math, for a two-year term, in May 2012 after a series of complaints over misappropriation and misuse of the math’s properties. Given the fact that the task is incomplete, there is the likelihood that the term of the administrator will be extended. The former Chief Justice of India M.N. Venkatachaliah is the chairman of the advisory committee which has been constituted to guide the administrator.
Mr. Jairaj said the math had received huge donations for several centuries, including gold jewellery dating back to the Vijayanagara rulers. Some of its prime properties had either been alienated or even rented out for a paltry income by the seers of the math over the last few decades. Some of the properties that have been recently recovered include a choultry comprising nearly 45 rooms at Tirumala. With the support of the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams “we have been successful in recovering the property”. There were still some prime properties in Chennai and other places, and efforts were on to recover them, he said.

Reorganisation

Giving details of the action initiated to take back the properties and restoring administration in the branches, he said, “Since the takeover of the administration there has been a comprehensive administrative and financial reorganisation of the math, and properties belonging to the institution are being safeguarded. The total income of the math is now Rs. 4.88 crore with a net savings of Rs. 1.25 crore. The math owned more than 3,000 acres of land near Bidadi in Bangalore Rural district and these valuable lands are now in the possession of unauthorised persons.
Improvements have been made at the math’s branch on Govindappa Road in the city, Mysore, Sosale, Srirangapatna and Tirumakoodalu in Mysore district. Works would be taken up on Tirumala in Andhra Pradesh, one of the major revenue earning centres, and Bannur in Mysore district, Kanakapura in Bangalore Rural district and Mulbagal in Kolar district.
Devotees have requested for providing facilities at Srirangam in Tamil Nadu. Borewells would be sunk at Vyasarajapura and Sosale in Mysore district. The wages/salaries of priests, managers and other sub-staff had been increased through two pay revisions. The allowance of Rs. 50,000 a month which was paid to the seer has, however, been suspended since he was reportedly in receipt of income from some of the properties.

Four members to be nominated to Karnataka Council after poll results
","Governor H.R. Bhardwaj on Thursday reportedly asked Chief Minister Siddaramaiah to commence the process of nominating four members to the Legislative Council immediately after the declaration of the Lok Sabha election results.
Mr. Siddaramaiah, who was busy in electioneering for nearly two months, made a courtesy call on the Governor on Thursday and discussed various issues, including filling vacancies in the Legislative Council, according to sources close to the Chief Minister.
Terms of four members nominated by the erstwhile Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government — S.R. Leela, Doddarange Gowda, M.R. Doreswamy and B. Shivappa — will end on June 20. Incidentally, Mr. Bhardwaj’s term comes to an end on June 21.
Mr. Siddaramaiah took up the issue of nominations ahead of sending formal proposals to the Governor to avoid any embarrassment in the event of the latter refusing them.
The government was in a fix recently when the Governor refused to nominate a district Congress president to the Council under the educationist quota stating the proposal did not have any supportive documents, sources said.
Several names, including Davangere District Congress president K. Abdul Jabbar, jeweller K.P. Nanjundi, film actors Jaimala and Bhavana, writers S.G. Siddaramaiah and K. Marulasiddappa, and Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee president G. Parameshwara, are doing the rounds for the vacancies, sources said.

Government failed to tackle drought, says Kumaraswamy
","The former Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy on Thursday charged the State government with “failure” to tackle drought and respond to drinking water crisis.
He was speaking to reporters after May Day celebrations at the party office here. Mr. Kumaraswamy said Chief Minister Siddaramaiah should have convened an all-party meeting to discuss the ways and means to tackle drought. It was not too late; he should convene a meeting immediately to get feedback from all political parties, Mr. Kumaraswamy demanded.
The former Chief Minister said many parts of the State had been facing severe water scarcity. Let alone for crops, water was not available even for drinking and people were forced to tread long distances to fetch water, he said. He alleged that the government was not responding to the woes of people.
Mr. Kumaraswamy took exception to Public Works Minister H.C. Mahadevappa getting his official residence renovated at a cost of Rs. 75 lakh. Public money should not be wasted for individual fancy, that too at a time when the State was facing severe drought, he said.
Party leaders Abdul Azeem, Narayana Rao and R.V. Harish were among those present.

“Explosives control bureau need of the hour""
","The Union government should allow the State governments to enact their own laws to deal with manufacture, possession, transport and use of explosives, and set up an explosives control bureau with an intelligence wing on a par with the Narcotics Control Bureau, noted forensic expert P. Chandrasekaran has said, reacting to the bomb blasts on a train in the Chennai Central.
The scientist,  Mr. Chandrasekaran, former director of the Forensic Department in the State, wanted the police to use explosive detectors instead of metal detectors.
 He said that even in the laws dealing with procurement of explosives, there were lacunae, as tracking the procurement of explosives rested with the Controller of Explosives in Nagpur. The Controller is governed by rules of the Explosive Substances Act, 1908. This law largely looked into factors pertaining to the prevention of crimes, unlawful and malicious act.
“The controller has very meagre staff and is suffering from lack of intelligence inputs. He comes into the picture only after an incident takes place,” explained Dr Chandrasekaran, who had made many investigative breakthroughs, including those in the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case.
 He said even the Explosives Act, 1884 had became obsolete. “In countries such as the U.S., mayors of cities were entitled to chalking out their own laws with regard to explosives. Records of each individual transporting explosive material are maintained and even his fingerprints are kept,” he said.
 If a person involved in ordinary quarrying had procured explosives more than his regular requirement, the information should be collected for reference.

U.P. seeks legal opinion on parole to QED founder
","The Uttar Pradesh government has sought legal opinion on parole granted to Mukhtar Ansari, the Quami Ekta Dal candidate from Ghosi in Uttar Pradesh, by a Delhi court. Mr. Ansari has been granted parole for ten days from May 1.
Ghosi, along with 17 other parliamentary constituencies in Purvanchal, goes to polls in the last phase of the Lok Sabha elections in Uttar Pradesh on May 12. Mr. Ansari is presently in Agra jail.
“The government is getting it legally examined as parole has been granted to Mr. Ansari by a special court in Delhi in a particular case [even though] a total of 12 cases are pending against him,” State Home Secretary, Kamal Saksena told journalists here on Friday, adding that the legal opinion was expected to be conveyed soon.
The alleged mafia don-turned-politician, an Independent MLA from Mau in Purvanchal (eastern Uttar Pradesh), had contested the 2009 Lok Sabha elections from Varanasi on a Bahujan Samaj Party ticket and lost to the Bharatiya Janata Party’s Murli Manohar Joshi by a relatively small margin of 17,211 votes. BSP president Mayawati subsequently expelled Mr. Ansari from the party. Before the 2012 Assembly polls, he formed the Quami Ekta Dal with his brother, Afzal Ansari, as its president.
In the run-up to the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, Mr. Ansari was expected to contest from both Varanasi and Ghosi before the QED decided to field him from Ghosi alone. Last week, QED chief Mr. Afzal Ansari announced in Varanasi that the “Quami Manch” (comprised of the QED and small parties like the Bharatiya Samaj Party) would support the Congress candidate from Varanasi (Ajay Rai). The decision surprised many keen watchers of the forthcoming electoral battle in Varanasi as it was largely speculated that the QED would, given its Muslim base, support the Aam Aadmi Party’s Arvind Kejriwal as against the BJP’s prime ministerial candidate, Narendra Modi.
Ajay Rai and Mukhtar Ansari are considered rivals in the badlands of Purvanchal. Informed sources in the Congress said the QED leadership was roped in to support Mr. Rai by two senior Congress leaders who had visited Varanasi last fortnight.

Strike called in Tripura against ‘rigged’ elections
","Tripura Pragatishil Gramin Congress, a new political party, has called a general strike on May 12 to protest against the ‘mass rigging’ in the elections conducted in two Lok Sabha constituencies in Tripura. The party announced the decision to enforce a dawn-to-dusk strike in Tripura on Friday afternoon and demanded repolling.
Gramin Congress, which was launched by former Congress MLA Subal Bhowmik after his defeat in the assembly elections in February last year, has been protesting against the alleged manipulation in West and tribal-reserved East Tripura constituencies that went to poll on April 7 and April 12 respectively. It blamed Chief Electoral Officer Ashutosh Jindal for ‘all wrongdoings’.
“We have called the strike in protest against massive bogus voting and manipulation in the elections. We have submitted complaints to the election commission along with evidences to the election commission, but no action taken so far”, Mr. Bhowmik told reporters.
CPI(M) has strongly opposed the strike call and termed the move as an attempt to run away from reality of an impending massive defeat in Lok Sabha polls. It also set aside allegations of manipulation in any manner in the elections which recorded an 85 per cent turnover.
Trinamool Congress that announced an agitation programme starting on May 5 has however said it would not support nor oppose the strike call. “Our leader Mamata Banerjee is really not in favour of a strike as it does not achieve much”, State chairman of the party Ratan Chakraborty told The Hindu.
Sources in Congress and BJP also ruled out possibility of giving open support to the strike. They would not oppose the strike as well.
The controversy over farcical elections surfaced after a local cable news channel aired footage over breach of election procedures at a polling station in Bishalgarh near Agartala. The election department is conducting a thorough probe into the charges.

Ms. Sharma alleged that the security personnel at Mr. Tiwari's residence were trying to prevent her from meeting the senior Congress leader.

But some people want a monopoly over his property so they don't want his family to be with him,” said Ms. Sharma, a retired lecturer. Ms. Sharma said that she was being denied entry into the residence after the security personnel had issued a press statement allegedly signed by Mr. Tiwari that said that he has “nothing to do with her.”

Majlis confident of increasing tally
","Will the Majlis spring an electoral surprise this time? The answer is in the affirmative if the party’s upbeat mood is anything to go by. It is confident of wresting the Jubilee Hills and Rajendernagar Assembly seats in the city apart from the Nizamabad seat. A day after the polls, Majlis president Asaduddin Owaisi exuded confidence that his party would increase its tally to 10.
“We will retain the existing seven seats and are hopeful of adding three more,” he remarked.
The Majlis is not worried about the low percentage of polling in the city. In absolute terms, it feels, the number of votes polled have gone up by 2.27 lakh in the Hyderabad parliamentary constituency as compared to 2009. This is expected to benefit the Majlis’ prospects. Heavy voter turnout is usually seen as an indication of anti-incumbency factor. Since the city experienced moderate polling it is construed that voters are not unhappy with the Majlis’ performance. The party feels diversion of minority votes to other parties could be much less this time unlike in 2009 when the grand alliance of TDP, CPI, CPI(M) and TRS chipped away about 30 per cent votes.
Sources say a photo finish will occur in Jubilee Hills and Rajendernagar Assembly constituencies where the Majlis has put up a spirited fight. “We will get good number of votes of the majority community here as there is a resentment against the local MLAs,” Mr. Asaduddin said. He doesn’t think the Majlis will have any problem in Yakutpura and Nampally segments either. The Majlis leader refuses to go into minute calculations. “We have done our best. Even during my student days I used to write the exam and forget the result,” he remarked. He predicts an upper hand for TRS in Telangana region. “But whoever forms the government has to deliver the goods and fast. Otherwise people will throw them out,” he warns.
Mr. Asaduddin, who is rushing to Anantapur to campaign for the party candidate, is sure of YSRC sweeping the polls in Seemandhra. He said AAP would play spoilsport by cutting into the votes of secular parties. Will Narendra Modi become Prime Minister? “I don’t think so. If he occupies the top job, it would not be good for what India stands for,” he added.

Leaders unwind, take time off from electioneering
","As the dust settles down after hectic electioneering, it is time for politicians to relax, catch up with reading and spend some time with family members.
And that’s exactly what senior BJP leader Bandaru Dattatreya is doing.
Mr. Dattatreya, who is contesting from Secunderabad Lok Sabha constituency, was on his toes right from early morning each day to meet electors. Padayatras and door-to-door campaigning were his preferred modes.
With people casting their votes and deciding the fate of contestants on Wednesday, Mr. Dattatreya held a review meeting with important party functionaries of all the seven Assembly segments on Thursday and assessed the situation.
Telugu Desam activists from Khairatabad Assembly constituency too attended the meeting and gave their feedback.
Exuding confidence that he would emerge victorious, he claimed that lot of “cross-voting” took place and supporters of Congress, TRS and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) too favoured the BJP.
With the busy period over, he is now spending time reading Ramayana and other books. He will also resume his daily routine of walking for an hour and doing yoga exercises. He is also planning to campaign in Seemandhra, where polling will be held on May 7.
For Telangana BJP president and candidate from Amberpet Assembly constituency, G. Kishan Reddy, curtains came down on electioneering no doubt. But more than that, he is feeling relieved as he was under “pressure” ever since he took over as BJP chief.
First, the by-elections to Nizamabad Assembly seat were held, followed by by-polls to Mahabubnagar and Parkal, even as the Telangana movement continued.
Then the alliance with Telugu Desam was firmed up and there was talk during the crucial passage of the AP Reorganisation Bill in Parliament that BJP might not support it. All these situations caused tension and pressure, he added. He too plans to visit Seemandhra in the next couple of days to undertake campaigning.
Another BJP leader, N. Ramchander Rao, who contested from Malkajgiri Assembly seat, said the run-up to the elections was quite hectic and he used to hold meetings till midnight with party workers on a daily basis. But he is relaxed now and on a thanksgiving visit to the residences of some of the important BJP and TDP activists.
Mr. Rao, who is a senior advocate, said he would start attending criminal courts from next week, even as he and the other contestants are eagerly awaiting the results.

Awareness drives come to nought
","Despite the hype around spreading awareness among IT professionals, youth and urban middle-class about exercising their franchise, the effect on the ground in Ranga Reddy district leaves a lot to be desired.
The district administration and the Labour Department had worked overtime trying to build awareness among the public, especially IT professionals, by organising meetings with IT companies and industry bodies through whom they hoped to reach their target audience.
They also convinced the companies to declare April 30 as a paid holiday, with many of them actually acquiescing to it.
However, it is now apparent that the professionals merely enjoyed the holiday and stayed home, instead of taking the pains to go to the polling station.
While it was expected that the district would clock a polling percentage of 70 per cent, as against the 54 per cent recorded in the 2009 elections, actual polling remained only at around 60 per cent. Even this rise owes itself to the considerable increase of polling in Uppal constituency.
As per information provided by the district administration, the constituencies of Serilingampally, Kukatpally and Quthbullapur, the hubs of IT professionals, hardly registered growth in voting percentage.
On the contrary, the numbers fell in comparison with the previous elections.
In Serilingampally, polling plummeted to 48 per cent from 53.3 per cent in 2009, while Kukatpally, at 50.36, clocked a negative growth of over three per cent. Quthbullapur recorded a drop of nearly two per cent.
L.B. Nagar, another urban constituency housing mostly government and public sector employees, registered a slight drop too.
Uppal, however grew respectably from 42.38 per cent to almost 50 per cent, while Malkajgiri, the most sought-after constituency by VIPs, registered nearly three percent decline in polling percentage. Against the 54.61 per cent in the last elections, this year registered a mere 51.74 per cent.
Voting in Medchal more or less remained the same.
Surprisingly, polling percentage dropped in semi-urban constituencies such as Maheshwaram, and Rajendranagar too, even while increasing in their rural counterparts.
Chevella witnessed the highest polling in the district at 78.72 per cent, followed by Ibrahimpatnam at 78.14 per cent.

Insulation from ideological assault
","India is in the midst of a high voltage election, which commentators and politicians alike have described as the battle for the idea of India. And yet, there is nothing remarkable about the face-off between the ideas of secularism and Hindu nationalism. Ideological polarisation is a staple of most democracies across the world. Still, we continue to witness fear and concern at the prospect of Narendra Modi becoming the next Prime Minister.
The fact that this fear persists, in spite of India’s proud record of holding regular elections, reveals something deeply disturbing about the Indian state; a state that is governed, first and foremost, by a Constitution. Built into that Constitution are checks and balances and they are backed by an independent judiciary, the president, the opposition, a free press, and civil society. Meanwhile, public institutions like the civil services and the armed forces have their own institutional norms and gatekeepers tasked with the responsibility of protecting these institutions from political pressure. If we think Mr. Modi will be able to ride roughshod over these institutions and bend them according to his whims, then something very significant has gone wrong already.
It is still in the public’s collective memory that India’s institutions were trampled over by the will of a few powerful individuals during the Emergency period of 1975 to 1977. Some fear that if it could have happened once, it could happen again. But it should not, not if a proper inquiry is conducted and policy recommendations are implemented.
In the case of the Emergency, the inquiry was conducted by the Shah Commission, which found that former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and a list of individuals, whose careers seemingly did not suffer after the Commission’s publication, subverted both the Maintenance of Internal Security Act and the Defence of India Act in order to damage political opponents. It also found that numerous officers from the Indian Administrative Service accepted orders from above even though they believed these orders were made on improper political motives. Still, the Shah Commission report was, by most accounts, stillborn, and very little was done after the Emergency to ensure that India’s institutions prevail, regardless of the leadership.
The pogroms against Sikhs in Delhi in 1984 and against Muslims in Gujarat in 2002 also remain in the public’s collective memory, reminding us that similar incidents could happen again. The police and civil bureaucracy could look the other way as citizens are butchered for days before the Army is called out to put a halt to the violence.
If institutions like the intelligence services (currently without legislative oversight), the police, civil bureaucracy, and the courts are protected from capture, citizens know that they can turn to them when a governing party transgresses their rights. In other words, when institutions rule, citizens enjoy protections, irrespective of the party or individuals in power. India rightfully takes pride in her longstanding record of peaceful transfer of power after every election. But this transfer should also be free of fear for all her citizens.
So why has so little been done in response to the Shah Commission and similar reports? The answer may lie in the fact that elections are often viewed as the means to institutional capture in India. It is understood that the party in government can bend institutional rules to fulfil its agenda. This is partly a design problem, with some of the public institutions not enjoying the kind of autonomy that would protect them from the ideological changes that often accompany electoral swings in democratic countries. But it is also an erosion problem whereby normal institutional behaviour has gradually been subverted to meet political objectives. Today, if the worry is indeed that India’s critical institutions do not have the strength to withstand an ideological assault on their norms, then Mr. Modi is just a symptom of a much larger problem: weak institutional design in need of fire-walling from political pressures. Moreover, the blame for undermining the autonomy of these institutions and the failure to bolster their design is shared by all major political parties.
Even as some worry that a coalition government led by Mr. Modi will threaten the idea of India, we must remember that India’s state institutions are the premier embodiment of this idea, and therefore, we must ask why that idea is so defenceless in the first place.

>Modi selfie spells trouble,” May 1). It is nothing but a part of a deliberate attempt to orchestrate support for the BJP in the remaining phases of the election. Supporters and party spokespersons of the BJP cannot brush this gesture aside by saying that it was not an organised press conference. Has Mr. Modi forgotten that the “Lotus” is his party’s symbol?

J. Anantha Padmanabhan,


Tiruchi

On the face of it, the physical effect of Mr. Modi’s transgression could be less dangerous than one of jumping a red signal. But he has jumped the law, wantonly, knowingly, even with a shade of contempt. Where was the need to do this, for a man who has already decided that he would be the Prime Minister soon. Perhaps this thought itself was the trigger for his act. He was actually thumbing his nose at the Election Commission and challenging it, as it were, to catch him if it can.
Is this the way he is going to run the country, having his way no matter what? He was certainly not behaving like a leader to whom now millions are looking up to — a sad prospect indeed. He should have been immediately barred from campaigning for the remaining phases.

M. Balakrishnan,


Bangalore

Filing a first information report against Mr. Modi is a futile exercise because he is now above the law of the land. Let us not forget that he justified the Gujarat pogrom by saying that “for every action there would be reaction.” The brazen manner in which he went about taking his selfie shows that he will be a very domineering force in governance.

N.M. Mohammed Ali,


Thiruvananthapuram

It takes several years to build one’s reputation and credibility, especially when one is in public life, which can be erased in a stroke with one wrong move. Mr. Modi appears to be facing such a situation now. Electoral laws make it clear what does or does not amount to a poll violation. Even the most committed admirer of Mr. Modi will now find it difficult to defend him in this case.

N.S. Venkataraman,


Chennai

The media and those who are incensed by Mr. Modi’s act are overreacting. Let me pose this question. If the Congress president waves her hand before, during voting or after she exercises her franchise, will she be disqualified? It is high time the archaic election rules are reviewed and updated in this modern electronic era.

Cross-border strikes
","As a nation that has been shown to foster and back terror, Pakistan will go to any lengths to counter us. India too must desist from fostering terror (“
>India’s new language of killing,” May 1). How can we take on Pakistan in the U.N. if we do the same?
Also, the statement in the article that “the authoritative South Asia Terrorism Portal database shows that violence in Jammu and Kashmir declined year-on-year from 2002 to 2013” shows that peace talks and diplomacy works.

Ibnu Mohamed,


Coimbatore

For more than 60 long years we have debated dispassionately with Pakistan on the need to shun violence and follow the path of peace. Has it helped? It has only resulted in wars being thrust on us, 26/11, and the beheading of our soldiers here and there. Let us try passion for a change. Let us “bash on regardless”, as famously put by Field Marshal Sam Manekshaw. Let us give unadulterated nationalism a chance.

Deshabhimani Rao,


Bangalore

Our new language of killing is neither audible nor visible by our enemies, or even by our existing intelligence agencies. We are not professional enough to have premier intelligence agencies such as the CIA, MI6, KGB or Mossad. Let us evaluate our intelligence success stories since 1947. There is no substantial intelligence report which has saved our nation. The American system traced Osama bin Laden in Pakistan. And, foreign intelligence agencies have undoubtedly succeeded in straying into the Indian intelligence system.

V.V. Nair,


Manipal

Mr. Modi has nothing new to offer in terms of economic policy. Poverty alleviation is not on his agenda at all. Against this background of pursuing the same pro-rich policy like the Congress, in the event of his forming the government he needs to do something to impress and divert the attention of the people. The best option is to threaten to launch strikes against Pakistan which, apart from diverting the attention of the nation, will also fulfil his communal agenda.

A. G. Rajmohan,


Anantapur

Mr. Modi needs to rethink what he has said — it is nothing but a classic example of empty rhetoric. And given the state of our defence forces, how does he think he can do this? It is better he confines himself to his promises on development, leaving serious matters like foreign policy for a later date to be discussed in Parliament with inputs from experts.

Falling in line
","This refers to the report, “
>Voters ensure Chiranjeevi falls in line,” (May 1). I appreciate the way Mr. Raja Karthik Ganta and Union Minister K. Chiranjeevi handled the situation. Mr. Chiranjeevi in particular needs to be really complimented for acknowledging the “error” in a very polite and humble manner and apologising. How many politicians would do that?

Kolluru Raju,


Kakinada

One needs to appreciate the courage of voters led by Mr. Ganta in stopping Mr. Chiranjeevi. The Minister should understand that when he comes to cast his vote, he is only a voter and that his superstar antics should be confined to reel life. Special treatment is reserved only for senior citizens and those who have disabilities. Throughout India, politicians have been portraying themselves as paragons of virtue. It is good that voters bring them down to earth with a thud when they cross the line.

T. Anand Raj,


Chennai

The reason that these “popular” people mock rules and regulations is that they are elevated to the level of god by laymen. Mr. Ganta in particular deserves our appreciation and has shown that citizens can change the fortunes of this country if they can stand up as one.

Sen, Modi and RSS
","This refers to two letters in this column under the heading “
>Amartya Sen’s views” (May 1). Responding to Nobel laureate Amartya Sen’s scepticism about Mr. Modi because of his right-wing links, the two readers have strongly defended the RSS as not being a communal organisation. To set the record straight, let me highlight the views expressed by RSS founder M.S. Golwalkar about non-Hindus: “The non-Hindu people of Hindustan must either adopt Hindu culture and languages, must learn and respect and hold in reverence the Hindu religion, must entertain no idea but of those of glorification of the Hindu race and culture... in a word they must cease to be foreigners; Or may stay in the country, wholly subordinated to the Hindu nation, claiming nothing, deserving no privileges, far less any preferential treatment — not even citizens’ rights” (cited from Guha, Ramachandra (2008), India After Gandhi: The History of the World’s Largest Democracy, Pan Macmillan, p.19).

Uddhav backtracks after Saamna’s attack on Mumbai’s Gujaratis
","Barely a week after polling ended in Maharashtra, the strain within the Shiv Sena-BJP alliance has resurfaced.
On Thursday, the Shiv Sena’s newspaper Saamna carried a searing editorial on the occasion of Maharashtra Day against the Gujarati community in Mumbai, which has traditionally supported the BJP and now backs its prime ministerial candidate, Narendra Modi.
Twenty-four hours later, Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray has back-tracked. He appealed to the Gujarati community on Friday to be united with the local Marathi community for the forthcoming assembly elections as well.
But Mr Thackeray’s attempt at damage control does little to take the sting out of the strongly-worded editorial.
The piece criticised Gujarati traders in the city for not participating in the Maharashtra Day celebrations on May 1, and accused them of exploiting the city for personal gain. “The trading community used to say they had no connection with politics. But they rallied together to support the prime ministerial candidate from their community. But how many of them came down from their tall buildings to participate in Maharashtra Day celebrations?” it asked. The editorial asked if members of the trading community had paid tribute to the 105 martyrs of the Samyukta Maharashta movement.
The editorial then went on to issue a veiled threat. “Maharashtra has nurtured and given opportunities to many. But those who have no affection or respect for it should remember that the Martyrs’ Memorial at Hutatma Chowk shows a labourer with a flaming torch.” It ends by stating, “Gujaratis and other traders who came together with pride for Modi should do the same for Chhatrapati Shivaji’s Maharashtra.”
The editorial caused a ripple in political circles, leading to Mr Thackeray press statement on Friday. “In this election, the Gujarati and Marathi community came together strongly and this upset many others. Their attempts to divide us should be ignored. This unity will never be divided and there will be miraculous results,” he said.
BJP sources feel that the Shiv Sena’s editorial is a reaction to possible moves from Uddhav’s cousin and rival Raj Thackeray’s Maharashtra Navnirman Sena to play the Marathi card ahead of the assembly polls.
The BJP also played down the rift. “The Gujarati and Marathi community in Mumbai have always stood united in the name of Hindutva. Shiv Sena candidates have also been elected from Gujarati-dominated constituencies. Some people are trying to cause a divide between the Gujarati and Marathi people. The Shiv Sena should not fall for this game,” said senior BJP leader Vinod Tawde.
Meanwhile, the city’s powerful Gujarati community is upset. “It’s not true that Gujaratis have exploited Mumbai. We have lived here for generations and given a lot back to the city. Political parties woo us before elections but say such things later,” said Shantilal Maru, former leader of a Mumbai-based Kutchi organisation.
The president of the Bruhad Mumbai Gujarati Samaj Hemraj Shah said, “The martyrs for the Samyukta Maharashtra movement include Gujaratis as well. Our organisation paid tribute at the martyrs’ memorial. Why has the Shiv Sena suddenly raked up this issue?”

From diamonds to grain: Gujaratis in Mumbai

Mumbai is home to approximately 30 lakh Gujaratis, of whom around 22 lakh are registered voters according to the Bruhad Mumbai Gujarati Samaj. Maharashtra has around 60 lakh members of the community. Outside of Gujarat, Maharashtra is home to perhaps the largest population of Gujaratis.
The two states have strong historical links and were once part of the Bombay Presidency. The Samyukta Maharashtra movement later led to the formation of the Maharashtra state, with Mumbai as its capital.
The Gujarati community has a strong presence in business and trading. “ Ninety per cent of the diamond merchants in the city are Gujaratis. But we also employ a large number of Maharashtrians,” says Kirit Bhansali, convenor of the Bharat Diamond Bourse.
The community also dominates the metal, paper, textile and grain trade. It also has a significant presence in the stock market.

Seemandhra will join big league: Sonia
","Admitting that the decision to bifurcate Andhra Pradesh has caused much pain and heartburn to the people of Seemandhra, Congress president Sonia Gandhi said on Friday that the new State would develop into a powerful economic house, setting an example for other states in the country.
“I empathise with the people of Seemandhra and admit that the formation of the new State has caused great pain to the people, but I have no doubt that the hard working and intelligent people here will develop the new State as a model one,’’ Ms. Sonia Gandhi said at an election meeting on Andhra Muslim College campus here.
The turnout for Ms Gandhi’s maiden public meeting in Seemandhra after the State bifurcation was not to the satisfaction of the leadership despite the best efforts by Congress leaders to mobilise crowds. Only two days ago, party vice-president Rahul Gandhi had addressed a rally in Hindupur in Anantapur district.
Admitting that Hyderabad has been a bone of contention, Ms. Gandhi assured that Hyderabad would remain a common capital for 10 years and all procedures relating to admissions into educational institutions and quotas would continue for 10 years.
“This is my commitment to the people here. All educational opportunities will continue for 10 years, ‘’ she said.
Ms. Gandhi, who spoke in English reached out to the people by assuring that special development package which has been made part of A.P Reorganisation Bill-2013 would ensure comprehensive development of the region as 90 per cent of funding would be in the form of grants. Polavaram irrigation project has been given the national project status and two separate river boards would be set up for Krishna and Godavari river basins.
Later, Sonia Gandhi promised to enact laws bringing health security, shelter and pensions in unorganised sector under fundamental rights. Ms. Gandhi said that the right to health security, shelter and pension have been included in the party’s poll manifesto.
“Every eligible person would be given free medicine and free health care under the right to healthcare and would be provided a roof over his head under the right to shelter,’’ Ms. Gandhi said.
Earlier, Ms. Gandhi took pot shots at the TDP and BJP and said that both the parties were two sides of the same coin. “Why did the TDP not walk away from the NDA government after the Godhra riots in 2002? “A vote for TDP is a vote for communal forces,’’ Ms. Gandhi said.
Listing out the achievements of the Congress-led UPA governments, Ms. Gandhi said that several landmark legislations including the right to education, right to information and right to food have been passed by successive governments of UPA-1 and UPA-2.
“We take our promises seriously and implement them,’’ Ms. Gandhi said winding up her campaign in Seemandhra which goes to polls on May 7.
AICC in-charge of AP affairs Digvijaya Singh, Union Ministers K. Chiranjeevi, Panabaka Lakshmi, J.D Seelam, PCC president N. Raghuveera Reddy and former minister Kanna Lakshminarayana were present.

It’s a tough going for Buddha Prasad in Avanigadda
","The Mandali clan has been synonymous with the Congress for many decades and especially the family has been sailing with the party both in the good and bad times in Avanigadda – a place known for agriculture and aquaculture.
However, Congress-initiated bifurcation of Andhra Pradesh has changed political equation here, forcing veteran Congressman and former Minister Mandali Budda Prasad to call it quits and join hands with the Telugu Desam Party. He even managed to get the ticket to contest from the Avanigadda Assembly constituency. But Mr. Buddha Prasad is fighting this electoral battle with his back to the wall for many voters are yet to digest his betrayal to the Congress and most of his followers have left him in lurch and joined the YSR Congress.
For both seasoned politicians and chroniclers of politics, his joining the yellow brigade was unpalatable for he was known for his uprightness and values. “As a die-hard integrationist, he should have joined the Jai Smaikyandhra Party, which was floated to fight for the unified Andhra Pradesh with former Chief Minister N. Kiran Kumar Reddy at the helm of affairs. He (Mr. Buddha Prasad) knows that by joining the Jai Samaikyandhra Party he can’t prosper as a politician. He is power conscious politician and can’t live it,” opined Avala Maruti, a former Congress leader.
Mr. Buddha Prasad joined the TDP when there was a wave in favour of the party during the municipal and panchayat elections. However, post TDP-BJP alliance, the YSRC has gained the edge. With his followers and vote bank drifting to YSRC, the 57-year-old Kapu leader now is on the back foot for he has also alienated the Muslim votes.
The TDP cadre is also not happy at the party high command’s decision to ignore sitting MLA Ambati Srihari Prasad, son of late Telugu Desam leader Ambati Brahmanaiah, who contested and won the by-election after his father’s death. The followers of Mr. Ambati are apparently seething with anger and in no mood to support Mr. Budda Prasad, who is considered an outsider. He is also having tough time in cooling the TDP dissident, Kantamaneni Ravishankar, who filed nomination as a rebel candidate before opting out of the race. He is also facing the heat from YSRCP candidate Simhadri Ramesh and also giving him nightmares is the Congress candidate Mathi Srinivasa Rao.

Fair political representation eludes women in Krishna
","Krishna district has put up a poor show in giving a fair representation to women in politics if the number of women elected to the State Assembly is an indication. The apparent discrimination against women is startling despite the fact that women voters outnumber their male counterpart in the district.
A good political representation of women in this district is a myth as the number of women elected to the Assembly was just eleven since the formation of Andhra Pradesh while a mere 50 and odd women have contested the elections in the last six decades. And, of the eleven women MLAs, three were elected in by-polls conducted in 1970, 1986 and 2001, while only two women were elected twice from the district.
A majority of the Assembly segments in the district did not elect any women representative since 1955 while segments like Gudivada, Gannavaram, Mudinepalli, Vijayawada (East), Nidumolu (SC), Jaggaiahpet, Vuyyur have a history of electing women candidates. There were 17 Assembly segments in the district till 2004 elections and the number has come down to 16 post-delimitation in 2009.
So far, more than 58 women candidates entered the contest since 1957 and a majority of them had tried their luck as independent candidates while parties like the TDP, Congress, CPI (M) and BSP fielded women candidates on a few occasions. And, in most of the cases, the voting did not exceed two per cent of the total valid votes with the exception of those who contested on tickets of the recognised political parties.
Three TDP MLAs, five Congress MLAs and one CPI (M) MLA have been elected so far, while two MLAs of the TDP and the Congress were elected twice. However, more than 180 male candidates (the number includes MLAs elected more than once) have been elected from the district since the 50s.
Interestingly, no woman was elected from Gudivada, the native place of TDP founder N.T. Rama Rao who gave equal property inheritance to women. NTR, who had a record of contesting from two segments simultaneously, chose to field a male candidate in the by-election in 1985 after he had tendered his resignation. Raavi Sobhanadri Chowdary was fielded in the by-election.
Yerneni Sita Devi of the TDP won from Mudinepalli segment in 1985 and 1994, while Vangaveeti Ratnakumari of the Congress emerged victorious from Vijayawada (East) in 1989 and 1994. D. Padmajyothi of the Congress won from Tiruvur in 2009 general elections.

Realty boom, a benefit of bifurcation: Digvijaya
","All India Congress Committee (AICC) general secretary and in-charge of Andhra Pradesh affairs Digvijaya Singh has said that the land prices has gone up in Seemandhra while it witnessed a nosedive in Hyderabad. He listed out this as one of the several benefits for the people of Seemandhra caused by the State bifurcation.
Interacting with the media at a ‘Meet-the-Press’ programme organised by the Andhra Pradesh Union of Working Journalists here on Friday, Mr. Singh said that many provisions had been incorporated in the Andhra Pradesh Re-Organisation Act, 2013 which would benefit the Seemandhra people.
He refuted the claim that 90 per cent of the land in the Seemandhra region was under the control of just 10 per cent of the people.
Taking a dig at the Telugu Desam Party leadership, Mr. Singh said that the party had lost its secular character by joining hands with the Bharatiya Janata Party and any question on the Congress having some kind of political understanding with it in the futurewas totally hypothetical.
Describing former Union Minister D. Purandeswari’s joining the saffron party as a “treacherous act”, Mr. Singh said that many leaders, who grew in stature because of the Congress’ largesse, had deserted it. “Not only did former CM N. Kiran Kumar Reddy fail in his duties, he also ditched the Congress,” he said. Asked how he was different from BJP prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi, when it came to concealing private affairs, he said that there was no need for him to talk about such personal matters.

BJP’s track record in Seemandhra poor
","The brand image of prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi may give the much needed push to the BJP in the general elections in Seemandhra, but the track record of the party is not on its side going by its dismal show in Parliamentary elections since the heady days of its parent organisation Bharatiya Jana Sangh (BJS).
BJS has fielded candidates in 1971, which was 20 years after it came into existence as the political arm of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), for only three Parliamentary constituencies – Kakinada (P.V.N. Raju), Guntur (Jupudi Yagnya Narayana Rao) and Nellore (SC) (B. Lakshman) and all of them stood second.
There was not even a single candidate of BJS in the fray in what is today called Seemandhra in elections held in 1952, 1962, 1967 and in 1977 when it ceased to exist.
M. Venkaiah Naidu was the only BJP candidate in entire Seemandhra, from Bapatla in 1989 and he lost to S. Benjamin of Indian National Congress (INC) by 43,620 votes.
The BJP had fielded candidates for 26 out of 27 constituencies in 1991 and it had to be content with the third slot in 25 constituencies.
Similar was the party’s performance in 1996 when most of the candidates fielded in 25 constituencies stood fourth.
Candidates of NTR-TDP (LP) fared better than those of BJP.
Out of 24 candidates in 27 constituencies, only two won – U.V. Krishnam Raju from Kakinada and G. Venkata Swamy Naidu from Rajahmundry in 1998. They defeated Thota Gopalakrishna (INC) and M.V.V.S. Murthy (TDP) respectively by impressive margins.
In 1999, BJP’s S.P.P.B.K. Satyanarayana Rao won from Rajahmundry, U.V. Krishnam Raju from Narasapuram and N. Venkata Swamy from Tirupati.
They defeated Chitturi Ravindra, Kanumuri Bapiraju and Chinta Mohan who were all Congress candidates.

‘PM prefers Vizag as capital’
","Prime Minister Manmohan Singh prefers Visakhapatnam as capital of the residual Andhra Pradesh, Vice-Chairman of the National Disaster Management Authority Marri Shashidhar Reddy revealed here on Friday.
He and Tribal Welfare Minister V. Kishore Chandra Deo were discussing the issue some time ago (it may be recalled that Mr. Deo strongly advocates Visakhapatnam as capital) along with the Prime Minister and when Dr. Manmohan Singh was asked what city would be the best suited as capital of AP, he felt Visakhapatnam must be made capital, Mr. Shashidhar Reddy said. He and BJP national spokesman Prakash Javadekar were addressing members of the Vizagapatam Chamber of Commerce and Industry after the organisation held a meeting with contestants to Lok Sabha from Visakhapatnam constituency.
Mr. Reddy wanted the chamber and locals to make proper representation on Visakhapatnam as capital to the five-member expert committee formed by the Union Government with former Union Minister K. Sivaramakrishnan to decide on the capital for the residual AP. He also wanted all the concerned to ensure peaceful atmosphere of the city prevailed.
“AP has a great future and its long coastline will be of great help,” he said. He also noted that land prices in AP region have gone up and in Telangana it was showing a downward trend.
Mr. Shashidhar Reddy, whose son was born here, recalled his several visits to the city as Minister for Environment and its status as the most polluted city. If proper care was taken, Visakhapatnam would become a world class city, he felt.
Mr. Javadekar also expressed his appreciation for the city. “It is a pleasant city and looks completely different from other cities,” he said.
As many as one crore people registering themselves as new voters on March 9 indicated the great awareness among people about the elections and it was also a great boost to the democracy and indicative of progress of the nation, Mr. Javadekar said.

Given the fact that in most states the elections were only being held for the Lok Sabha, the voters were thinking clearly about the national picture and were keen on making Narendra Modi as Prime Minister, he said. In states where elections were being held simultaneously for State assemblies and the Lok Sabha, there were chances of the voters being swayed by the local issues.
The voters were fed up with the Congress and their votes too would go into the BJP kitty, he explained.

Priyanka has pushed Rahul ‘out of the frame’, says Jaitley
","BJP leader Arun Jaitley on Friday said Priyanka Gandhi-Vadra had succeeded in “robbing the brother from being in the limelight” and pushed him “out of the frame”.
“Ostensibly intended to attack Narender Modi daily in somewhat impolite language, the sister has succeeded in robbing the brother from being in the limelight. Attack Modi was the strategy but ‘dilute Rahul’ is the consequence...
“Having pushed the brother out of the frame, the sister has to realise that there is much more in politics and the country than only ‘our family’,” Mr. Jaitley said in an article.
The BJP leader also charged the Congress with showing desperation, saying the likelihood of a BJP-NDA government at the Centre headed by Mr. Modi has resulted in courtesies and rationality slipping out of the Congress’ campaign.
Mr. Jaitley also urged his own partymen and supporters to concentrate only on three issues — development, leadership and stability.
“Visibly losing the vote of India the Congress created an impression that the heart and idea of India are still a Congress property. The argument did not cut much ice.
“The eclipse of Rahul Gandhi as the de facto prime ministerial candidate of Congress is virtually complete. When he was not seen as being able to deliver, the mother stepped in. The focus has now shifted to the sister,” he said.
Mr. Jaitley said there is a streak of “misguided aggression” in the Congress, as it was trying to leave the voters more and more confused.

Parties don’t reward MPs for performance
","Do political parties and voters care about the parliamentary performance of elected representatives? The data indicates that they don’t.

The Hindu’s analysis of parliamentary performance data and electoral data shows that there is a weak positive and statistically significant correlation between attendance rates of members of Parliament in the 15th Lok Sabha and their likelihood of being re-nominated by their party in the current election. For other attributes of parliamentary performance, like the number of debates participated in, the number of questions asked and the number of Private Member Bills introduced, there was a very weak, statistically insignificant positive correlation.
This indicates that political parties are not very likely to reward MPs who perform well in Parliament with re-nomination, which is more likely determined by other factors.
Moreover, voters appear to care even less about parliamentary performance. For the 14th Lok Sabha, The Hindu found a weak negative, statistically significant, correlation between attendance rates and the likelihood of re-election, as well as that between the number of debates participated in and the likelihood of re-election.
In other words, MPs with higher attendance rates and better debate participation were slightly less likely to be voted back. The correlation between number of questions asked and number of Private Member Bills introduced was, as with the 15th Lok Sabha, a very weak positive one and statistically insignificant.
For this analysis, The Hindu used parliamentary performance data for the 14th and 15th Lok Sabhas compiled by PRS Legislative Research, and excluded ministers, speakers and leaders of the Opposition, who do not mark their attendance. For data on candidates who contested the 2009 and 2014 elections, The Hindu used data from the Association for Democratic Reforms, which scrutinises election affidavits, data from the Election Commission of India, and news archives.
“Sadly, this is not surprising,” said M.R. Madhavan, co-founder and president of PRS Legislative Research. “Party nominations are based on winnability and electability. What parties think of as winnability is for them to answer,” he said. As for voters, part of the problem was that they did not have information about their MPs, Mr. Madhavan said. “But while they may care if the person is of their caste, they may not care about parliamentary performance. I wish they did,” he added.
Jagdish Chhokar, founder-member of ADR, is equally unsurprised. “For parliamentary performance to matter to parties and voters, first of all Parliament has to matter, but it has become irrelevant to political parties,” Mr. Chhokar said. A host of other factors determined party nominations, Mr. Chhokar said, looking in parliamentary statistics for clues would be missing the wood for the trees.
Nirmala Sitharaman, national spokesperson of the BJP disagrees. “Parliamentary performance is something the party pays close attention to not only at the time of candidate selection, but all through the MP’s term,” she said, adding that it helped build goodwill and respect in the eyes of party peers. Voters were increasingly paying attention to participation in televised debates and presence in the house, she added.

","Accusing the BJP of resorting to vilification, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, daughter of Congress president Sonia Gandhi, on Friday alleged that booklets containing “dirty material” about her family were being dumped in Amethi right before her public meetings. “Some booklets are thrown at places where my public meetings are scheduled . Dirty and false things are written about my family. If they have to say something, they should come out and talk openly. Why do it like cowards,” Ms. Vadra said in Amethi, where she is campaigning for her brother and Congress president Rahul Gandhi. Contending that the election was an ideological war, Ms. Vadra said it should be fought on principles. But the level of political campaigning had stooped down to a new low, she said.
At least two booklets are in circulation in Amethi containing highly defamatory allegations in insulting language made against Ms. Gandhi and Mr. Gandhi. One of these booklets contains articles written by BJP leader Subramniam Swamy. While one booklet is titled “Sonia ki barbarta va sajish” (Sonia's cruelty and conspiracy), the other targets Mr. Gandhi with the label “Rahul ki Ravanleela” (Rahul's Ravanleela).
BJP spokesperson Vijay Bahadur Pathak denied that his party had any role in distributing the booklets. “We don't believe in character assassination. We don't favour it,” he said. Akhilesh Pratap Singh, Congress MLA and spokesperson, however, said the booklets contained “articles written by BJP leaders and other dirty material.” Responding to this Mr. Pathak said: “If the Congress has any complaints they can take the right route through constitutional methods. Our targeting of the Congress has only been on political issues.”
The Congress did not lodge a complaint till Friday evening. During her address, Ms. Vadra also attacked the BJP prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi for his craving for power. “ (Modi) He wants to give you strength. He also wants to give you power. There is a leader in the country, who wants power for himself. He keeps on demanding to strengthen him,” Ms. Vadra said.

Tainted leaders in Fifth Phase in UP
","Last December, weeks after he was restored into the Samajwadi Party and declared its candidate in Sultanpur, Atiq Ahmed, the politician from Allahabad, stormed into the constituency with a cavalcade consisting of hundreds of vehicles. He was allegedly accompanied by gun-toting supporters, a claim he later dismissed. While the residents of Sultanpur were left shocked, the incident did not come as a surprise for many. Mr. Ahmed, 51, the alleged-mafia don-turned politician, faces 42 criminal cases, including charges like criminal intimidation, murder, attempt to murder, kidnapping and extortion and has been out on bail since February 2012 after spending four years in prison.
He has the distinction of being the first person to be booked under the State's notorious Gangster Act and stands trial in the murder of BSP MLA Raju Pal in 2005. Talking to The Hindu on his way to campaigning in Shrawasti, where he is now fielded, Mr. Ahmed hopes to convert that “negative publicity” into a winning formula backed by favourable Muslim-Yadav caste equation in the constituency. By his own admission he has been successful. “The media's publicity of me as a mafia don has helped increase my popularity. Badnaam hi sahi, popular toh ban rahe hai,” says Mr. Ahmed.
Ridden with poor infrastructure, Shrawasti is a backward constituency bordering with Nepal. Mr. Ahmed, who won the Phulpur Lok Sabha seat in 2004, has promised voters that he would convert the constituency in a tourist hub. In a recent public meeting in Balrampur, SP chief Mulayam Singh promised to provide a “special package” to the constituency. “Development is a key issue but my priority is to make Mulayam Singh the PM,” says Mr. Ahmed. “So every seat is precious.”
Mr. Ahmed faces sitting Congress MP Vinay Kumar Pandey, who has five declared criminal cases against him. Along with Mr. Ahmed, the fifth phase of the elections in UP on May 7 will decide the fate of many tainted leaders, most of them belonging to the Samajwadi Party. In Faizabad, SP MLA from Bikapur, Mitrasen Yadav, who has 15 criminal cases and a long history of criminal background and convictions against him will challenge sitting Congress MP and UPCC president Nirmal Khatri.
The BJP has fielded Lallu Singh, an accused in the Babri Masjid demolition while the BSP's candidate Jitendra Kumar Singh has 16 cases against him. In Kaiserganj, the BJP candidate and sitting MP Brij Bushan Sharan recently joined the party after quitting the SP also has a long criminal history and is also an accused in the Babri Masjid demolition. So is Pawan Pandey, the BSP candidate in Sultanpur, who has 32 criminal cases against him including murder and rioting. He will look to turn the Dalit-Brahmin equation in his favour to challenge BJP general secretary Varun Gandhi. In Sant Kabir Nagar, the SP has fielded Bal Chandra Yadav, who has 10 criminal cases against him, including attempt to murder. The party's sitting MPs and candidates in Fatehpur and Kaushambi, Rakesh Sachan and Shailendra Kumar also have criminal cases (8 and 4) against them.
In Phulpur, the sitting BSP MP Kapil Muni Karwariya has 4 criminal cases against him while the BJP candidate and MLA Keshav Prasad Maurya has 11, including murder and creating enmity between groups. The SP's candidate and former MP Dharamraj Patel also faces two criminal cases while the Congress candidate in Allahabad Nand Gupta Gopal Nandi faces seven.

Stay active at booth level: Amit Shah to BJP activists
","BJP leader and Narendra Modi’s key aide Amit Shah on Friday asked the BJP activists to be active at booth level for an easy victory of party’s nominee Smriti Irani from Amethi Lok Sabha constituency.
“Be much active even at booth level for an easy victory in favour of BJP in Amethi,” Mr Shah asked the BJP activists at party’s office in Gauriganj here.

Congress may back alternative front to keep Modi out: Karat
","A repeat of the 1996-like situation is possible and the Congress may be forced to support a government of secular parties at the Centre to keep the BJP out of power, the CPI(M) general secretary Prakash Karat told the PTI in an ineterview.
He also did not rule out parties like the AIADMK joining an alternative front to keep the Narendra Modi-led BJP and the NDA out of power like it happened in 1996 when a government under Deve Gowda was formed with Congress supporting from outside.
“Well, depending on the results, there may be a situation where the Congress will have to play a role in terms of ensuring that there is a secular alternative government put in place.
“If the Congress does not want a BJP-led government, then it will have to play a role of contributiung to the formation of a secular alternative government...,” Mr. Karat said.
He acknowledged that the anti-Congress mood is helping BJP in States where the two parties are in direct fight but dismissed reports of a Modi wave across the country.
Mr. Karat said that there are powerful regional parties which are strong and fighting the BJP and they may not be joining the saffron party in forming the government.
The front of non-Congress, non-BJP parties would be able to cobble up a majority with outside support from Congress, he said.
“There are some secular parties which have opportunistically tied up with the BJP and we know who they are. But the bulk of the regional parties today who are in the non-Congress, non-BJP category have not aligned with either the Congress or the BJP in these elections.”
Asked if the Left parties, who had withdrawn support to the UPA-I government on the issue of nuclear deal with the U.S., would have problems dealing with Congress, Mr. Karat said that question will concern all the secular non-Congress parties.
“We will be able to come to a common understanding. I think, as against the BJP, most of these parties would not be averse to seeking the cooperation of the Congress,” he said.
To a question as to who will lead such a front, the CPI(M) leader said, “That is a post-election matter to be decided. As it happened in 1996, the combination or the alliance which is going to be forged will be a post-poll alliance.
“So, the question of the leader, etc., who will lead the alliance, will be discussed at that time. It will be premature to discuss it now.”
He also ruled out the possibility of the Congress staking the right to leadership of a government after it loses the election.
“Well, midway through the polling process and the election campaign, it is evident that the Congress is faring badly and it will face a big defeat.
“In an election, if the ruling party gets defeated, I don’t see how they can contemplate even forming a government or leading a government. That is not done,” Mr. Karat said.
He said the question now was who is benefitting from the anti-Congress trend among the people.
“The propaganda being made that there is a Modi wave is misleading because this anti-Congress mood is going to benefit other secular non-Congress parties, including the regional parties which are a substantial force in the country. So to claim that there is a Modi wave is just an obfuscating tactic by the BJP.”
Asked if the secular parties were refusing to see the writing on the wall on the BJP’s prime ministerial candidate, Mr. Karat said the BJP will be benefited in States where it is the main contender to the Congress in a situation of anti-Congress mood.
But, he said, in a majority of States there was no bi-polar situation of the Congress versus the BJP. “So, State after State, if you see, it is the non-Congress secular parties and they range from some regional parties to various other parties, who are going to gain in such a situation.”
To a query about how many of them could be called secular parties and how confident he was that they won’t align with the BJP after the elections, Mr. Karat said a bulk of these parties have not aligned with the Congress or the BJP in these elections and they have substantial base and support among the people. “We had about six-seven major regional parties which, along with the Left parties, had discussed this matter before the elections and said that we will fight the elections against the Congress and the BJP, and after the elections, we will cooperate and come together.”
He said the main aim of the non-Congress secular formation would be to see that the BJP and its allies do not come to power.
“That is the >mid-course shift in focus. It is evident that the Congress is going to lose these elections. So the main contender would be the BJP and its allies and non-Congress secular parties.”
Mr. Karat expressed confidence that the Left block, which had a record 64 seats in 2004 and was reduced to 24 in the outgoing Lok Sabha, would do well in the current elections.
“We are confident of improving the strength of the CPI(M) and the Left in these elections. We have only one hurdle which we have to overcome, which is the tactics of the Trinamool Congress (TMC) in West Bengal that is rigging elections.”

AAP gathers strength in Varanasi
","In the shadow of a statue of revolutionary Chandrashekhar Azad, at a busy intersection at Lahurabir, a mahila panchayat is in full swing. It is around 5 pm on Thursday, and the street play mimics the manner in which politicians of various hues make their pitch, from the musclemen to those use allurements such as alcohol. But the chief target is the BJP’s prime ministerial candidate, Narendra Modi, who is contesting from >Varanasi.
Women’s groups from across the State have gathered in Varanasi to conscientise women on the significance of their vote and to urge them to use the ballot to defeat Mr. Modi. While there is some soul searching on whether to name the candidate who people should vote for, Padma Singh, one of the organizers says, “If we don’t name one person, the votes will get divided – so we are pitching for AAP.”
As election day draws near, across Varanasi, all those who want to defeat or at least, ensure that the margin of Mr. Modi’s victory is reduced, are gradually veering towards >the Aam Aadmi Party’s Arvind Kejriwal again, after a brief hiatus in which it had seemed as though the Congress’s Ajay Rai, a Bhoomihar strongman who has the backing of his one lakh strong community might pose a greater challenge, especially after the Quami Ekta Party (QED) withdrew its candidate, Mukthar Ansari, declaring it would back the Congress.
The Janata Dal-United has declared support for AAP here, and Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar as well as senior party leader Sharad Yadav are expected here shortly to campaign for Mr. Kejriwal.
But it’s evident that while the three-lakh strong Muslim community is working to ensure that its votes don’t get divided, there is little enthusiasm amongst its members for the Congress candidate nor has the QED’s endorsement worked.
It’s late evening in Madanpura, a Muslim -dominated locality, home to many of the city’s famous trade in Banarasi saris. “The people have seen the Congress, it has done little except increase prices; worse, its candidate is a muscleman. And we wont’ vote for Modi,” says HM Sagheer, who has a dry fruits business, “maybe we should try AAP…but we haven’t yet made up our minds.” Akram Burari who is in the Banarasi sari trade, says, “Kejriwal could pose a challenge and no, the QED’s endorsement is worthless.” Indeed, most >Muslims appeared to be veering towards Mr. Kejriwal, even though they all maintained that they would wait till closer to Election Day to take a final decision.
At the office of the Momin Conference that has lent its support – and precincts in Sigra - to the AAP, Sanjeev Singh, a young lawyer and AAP activist – the original party candidate - is full of enthusiasm for the Kejriwal campaign that now has 55,000 volunteers registered manually, and another 17, 000 online. “We are fighting two people who have broken the law, one on a large scale, and the other on a smaller,” Mr. Singh says, stressing that apart from its national pitch of bringing in a new kind of politics marked by integrity and concern for the common man, the party has taken up local issues – from the concerns of the weavers’ community, to opposition in one of the rural segments against a Coca Cola factory that has depleted the ground water.
The energy visible at the AAP office is missing at the Congress headquarters: though packed with workers, there is an air of lethargy. A spat breaks out between two workers here, with one accusing the other of lounging around instead of getting out into the heat and dust to campaign: the response: “I can’t leave –I’m on protocol duty, waiting to receive senior leaders from Delhi.”
In sharp contrast, even though most people here believe that Mr. Modi is a shoo-in, the BJP is taking no chances, shipping in people from across the country to its expensively appointed hi-tech office here. Former IAS officer KJ Alphons, for instance, has come from Kerala, as has Dr. Jaychandran, an Ayurvedic doctor now based in Ahmedabad – the latter describes himself as part of Mr. Modi’s core team. Their task? To mobilize the South Indian vote in the city.
If the BJP is working towards ensuring Mr. Modi wins by three lakh votes, the AAP and its growing band of well-wishers are working to close that gap. Varanasi has become more than just another VIP electoral contest – it has become the site of a battle to preserve the city’s boast of being a symbol of India’s syncretic culture.

‘Modi vs. all’ shows up insecurities of rival camp: Amit Shah
","
On Wednesday, as the seventh phase of polling was under way, Amit Shah, closest confidant of the Bharatiya Janata Party’s prime ministerial candidate, Narendra Modi, and party general secretary, seemed relaxed and hopeful. He had just cast his vote and was watching television with his wife, Sonal, and son, Jayant, at home in a quiet neighbourhood of Ahmedabad. Mr. Shah opened up to Poornima Joshi on the sudden bitterness in the election campaign, the prospects of finding future allies for the BJP in such an atmosphere and his relationship with party president Rajnath Singh. Excerpts
:

The Hindu: The BJP started off with the development plank, but now the campaign seems to have degenerated into personal attacks and bitterness. What has changed? It seems to have suddenly become “Modi versus all” …


Amit Shah: Development is still the main plank of our election campaign. On the whole, I don’t think even two per cent of the volume of the campaign contains
> personal attacks or slights. But the media picks up only on that two per cent in its eagerness to create the illusion that the campaign has somehow been debased. I watch every political leader’s speeches very carefully; I don’t think they are interested only in attacking each other. That is not true. So far as “Modi versus all” is concerned, that has been the case right from the beginning. They [rival leaders] are becoming more voluble as the campaign focusses on their respective States; their insecurities are now coming to the surface.

But tell us, why is Mr. Modi focussing his attacks more on the >Gandhis than on the regional players, who, whether it is Mamata Banerjee or Lalu Prasad, are far more militant in their attacks on him and the BJP.

This is because the UPA [United Progressive Alliance] is the ruling coalition at the Centre. But it is not as if he is not attacking the SP [Samajwadi Party] and the BSP [Bahujan Samaj Party] in Uttar Pradesh and Mamata in West Bengal. The frontal attack would naturally be more focussed on the Centre. These things happen in elections. What is so new about them?

 The BJP is a democratic party. We are not a family-run business. We try and evolve a consensus on everything. 

But the regional leaders seem far more vocal in their attacks on Mr. Modi than he is on them. So is it a deliberate attempt to soften up the regional players for post-election tie-ups?

That is not true. He is highlighting the lack of development in every State and targeting everyone responsible. Our target is 272+ for the NDA [National Democratic Alliance]. We are working towards that. There is no other strategy.

What about Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Jayalalithaa? She has suddenly become >very vocal. We would have thought she and Modi had a good relationship …

You will find the answer to this question in the election results, even in Tamil Nadu where the BJP’s vote share is rising. I don’t want to say anything else.

We would like you to elaborate on it. Do you mean she is raising her pitch because she feels threatened by Mr. Modi?

I told you I would not say anything more than what I had already said. Let the results come out.

You don’t think this pre-election posturing will continue after the elections?

Every party presents its side in the campaign. But everyone respects the mandate. Let the mandate come. That has been my experience. Once a party gets the mandate, every other party respects that.

You have been handling >Uttar Pradesh affairs for the BJP, and one could see what has happened in the western region of the State. The BJP seems to be benefiting from the communal polarisation in the region. But in the eastern parts, the party’s campaign doesn’t seem to have picked up. So unless there is Hindu-Muslim discord, your party does not do well … is that so?

In the eastern parts, I am sure you went there when the campaign had not even begun. But I would ask you to make a trip now; the atmospherics are completely different. It is a one-sided election, there is a wave. This Hindu-Muslim issue that you are raising, I would say your perspective is warped. It is not about Hindus and Mussalmans. It is about administrative collapse and absolute mishandling of the situation. The people are angry with the State government for allowing the situation to go out of control …

But the >BJP’s involvement …

Again, I would ask you to examine the situation not on communal lines but from the people’s perspective. The people are voting in a certain way because there is anger against the government, among both Muslims and Hindus. The riots happened because the government did not respond to the situation. The police action was driven by vote-bank politics. They did not handle the situation properly.

 The BJP is a democratic party. We are not a family-run business. We try and evolve a consensus on everything. 

Okay, let us forget western Uttar Pradesh for a while. Let me ask you about whether people are responding to the BJP because of Mr. Modi’s personality or his development agenda? Tell me specifically about Uttar Pradesh, whether caste and communal polarisation are the only factors in the election?

We will get the maximum number of seats from U.P. this time. I can promise you that. It is a one-sided election in the BJP’s favour.

What are the problem States for the BJP?

In the southern and the eastern parts, we traditionally suffer from organisational weaknesses. This problem does exist.

In the southern parts, what are you expecting from the alliances that have been forged, especially in >Tamil Nadu?

I am hopeful. I think we will do well. I think our vote share will increase exponentially. There is a possibility of getting a good number of seats.

How many seats are you expecting?

Let me not start counting seats because I haven’t really travelled in southern India. My information is not based on primary sources. I am only telling you what I have learnt from the people who are working on the ground. I can’t cite a figure based on telephonic conversations.

Mr. Rajnath Singh says Mr. Modi had nothing to do with your >assignment as election in-charge of Uttar Pradesh. We find it difficult to believe, especially given your proximity to Mr. Modi …

He is absolutely right. Narendra Modi and Amit Shah are loyal soldiers of the Bharatiya Janata Party. We do what the party has assigned us to do. I am a general secretary of the BJP and the party president asked me to manage elections in U.P. It was his decision. Who goes where, who takes charge of different States is an organisational matter. It is purely the prerogative of the party president. Narendra Modi has nothing to do with it.

Tell us something about this newfound proximity between Mr. Rajnath Singh and Mr. Modi.

Look, Modi
ji is our PM candidate and Rajnath
ji our party president. There is harmony and good coordination between them. It is a good thing for the party. I believe this coordination is the reason for our campaign to have picked up so well.

On the national scene, do you think people still look at you with distrust? Do you think it is necessary to win over the liberal intelligentsia who are suspicious of you?

I have never done anything in my life to win over anyone. I do my job with the honesty and integrity that I have and leave judgment to others. I think this impression that you talk about, it has been created without knowing me. I believe once people get to know me, my work, they will begin to see things in a different light.

A section of the media believes you will be the second-most powerful man if Mr. Modi becomes Prime Minister. You must be happy about it?

This impression is not correct. Mein zamini star ka karyakarta hoon [I am a ground-level worker]. I am a general secretary of the BJP like so many others. There are so many leaders in our party. What I mean is, forget number two, I am nowhere in the pecking order. Frankly, I am embarrassed about it.

But how do you feel about your position in the party hierarchy? What is the basis for this impression?

They say these things because I am in charge of U.P. It is a critical State. That is why some hype has been created.

You are from outside Uttar Pradesh. Did that pose a problem?

I never had any problem. I hail from the organisation. So I know how common functionaries work. I am an RSS [Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh] Swayamsevak [volunteer], I have been with the ABVP [Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad] and I draw inspiration from these roots. They have shaped my functioning and my entire life. It is not just me and Narendra Modi who come from the RSS. Rajnath
ji also comes from the RSS. We all belong to the same family.

Is there a division in the party’s ideological agenda and the development plank of the party? The Ram Mandir is mentioned very late in your manifesto?

The >manifesto reflects our agenda. There is no difference between the ideological line and development agenda. And what is the problem in mentioning Ram temple in the last pages? If we had mentioned it in the front page, the media would have made an issue about that as well. You might be suffering from a perception problem. We have no such confusion.

 The BJP is a democratic party. We are not a family-run business. We try and evolve a consensus on everything. 

But you can’t deny differences in the party over the articulation of your agenda. That is why the manifesto was delayed so much that you released it on a day when polling was going on in some States?

The BJP is a democratic party. We are not a family-run business. We try and evolve a consensus on everything. This time too, we evolved a consensus, everyone voiced their opinion. That should not be construed as a difference of opinion. Yes, the manifesto was delayed. I wish it wasn’t, but when we did release it, everyone had endorsed it. Everyone was on the dais when it was released.

You claim everyone is satisfied and everything resolved. Why is BJP leader Sushma Swaraj not campaigning then? Have you succeeded in placating her?

What do you mean by that? What is the problem? Sushma
ji is contesting an election. She will campaign after her own election has concluded. Even before that, she has been campaigning in various States. Just because you people choose to portray some trumped-up reality, it doesn’t mean there is no truth. Sushma
ji is campaigning and she will campaign. There is no problem.

What about veteran party leader L.K. Advani? What role would he have if Mr. Modi becomes Prime Minister? It is difficult to imagine him working under Mr. Modi …

I am a small fry. How can I comment on Advani
ji’s role? Advani
ji’s role will be decided by Advani
ji himself. The parliamentary board will decide. How can I comment on that?

What about you? If the NDA comes to power, >will you join the government or work in the party or organisation?

About my own prospects, all I can say is that the party has taken every decision that was ever taken in my professional life. But if you ask me, or more important, if the party asks me, my priority will be to work for the party.

So you are against joining the government if it is formed?

I am not against anything. All I am saying is that my personal priority is to work for the party.

In Uttarakhand, Modi comes first, not the Ganga
","Ashrams line the banks of the Ganga in Uttarkashi, Rishikesh and Hardwar. While sadhus believe they have a close connect with ‘Ganga maa’ (mother), so do many Bharatiya Janata Party stalwarts. However, the electorate seems more attracted to the ‘Modi factor’ than the cause of the Ganga.
Gaumukh, which is the source of the Ganga, is located in Uttarkashi district. Vikas Kalura, a resident of Uttarkashi’s Joshiyara area, said, “The BJP takes up the >issue of the Ganga so that the media picks it up and a wave is generated in favour of the BJP.”
“I will be voting for the BJP this time but not because they would do something for the Ganga. They haven’t done much for the river except raising their voices for it,” Mr. Kalura said, adding the anti-incumbency against the Congress was working in favour of the BJP.
BJP leader Uma Bharti, who is the election in-charge for Uttarakhand, in all her recent media addresses in State capital Dehradun, has spoken about “conservation of the Ganga.”
Mukul Sharma, in his paper, ‘Passages from Nature to Nationalism: Sunderlal Bahuguna and Tehri Dam Opposition in Garhwal’, published in the Economic and Political Weekly, states: ‘…. often making partnership with Hindutva politics. Ganga becomes holier and holiest. The ecological reasoning is blurred and goes beyond logic, eliciting Hindu patriotism and xenophobia.’
“Big dams or small dams, this debate will happen later. We want the flow of the Ganga to remain uninterrupted and the holy water to remain clean,” Ms. Bharti said at Ganga Samvad, a seminar on methods and reasons to conserve the flow of the Ganga which was held in Dehradun in January this year.
‘Sparsh Ganga Abhiyan’ — a campaign for cleaning up the Ganga — was launched in 2010 when BJP leader Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank, who is the BJP’s Lok Sabha candidate from the Hardwar seat, was chief minister.
According to Mr. Nishank, 40,000 youngsters were connected to the Sparsh Ganga Board, but with the end of the BJP government in the State, the ‘Sparsh Ganga Abhiyan’ also took a back seat.
However, BJP leaders often proclaim that they are not anti-development, and by “conservation of the Ganga” they do not mean they are anti-dams.
Addressing a rally in Tehri constituency’s Vikas Nagar area on Tuesday, the BJP’s prime ministerial candidate, Narendra Modi, said, “The Ganga maiya [mother] gives life to the countrymen …. why should we not ponder upon the ways in which Ganga maiya can transform the lives of the people of this region.”
At a rally in Dehradun in December last year, Mr. Modi had pointed out the water potential of the State while stating that the country should not be without electricity with the State’s immense hydropower resources. Many people in the Chadeti village, in Uttarkashi district’s Bhatwari Block, have still not received their compensation after the June disaster last year. Rajesh Rawat, a resident of the village, said: ""We don’t support the BJP because it takes up the issue of the Ganga. We support it because we believe it will work for the development of our area.”

How can RSS-born Modi be pro-women? asks Rahul
","Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi on Thursday observed that Bharatiya Janata Party’s prime ministerial nominee Narendra Modi claimed to be pro-women but represented an organisation known to nurture a patriarchal ideology. “The Lok Sabha elections of 2014 is a fight between two ideologies and one should be conscious of the RSS’s [Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh] thinking [and its] leader [Golwalkar’s belief] that India [made] a huge mistake by giving voting rights to women. And don’t forget that Modi, who now claims to be pro-women, also represents the same ideology.”
Addressing rallies in Himachal Pradesh’s Solan and Bilaspur, Mr. Gandhi slammed Mr. Modi for his alleged links with the industrial house of the Adanis and said “only one person’s wealth grew over the past decade”. He alleged that Mr. Modi allotted free land worth Rs.10,000 crore and free power worth at least Rs.20,000 crore to the Adani group. The business house, as a result, increased its net-worth from from Rs.3,000 crore to Rs.40,000 crore in Modi’s tenure, claimed Mr. Gandhi. “How could Modi claim to have developed the entire State of Gujarat and how much employment has he given to the youth?” he asked amid applause from Congress workers among the sparse crowd. The Congress leader also condemned former Himachal Chief Minister Prem Kumar Dhumal’s alleged allotment of Rs.250-crore-worth land for free to his son for developing a cricket stadium.

EC may decide on Army Chief’s appointment next week
","The Election Commission would take a call any time next week on the reference made by the government on whether or not it could go ahead with the process for appointment of a new Army Chief.
According to sources in the Commission though in the last week of March it had communicated to the Defence Secretary that the Model Code of Conduct (MCC) does not apply to defence related matters including appointments, the full Commission would look into reference made by the UPA government on selection of a new Army Chief.
“The full Commission meets on a regular basis to consider various issues related to conduct of election. Some times it could even be twice a day depending on the issues and developments. Since the government has made a specific reference it is only natural that as and when the next Commission holds a meeting the Army Chief appointment would be on the agenda,” sources in the EC told The Hindu.
Among other subjects that could come up at the meeting include the petition by the BJP seeking review of the EC order on registration of an FIR against its prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi for alleged violation of The Representation of People Act, 1951 and Model Code of Conduct.
On Friday the Defence Minister A.K. Antony had said that the government had sought counsel of the Commission on the issue as it wanted to `strictly follow all the procedures’ before taking any final decision on the issue. The government move to seek EC’s advice followed questions by the BJP on the competence of the government to make any major appointments in the middle of a general election.
Tenure of the present Army Chief Gen. Bikram Singh would end on July 31. Traditionally, the appointment of chief of services has been made two months before the retirement of the incumbent.
However, in the case of present Army Chief Gen Bikram Singh the appointment was done three months before the retirement of Gen V K Singh, who was engaged in a long-drawn battle with the government over his age issue.
For several weeks now the principal opposition party has been questioning the propriety of the government to make new appointments including that of the new Army Chief on the plea that it would be against the letter and spirit of the Election Commission’s Model Code of Conduct (MCC) in operation since the announcement of the general election scheduled on March 5.
On April 19 the BJP Legal Affairs Cell wrote a letter to the Election Commission asking the poll body to direct the government to refrain from making `major appointments’ including those related to armed forces.
The letter had said, “We learn that something similar is cooking in respect of the Army Chief where the present incumbent is due to superannuate in July 2014. We also hear that there is some hurried activity in hastening the selection process of the Lok Pal”.
Well before the BJP letter the EC had informed the government on March 27 that the Code is not applicable to any matter pertaining directly to the defence forces, be it the recruitments/promotions for defence forces and defence purchases of all kinds.
“These instructions shall be treated as standing instructions of the Commission and will be applicable for all elections in future. This may be brought to the notice of all concerned for future guidance”.

Modi saddened to see DD ‘struggling to maintain professional freedom’
","With Prasar Bharati Corporation chief executive officer Jawahar Sircar kicking up a storm over the autonomy of the public broadcaster, Bharatiya Janata Party’s prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi on Saturday kept the controversy alive by tweeting that he was saddened “to see our national TV channel struggling to maintain its professional freedom”.
Using Twitter to greet “journalist friends” on World Press Freedom Day, Mr. Modi said: “Free press is a democracy’s cornerstone & must be preserved in letter & spirit. On days such as this, I feel very sad to see our National TV channel struggling to maintain its professional freedom. We have witnessed the horrors of Emergency when freedom of press & freedom of expression were suppressed. It is a blot on our democracy.”
His tweets on free press stoked the long-standing debate over the autonomy of the public broadcaster which has not died down even after the enactment of the Prasar Bharati Act with a view to unshackling Doordarshan and All India Radio from government control. The issue was prised open yet again this week after it became apparent that Doordarshan News had edited out portions of its interview with Mr. Modi though the broadcaster insists it was done to fit a 54-minute interview into a half-hour time slot.
The controversy further snowballed after Mr. Sircar blamed Minister of State for Information & Broadcasting Manish Tewari of blocking “more operational autonomy” to Prasar Bharati. The two have had differences in the past even as Mr. Sircar is being accused by his detractors of speaking out this time in the hope of currying favour with a BJP dispensation which is widely expected to form the next government.
Reacting to this, a former Shiv Sena member of the Rajya Sabha Pritish Nandy tweeted: “For those who don’t know, CEO Prasar Bharati is a statutory post, five years fixed. So Mr. Sircar need not curry favours with any sarkar.” Mr. Nandy was also member of the Consultative Committee for the I&B Ministry when he was Rajya Sabha member.
Though Prasar Bharati autonomy has been advocated by all political parties when out of power, a flashback into the 16-and-a-half years of the Act’s implementation is testimony to the way successive governments including the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance have sought to use it to their advantage.
The current government had set up an expert committee in 2013 under Sam Pitroda, Advisor to the Prime Minister on Public Information Infrastructure and Innovations, to review the institutional framework of Prasar Bharati including its relationship with the government and funding. The committee submitted its report in January this year in which it recommended amendments to the Act to “impart genuine and effective autonomy” to Prasar Bharati.

Gogoi seeks NIA probe into Assam violence
","Assam Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi on Saturday asked for a probe by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) into the violence by Bodo militant group NDFB(S) in the state and vowed to apprehend those responsible for the killings.
“We have decided to recommend a probe by the NIA. Nobody responsible for the killings of so many innocent people will be spared,” Mr Gogoi told reporters here after NDFB(S) militants went on the rampage since Friday killing 32 people and torching scores of houses.
“We have reports that the NDFB(S) group is responsible for these attacks. We have directed the security forces to take the strongest possible action against them,” he said.
Mr Gogoi asked BJP not to politicise the situation and said his track record in maintaining law and order was better than BJP-ruled Gujarat.
“I had called the army in the past to assist the local administration to restore peace. Tell me how many times they called the army to control the riots in Gujarat in 2002,” he said.
At least 32 people were killed in the violence unleashed by NDFB—Songbijit militants in Bodoland Territorial Administration Districts (BTADC) area in Assam since Thursday night.

Omar blames Modi for ‘inciting violence’ in Assam
","Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah on Saturday blamed Narendra Modi for inciting violence in Assam that left 32 Muslims dead.
“In Assam, 30 Muslims were murdered. Why? Because BJP prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi made a speech there and tried to incite people against Muslims. This is a fact. This truth cannot be denied,” Omar told an election rally at Tangmarg in Baramulla Lok Sabha constituency.
Omar said that Modi, in his election rally in Assam three days earlier, had branded all Muslims living in that State as “Bangladeshis”, which resulted in the attacks on them, he claimed.
“Three days earlier, he (Modi) went there and branded all Muslims as Bangladeshis and today 30 Muslims have been put to sleep in the grave,” he alleged.
Referring to Modi’s statement holding National Conference leaders responsible for exodus of Kashmiri Pandits, Omar said the BJP leader had set out to insult all Kashmiris in the country.
Omar also accused the BJP of wanting to divide Jammu and Kashmir into three parts.
Baramulla Lok Sabha constituency along with Ladakh Lok Sabha constituency in Jammu and Kashmir will go to the polls on May 7.

Sibal trashes Jaitley’s objection to snoopgate probe
","Trashing BJP leader Arun Jaitley’s contention that the UPA government’s action on >snoopgate probe was illegitimate, Law Minister Kapil Sibal on Saturday said he “should go back to law” before making such statements and insisted that a judge to head the inqury will be named before May 16.
Defending the Centre’s move, the Minister asked why this was being questioned when the Narendra Modi Government had itself set up a probe panel to go into the issue, showing that there was something to be investigated.
He also pointed out that the Gujarat Government’s probe panel, which was supposed to give its report within three months, has not held a single meeting till date.
“A judge (to head the inquiry) will be in place before May 16......Jaitley has got cut off from law for a long time. He should go back to law and see this little more carefully before making any such statements,” Sibal told reporters at the AICC headquarters.
“If he takes a little time to understand, he will realise this is legally not possible,” Sibal said when asked if Jaitley’s remarks showed that in the event of the BJP winning, the next government will wind up the probe panel.
Both Sibal and Jaitley have been senior advocates of the Supreme Court.
Jaitley had said that all the judges approached by the UPA Government had refused to be a part of the “desperate” exercise and “political and malafide” move which would be an “illegitimate” action on the part of government.
“And if the government still goes ahead, it will be within the jurisdiction of the next government to consider them as improper,” he had said.
Dismissing BJP’s criticism, Sibal said, “When the State sets up a probe panel, it is fine. But when the Centre sets it up, then it becomes vindictive. What is this logic?”
He stressed that “communication” is a Central subject and snooping had been done in more than one State beyond Gujarat.
The Law Minister wondered how a probe panel set up by the Sate Government headed by Modi could investigate charges against him.
He also made light of the terms of reference of the State probe panel saying they were at variance with BJP’s statements which do not rule out the fact that snooping was done.
“Their real face has got exposed in the Snoopgate issue also. They set up a probe panel in the State fearing that the Centre may appoint an inquiry which could bring out facts that could create trouble for him (Modi),” Sibal said.
It was alleged that illegal surveillance was carried out on a young woman in Gujarat in 2009 at the behest of Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi and Amit Shah was the Home Minister of the State at that time.

Snoopgate probe: Amit Shah questions UPA’s moral authority
","Slamming UPA government’s move on snoopgate probe, Narendra Modi’s close aide Amit Shah on Saturday said it had no “moral or constitutional authority” to take decision on it at the fag-end of its tenure.
He blamed Congress’ “dirty tricks department” for the government’s move to appoint a judge to probe allegation of snooping of a young woman in Gujarat before the Lok Sabha poll process comes to an end on May 16.
The illegal surveillance was allegedly done at the behest of Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi and Shah was the Home Minister of the state during that period. There have been allegations that Shah himself was in regular touch with the officials involved in the alleged snooping.
“It is the Congress dirty tricks department which is behind the move to appoint the judge at the fag-end of the government’s tenure,” he said at a press conference here.
Mr Shah alleged that the Manmohan Singh dispensation has “lost constitutional and moral authority” to appoint a judge to conduct the probe “as the government is going”.
“The moral authority of the UPA government has ended. It has no constitutional authority either. Still, if they are doing this, they do not know why their government is going.”
Yesterday, the government had said a judicial commission to probe ‘snoopgate’ allegedly involving Mr Modi will be in place before the Lok Sabha poll process comes to an end on May 16.
The government had decided four months back to set up the inquiry commission but the process got delayed reportedly because of its inability to find a judge, who was ready to take the task.
The government had announced that the Commission, to be headed by a retired Supreme Court judge or a retired Chief Justice of a high court, will also look into charges of snooping on Himachal Pradesh Chief Minister Virbhadra Singh by the previous BJP government when he was in the opposition as well as the leaking of the call data records (CDR) of Jaitley in Delhi.

Rahul questions source of funds for Modi’s campaign
","Attacking the BJP and its Prime Ministerial candidate Narendra Modi over election expenditure, Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi on Saturday alleged that corporates were pumping money into the saffron party’s campaign and asked it come clean on the source of funds.
“They (BJP) do politics of two—three corporates as they gift them mota paisa (hefty money). From where is the money for big cutouts and posters coming?” Gandhi, who arrived in his constituency for a two—day campaign, asked at an election rally.
He alleged that Modi gave nearly Rs. 26,000 crore of electricity and Rs. 15,000 crore of land to one industrialist which is much more than the Rs. 30,000 crore that Congress gave to the poor through MNREGA in a year.
“Please ask BJP where do they get crores of rupees for such posters. Is it Modi’s money?.... They ask us why we give free money to poor through MNREGA, food guarantee scheme. Poor does not get free money. They work for it whereas free funds are given to Adani,” he said.
“I am not against corporates. But they should be given facilities following rules and regulations. In Gujarat, it is Adani who is getting facilities and not the poor”, Gandhi added.
Describing the elections as a fight between two ideologies, Gandhi said that while Congress wanted to take Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs and Christians along, the other side was stoking politics of “anger“.
“Their (BJP) leaders used to criticise, abuse and keep poor at bay while we (Congress) talk of unity and to take country forward,” Gandhi said.
“The difference is that they want to keep the ATM with themselves, while we want to give the ATM to the poor”, he added.
“They want to create a divide between Hindus and Muslims and want to see them fighting. They want brother to fight against brother, unlike us”, he said.
Hitting out at his opponents, Aam Aadmi Party’s Kumar Vishwas and BJP’s Smriti Irani, Gandhi said they would run away from Amethi after the elections.
Without taking the names of rival candidates, he said the people who come from outside are angry at the relations that the Gandhi family shares with the people of Amethi.
“Let Congress form the Government at the Centre, I will show them what can be done in Amethi....People who come from outside can say whatever they like but Gandhi family shares a relation of love with people of Amethi. They will not be seen once elections are over,” he said.
“Those who are contesting (against me) will run away after election. I have family relations with Amethi. I came here at the age of 12 years with my father (Rajiv Gandhi). I don’t have political relation with this place,” Gandhi said striking an emotional chord.
“Some persons come here, tear posters, throw stones, abuse and return. They did not come here for the next five years.

","The BJP on Saturday approached the Election Commission to seek action against Rahul Gandhi, claiming he had made a “highly provocative” statement that 22,000 people will be killed in the country if Narendra Modi becomes the Prime Minister.
“We brought to the EC notice the statement of Rahul Gandhi yesterday in Solan (Himachal Pradesh) that if Modi becomes Prime Minister there would be massacre of 22,000 people. This is a highly provocative statement by the Congress vice president,” BJP leader Ananth Kumar said.
Mr Kumar, who was talking to reporters after leading a party delegation to Chief Election Commissioner V S Sampath, said the alleged remark was “uncalled for and breach of model code of conduct”.
The BJP “urged the CEC to take serious note of it and take action to restrain Rahul Gandhi from giving such statements,” he said.
Asked about the EC response, Mr Kumar said “CEC assured us that appropriate action will be taken after looking into it.”
The BJP delegation, which also included Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi and Chandan Mitra, also alleged that rigging, booth capturing had taken place along with violence in West Bengal during polls on April 30 and demanded increased arrangements during the remaining two phases of polling.
“We brought to his (CEC’s) notice that in most of the booths in West Bengal there were no CCTVs nor central forces,” Mr Kumar said, adding the delegation had submitted a memorandum giving details of rigging and booth capturing on April 30.
The party demanded repolling in those booths where voting was very high.
“We urged the CEC that he should ensure increased arrangements with CCTVs in all the sensitive booths in the ensuing two phases on May 7 and 12,” he said.

Overthrow ‘government of plunderers’, says Modi
","Taking a swipe at the Gandhi family, >Narendra Modi on Saturday said the mother and son have never gone through the pangs of penury and asked the people of Uttarakhand to overthrow the “government of plunderers who have looted the people and stashed their money abroad.""
He charged that the government of the “mother and son” (Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi) has destroyed the country and the “saddest part” is that they are “not affected or worried by this. They think people will forget everything.”
Mr. Modi also attacked Home Minister Sushilkumar Shinde and said, the “Home Minister” of the “mother and son” says that people forget everything (corruption and inflation) like the “way they forgot the Bofors (scam)”.
“If you want back the country’s looted money stashed abroad, you will have to first remove the government of plunderers in New Delhi,” he told an impressive election meeting held here in support of party candidate from Pauri Lok Sabha constituency and former Chief Minister Bhuvan Chandra Khanduri.
He said the mother-son government at the Centre cannot feel the pain of the poor because they were born with a golden spoon in their mouth and never went through the pangs of penury.
Again describing himself as a “humble chaiwala” who has seen it all moving from one railway compartment to another to offer people tea, >Mr. Modi said this time the poll battle is between the mother-son duo on the one side and a chaiwala on the other.
“
Namdars on the one hand and a kamdar on the other,” he said, targeting Sonia and Rahul Gandhi.
The Gujarat Chief Minister said the country had given 60 years to administrators but now it was time it gave 60 months to a servant and a chowkidar (watchman).
“You gave 60 years to administrators. Give just 60 months to a servant and a chowkidar. I can assure you I am a chowkidar who would never let anyone lay a hand on the country’s coffers,” he said.
Seeking to strike an emotional chord with the people of the State, Mr. Modi said he shared a special bonding with the people of Uttarakhand as he was in charge of the party’s affairs in the State many years ago.
However, he regretted not being allowed to do anything for the people of the State when calamity struck in June last year.
“I got restless when I heard of the tragedy and wanted desperately to do something for the victims. I came running but due to perverted politics I was not allowed to do anything. I shall always regret it,” he said.
Terming the Uttarakhand government as the “worst example of failure in the face of crisis”, he said the “mother-son” government of New Delhi will also have to share the responsibility for this “failure”.
He said the Congress at the Centre had promised to give jobs to 10 crore youths in ten year’s time but gave jobs to just one crore of them, whereas the Vajpayee government gave jobs to 6.5 crore youths in a tenure lasting just six years.
Asking people to turn up in large numbers at the polling booths to cast their vote, Mr. Modi said if they wanted a stable government in New Delhi under his leadership they will have to ensure the victory of all the five BJP nominees from Uttarakhand.
“It is the Himalayas. Weather changes quickly here. But you have to venture out to cast your ballot regardless of whether it is raining or getting cold,” he said.

","The Election Commission (EC) on Saturday said it will consider the issue of the appointment of the next Army chief at a meeting of its top brass next week.

The matter has so far not been placed on the agenda of the ‘full commission’ (the Chief Election Commissioner and the two Election Commissioners),” a senior EC official told PTI.
“The meeting could take place on Monday or Tuesday where the matter would be considered,” the official said.
The poll panel will consider the matter in the light of its March 27 order that appointments, promotions, tenders and procurements of defence forces are not covered under the Model Code of Conduct in the ongoing elections as well as any other election in the future as well as complaints from BJP that the government was rushing with the appointment of the next Chief of Army Staff.
Amid strong opposition by the BJP to the appointment of the next Army chief, the government had referred the matter to the Election Commission saying any decision will be taken only after getting its nod.
“The matter is before the Election Commission. We want to strictly follow all the procedures before taking any final decision on the issue,” Defence Minister >A.K. Antony had said on Friday when asked about the status of appointing the next Army chief.
The matter was sent to the EC by the Defence Ministry earlier this week though the poll panel has already said that appointments, promotions, tenders and procurements are not covered under the Model Code of Conduct in the ongoing elections as well as any other election in the future.
On why the Ministry has sent the matter to the Election Commission despite its March 27 order, highly-placed Defence Ministry sources said such matters are important and it was felt that nod of all authorities concerned should be taken before proceeding.
The BJP has been opposing the appointment of the next Army chief by the UPA Government, arguing that there was no hurry to do so and the matter should be left to the next government.
Army Vice-chief Lt. Gen. Dalbir Singh Suhag is the front-runner for appointment to the top post which will fall vacant on July 31 after the retirement of present Army chief Gen Bikram Singh.
The EC official also said the panel has not received any reference from the government on the snoopgate commission of inquiry.

The provision says: “Notwithstanding anything contained in this section, if the Central government is of the opinion that a scheduled offence has been committed which is required to be investigated under this Act, it may, suo motu, direct the agency to investigate the said offence.”
Home Ministry sources said the government was considering the Chennai blasts as an act of terror as defined in Section 15 of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967, a scheduled offence under the NIA Act. The provision defines a terrorist act as “Whoever does any act with intent to threaten or likely to threaten the unity, integrity, security or sovereignty of India or with intent to strike terror or likely to strike terror in the people or any section of the people in India or in any foreign country, commits a terrorist act.”
NIA officials pointed out that a State government may request the Centre to hand over the investigation of a case to the agency, provided the case had been registered as per the schedule to the NIA Act. The agency could also seek the assistance of the State Police during investigation of cases, and in that situation, it was incumbent on the State police to assist it.

Mr. Modi’s claim was that they used to speak frequently but all that had stopped and Mr. Patel no longer took his calls.
The bits on Mr. Patel were edited out, as were Mr. Modi’s comments on Ms. Gandhi’s daughter, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, of the interview aired on Doordarshan News on Sunday.
Mr. Modi’s office released the full 54-minute interview on Thursday night in a bid to put the lid on the controversy.
In the wake of the controversy, Prasar Bharati Chief Executive Officer Jawahar Sircar has reportedly written to the Board, detailing the circumstances surrounding the interview. He is said to have suggested that such a situation would not have arisen had professionals been brought in at all levels.
Even as the entire interview became available on YouTube, Doordarshan maintained that the portions on Mr. Patel and Ms. Vadra were cut, but not in a bid to be on the right side of the current dispensation.
“The interview was to go in a 30-minute slot and we had about double that duration of recording. Some portions had to be edited and we took out those that did not seem relevant while retaining a lot that was critical of the current government,’’ said Doordarshan News officials.
Meanwhile, Doordarshan anchor Ashok Shrivastav, replying to queries whether his interview was censored on instructions from the top, said he would “answer all questions and queries at the appropriate time.”

Will appoint judge to probe ‘snoopgate’ by May 16: Shinde
","Union Home Minister Sushilkumar Shinde sparked a controversy on Friday when he announced that the government would appoint a judge before May 16, the day counting of votes in the Lok Sabha polls is taken up, to head the judicial commission set up to investigate the “snoopgate.”
In December, the UPA government had announced that a panel would be set up to investigate the charges of snooping on a woman by government agencies in Gujarat, allegedly at the behest of their political masters. But the name of the judge to head the panel has not been announced to date.
Now, soon after Mr. Shinde’s announcement at a press conference in Shimla, the BJP asserted that the government had no right to appoint a judge in the middle of elections and said the new government would be well within its rights to “review such a mala fide decision.”
The Home Minister maintained that the decision to appoint a commission of inquiry was taken well before the announcement of the general elections on March 5.
“We will soon appoint the judge....before May 16,” he said adding that “the way the Gujarat Chief Minister has snooped on a woman, I am really worried what will happen to women of the country if he becomes the PM.”
BJP leader Arun Jaitley said the UPA was getting “desperate” as it had no plank to fight the election.
He pointed out that a commission of inquiry, headed by a woman High Court judge, was already in place in Gujarat and the Centre did not have the right to form another commission at this juncture when the Model Code of Conduct is in place.
Mr. Jaitley claimed that the UPA had made three unsuccessful attempts against Mr. Modi so far.
“First they tried to appoint two new information commissioners, second they tried to fill up the quorum of the Search Committee for appointment of the Lokpal, and third they are trying desperately to get at least one judge to agree to head the ‘snoopgate’ commission. “I doubt very much if any of these moves is likely to succeed. Even if it does, a future government would be well within its legitimate rights to review such a mala fide last-minute decision of the UPA,” he said.

A. Raja, Kanimozhi, Dayalu issued summons in 2G case
","Taking cognisance of an Enforcement Directorate complaint in connection with a money-laundering case related to the 2G spectrum allocation scam, a Delhi court issued summons on Friday to the former Union Telecom Minister A. Raja, Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam chief M. Karunanidhi’s wife Dayalu Ammal and his daughter Kanimozhi, and 17 others to appear before it on May 26.
Mr. Karunanidhi’s daughter Selvi is one of the 30 witnesses.
In filing the case, the ED traced the trail of a sum of Rs. 200 crore that reached Kalignar TV from other accused companies, and concluded that it was illegal gratification for, and on behalf of, A. Raja and his associates for illegal favours given to Swan Telecom. “Raja was actively involved in receiving and refunding the proceeds of crime,” it said.
“On a perusal of the material on record, I am satisfied that there is enough incriminating material to proceed against the accused,” Special CBI judge O.P. Saini said.
The ED said in its complaint that Kalaignar TV director P. Amirtham and managing director and chief executive officer Sharad Kumar, “in association with Dayalu Ammal and Kanimozhi, were involved in parking Rs. 200-crore illegal gratification and its refund.”
Shahid Usman Balwa, Swan Telecom promoter; Vinod Goenka, managing director of DB Realty; Asif Balwa and Rajiv Agarwal, promoters of Kusegaon Fruits and Vegetables Pvt. Ltd.; and Karim Morani, director of Cineyug Films are among others summoned.
“An amount of Rs. 200 crore was paid by promoters of Swan Telecom using their group entity Dynamix Realty to Kalaignar TV through Kusegaon Fruits and Cineyug Films in the garb of legitimate financial transactions as loan/share application money ... In the garb of loan, it was the illegal gratification, which was apparently projected as untainted money ... The reverse flow of such amount further establishes the projection of the proceeds of crime as untainted money and is nothing but the process of money laundering,” the ED said.

Poor show led to Sinha exit: Chidambaram
","In a sharp reaction to former Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha’s accusation, in a recent newspaper interview, that he was “trying to fool the country” with a “fiscal fraud,” Union Finance Minister P. Chidambaram has said the BJP leader’s performance in the same office “was such that he had to demit office on July 1, 2002.”
“I may point out that 2000-01 and 2002-03 were the worst years since liberalisation in terms of growth and Prime Minister Vajpayee was forced to replace the Finance Minister,” Mr. Chidambaram said on Thursday. “I thought Mr. Sinha would be happy to remain a distant memory for the people of India. However, he seems determined to remain relevant in his party.”
Mr. Sinha had accused Mr. Chidambaram of reducing fiscal deficit by “savagely” cutting planned expenditure, milking PSUs of dividends, and postponing subsidy expenditure incurred this year to the next fiscal.
Mr. Chidambaram cited official figures to show that the Gross Domestic Product growth rate in the two years were 4.3 per cent and 4.0 per cent. Despite the economic slowdown, the growth rate during the UPA’s tenure did not fall below 4.5 per cent. “The allegation that government has postponed the payment of subsidies is either born out of ignorance or is mischievous.” Rollovers had been the practice for many years and nothing unusual happened in 2013-14, he added.
On Mr. Sinha’s accusation that the UPA government had not done its homework on implementing the Goods & Services Tax (GST) and the Direct Tax Code (DTC), the Minister said that when consensus had nearly been reached, the State “governments of Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat stalled further progress … Issues that had been settled were reopened.”

YSRC asks Pawan to get his facts right
","The YSR Congress Party has suggested actor-turned-politician Pawan Kalyan to get his facts right before blaming YSRC as being responsible for the bifurcation of the State.
Refuting the Jana Sena founder’s criticism of YSRC, party senior leader M.V. Mysura Reddy stated here on Friday that creation of Telangana was the result of Congress’ mishandling of the sensitive issue and the politics of conspiracy played by the TDP. Reading out excerpts from page 194 of Sri Krishna Committee report, Dr. Reddy stated that a separate group was formed in the TDP seeking statehood for Telangana after N. Chandrababu Naidu became the Chief Minister for the second time. Akin to the 1969 situation, K. Chandrasekhar Rao launched TRS in 2001 with an objective to achieve statehood for Telangana region, in the backdrop of NDA carving out Chhattisgarh, Utraranchal and Jhakhand States in 2000.
Both the BJP and TDP had claimed during their election campaign in Telangana that it was because of them the statehood to Telangana had become possible, Dr. Reddy pointed out and reminded Mr. Kalyan that he had said in the past that the BJP had influenced the Congress to announce Telangana.

TDP cadres buoyant
","The mood in the TDP district unit appears to be upbeat with the grand success of the NDA Vijaya Sankharavam meetings organised at Tirupati and Madanapalle in the last two days.
Spearheaded by BJP’s prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi, TDP chief N. Chandrababu Naidu and actor Pawan Kalyan, the district cadres believe the meetings have given the required boost to party candidates. Talking to The Hindu, senior TDP leader Gali Muddukrishnama Naidu, contesting from Nagari Assembly constituency, said that the overwhelming response to the meetings reflects the strong desire of the people to have good governance both at the State as well as the Centre. Exasperated with corruption, people now want visionary leaders such as Modi and Chandrababu Naidu, he said.
When contacted, another senior leader, Bojjala Gopalakrishna Reddy, from Sri Kalahasti, said that the meeting had contributed to the consolidation of party votes. In addition to this, Naidu’s proclamation that he would prefer taking an oath in Seemandhra and would not mind administering the State from under the tree’s shade has kindled the sentiments of people, who are said to be deeply hurt by the bifurcation. Further, Modi’s assertions with regard to Naidu’s competence have also provided the required fillip to the party’s image.
Meanwhile, buoyant cadres also drew parallels between Naidu, who upped his diatribes against the Congress and the YSRC, and the then Chief Minister Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy, who adopted a hard-line approach at the Nandhyala public meeting during the 2009 elections.
Above all, the catch phrase ‘YSRC Hatao – Seemandhra Bachao’ conceived by Pawan Kalyan at the Tirupati meeting has gone down well with voters.

“Truck with TDP a tactical blunder”
","Even as Bharatiya Janata Party is pinning hopes on three to four Lok Sabha seats in Telangana, a senior leader said the party committed a “tactical blunder” by entering into an alliance with Telugu Desam in the region.
BJP functionaries expressed confidence that senior party leader Bandaru Dattatreya would romp home in Secunderabad Lok Sabha constituency. They are hopeful that BJP nominees would do well in Mahabubnagar, Nizamabad and Karimnagar Lok Sabha constituencies and a dozen Assembly seats, including Amberpet in city from where Telangana BJP president G. Kishan Reddy is seeking re-election.
They said Musheerabad, Goshamahal, Malkajgiri, Khairatabad, Nizamabad urban, Yella Reddy, Karimnagar, Vemulawada, Yella Reddy, Mahabubnagar and Nagarkurnool Assembly seats were the other places where the party was expected to put up a sterling performance. However, the situation would have been totally different and Congress would have been wiped out had the BJP tied up with TRS instead of TDP, said a senior party leader.
The leader, who did not wish to be identified, said most of the seats allotted to BJP were TRS strongholds. Besides, TDP president N. Chandrabau Naidu did not concentrate much on Telangana and also did not spend enough.
He said by aligning with TDP, the party virtually yielded ground to TRS in claiming to be the sole champion of Telangana. “We depended only on Mr. Narendra Modi’s glamour and left Telangana factor to TRS and Congress,” he added. He said that a BJP-TRS alliance would have got at least 14 Lok Sabha seats as the combination of Mr. Modi’s glamour and Telangana issue would have resulted in huge success.
Another BJP leader said BJP-TDP alliance simply did not work. He said the speeches of Mr. Modi during his tour of Telangana when he criticised the manner of bifurcation of the State also did not go well with the people in the region. This aspect was exploited to the hilt by TRS leader K. Chandrasekhar Rao subsequently.

What about the job, asks Paralympian Girisha
","H.N. Girisha, who hit the headlines after winning a silver medal in the Paralympic Games held in London in 2012, is angry with both the Union and State governments for failing to keep their promise of offering him a job. It has been 20 months since he won the medal. He feels insulted that he has to remind the governments to look into his case.
Mr. Girisha, a native of Hosanagara village in Arakalgud taluk of Hassan district, was the only athlete from India to win a medal in the Paralympics that year. His achievement not only drew the attention of those in power but also of other sportspersons.
Cricket maestro Sachin Tendulkar himself called him up to congratulate him. The Centre had promised him a Class 1 executive job in the Sports Authority of India (SAI). The then Sports Minister, Ajay Maken, had tweeted his assurance. Even The State government had assured him a job in Karnataka.
Speaking to The Hindu on Friday, Mr. Girisha said, “I approached the Centre and the SAI several times. But nothing has worked out. How many times should I go and beg for a job?” he said.
He had even met State government authorities many times, but to no avail. “I am happy that the Centre honoured me with the Padma Shree. I met Karnataka Sports Minister Abhay Chandra Jain only to hear that something will be done,” he said.
The previous BJP government had assured him a job. “The present Minister and officers say there was no Government Order. If the previous government did not issue an order, does that mean the present government ignores the promises made earlier? If this is the government’s attitude, how will children be motivated to take up sports?” he asked.
Hassan Urban Development Authority offered him a 1,200 sq.ft site in Vijaya Nagar Layout in Hassan. Other Olympic medallists have been offered good posts in other States. There, Olympic medallists are working in the cadre of Superintendent of Police or Deputy Superintendent of Police. Besides, they get financial support to take part in international sports meets, he said.
Mr. Girisha, hailing from a poor family, had resigned from his job in a private company to practice for the Paralympic Games in 2012.
Before leaving for London, he had approached the Deputy Commissioner of Hassan to help him get a job. The DC had suggested he apply for the post of village accountant, for which the recruitment process was on. However, within a couple of weeks, he won the medal in London and he was promised a government post by both the Centre and the State.

Small, medium towns in Karnataka may get 24x7 water
","The 24x7 drinking water supply scheme may be extended to small and medium towns in the State this year, utilising assistance provided by the Union government under the Urban Infrastructure Development Scheme for Small and Medium Towns (UIDSSMT).
The scheme, introduced on a pilot basis in a few wards in Hubli-Dharwad, Belgaum and Gulbarga city corporation limits, will be extended to all the wards in the three cities at a cost of Rs. 1,760 crore, with 50 per cent assistance from the World Bank, as it has become a success.
The State government has now decided to experiment the scheme in Sedam and Chincholi towns in Gulbarga district.
Executive Engineer of the Karnataka Urban Water Supply and Drainage Board (KUWSDB) Ashok Madyal told The Hindu here on Thursday that the Union government had given its approval for implementing the scheme in Sedam at a cost of Rs. 26.1 crore. It would be funded under the UIDSSMT and implemented by the KUWSDB. The State government had given its administrative approval and tenders had been invited for bulk supply of water, he said.
Mr. Madyal said another proposal for implementing the scheme in Chincholi town at a cost of Rs. 50.01 crore had been submitted to the State government for administrative approval. A proposal had also been placed before the Union government seeking assistance.
The KUWSDB also proposes to take up the scheme in Aland town in Gulbarga district under the UIDSSMT. A survey had been completed in the town, and design and estimates were being prepared.
Mr. Madyal said that a Rs. 99-crore proposal under the UIDSSMT had been submitted to the Union government for taking up Phase I of the 4th stage of the underground drainage project in Gulbarga city. A detailed project report had been submitted to the Union government and technical appraisal completed. Apart from this, the UGD project for the industrial township of Wadi in Chittapur taluk and Aland town at a cost of Rs. 60.43 crore and Rs. 39.8 crore, respectively, had been approved under the UIDSSMT. The State government has given its administrative approval.
He said the Union government had also accorded its sanction for taking up the UGD project in Sedam and Chittapur towns at a cost of Rs. 22 crore and Rs. 18 crore respectively. Estimates were also being prepared for taking up the UGD project in Chincholi and Afzalpur towns in Gulbarga district.

Complaint against Minister for ‘threatening’ journalist
","Minister of State for Youth Services, Sports and Fisheries K. Abhayachandra Jain is reported to have threatened a reporter of a regional newspaper here on Thursday, resulting in the latter filing a complaint against the Minister in the jurisdictional Moodbidri police station.
Police Commissioner R. Hithendra said the Moodbidri police had received a complaint from Yashodhar Kotian, the reporter, alleging that the Minister had threatened that Congress workers would attack him for publishing a report. The police have since initiated an investigation into the complaint.
The reporter alleged that he was threatened when he called the Minister to seek his reaction about a report on a power project.
The report pertained to a letter written by Chief Minister Siddaramaiah to the Union government stating that the State government was interested in going ahead with the thermal power project at Niddodi while the Minister is opposed to it.
The former Deputy Chief Minister K.S. Eshwarappa has criticised Mr. Jain for his alleged conduct with the journalist. “Mr. Jain should apologise for his conduct and resign from the Ministry. If he does not do so, the Chief Minister should remove him,” he said.
The Dakshina Kannada Working Journalists Association has also criticised Mr. Jain. By threatening a journalist, Mr. Jain had created a sense of fear among people, Harish Rai, president of the association, said.
A protest has been planned outside the office of the Deputy Commissioner here on Saturday.

On the incident at Tanikodu check-post, near Sringeri, where a youth from Mangalore was shot dead allegedly by Anti-Naxal Force (ANF) personnel, Mr. Reddy said the Bharatiya Janata Party’s reaction to the incident “exposes their true colours.”
He said the BJP had sought withdrawal of compensation paid to the family of the youth, Kabir (24), and cases filed against the ANF constable who had allegedly shot him. He said there was a clear design to turn the case against the youth and make him out to be a criminal. The Congress government should not buckle under pressure, he said.

Five months after Govt. Order, Rajiv Arogyasri still on paper
","Five months after the formal announcement, Rajiv Arogyasri — the State government’s healthcare scheme for all above the poverty line (APL) ration cardholders — is still on paper.
The reluctance of corporate hospitals to get empanelled under the scheme has put paid to the plans of the government to provide high-quality medical treatment at low rates.
However, the Suvarna Arogya Suraksha Trust (SAST) that is entrusted with the implementation of the scheme attributed the delay to frequent transfers of top officials in the Department of Health and Family Welfare and the Lok Sabha elections.
A Government Order on the scheme was issued on November 23, 2013. The scheme, stated to be the first of its kind in the country, was aimed at making it possible for all ration APL cardholders (irrespective of their economic status) to get subsidised treatment up to Rs. 1.5 lakh annually in super-specialty hospitals empanelled by the government.
Patients have to pay only 10 per cent of the total cost (up to Rs. 1.5 lakh). Now, BPL cardholders are covered under the Vajpayee Arogyasri.
Citing low package rates, nine of the 80 private hospitals empanelled for the Vajpayee Arogyasri had backed out of the partnership.
Of the nine hospitals, one is a noted medical college hospital in Dharwad and the others are among the top private hospitals in Bangalore. Their main contention was that the low government package rates would cut into their profits and hit their “functioning”.
According to a spokesperson of a private hospital, although surgical procedure rates vary among the hospitals, getting empanelled under the government schemes means “all hospitals will have to follow a standard rate”.
As most hospitals are also empanelled for the Vajpayee Arogyasri, they are finding it difficult to cross-subsidise the scheme with patients who can afford to pay. P. Bore Gowda, Executive Director of Suvarna Arogya Suraksha Trust, said that eight other hospitals had also stayed away from the scheme after their initial empanelment. But as the number of patients in these eight hospitals reduced considerably, they decided to remain in the scheme. The higher number of admissions in the empanelled hospitals compensated for the lowering of tariffs, he said. He said treatment packages were priced following extensive consultations with specialists from government and private sectors.
The Rajiv Arogyasri scheme is applicable to 447 surgical procedures.

Bar licence: UDF in for a long haul
","It is going to be a long haul for the United Democratic Front (UDF) leadership to arrive at a fair decision on the issue of renewing liquor bar licences mainly because most of the leaders of the constituent parties are reluctant to get involved in the process.
After reaching nowhere in their attempts to resolve their differences, Chief Minister Oommen Chandy, Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee president V.M. Sudheeran and Home Minister Ramesh Chennithala had decided to elevate the status of their dialogues to the UDF level by getting the leaders of constituent parties involved.
However, several senior leaders would prefer to leave it to the Congress to sort out the issue since the party was handling the Excise portfolio.
Mr. Sudheeran has reiterated his stand against the renewal of bar licences without a proper evaluation.

Main issue

The main issue, according to him, is the proliferation of liquor dens and the easy availability of liquor, which is a major social evil in Kerala. Instead of merely talking tall about prohibition, he has been goading his party workers to take a proactive stance towards the issue.
On his part, he promptly issued notices to all functionaries of the Congress, especially in the local bodies ruled by the Congress-led UDF, not to give ‘no objection certificates’ for opening new bars.
He has also got the KPCC executive to agree to an anti-liquor campaign, beginning with a drive within the government by getting various departments come on a common platform for this purpose.
His take on the issue is that the Congress should take an affirmative stand and take the initiative against proliferation of liquor outlets.

CM’s concerns

As far as the Chief Minister and Excise Minister K. Babu are concerned, they fully share the concerns of Mr. Sudheeran, but their perspectives are conditioned by their official positions.
Mr. Chandy even went to the extent of stating that the government would not hesitate to forgo revenue from liquor. At the same time, he made it clear that since he was the head of administration, he would have to consider several legal and administrative aspects before taking a decision.

UDF policy

Ever since returning to office in 2011, the UDF’s liquor policy has been aimed at restricting bar licences to higher categories, with the result that only five-star hotels are now eligible for licence in the third year of UDF reign.
The legal issues apart, the government would also have to ensure availability of good quality liquor, without letting the grey market to get the upper hand from the gaps in the trade.
Through discussions, the Congress leaders were able to defuse the air of confrontation that had been gradually emerging on the bar licence issue.
As it turned out, they appeared to be in agreement in belling the cat, but seemed not sure about how to go about it.
Mr. Sudheeran said the first of the consultations with the UDF leaders would be held most probably on Wednesday.
The IUML’s stand on liquor is well known, with its religious connotation. The Kerala Congress (M) would go along with whatever decision the Congress might take, but party leaders said that it would be only fair to give a chance for these bars to improve their standards within a stipulated time, as suggested by the Ramachandaran committee.

Kerala faces court ire on Bevco facilities
","Even as the Kerala State Beverages Corporation (Bevco) on Friday informed the Kerala High Court that steps were being initiated to provide more facilities at its liquor outlets, Justice Alexander Thomas expressed displeasure over the government failure to respond to the court suggestion for a commission to look into the facilities available at the outlets.
Meanwhile, on another petition seeking to implement the M. Ramachandran Commission report on the liquor policy, the judge directed the State government to file a statement detailing the steps taken to implement the recommendations. The petition was filed by High Court lawyer Basil Attipetty.
Justice Alexander Thomas wondered why the government was meting out step-motherly treatment to public corporations such as Bevco.
It seemed to have turned a blind eye to improving the facilities for consumers at these outlets. The court orally pointed out that just as the government efforts for metro rail for solving transport woes in Kochi, the government could take a cue from the Delhi government policy and emulate the system of distribution of liquor in New Delhi. (In Delhi, four public corporations are engaged in retail trade of liquor. Private entrepreneurs are also allowed to run retail outlets in Delhi. The Delhi government has also granted licence for retail sale of beer and mixed alcoholic beverages through departmental stores).
The court made the oral observations when a petition by Bevco challenging the decision of the Sasthamcotta panchayat directing it to close down an outlet at Bharanikkavu came up for hearing.
Bevco counsel C.S. Ajith Prakash submitted that the corporation had initiated steps to open more outlets depending on the availability of space. In fact, more than one counter was functioning at all outlets which had high sales turnover. It also proposed to run outlets in supermarkets where people could take bottles of their choice. However, sufficient security personnel needed to be provided at these counters. He also submitted that the corporation was running as many as 338 outlets, of which, 331 were functioning from rented buildings. As part of the corporation’s initiative to improve facilities, it would construct shelters over its counters .
Last time, when the petition came up for hearing, the court had observed that long queues were seen in front of the outlets, often causing public nuisance.

Setting up of nine mega borewells and 22 mini power pumps have been taken up at an expenditure of Rs.1.14 crore sanctioned under the State Disaster Response Fund.
One of the bore wells, 800 feet in depth, set up at Mappillaiyarkulam, at an expenditure of Rs.5 lakh, will augment supply for about 500 households in wards 9,10,11, and parts of ward 3. Maiden tests for water supply were conducted on Friday evening. Municipal sources said that this was the first of the nine borewells that was being put to use.
The source at Mappillaiyarkulam is a good source of potable water and it would eventually be linked to the drinking water lines.
“It has been planned to supply water during the forenoon session. Based on technical details, it would be extended to evening session too,” sources said.
The civil works for setting up borewells one each at Kamarajapuram, Kakkachi Oorani, Sengaithoppe, and Samathuvapuram and three wells at Ammaiapatti were in progress.
“While the source at Ammaiapatti is fit for human consumption, water from other sources need to be analysed,” sources said.
In case the source does not meet human consumption norms, it would be supplied for other domestic use, sources added.

He denied the existence of any wave in favour of the BJP prime ministerial candidate. “There is only heatwave in Barmer [in Rajasthan, where Mr. Singh is in the fray as Independent], no Modi wave.”
Drawing a comparison between the former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee’s leadership and the present BJP leadership, Mr. Singh said: “I had the honour of working with a team led by Mr. Vajpayee who enjoyed the confidence of his Cabinet. I don’t see that happening in the renewed National Democratic Alliance. I am happier to remain swatantra.”
Targeting Mr. Modi, he said the BJP had now become a “one man party” but during Mr. Vajpayee’s time there was no “coterie” chosen by one person.
“The BJP has not had, even in Vajpayee’s time, a single man leadership. Currently, there is either one-man leadership or it is confined to a small coterie chosen by one personality. That is a choice which the BJP has made for itself.”
On the ongoing general election, Mr. Singh said it “is more about political rhetoric, there is no discussion on ideas and issues which will have an impact on our country. Rhetoric is replacing logic and the level of discussion is very low.”
He described as “grossly unjust” the BJP’s action against his son, Manvendra Singh, for campaigning for him during the elections. Manvendra was sacked from the BJP’s National Executive on April 10.

Mafia calling the shots in U.P.: Mayawati
","Alleging total collapse of the law and order machinery under Samajwadi Party rule in Uttar Pradesh, BSP supremo Mayawati on Friday said the Akhilesh Yadav government was playing into the hands of the mafia and underworld dons.
“Law and order has touched an all time low in Uttar Pradesh with mafia and underworld dons calling the shots under the SP rule,” she said at a rally here in support of BSP nominee from Haridwar Haji Islam.
Citing spurt in crime against Dalits under the SP rule, she said when she was the Chief Minister the Dalits felt safe and those who committed crimes against them were put behind the bars.
Claiming there was no riot during her rule in the State, she said riots occurred in Uttar Pradesh not long after the SP took over the reigns of power.
The BSP supremo said she distributed tickets in these elections keeping the interest of Sarva Samaj in mind and if the Dalit and Muslim votes went collectively to the BSP candidate “no force can stop him from winning”.
Giving reasons for the recent suspension of Uttarakhand Cabinet Minister Surendra Rakesh and MLA Haridas from the BSP, she said action was taken against them as they could not work in the interest of the Dalits despite holding a position of power.
She also made it clear that they would not be given ticket to contest the next Assembly polls in Uttarakhand.

Views sought to make helmets must for women
","The Delhi Government’s Transport Department issued a notification on Friday seeking objections from people over its decision to amend the Motor Vehicle Rules,1993, for making helmets mandatory for woman driving or riding pillion on two-wheelers.
The move comes after the Election Commission gave its nod to issue a gazette notification to invite public suggestions and objections in the matter. The amendment would delete sub-rule (2) of rule 115 of the Motor Vehicle Rules making it mandatory for all women to wear headgear while on a two-wheeler.
“People can send their objections and suggestions to the Transport Commissioner. All the drafts received over the next 30 days will be considered before the MVR is amended,” a Transport Department official said.
While the city has seen several accidents involving two-wheelers in which women have been killed, members of the Sikh community have been protesting against the move on the grounds that it went against their religion.
Successive elected governments in the Capital have rejected any such move due to pressure from the Sikh community. Lieutenant-Governor Najeeb Jung, however, cleared a Transport Department proposal last month to amend the MVR.
The Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Managing Committee has sought review of the order. A day after the L-G gave his nod, the committee wrote to Mr. Jung requesting him to exempt Sikh women from wearing helmets.

Jagan-rivals' war of words gets shrill
",": The YSR Congress (YSRC) and its president Y.S. Jaganmohan Reddy has become the common target of all other political parties in the fray in Seemandhra as the campaign peaked with only three more days left to woo the electorate.
With the mercury levels soaring in Coastal Andhra, Jagan’s rivals have sharpened and intensified their criticism of Mr. Reddy. In particular, TDP-BJP combine including the newly-floated Jana Sena Party, Congress, and other fringe parties went overboard in attacking the YSRC chief by linking the cases of corruption.
TDP chief N. Chandrababu Naidu and Jana Sena founder Pawan Kalyan are leaving no stone unturned in targeting Mr. Reddy while BJP’s prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi resorted to a veiled attack on the YSR Congress as he tried to build an opinion by repeatedly asking people: “Whether you want a State with scams or the one with golden opportunities”.
Mr. Naidu and Mr. Pawan Kalyan, however, have been going harsh and personal against Mr. Reddy by digging into how the latter built his business empire when his father the late Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy was the Chief Minister. The two have been targeting Mr. Reddy as being responsible for the bifurcation of the State too.
The Congress too has been ‘unsparing’ in its criticism of Mr. Reddy with Union Ministers Jairam Ramesh and K. Chiranjeevi being the star campaigners till AICC president Sonia Gandhi addressed an election rally in Guntur on Friday.
On its part, the YSRC and its chief Mr. Reddy have been effectively countering the rivals’ attack by explaining to the people how they lacked “credibility” by making it one of his poll planks in addition to “values in politics and welfare schemes of YSR”. Claiming that his was a family that had not gone back on the word given to people, he has been telling people how the Congress with the help of TDP have been victimising him for not abandoning his “odarpu yatra”.
“The BJP-TDP combo is unleashing a barrage of lies and promising to bring heavens down without talking about resources,” Mr. Reddy shot back during his election campaign in Krishna district on Friday. He charged the two parties as the prime culprits along with the Congress for dividing Telugu people. “How can the same set of people come to Seemandhra and tell people that Jagan is responsible for the division,” he asked.
Criticising Mr. Naidu for making “impossible promises”, Mr. Reddy said: “I can’t do that as I want to be in public life and people’s hearts for the next 30 years.”

","RBDCK would commence work on Palarivattom flyover shortly, while PWD would begin Vyttila and Kundanoor flyover works in three months’ time, Minister for Public Works V.K. Ebrahim Kunju said.
Inordinate delay by the two agencies in kickstarting work on flyovers had invited much flak. Speaking to the media here on Friday, Mr. Kunju said the design for Vyttilla and Kundanoor flyovers would be ready within a fortnight. DMRC will commission Edappally flyover in another year.
Widening work of Vyttila-Pettah Road would begin once PWD completes assessment of the rate for buildings that would be pulled down fully or partially, in another fortnight. DMRC and other metro stakeholders had condemned the delay in widening the arterial road since they are unable to begin Kochi metro works on the narrow road.
To a question on PWD’s keenness to widen and develop Thammanam-Pullepady Road, PWD Secretary T.O. Sooraj said Kochi Corporation was yet to hand over the road to PWD. “Once handed over, we are hopeful that the State government will announce a special package for land acquisition.”

Modi takes jibe at Mamata over ‘paper tiger’ comment
","Taking a jibe at >Mamata Banerjee over her “paper tiger” comment, BJP prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi on Sunday said that a real tiger is one who jails those involved in the Sharada chit fund scam and gets back money of the poor.
Mr. Modi also said that Ms. >Banerjee’s attack on him would not deter him in helping Bengal if BJP comes to power at the Centre and a strong BJP government would also ensure that the West Bengal Chief Minister does her job seriously.
“A tiger is the one who sends those involved in Sharada chit fund scam to jail, investigate the matter and get back the money of the poor.
“I am surprised. Didi, why are you afraid of a paper tiger. If a paper tiger has proved this costly for her, then what will happen if a real tiger comes before you,” Mr. Modi said while addressing a rally in Bankura.
The BJP’s prime ministerial candidate said the real tigers of Bengal were its youth.
Three days back, Ms. >Banerjee had taken swipe at Mr. Modi, saying there was a difference between a ‘paper tiger’ and a Royal Bengal Tiger.
Mr. Modi said that “Didi’s” attack on him will not be an impediment for Bengal and its development, if BJP comes to power.”
The Gujarat Chief Minister said that he does not believe in politics of “revenge” (badla), but politics of “badlav (change).
“Didi has bad-mouthed me, launched attacks and levelled false charges. But let me assure you that I will serve people of Bengal and work for them. I believe in politics of change and not revenge,” he said, adding that Bengal had suffered injustice for 60 years because of the central government.
The West Bengal Chief Minister and Mr. Modi have engaged in verbal slugfest over several issues and have launched vitriolic attacks on each other.
Appealing to the voters, Mr. Modi said that if BJP is elected to power, it will be a double profit for the people of Bengal.
“I am giving you a formula. If a strong BJP government comes to power at the Centre then Didi also has to stop her drama and show some seriousness in running the government.
“If I make 100 kms of roads, then she has to at least make 10 kms of road. If I build 1 lakh houses then she has to build 10,000 houses,” he said.

Left won’t have strong presence in next Lok Sabha, admits Karat
","Communist Party of India (Marxist) general secretary Prakash Karat conceded on Saturday that the Left would not have a strong presence in the next Lok Sabha to influence policy even if a third alternative government was formed with Congress support.
He was responding to reports suggesting that the Congress was wary of doing business with the Left for fear that the CPI(M) will try to steer the country away from economic liberalisation.
Fielding questions on a range of issues during an interaction with the media, Mr. Karat refused to be drawn into speculation on whether the CPI(M) would be open to having the Trinamool Congress in the third alternative if required. “We will have to wait and see because it is a party which has earlier had no hesitation to go with the BJP. Trinamool chief Mamata Banerjee’s attitude to [BJP prime ministerial candidate] Narendra Modi will become clear only after the elections,” he said, dismissing her anti-BJP statements as poll rhetoric. “It is very possible that she will join the NDA now and leave just before the West Bengal Assembly elections to get the Muslim vote.”
Maintaining that the widespread anti-Congress sentiment was being misinterpreted as a “Modi wave,” Mr. Karat insisted that the BJP alone would not benefit from this mood; even non-Congress secular parties stood to gain.
On the potential constituents of the third alternative, Mr. Karat pointed out that not one of the 11 signatories to the February 25 statement had gone with the Congress or the BJP. He also indicated the possibility of a couple of other parties joining this alternative, underscoring that the Congress would have to be integral to such a grouping.
About the stability of a third alternative, given past experience, the CPI(M) leader maintained that it was not the smaller parties but the Congress which destabilised two United Front governments.
About the Samajwadi Party’s alleged communal campaign, he said many of the statements attributed to the party were essentially made to counter the RSS propaganda that has been gathering steam ever since the Akhilesh Yadav government came to power in Uttar Pradesh.

Assam violence: Locals in Baksa refuse to bury the dead till Gogoi’s visit
","Demanding that Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi visit their area, people of Salbari in Assam’s violence-hit Baksa district on Sunday refused to bury their kin killed in attacks by NDFB-Songbijit militants.
Angry protestors in Nankekhadrabari area on Sunday said they will not perform the last rites of the bodies of the 18 people, including children and women, till Mr. Gogoi comes and personally assures to provide security to their lives and property.
“Does our life have no value? We are only demanding that we are protected and we are not attacked and killed in future” they told reporters.
“The district administration instead of providing violence-hit people security and protection, is now threatening to arrest us if we do not perform janaja (last rites) of our dead,” they alleged.
There is no immediate word from official sources about the Chief Minister visiting the area.
Heavily armed NDFB-S militants had gunned down 18 persons on Friday night and torched over 100 houses since the militant outfit started its mayhem against a minority community in the BTAD’s twin districts of Baksa and Kokrajhar from May one.
Altogether 32 people were killed in the violence, several others injured and thousands rendered homeless in the two districts.
Meanwhile, indefinite curfew imposed in neighbouring Chirang district of the Bodoland Territorial Administrative District (BTAD) since Friday night was relaxed for six hours from 10 am today, district administration said.

BJP playing communal card: Sibal
","The Congress on Saturday accused the Bharatiya Janata Party of vitiating the environment by playing the “communal card,” even as Prime Minister Manmohan Singh condemned violence in Assam.Addressing a press conference here, Congress leader Kapil Sibal said “the credit for the present communal environment goes to Narendra Modi,” who, he added, “stands for Model of Dividing India.”
“I don’t blame anyone baselessly and without any proof,” Mr. Sibal said when asked whether he blamed Mr. Modi for the Assam riots.
“Creating a national divide by polarising the polity for political dividends has been the strategy of the BJP. Whenever they find that their chances of acceptability are at their nadir, they play the communal card. Mr. Advani did this by launching the Rath Yatra [in 1990] and the BJP played the communal card by being instrumental in demolishing the Babri Masjid. Mr. Modi did this by polarising the polity in Gujarat,” Mr. Sibal charged.
Releasing photographs allegedly taken from Twitter accounts of BJP leaders, Mr. Sibal said the pictures of events in Pakistan, Palestine and Bangladesh were being shown on these Twitter handles as occurring in India to communalise the atmosphere.
One such picture was from Bangladesh but the caption said Bangladeshi Muslims were burning the tricolour in Assam. The Congress also highlighted purported speeches of senior BJP leaders with strong communal overtones.
Meanwhile, Prime Minister, who is keeping a close watch on the Assam situation, spoke to Home Minister Sushilkumar Shinde and Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi and directed them to take urgent steps to restore normalcy in the disturbed areas.
Expressing “shock and grief” over the killings, a PMO statement said “such attacks are cowardly attempts to spread fear and terror among our citizens.” Dr. Singh asked the people to remain calm and ignore rumours as the Centre and the State Government would take all measures to maintain law and order and restore normality.
Condemning the violence, BJP spokesperson Ravi Shankar Prasad blamed the State government for not taking timely action. While demanding the arrest of the guilty, he blamed the tension in Assam on vote-bank politics.
“We have some questions for Manmohan Singh, who has been a member of the Rajya Sabha from Assam for 24 years and Premier for 10 years. Tarun Gogoi has been Chief Minister for 14 years. This is the third clash between Bodos and Bangladeshi immigrants,” Mr. Prasad said.
On Mr. Sibal’s charge that the riots were caused by Mr. Modi’s remark that Bangladeshi immigrants should pack their bags and be prepared to leave after May 16, Mr. Prasad said: “He (Sibal) will be back to practising law in a fortnight.”
Communist Party of India (Marxist) general secretary Prakash Karat, too, attributed the attacks to the constant propaganda that all Muslims in Assam were Bangladeshis, especially, if they were Bengali Muslims.

YSRC has become hub of criminals: Naidu
","Telugu Desam Party (TDP) president N. Chandrababu Naidu said that YSR Congress president Y.S. Jaganmohan Reddy would go to jail in six months and not return before 20 years.
Addressing an impressive public meeting at the RTC bus stand in Piler town on Sunday, Mr. Naidu said that Mr. Jaganmohan Reddy was shuddering at the thought of the BJP-TDP alliance and Pawan Kalyan supporting it. “In order to protect himself, Mr. Jaganmohan Reddy is hoodwinking Muslims with all kinds of stories. He wants power to save himself from criminal cases and loot the State further. It was me who protected religious harmony in Hyderabad. I shall be the armour for the Muslim brothers,” he said. He defended the TDP alliance with BJP, saying that it was for the sake of developing the State.
The TDP chief said that the YSRC has become a hub of criminals and a ‘family party,’ with several of the family members contesting the elections, including Y.S. Jaganmohan Reddy, Vijayamma (Vizag MP candidate), Avinash Reddy (Kadapa), Y.V. Subba Reddy (Ongole) and Ravindranath Reddy (Kamalapuram Assembly seat).
Training his guns on JSP president N. Kiran Kumar Reddy and his brother Kishore Kumar Reddy (Piler candidate for JSP), Mr. Naidu alleged that Mr. Kishore Kumar Reddy had looted the forest wealth with large-scale smuggling of red sanders. He urged the people to vote for TDP candidate Iqbal Ahmed, ‘who has no money, but integrity’.
Mr. Naidu said that he had learnt politics from N.T. Rama Rao. Appealing to farmers, he said: “I am the son of a farmer. I will stand by you at all times.”
He listed the various poll promises, including the infrastructural development of Seemandhra on a par with Singapore.
Mr Naidu’s schedule in his home district was delayed by over four hours and his itinerary included Punganur, Kuppam, Palamaner and Chittoor, followed by a night halt at Tirupati.
Earlier, crowds surged at Piler, expecting the arrival of Pawan Kalyan along with Mr. Chandrababu Naidu, but were disappointed with just the presence of Mr. Chandrababu Naidu.

TRS confident of near sweep in north ‘T’
","After relaxing at his farmhouse for five days after hectic campaigning, Telangana Rashtra Samithi president K. Chandrasekhar Rao returned to the city on Sunday evening. He is expected to meet party candidates and evaluate their winning chances.
The TRS chief announced that the party’s executive will meet on May 9 wherein all the candidates who contested the polls to the Assembly and Parliament seats will be asked to be present.
Except visiting his native Chintamadaka village near Siddipet to cast his vote on the polling day, Mr. Rao was totally confined to the farmhouse at Gajwel ever since he addressed his last election rally at nearby Wargal village on April 28. Party sources said he did not even carry out his favourite farming activity during the period as he preferred rest because he was too tired having campaigned in 107 out of 119 Assembly constituencies for two weeks.
A TRS contestant said the party is riding on a “tremendous” wave and added that it would be a near sweep in north Telangana. Sources said that KCR has decided to give a serious thought to government formation and other related issues only after declaration of the election results.
The TRS has fancied its chances of forming a government in Telangana as the single largest party, expecting to cross the 60-seat mark in the Assembly. But, inputs from various sources suggest the party could get anywhere between 55 to 60 seats and the Congress up to 35. The TDP–BJP combine could garner 12 seats and the MIM seven to eight. Another four to five seats will be shared by CPI, CPI(M) and YSR Congress. In the Lok Sabha elections , both TRS and Congress could be on an even keel.
An MP aspirant from TRS told The Hindu that the party would win 47 to 50 Assembly seats in the north Telangana districts of Adilabad, Nizamabad, Medak, Karimnagar and Warangal. It is set to come up trumps in eight seats in Mahabubnagar and four apiece in Nalgonda and Hyderabad–Ranga Reddy districts, he pointed out.
He said his party would win Adilabad, Karimnagar, Warangal, Nizamabad, Zaheerabad, Medak, Chevella, Nagarkurnool, Nalgonda and Bhongir Lok Sabha constituencies. It would be a close contest between TRS and BJP in Mahabubnagar where Congress stalwart S. Jaipal Reddy is likely to be relegated to the third spot, he added.

‘Apprehensive’ T-Cong leaders set eyes on CM post
","Notwithstanding the not-so-encouraging feedback from the field about prospects of the Congress in the April 30 polls in Telangana, chief ministerial aspirants began to take stock of the polling trends and garner the support of partymen.
On record, all the top Congress leaders claim that victory over the TRS is a foregone conclusion. But during in-camera meetings, these leaders express fears that the going is not smooth. Information gathered from the 119 Assembly and 17 Lok Sabha constituencies has clearly indicated that it would be a close fight between the Congress and the TRS in several constituencies.
Not sure about their fate, seniors like Telangana PCC president Ponnala Lakshmaiah, former PCC chief D. Srinivas, former Deputy Chief Minister C. Damodar Raj Narasimha and former Minister K. Jana Reddy are busy making their own calculations about the chances of becoming the Chief Minister if the party comes to power.
A series of developments and the statements made by these leaders clearly indicate their keenness to be at the helm of affairs in Telangana State. The TPCC chief while exuding confidence about Congress performance maintains that high command would certainly consider him for the Chief Minister’s post because if the party is able to win a majority of the seats, he would get credit for the same.
Mr. Srinivas on Sunday maintained that he was not in the race for the top post but was quick to add that his experience as PCC president during the 2004 and 2009 elections would stand him in good stead for the Chief Minister’s post. He also brought in the BC angle claiming that high command would back a leader from the weaker sections.
Mr. Jana Reddy, a serious contender for the CM’s post, was closeted with Congress candidates at a meeting on Sunday. Sources said Mr. Reddy tried to take stock of the polling to arrive at the number of seats the party could win. He is believed to have listed out the names of the Congress candidates who stood chances of scraping through.
It is understood that he is slowly but carefully nursing the possible candidates with a fair chance of winning to support him in case there is a race for the top post. Mr. Reddy without talking about his aspirations said the Congress would comfortably form the government. He said the TRS was indulging in mind games to demoralise the Congress workers.
A senior TPCC functionary said that a section of the leaders had worked for the defeat of certain bigwigs and, in turn, chart their own path smoother for the top post.

Hope Island voters feel let down
","At a time when the Election Commission is keen on setting up polling stations within a radius of 2 km of the voter’s residence, people residing in Hope Island, an island situated off the coast of Kakinada, are forced to undertake a tedious journey to exercise their franchise. Of the total population of 343 in the fishermen hamlet located on the island, there are 101 male voters and 115 female voters, who have to reach their polling station at Chinna Boddu Venkatayapalem village, near Tallarevu.
From their hamlet, the voters, including the aged and pregnant, have to reach Kakinada by boat. This journey takes nearly two hours. From Kakinada, all of them have to depend on private transport to reach the polling station, as public transport is not available from Kakinada shore to Chinna Boddu Venkatayapalem village. All these voters belong to Mummidivaram Legislative Assembly constituency, which is a part of the Amalapuram Parliamentary constituency.
According to a resident of Hope Island, a polling station was set up on the island only once when the late N.T. Rama Rao contested the elections for the first time (in 1983). Since then, voters have been casting their vote somewhere in Tallarevu. Despite several requests, there is no response from the officials concerned to arrange for polling facility in the hamlet. Interestingly, district officials have arranged for polling stations in hamlets like Kondamodalu, Manturu and Talluru in Devipatnam mandal, where polling staff can reach only by boat.

‘YSRC bubble will burst after May 16’
","The Telugu Desam Party has charged the YSR Congress with copying highlights of its manifesto, including the nine steps for accelerated development of Seemandhra region.
Senior TDP leader Yanamala Ramakrishnudu said in a press release that the YSR Congress would be deserted as also the business empire of YSRC president Y.S. Jaganmohan Reddy once the election process was completed. The government that would come to power was sure to attach the leftover properties of Mr. Jagan, he said.
He alleged that the YSRC was not formed on the basis of sound principles, but was an outcome of Mr. Jagan’s lust for power. There was no effective leadership in the party and it was full of defectors who switched over loyalties after their attempts to secure posts in the TDP and the Congress failed. “This bubble will burst after May 16, the day when the results of general elections will be announced,” he said.
The senior TDP leader recalled the Supreme Court’s direction to complete investigation into the charges against Mr. Jagan and said the time limit fixed by the apex court would come to an end 58 days after the results were declared. He appealed to residents of Visakhapatnam not to vote in favour of YSRC honorary president Y.S.

Move to counter ‘Modi wave’ helps TRS, Congress
","The Muslim vote which can become the deciding factor appears to have gone in favour of TRS in some constituencies and for Congress in some others, apparently to counter the purported ‘Modi wave’.
“The idea to vote for TRS or Congress at some places was to stop the BJP from making any gains,” revealed a leader from Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (MIM) in Adilabad. “The thrust of voting in favour of TRS was more in MP election with the aim of defeating the BJP led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) coming to power at the Centre,” he added, imposing the condition of anonymity.
The number of Muslim voters spread over the 10 Assembly constituencies is estimated to be about 1.25 lakh with the concentration being more in Adilabad town in Adilabad constituency, Bhainsa in Mudhole constituency and Kagaznagar in Sirpur constituency. The Muslim vote has the potential to swing tides in these three constituencies.
The MIM seemed to have arrived at an unwritten understanding with the Telangana protagonist party in this election as its cadres openly canvassed in favour of the latter. Messages, accompanied by pictures of TRS and MIM leaders, claiming that the TRS will make a Muslim leader as Deputy Chief Minister went viral on the Facebook apparently aimed at garnering support for the TRS.
TRS president K. Chandrashekhar Rao himself appeared to have given a hint of the unwritten understanding as he kept referring to MIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi as 'our own' man at every public meeting which he addressed in the district. The impact of his statement however, will be clear only after the counting of votes.

It’s all about family fight in Jaggampeta
","Family politics has been the hallmark of the Assembly constituency, with the Thotas and Jyothulas, who are also close relatives, vying with each other to wrest this segment since 1989. Jaggampeta is presently represented by former Minister Thota Narasimham, who switched loyalty to the Telugu Desam Party. But, he is contesting from the Kakinada Parliamentary constituency this time, leaving his home turf from where he won twice in 2004 and 2009.
In this present election, a triangular fight between the TDP, YSRC and Congress is expected in East Godavari district. After emerging victorious in 1994 and 1999, Thotha Subbarao’s nephew Jyothula Venkata Apparao popularly known as Jyouthula Nehru lost in 2004 as a TDP candidate and in 2009 as a PRP nominee. But, after the PRP-Congress merger, he joined the YSR Congress to try his luck.
Jyothula Chantibabu, who is the TDP in-charge of Jaggampeta, stood third in 2009 elections by securing 33,000 votes and Mr. Narasimham won the seat. Now, Mr. Chantibabu is getting support from Mr. Thota Narasimham’s family and his own Jyothula family.
Mr. Narasimham’s relative Thota Suryanaryana Murthy alias Thota Ravi is contesting from the segment this time as a Congress candidate at the behest of Union Minister M. M. Pallam Raju. Despite him being a known face in this segment, the rising dissent among the voters against the Congress over bifurcation issue may spell trouble for him. Jaggampeta comprises Gandepalli, Gokavaram, Jaggampeta and Kirlampudi mandals. In 2004 elections, 1,26,225 votes were polled here against the total electorate of 1,56,696. Similarly in 2009, 1,47,301 voters of the total 1,86,347 exercised their franchise.
Amid this political hubbub, lack of adequate irrigation facilities for the upland farmers has remained a major issue as they largely rely on rain water to cater to their agricultural needs. All the major political parties have made the modernisation of Yeleru canal the main poll agenda. YSRC candidate Jyothula Venkata Apparao had led many agitations over this issue in the past. The TDP leaders also organised several dharnas, rasta rokos demanding solutions to the farmers’ woes.

“With hardly three days left for the general election, people should make up their mind whether they want a party which will fight for protecting the State’s interests or a party which bows before the Centre,” he said.
He charged the Telugu Desam Party and the Bharatiya Janata Party with joining hands with the Congress-led UPA government to divide the State for ‘the sake of votes and seats’.
He said the TDP had claimed credit for granting statehood to Telangana in the run up to the first phase of elections in the State on April 30. But TDP president N. Chandrababu Naidu was now blaming him and his party for the State’s division, ahead of the second phase of elections in Seemandhra.
The parties, which have turned politics into a ‘political chess game’, are responsible for ‘foisting cases to get rid of me in politics’, contended Mr. Jaganmohan Reddy, who is currently on bail for alleged economic offences.
Reiterating that the loan waiver promised by the TDP could not be implemented, he said when Mr. Chandrababu Naidu was in power, he did not even waive interest on farmers’ loans.
He promised to complete the multi-crore Veligonda project early to provide irrigation and drinking water to drought-prone Prakasam district while canvassing for party Kanigiri MLA candidate B. Madhusudan Yadav and Ongole MP candidate Y.V. Subba Reddy.

Nellore Staff Reporter adds: Mr. Jaganmohan Reddy addressed a roadshow at Kavali town where he asserted that it was their party that would decide who will become the next Prime Minister.
Taking a dig at the Telugu Desam Party, Mr. Jaganmohan Reddy deplored that TDP chief N. Chandrababu Naidu was asking people to vote for Modi for the PM’s post, which amounted to prostrating before the Central leaders. This should not be the case and the YSRC will make an appeal that Andhra Pradesh voters should cast their vote for their self-respect and pride this time, he said.
Directing his attack only on the TDP, Mr. Jaganmohan Reddy described the election as a struggle between credibility and dishonesty and between straightforwardness and deception. “Mr. Chandrababu Naidu is lying to the people. He is making all sorts of false promises only to mislead the people,” the YSRC president said.
Stating that his father Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy stilled lived in the hearts of the poor people by virtue of his welfare programmes, Mr. Jaganmohan Reddy said that Mr. Chandrababu Naidu did not care to think of the need for providing financial assistance to students and healthcare for poor families.

Congress will pay heavy price for dividing AP: Jairam
","Union Minister for Rural Development Jairam Ramesh on Sunday said that the expert committee constituted by the Union Ministry of Home Affairs on selection of a location to create capital for Andhra Pradesh would come out with its report on September 30.
Mr. Ramesh said at a media conference here that he had received representations from local Congress activists requesting to locate the State capital somewhere between Vijayawada and Eluru. Party workers favoured any location close to Gannavaram, one of the three airports identified for upgradation with an international status in the residuary State, for building the capital city, he said.
Mr. Ramesh admitted that the Congress party would pay a heavy price in the Seemandhra region for dividing the State. “I agree that our party is passing through a difficult phase and, after all, the difficulty is self-induced,” he told the media. He blamed the party leadership from the region for allegedly failing to take people on board in fulfilment of its commitment of a separate Telangana State.
The Congress might be lying low for the time being. But one could construe that it’s out, he said while replying to a question. In the same breath, he added: “One cannot write off the Congress in Seemandhra as the bifurcation process has to be carried out smoothly and peacefully.” It would be violent in the absence of the Congress because of the ‘trigger-happy’ regional satraps like K. Chandrasekhar Rao, N. Chandrababu Naidu and Y.S. Jaganmohan Reddy, he said.
Mr. Ramesh, however, defended the bifurcation, saying it came as a blessing in disguise for the residuary State in the form of a special development package as mentioned in the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act. Then came the national status for the Indira Sagar Project and the Krishna River Board, an independent authority to provide equal opportunity to both Telangana and Seemandhra regions in distribution of river waters, as part of the package, he said.

Anantha Venkatarami Reddy promises water for all under HNSS
","The incumbent Anantapur MP and YSRC candidate Anantha Venkatarami Reddy said that he would initiate the supply of water from the Krishna through the HNSS project, if he is elected again.
Speaking to The Hindu, Mr. Venkatarami Reddy said that the second phase of the Handri Neeva Sujala Sravanthi (HNSS) project would be completed within two to three years to ensure that all parts of the district are provided water.
“The endeavour shall be to fill as many tanks as possible with water from the project so as to solve drinking water and irrigation water problems to an extent. Special care will be taken to ensure sufficient drinking water to all municipalities and villages alike,” Mr. Venkatarami Reddy said.
On the dismal state of employment statistics in the district, he said concentration would be on industries which can harness mineral deposits in the district and those industries which require less water.
“A mini-airport is already in the sanction list of the Union government and its construction will start within the next five years. This will go a long way in furthering industrialisation in the district,” Mr Venkatarami Reddy said.
He said that one of his top priorities would be to ensure that either a Central university is established in the district or the existing university upgraded in a way that it becomes a centre of excellence.
“Funds and grants will be given to the university while stressing on the need for effective faculty to promote excellence in education and research,” Mr. Reddy promised even as he said that the quality and commitment of doctors was to be improved in the government general hospital while developing medical infrastructure.
He sought to remind people that he had sanctioned Rs. 1 crore for the purchase of medical equipment for the general hospital at one time, a first ever move of this sort in the State.
On the other hand, he said that there was a need for an agricultural university, specific to the district, which could look into the problems of the district and provide solutions and direction to development packages like ‘Project Anantha’. This would enable the uplift of the poor from the vicious circle of droughts and debts.

TRS leader holds meeting with Trinamool leaders
","Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) leader Kancherla Keshava Rao met senior leaders of Trinamool Congress (TMC) here on Saturday.
According to sources, the Rajya Sabha MP and other leaders met Trinamool general Mukul Roy, also a Rajya Sabha MP, at a five-star hotel.
While both sides are tight-lipped on the meeting, informed sources told The Hindu that Mr. Rao landed in Kolkata around mid-day “exclusively for his meeting with the second-in-command” of the TMC, Mukul Roy.
Reportedly, the meeting went of well but it was not clear whether the leaders discussed a possible alliance after the election. “We can confirm the meeting but not the content,” said the source, who was present at the meeting.
Keshava Rao, a former APCC chief, resigned from the Congress to join the TRS about a year ago alleging that the Central government was “not too keen” on acceding to the demand for a separate Telangana State.
He became the national secretary of the TRS and was sent to the Rajya Sabha earlier this year.
Mr. Rao is considered extremely close to TRS chief K. Chandrasekar Rao, and his visit to Kolkata is monitored by the political bigwigs of the city with interest.
“That is because Telangana has 17 Lok Sabha seats and according to our information, the TRS is going to bag at least half the seats,” said a senior Congress leader.

‘A.P. split may encourage similar demands’
","The bifurcation of Andhra Pradesh will have a serious impact on the other States where there are similar separatist demands, feels Mohammad Yusuf Tarigami, the State committee secretary of the CPI (M)’s Jammu and Kashmir unit.
The CPI (M) not only opposed the bifurcation tooth and nail, but also cobbled up an alliance for the general elections with Jai Samaikyandhra Party (JSP), founded by former Chief Minister N. Kiran Kumar Reddy. Mr. Reddy is not only pinning hopes on the judiciary to declare the division void, but has also made ‘unification’ his poll plank.
Talking to The Hindu on Saturday, Mr. Tarigami spoke on issues ranging from communalism to regionalism. He squarely blamed the Congress for not exhibiting enough foresight in handling the sensitive issue. It will indeed encourage aspirations in other States, where similar demands are being heard. “A mechanism has to be evolved to address the democratic aspirations of different groups. A word of caution from our side is that the situation should not be allowed to get out of hand,” he pointed out.
Mr. Tarigami said he saw a vast difference between the separatist feelings in Telangana and that which is witnessed in his State. In both the cases, developmental agenda should have been prioritised. He attributed the present situation in J&K to the ‘wrong policies’ of the Union government, while indicating the need to step up efforts to win over people.
Similarly, he sees communal forces emerging to destroy the country’s secular fabric. “A divisive feeling is all-pervasive across the country,” he said, referring to the Sangh Parivar adopting discriminatory policies. “They are not sporadic incidents, but reflections of the divisive mindset,” he warned.

Quarrying, vandalism ruin megalithic site
","Reaching the archaeologically-significant megalithic burial site near Chapparkallu in Devanahalli, about 55 km from Bangalore, is not easy as the area is surrounded by quarries, with the earthmovers throwing up dust. But once there, you see a site, dating back to 8 B.C. to 6 B.C, and protected by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) since 1951, thoroughly vandalised.
The area, better known for supplying granite blocks to Bangalore, is part of an ancient civilisation that existed in the Arkavati basin.
A majority of the subterranean rectangular burial chambers (cists) and Cairn Circle in a eucalyptus grove on a hillock, spread across 6.5 acres of government land, have fallen prey to treasure hunters, while several others have been damaged from quarrying. Pottery and iron fragments of that period are still seen scattered in the opened cists.
The ASI has dashed off letters to the Department of Mines and Geology and the Department of Kannada and Culture to prohibit quarrying and protect the few burial chambers that remain. It has also sent its field officers to assess the damage and take steps to prevent further ruin.
“The destruction of the burial site has been taking place systematically over the years, and now almost all the 50 graves have been vandalised,” said a village resident of Chapparkallu. Quarrying has been under way for over a decade now, he added. “After the ASI realised that the site was being vandalised, they put up boards stating it is protected. But, it hasn’t helped much,” he said, adding that most of the chambers were prised opened in the last five years.
What is even more shocking is that a road has been laid over some burial chambers to enable heavy vehicles to pass through. Meanwhile, an ASI source said: “Some of the burial chambers were vandalised even before it came under ASI protection. The geomorphology of the site, that had remained intact for centuries, started changing suddenly due to urbanisation. However, the site will be fenced to prevent further damage.”

The five friends, who decided to drive because they did not get train tickets, will be joining about 100 AAP volunteers from Bangalore and rest of Karnataka who are already there. “We have all taken leave from work for this campaign,” said Mr. Raju, who co-ordinated campaign in Bommanahalli area ahead of the April 17 polling for the Lok Sabha elections here.
At SewapuriKundan Singh, a bank employee in Bangalore who has taken a two-year break from work, is already campaigning in the Sewapuri Assembly segment in the Varanasi Lok Sabha constituency.
“We are 22 people in my group. We do door-to-door campaign in the morning in this largely rural pocket and do group activities in the evening,” he told The Hindu, and added that most Karnataka volunteers were working in the segment.
Interestingly, some of the candidates who contested in the polls in Karnataka are now campaigning in Varanasi. While writer and former Minister B.T.

Officials love a good drought in Trivandrum
","Do officials, those in local governing bodies and the regional setups of the Kerala Water Authority, in Thiruvananthapuram love a good drought?
As the district slowly begins to feel the heat of an impending drought this year, indications from government files of last year, when Thiruvananthapuram was among the worst-hit districts, are that officials had actually loved the drought, focussing and coming out with a plethora of projects that were termed anti-drought measures, but which in turn barely got implemented or ensured that the impact of the drought was minimised.
The government’s anti-drought preparations had begun as early as January last year, and as time went by, the project reports called for as part of the preparations revealed widespread instances of utter mismanagement of water, supply systems and precious water bodies in the State capital. The response of the local bodies to the situation was enough indication of how things were – with less than 50 of 73 panchayats submitting projects within the deadline – and how things could be this year since the ground situation that “inspired” the projects has hardly changed.
Last year, there were more defunct hand pumps in the district than working ones – a situation that is more or less the same this year as well; a majority of its public open wells and ponds were polluted, again something that is yet to change; and more disturbingly, little was done to address these despite the situation being the same for several years.
According to District Collector Biju Prabhakar, the administration had arranged for enough water tankers to cater to needy areas this year and the decision was that local bodies would not be allowed to use drought relief funds as per their whims and fancies, but only for making provisions for drinking water.
“It is not when the drought is at your doorstep that you think of water supply schemes and projects that can be taken up much earlier. There are instances from last year, when Rs.32 lakh was spent on a water supply scheme, with water yet to reach that place. We won’t allow that this year, with the funds to be given only for drinking water supply,” he told The Hindu, adding that an audit of what was done last year would be done with efforts on to collect data on last year’s project implementation.
Reports suggest that almost all panchayats in the district are in for a tough summer, something that could have been avoided with a little bit of foresight, since it is not water that is absent, but the ways and the will to distribute it efficiently. Project reports submitted last year revealed that panchayats like Vellarada, which had 37 hand pumps, had only five of them operational. In Amboori, just three out of 36 were working while in Vilappilsala, only seven of 25 were functional.
The condition of ponds in every panchayat was pathetic, and remains to be so. Chirayinkeezhu had reported 78 polluted ponds, while Kuttichal had 50 polluted ponds and Kilimanoor 46 ponds that were polluted beyond use. Panavoor had 46 while Vellanadu panchayat had 71 polluted ponds. While some measures were initiated to revive a few of these, the larger picture remains the same, a district panchayat official said.
The condition of overhead water tanks was stated to be satisfactory in most panchayats, but the condition of water pipelines was replete with complaints. According to Mr. Prabhakar, the government and the district administration have decided not to allow repair works of the KWA to be done with drought funds. “Those are works that should be taken up and completed much before the drought. So we will not be allowing drought funds for such works wherever possible,” he said.

RSS following in the footsteps of Hitler: VS
","Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) activists in Kerala are following in the footsteps of Adolf Hitler to kill activists of the Democratic Youth Federation of India, the Students Federation of India, and the Communist Party of India (Marxist), Leader of the Opposition V.S. Achuthanandan has said.
“The murderous face of the RSS was seen by the country during the Gujarat riots of 2002 and the demolition of the Babri Masjid,” he said while inaugurating a dharna organised by the DYFI at the Press Club Maidan here on Saturday to protest against the murder of DYFI leader Sreeraj, allegedly by RSS activists, at Nedumankavu last month.
Mr. Achuthanandan said that neither the Congress not the United Democratic Front government was doing anything to counter the “reign of terror being unleashed by the RSS.” The government seemed to be promoting such activities, he said. Hence the police were lax in properly investigating murder cases in which RSS activists were involved.
He said that the RSS had murdered hundreds of CPI(M) and other Left activists in the State since the 1970s. He called upon people to come forward and jointly oppose the RSS.
Addressing mediapersons at the Press Club, DYFI State president T.V. Rajesh and secretary M. Swaraj alleged that the Union Minister of State for Labour, Kodikunnil Suresh, was protecting the RSS activists involved in the murder of Sreeraj. Those arrested by the police in connection with the murder were not the real culprits, they said.
P.K. Gurudasan, MLA; K.N. Balagopal, MP; and Aisha Potti, MLA; spoke. The dharna which began at 10 a.m. concluded at 5 p.m.

His re-induction has been sanctioned by both the district and State committees of the party. Now, they are waiting formal sanction from the party central committee.
Mr. Murali and 60 party members, including more than a dozen councillors, had left the party and joined hands with the Congress to capture power in the municipality, which was a stronghold of the CPI(M).
As part of his re-induction, Mr. Murali had quit the chairmanship of the municipality to pave way for a party nominee some time back.
During the Lok Sabha election last month, Mr. Murali and the JVS worked for CPI(M) candidate M.B. Rajesh, MP. CPI(M) State secretariat member A.K. Balan on Saturday said the party had considered the request of Mr. Murali for re-induction. There were only some technical formalities to be completed before formally re-inducting Mr. Murali and others who left the party in 2008.
Mr. Murali was suspended from the party on the charge of anti-party activities in 2008. The re-induction of Mr. Murali and his supporters is part of a State-level appeal made by the party to those who had left the CPI(M) to return to the party fold.

","DMK president M. Karunanidhi on Saturday wondered why he was being singled out by Chief Minister Jayalalithaa for the remarks he expressed on the May Day twin blasts on a train at Chennai Central when leaders of various other political parties had also spoken out on the issue.

Manipur hospitals using contaminated water
","Usage of contaminated water in Manipur’s public and private hospitals has sparked concern among people. Disturbing photographs showing private water suppliers’ — on whom these hospitals depend for water requirements — tankers refilling from dirty public drains have appeared in local newspapers.
Sources said the main water pipe meant for Imphal’s Regional Institute of Medical Sciences — which is under the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare — had dried up decades ago since local residents made numerous holes in it to illegally tap water. Villagers near major rivers are not permitting private water
suppliers to use them fearing water shortage. As a result, these suppliers are delivering contaminated drain water at a high price.
Sometimes, surgeries in these hospitals had been put off due to the unavailability of contaminated raw water. Fearing infection and other deadly diseases, some patients had asked hospital authorities to allow them to buy bottled water, which was turned down by the latter.
In Manipur, all water supply schemes had been closed down some months back due to the lack of water sources. The Public Health Engineering Department had failed to translate into action the ambitious plan to distribute lake water to people. The department had submitted the action plan to the Chief Minister Okram Ibobi Singh. It said, inter alia, three water tankers shall be pressed into service in each of the 60 Assembly constituencies. Perhaps the Chief Minister is of the view that this will create more problems than solving the existing ones since 3 water tankers cannot supply water to the people of a constituency.
Showers in Manipur in the past few days have perhaps come as a silver lining. However, these are too sporadic to be of any relief to the people.

UPA welfare laws will go if BJP comes to power, says Rahul

“I have information that they intend to abolish the legislation on food security and employment guarantee,” Mr. Gandhi said addressing a rally in his constituency, Amethi.
Resuming his attack on BJP’s prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi, Mr. Gandhi said the Gujarat Chief Minister’s development model was limited to one or two industrialists, in a reference to Mr. Modi’s proximity to corporate giant Adani.
While Mr. Modi in a rally in Badohi flayed the Congress for neglecting the interests of farmers, Mr. Gandhi said farmers in Gujarat were being deprived of their land and compelled to flee to other States.
“Modi didn't ask the farmers even once before giving away their land to Adani. Some of the farmers met me and narrated their woes. We fought for Bhatta Parsaul, which led to the enactment of the land acquisition law,” he said.
Elaborating on the welfare steps taken by the UPA regime, Mr. Gandhi said his government had waived Rs 70,000 crore in farmers’ loans even as Mr. Modi distributed land worth Rs 40,000 crore to Adani.
Mr. Gandhi who held a roadshow in his constituency with his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, who has been actively campaigning for him, also tried to strike a chord with women.
While raking up ‘snoopgate,’ Mr. Gandhi flayed Mr. Modi for his double standards on women. Even as the police in Gujarat tap phones of women and harass them, Mr. Modi spoke about empowering women, Mr. Gandhi said. “He should learn to respect women.”

Delhi Metro to construct underpass
","The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation has now been asked by the Delhi Government’s Public Works Department to construct an underpass for traffic on Benito Juarez Marg that will enable a right turn towards Ring Road and also towards San Martin Marg on the other side of Ring Road.
“The design is being worked out. Since the Delhi Metro has already constructed overground and laid the foundation, we will ask them to construct the underpass as well,” said a senior PWD official.
The tendering for the project will commence after May 16 when the model code of conduct will no longer be in force.
The underpass will cross the entire stretch of the road with two ramps on both sides, said the official, one leading towards Jesus & Mary College and one towards the Ring Road. The proposal for the underpass was put forward to decongest the Rao Tula Ram Marg and Dhaula Kuan and to fully utilise the Benito Juarez Marg for traffic coming from the airport and National Highway-8. So far a right turn was not provided to go towards Moti Bagh and New Delhi.
The proposal for the underpass has been previously screened and passed by both the Unified Traffic and Transportation (Planning and Engineering) Centre (UTTIPEC) and the Delhi Urban Arts Commission. The last governing body of the UTTIPEC also saw representatives from the PWD, the Traffic Police and the Delhi Metro participate.
The proposed underpass is part of a long term measure to improve traffic flow on RTR Marg that also includes construction of a three-lane flyover parallel to the RTR flyover that will extend the existing Munirka flyover by a kilometre.
In March this year, the Delhi Government had granted the sanction for the project.

Hibi blames corporation for Metro delay and traffic snarls
","The war of words between Congress leaders over the delay in the Kochi Metro Rail construction and development of related infrastructure intensified when Hibi Eden, MLA, accused the Kochi Corporation of not being proactive in fulfilling its role in the timely completion of the prestigious project.
Kochi Mayor Tony Chammany, who recently shot off a letter to Chief Minister Oommen Chandy stating that he was upset over the tardy pace of works on the Kochi Metro Rail project, lost no time to hit back by saying that Mr. Hibi Eden seemed to be settling personal scores by raising baseless allegations against him on the Metro Rail issue. 
The Mayor also reiterated that he had only pointed out certain facts regarding the need to remove the existing bottlenecks in the Metro Rail project. 
Mr. Eden had blamed the local body for its failure to complete its major road projects, including the Atlantis rail overbridge and Thammanam-Pullepady Road. The government had made all efforts to clear various hurdles, including the vexed issue of land acquisition, aimed at the smooth and timely completion of the Metro Rail project, he said. 
Mr. Eden said the government had already sanctioned Rs. 25 crore for the widening of the Thammanam-Pullepady Raod but the corporation could not ensure the time-bound completion of the project that would have eased the traffic snarls in the city. He said the government had also sanctioned Rs. 19 crore for developing 22 roads under the Kochi Corporation. 
The MLA urged the Kochi Corporation authorities to step up pressure on the State government and relevant agencies to increase funding for various road projects rather than complaining over the lack of support from the State government for city's development.
Mr. Eden said a meeting of elected representatives would be held at Thiruvananthapuram on May 7 to resolve various issues related to the Kochi Metro Rail. He praised the Kochi Metro Rail Ltd for trying its best to ensure the timely completion of the project. 
Referring to the differences between the Mayor and the Chairman of the Greater Cochin Development Authority over the laser show project at Rajendra Maidan, Mr. Eden said it was a viable initiative that should be supported. He requested the local body to speed up necessary clearances for the project.

Ganababu, Ratnakar racing neck and neck
","Visakhapatnam West Assembly segment has gained a lot of attention with P.V.G.R. Naidu (Ganababu), former MLA and son of former MP and Telugu Desam leader P. Appala Narasimham and Dadi Ratnakar, youngest son of YSR Congress leader Dadi Veerbhadra Rao, who till recently was an important leader of the Telugu Desam, being locked in the contest.
Though there are 12 candidates in the fray, including Pedada Ramani Kumari of Congress, two-time corporator Botta Eswaramma of CPI (M), candidates from Lok Satta, AAP, BSP, Jai Samaikyandhra Party, and only two independents, the contest is mainly between TD-BJP combined candidate Mr. Ganababu and Mr. Ratnakar. Both belong to the Gavara community. Mr. Ganababu lays stress on the point that he is the local and can serve people well.
Mr. Ganababu was elected on the TDP ticket in 1999 from the Pendurthi segment and contested again on the Praja Rajyam ticket from Visakha West, which was one of the segments formed out of Pendurthi in 2009 after delimitation of constituencies but lost by a narrow margin to Malla Vijaya Prasad of the Congress. He returned to the Telugu Desam during late 2011.
Mr. Ratnakar was rural in-charge of TDP before his father, former TD MLA of Anakapalle decided to join the YSR Congress last year. Mr. Vijaya Prasad, YSR Congress city unit president, is working for the success of Mr. Ratnakar.
Interestingly the two contesting candidates are closely related. Ratnakar’s mother is first cousin of Ganababu and the YSRC candidate is asserting his status as local saying that he was born in Visakhapatnam and his family has properties here and has a lot of relatives in the area.
This constituency has a rare mix of poor, affluent and people speaking different languages, thanks to the residential quarters of the Navy personnel, employees of various major public and private sector industries. One part is Gopalapatnam, Kancharapalem, Gnanapuram and others areas and the far-away Sriharipuram and industrial area, Nausena Baugh and other Naval areas including the residential quarters atop Dolphin’s Nose hill. Mr. Ganababu terms this segment as a mini-India and pinned a lot of hopes on the non-Telugu speaking voters who support BJP prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi. Contacts with every area of the constituency and his sports activities (he was also international volleyball player and chairman of the District Volleyball Association) would fetch him votes, Mr. Ganababu feels.
Mr. Ratnakar, on the other hand, is confident of getting support from the slum voters who constitute 40 per cent of the 2.26 lakh voters, the 4,000 Christians, SCs and Muslims. His father has positioned himself in Sriharipuram area and is conducting a vigorous campaign.
The constituency has many issues pending for long. Hundreds have constructed houses on the Simhachalam Devasthanam lands and the houses are not regularised. With the NAD junction to Pendurthi road choked with traffic, a parallel road was laid but it was not connected to the National Highway due to NSTL not allowing it to run through its premises. House pattas are not given to those living on the hill slopes. A flyover at NAD junction is needed and another over the rail track on the Gopalapatnam-Kothapalem road. Pollution, particularly in the industrial area, is a major problem and drinking water is in short supply.

Reject BJP-TDP alliance, YSRC: Medha
","Social activist Medha Patkar on Saturday termed BJP-TDP alliance ‘unholy’ and YSR Congress as ‘corrupt and criminal’ and appealed to the voters of Seemandhra to reject them.
Speaking to reporters after garlanding the statue of Mahatma Gandhi near GVMC, Ms. Patkar, who is in fray for Mumbai North East Lok Sabha seat, had a dig at the National Democratic Alliance’s prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi and YSRC president Y.S. Jaganmohan Reddy.
She said Mr. Modi’s high-voltage election propaganda was being funded by corporates like Adanis and alleged that even the Ambani brothers were moving close to him. “Mr. Modi stands for crony capitalism,” she said.
Describing TDP president N. Chandrababu Naidu as an ‘opportunist,’ she said he used to be the blue-eyed boy of the World Bank during his nine-year term as the Chief Minister.
Ms. Patkar said Mr. Jaganmohan Reddy was a land-grabber and known for indulging in several corrupt deals when his father late Rajasekhara Reddy was the Chief Minister.
She said AAP had fielded candidates without money and muscle power as it wanted to live up to the expectation of common man. “We want to bring some difference to the country’s polity by cleansing the system,” she said before visiting some slums in the city.
Ms. Patkar promised to regularise slums, scrap Petroleum, Chemical and Petrochemical Investment Region (PCPIR) between Visakhapatnam and Kakinada and take steps to contain industrial pollution in and around the city.

Manda Krishna asks people to throw out UPA government
","Justice to the downtrodden sections of society is possible only under the NDA regime and people should vote out UPA government, Manda Krishna Madiga said.
Addressing mediapersons here on Saturday, Mr. Krishna Madiga said he and his community would support BJP nominee for Visakhapatnam Lok Sabha K Haribabu and the NDA across the country. In the State they would support the TDP-BJP-Jana Sena alliance, he said.
Minister in Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy government M Mareppa, who quit the YSRC, joined the BJP along with former IAS officer Rosaiah on the occasion.
Mr. Mareppa said YSRC president Jaganmohan Reddy had a ‘use and throw’ policy which was evident in the way he dumped a number of YSRC loyalists. Only those who have money have been given tickets by the YSRC, he added. He lashed out at Vijayamma saying that she could only read out a written script and could not be expected to do justice to the people who elected her.
Entry of Mr. Mareppa would strengthen the BJP, Mr. Haribabu said and asked him to work for the victory of the NDA in the elections.
Later, Mr. Krishna Madiga called on BJP candidate for Visakha North Assembly segment P. Vishnu kumar Raju and said he was impressed with the honesty and simplicity of the person. He urged everyone to vote for him and help the BJP throw out the Congress-led UPA government at the Centre.

Venkaiah sure of clear majority for NDA
","Emphasising that BJP has always been clear on its stand on Telangana, senior party leader M. Venkaiah Naidu said the other parties have kept quiet in Parliament and only BJP saw to it that the interests of Seemandhra are protected.
Addressing a press conference here on Sunday, he shot off questions to YSRC countering its charge that Congress, BJP and TDP were responsible for bifurcation.
He said in 2004 Congress tied up with TRS, and TRS was a coalition partner in the governments of Congress at the Centre and the State, Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy had sent a delegation of 40 MLAs to the then NDA government to create Telangana and later in the Assembly he had committed himself to the creation of Telangana and YSRC also stated that the State should be divided as per Article 3.
Lambasting YSRC, Mr. Naidu said, “we are not the accused, you’re the accused.”
In the post-election scenario, KCR and Congress would come together in Telangana, the BJP leader said citing the Congress extending support to Aam Aadmi Party in New Delhi. On Y. S. Jagamohan Reddy’s reported statement that he would extend to any government at the Centre, he said, “We are getting clear majority. We do not need anybody’s support.”
Where is the sentiment?” he asked answering a question on why this election would be fought on development plank since all the poll battles since 1983 centred on emotion or welfare measures. However, everybody was concerned about development since it was centred round Hyderabad till now.
He wanted the Election Commission to work better to further check the distribution of money and cheap liquor and to act against the Central Minister who described BJP prime ministerial nominee as “monster.”
Andhra Pradesh BJP president and party Lok Sabha nominee K. Haribabu, party leaders D.V. Subba Rao, Bandaru Ranga Mohana Rao and Avinash Kohli were present.

Toll collection stopped at Sadahalli Gate, but only briefly
","Toll collection at Sadahalli Gate on National Highway 7 was disrupted briefly on Tuesday, as activists of BJP and Karnataka Rakshana Vedike staged protests at the toll plaza against the nearly four-fold hike in rates.
However, police ensured two-way traffic flow through two gates on the left. Police were deployed in huge numbers on the third consecutive day of protests.
Former Deputy Chief Minister R. Ashok, who led the BJP activists, alleged that the State government had colluded with the private company authorised to collect toll. He further alleged that the company was scuttling free passage of local villagers and demanded a toll-free service road.
He claimed to have stopped the company from collecting toll when he was in the government on the grounds that the project was yet to be completed.
Narayana Gowda, vedike president, told the State government to roll back the hike in 24 hours. He warned that the vedike would pull down all toll booths, like in neighbouring Maharashtra, if there is no roll back.
About 400 protesters, including R. Ashok, B.N. Bachegowda from the BJP and T.A. Narayana Gowda from the vedike, were arrested and later released.
Less than half an hour after the protesters were cleared, the toll collection resumed, leaving the road users and cab drivers sceptical of the effectiveness of the protests.
Arvind Kumar, a commuter who had been to the airport, said, “The protests are an act for the media. In a few days, people will soon get used to the new rates.”

Protest against ‘pankthi beda’ in temples
","Hundreds of protesters gathered here in the city on Tuesday to stage a demonstration against caste-based segregation in serving of food (pankthi beda) at Kukkesubramanya, Udupi Math and other religious places.
The protest, organised by the Communist Party of India (Marxist), had support from various labour unions including that of autorickshaw drivers in the city.
The party’s zonal member of Bangalore District, B.M. Raghu, said the protesters demanded a law against such “superstitious beliefs”.
“We condemn the caste discrimination and demand that action be initiated against such temples that follow such beliefs. It is an affront to human dignity,” he said. The protesters will hold a bigger protest, with many labour unions participating, in the city on Thursday near Anand Rao Circle.

Minister takes BBMP to task over garbage clearance
","Transport Minister Ramalinga Reddy, who is also the district-in-charge Minister for Bangalore, cracked the whip on BBMP officials for mismanagement of solid waste disposal. Chairing a review meeting on Monday, Mr. Reddy gave them a fortnight to clear garbage in the city or face suspension.
Joint Commissioners of eight zones of the BBMP, chief engineers and senior officials participated in the meeting.
Speaking to The Hindu after the meeting, Mr. Reddy said two issues were being dealt with as top priority: roads and garbage. “While road works have been going on, garbage clearance and disposal has not been happening effectively. Bills in the name of waste management are being generated, but no work seems to be happening,” he said.
Mr. Reddy also raised the issue of implementation of the ban on plastic less than 40 microns. “We have observed that plastic forms more than 50 per cent of the garbage. Plastic below 40 microns are still being used. I have directed officials to close the factories of manufacturers, stop the inflow of such plastic from outside Karnataka and cancel licence of malls or shops that are giving out the banned variety of plastic,” he said.
The Minister is also said to have taken to task officials who have been using elections as an excuse to not do their duties. Officials said the Minister also directed the health and engineering departments to coordinate regarding waste segregation.
The matter of BVG, the company entrusted with waste management in Yelahanka zone, cropped up during the meeting. Though the civic agency paid Rs. 24 crore to the company, it later slapped a fine of Rs. 1.25 crore for not doing the work well. However, BVG is said to have got a stay order due to which the civic body cannot call off the contract, officials informed the Minister.

“… we seek or make no difference between us and the Gujarati community of Mumbai and neither endorse such views by anyone as those of the party or the leadership.”
The editorial on Thursday lashed out at Gujarati traders for not participating in Maharashtra Day celebrations on May 1 and accused them of exploiting the city for personal gain.

Urging women in the IT sector to ‘take charge’
","“It is important that women are networked. This catharsis of sharing and learning can be a good enabling agent,” said Jayanti Ravi, commissioner, higher education, Government of Gujarat, speaking at the eighth anniversary celebrations of Empowering Women in IT (eWIT) on Monday.
The theme for the afternoon was to encourage more women in the industry to ‘ascend and take charge’. eWIT, run by women IT professionals, was founded in 2006 as a platform to represent, discuss and voice challenges faced by women in the IT industry and to facilitate growth of women in the industry.
They have 20 large companies as members, apart from individual members and smaller companies, according to them.
“Though there are many women in IT companies, not many are found in leadership positions. Good family support and infrastructural support can make a huge difference,” said Rama Sivaraman, president, eWIT, and chief delivery assurance officer, Polaris.
Sujith Kumar, location HR lead, Infosys, Chennai, said that working couples setting goals collectively could solve a lot of problems. He urged women to explore positions that are off the beaten track. “Close to 24 per cent IT companies do not have technology architects who are women,” he said.
C.N. Ram, co-founder, Rural Shores, noted that “male bastions are fast crumbling”, and raised a question on the response to the change.
He said that they started BPOs in villages targeting educated rural youth and around 45 per cent of their staff was women. “Empowerment of women is happening at an alarming rate,” he said.

Study charts a path for pedestrian facilities
","Any city to be called a developed city should not only have better road infrastructure for vehicles but should also be well-designed with accessible footpaths for pedestrians.
As the city’s vehicular population is burgeoning, the focus of the Chennai Corporation seems to have been on easing the traffic flow by increasing the width of roads. However, this development has meant that pedestrian space is compromised: the city’s footpaths seem to suffer from deficiencies in terms of design.
The Institute for Transportation and Development Policy (ITDP) has come out with an updated reference guide for footpath design standards, complimenting the IRC Guidelines.
The study, prepared by Advait Jani and Christopher Kost, has prepared a model footpath divided into frontage, pedestrian and furniture zones with different paths marked out for three different zones: residential, commercial and high-intensity commercial. The study prescribes that footpaths have a minimum width of 1.8 metres in residential areas and 2.5 metres in commercial areas.
The study, while describing the height and surface that need to be maintained for the footpath in each zone, has recommended that guide tiles be installed to assist persons with vision impairments. The footpath design shows that pedestrians, hawkers and commercial establishments could co-exist without any conflict by accommodating the hawkers in the pedestrian zone and earmarking structures that prove to be footpath impediments, including utility boxes, streetlights, manholes and trees, in the furniture zone.
The research on street design was done as part of ITDP’s ‘Better Streets, Better Cities: A Guide to Street Design in Urban India’, and is available at www.itdp.org/betterstreets.

Have you ever raised your hand to catch the railing on an MTC bus and found it broken, or jumped up from your seat as a nail poked you?
Many MTC passengers have for years raised complaints about poorly maintained MTC buses, but their woes have fallen on deaf ears.
There are nearly 3,500 MTC buses plying the city, serving lakhs of commuters. There are over 700 express buses, over 1,000 deluxe buses and nearly 100 Volvo buses. These have been purchased at a huge cost. But sadly, their maintenance has been found lacking.
“In most buses the handles on the railing are broken, the seats rickety and the buses dirty. It is with utmost care that we have to stand on the steps as many of them have developed cracks,” says M. Vijayakumar, a commuter.
Many who commute by the air-conditioned buses say there are cracks in the flooring. “This is because the chassis is low and gets damaged frequently. The maintenance of these buses has to be regular. Many passengers have complained that the cooling effect is poor,” a conductor of an MTC Volvo bus points out.
Many passengers point out that in many buses the driver’s seat is rickety. “This can lead to accidents. Besides, there is a lot of garbage in the bus and the MTC seems to be least bothered,” a retired MTC senior official says.

Teaching teachers laws on child protection and rights
","What place do the nuances of law have in the classrooms? With cases of corporal punishment and child abuse being reported in schools, teachers on Monday took stock of the situation beyond the syllabus.
A State-level teachers’ sensitisation programme on child rights and child protection, organised on Monday by the Directorate of School Education and the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) recommended that teachers become conversant with laws that govern rights of the children.
The initiative was to bring teachers and principals of schools up-to-date on two principal laws- the Protection of Children from Sexual Offence (POCSO) 2013 and section 17 of the Right to Free and Compulsory Education Act (RTE) which deals with ‘physical punishment or mental harassment,’ said E. Vallavan, Director, School Education.
The NCPCR, formed in 2007, monitors the implementation of the RTE and POCSO Acts. But teachers have a role in ensuring child rights, according to Asheem Srivastav, member-secretary, NCPCR.
“It is important for every person who is implementing the law at the ground level to be conversant with the nitty-gritty of the Acts,” he said, explaining the need for sensitisation.
The debate on child rights is gaining weight in the international arena. India is a signatory to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.
Noting that the Education Department had issued a “strict circular” to government and private schools on corporal punishment, Mr. Vallavan added that the scenario in schools has changed.
“Two out of three cases are of children being subjected to mental harassment. It is not to say that physical punishment is not upsetting, but mental harassment can have a more severe impact on a child.”
This is more in the case when the children hail from single-parent families or suffering from a disability or disorder including dyslexia and other learning disabilities.
Encouraging teachers to adopt a friendly approach to students, Mr. Vallavan said awareness of laws can create a shift in attitude towards children.
Principals of schools in the Union Territory have received training in psychological handling of children, under the aegis of the Indian School Pyschology Association, he added.
Teachers must realise that the future GDP and prosperity of the country rests with children, noted Mr. Srivastav.
Panel discussions and sessions on child abuse and child rights were part of the event.

Just one foot more, Veeranam to be full
","The Veeranam tank is just less than one foot short of attaining its full capacity owing to the recent spell of rain and the forethought of the authorities to bring water from the Lower Anicut through the Vadavar to the tank.
As the water level in the tank has reached almost its brim, it has brought cheers to the ayacutdars and Chennai residents. As the storage in the tank has reached a comfortable level it could sustain the 77 cusecs supply to Chennai to partly meet the metropolis’ drinking water requirements during the summer.
As on Monday, the water level in the tank stood at 46.15ft against the full capacity of 47.5ft. With the inflow pegged at 1,400 cusecs the tank is expected to get filled up soon.
It may be noted that to ensure uninterrupted water supply to Chennai the authorities had started releasing 5,200 cusecs from the Mettur Dam to the Coleroon and then to the Lower Anicut. From the Lower Anicut the feeder canal Vadavar is carrying water to the tank. The realisation at the Veeranam from this source had been in the order of 1,200 cusecs. With the good rainfall in the catchment areas the inflow into the tank rose to 1,400 cusecs on Monday.
The tank, a sprawling water expanse as it is, would replenish the groundwater to an appreciable extent. The farmers feel elated as it is a rare sight for them to see the tank full during summer months.
If the wet spell continues and if the Mettur Dam also gets its due share from Karnataka the seasonal water release could be possible in June as usual and it would certainly revive agriculture to its past glory in this tail-end delta region.
However, president of the Kollidam — Keelanai Paasana Vivasayigal Sangham P. Vinayagamoorthy in a representation to Chief Minister Jayalalithaa has sought the release of water from the Veeranam tank to fill up the ponds in the surrounding areas.
Mr. Vinayagamoorthy has stated that because of the deficit rainfall for the past two years the ponds and lakes in Cuddalore district have become dry. Hence, the villagers have been facing water scarcity.
Drinking water shortage has affected both human and cattle heads. Therefore, Mr. Vinayagamoorthy has appealed to the Chief Minister to release water from the tank, at least for two days, to fill up the ponds.
As on Monday Cuddalore district received a rainfall of 411.90 as against the average of 19.61mm. for the season. Annamalai Nagar recorded the highest rainfall of 51mm followed by Chidambaram and Kothavacheri — 49mm each, Vriddhachalam — 48.30mm, Kattumannarkoil — 46mm, Lalpet — 36mm, Bhuvanagiri — 28mm, Sethiathope — 24.20mm, Parangipettai — 24mm, Cuddalore — 16.40mm and Sri Mushnam — 15mm.
In Villupuram district Tindivanam recorded highest rainfall for the day of 40mm followed by Marakkanam — 20mm, Vanur — 19mm, Ulundurpet — 11mm and Villupuram — 3mm.

Mullaperiyar: Kerala government to file review petition
","Kerala government will file a review petition against the

The Chief Minister told the media after a discussion on the verdict in the Cabinet that Supreme Court did not give due consideration to the issues raised by the State regarding the safety of the dam.
Mr. Chandy said that Kerala had enacted the Irrigation and Water Conservation (Amendment) Act, 2006, which was struck down by the Court, not to deny water to Tamil Nadu; but to address concerns about failure of the 119-year-old dam.
He said that the government had done all that was required to argue the case well before the Court in consultation with all political parties. It also had the support of all. It would be convening another all-party meet to discuss the defeat and chart out future course of action.
Referring the call for hartal in protest against the verdict, the Chief Minister urged all to show restraint. Steps would be taken to address the concerns of the people.
He said that the Cabinet had finalised the action plan for the remaining term of the government. This would be announced on Thursday. The proposal for hiking bus fares were not taken up because it had to discuss the Mullaperiyar verdict and the action plan.
Replying to a question, Mr. Chandy said that attempts were on to scuttle the plan for development of port at Vizhinjam by some quarters. However, the project would be realised and the government was confident about that.

Mullaperiyar: The continuing saga
","The >safety of the Mullaperiyar dam in Idukki district of Kerala has been a concern for the state for long. Even as early as 1979, the then Chief Minister C H Mohammed Koya  had told reporters that the state government was aware of the need to strengthen the Mullaperiyar dam at Thekkady at that time under the administrative control of  the Tamil Nadu government. The CM's response came when he was quizzed about the chance of a Morvi-type (In 1979, Morvi, a town in Gujarat was flooded because of the collapse of a dam on Machchu river) tragedy happening to the Mullaperiyar dam, which was built in 1895. The matter has been the subject of many letters exchanged between the Central Water and Power Commission and Kerala from the mid-sixties.

>In October 1979, Mr. Koya told the State Assembly that he had written to the Union Agriculture and Irrigation Minister to direct the Central Water and Power Commission and the Tamil Nadu government to take steps to strengthen  the Mullaperiyar dam. The Commission had directed the Tamil Nadu Government to keep the water level in the reservoir at 145 feet and ""if the level rose beyond two feet, it should be brought down to 145 feet within 24 hours"".
While >ruling out any ïmminent danger ""to the dam, a spokesperson of the Union Agriculture and Irrigation Ministry had pointed out that ""while designing the Periyar dam, the conventional uplift forces had not been taken into account resulting in some tension under full reservoir conditions"".

Quibble over ""seepage""and ""Leakage""

The cause of apprehension among some sections is because of the perception regarding seepage and leakage, as per a report published in this paper during the late seventies.
Under modern building conditions, dams are provided with seepage galleries within, where the seepage is pumped out after testing. But in the Periyar dam, the seepage is visible and hence the anxiety.

Bandh in Kerala on Thursday over Mullaperiyar
","The Mullaperiyar Action Council has called a dawn-to-dusk hartal across Kerala on Thursday following the Supreme Court's decision to permit Tamil Nadu to raise the water level in the Mullaperiyar dam to 142 feet and its declaration of the Kerala Irrigation and Water Conservation (Amendment) Act of 2006 unconstitutional.
No political party has so far come out in support of the hartal call, but almost the entire political spectrum in the State has expressed shock and dismay at the Supreme Court verdict. There was a spontaneous gathering of people at Chappath, the venue of the Mullaperiyar Dam stir in Idukki district, and the Action Council leaders told reporters that they would resume their agitation with renewed vigour in the light of the Supreme Court verdict.
Chief Minister Oommen Chandy was cautious in his response to the verdict and told reporters in Thiruvananthapuram that the government would continue to pursue measures aimed at ensuring safety of the life and property of the people of the State after studying the text of the verdict.
Water Resources Minister P.J. Joseph told reporters that the government would explore possibilities for filing a review petition in the Supreme Court.
Leader of the Opposition V.S. Achuthanandan accused the State government of having failed to convince the Central government and the about the anxieties of the people of Kerala about the safety of the present dam and called for an urgent session of the Kerala Assembly to discuss the way forward.
Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) president V.M. Sudheeran termed the verdict a 'severe blow' for Kerala while Home Minister Ramesh Chennithala said it was 'shocking'.

Minister for Revenue Adoor Prakash told reporters here on Tuesday that the estimated total loss during April and May was Rs. 70 crore, according to preliminary estimates.
The Minister said he along with the Principal Secretary (Revenue) would submit a memorandum to the Centre in Delhi on Wednesday seeking funds to compensate the losses.
The Minister said 20 persons had died in natural calamities since April 1. The majority of them had died after being struck by lightning. As many as 280 houses had been destroyed, while about 1,000 houses had suffered major damages. Four-thousand houses had suffered minor damages.

Excess rainfall

The State had so far received 367 per cent excess rainfall this summer. The worst damage was reported in Thiruvananthapuram, followed by Thrissur. Loss of agriculture crops amounted to Rs. 12 crore.
Mr. Prakash said the Centre had so far declined to provide funds to compensate deaths from lightning despite repeated requests by the State in the past. However, it had agreed to consider damages from sea erosion for assistance.

Control rooms

He said heavy rain was continuing in south Kerala and the losses were mounting. The government had opened a control room to coordinate relief work. The control room can be reached on phone: (471) 2331639. District Collectors had been told to coordinate relief activities and ensure that hospitals were prepared to handle emergencies.

Ahads plans Japan-aided project in Wayanad
","The Attappady Hill Area Development Society (Ahads), which has been converted as the Centre for Comprehensive Participatory Resource Management (CCPRM) by the government recently, will implement a Japan-aided ‘comprehensive environmental conservation and community development project’ in Wayanad from January next year.
Project director of the CCPRM N.C. Induchoodan told The Hindu here on Tuesday that of the project estimate of Rs.690 crore, Rs.225 crore had been earmarked for agrarian relief projects. Farmers in Wayanad were in dire straits and suicide by farmers had been reported from the district, he said.
Mr. Induchoodan said the project had got sanction from the Central and State governments. The Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), which funded the Rs.219-crore Attappady Wasteland Comprehensive Environment Conservation Project implemented by Ahads, had offered financial assistance for the project.
He said Wayanad was a developmental paradox in the sense that it remained the most backward district in Kerala with respect to several human development indices, especially among the BPL communities.
The project’s aim was to enhance livelihood security of the tribal communities and the Below Poverty Line (BPL) sections. These sections would capacitate and organise in planning, implementation, and monitoring of a participatory and integrated area development programme, leading to improved human development indices in an ecologically sustainable, socially enabling, and culturally vibrant environment, Mr. Induchoodan said.
Mr. Induchoodan said Wayanad was a complex but veritable landscape unique in geophysical, biological, socio-economic, and cultural attributes. Ecologically, it was unparalleled in the world and known for globally significant biodiversity.
“It provides immense ecosystem goods and services, particularly being the catchment of the Cauvery that is crucial for the drinking and irrigation water supply for about six crore people in few districts of Kerala and Karnataka. This region has strong eco-cultural affinities, being the abode of several aboriginal communities that have developed strong cultural and livelihood adaptation strategies based on natural resources,” he said.
He said the project would be implemented in 10 years.
An amount of Rs.105.80 crore would be spent for eco-restoration, augmentation of natural resources, and protection of river basins; Rs.65 crore for housing development; Rs.96 crore for roads, bridges, drinking water, and energy conservation; Rs.92 crore for heath care, sanitation, education, and infrastructure development; and Rs.47 crore for human resources development.

The town relies on the KWA to meet its drinking water requirements. Various organisations and citizens’ groups had protested against the supply of saline water by the KWA from a makeshift check-dam at Bavikara. The KWA cited tidal action during the month as reason for the saline infusion.
The KWA water had 1,250-mg salinity, as per studies, and various organisations had staged demonstration in front of the KWA office here accusing the government machinery of failing to complete the Rs.8.20-crore check-dam at Bavikara. The project was conceived over three decades ago.
The work got stuck midway due to technical reasons and the Minor Irrigation Department, tasked with the construction, submitted a fresh proposal to the Water Resources Department on April 25. The cost was put at Rs.11.05 crore and it was awaiting nod, KWA Executive Engineer K.R. Venugopalan told The Hindu.
If sanctioned, the department would be able to complete the work by June next, he said. The stalled work could have been completed before this monsoon had the department received timely direction from the higher authorities, he said.
A senior official of the Groundwater Department disagreed with the idea of constructing a check-dam as a solution to drinking water problems.
Long-term plans, including curbs on crusher-stone units, were required. Bore-wells should not be allowed as it allows no time for replenishment of the water table, he said. The water table was now down by over a metre, the highest ever recorded in the district, he said.
There was an urgent need to accord top priority to groundwater replenishment activities. Rainwater harvesting units should be set up on the premises of houses, government offices, parks, playgrounds, and schools, he said.
The building bylaw of the Kasargod municipality mandates the setting up of such units in all houses, he added.

NHAI drops two road projects
","The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) has ‘omitted’ the 172-km Kazhakuttam-Cherthala and 111.73-km Edappally-Kuttipuram NH stretches from the National Highway Development Project (NHDP). The roads were to be developed into four-lane carriageways.
The government was aware of the notification issued by ‘omitting’ the stretches, though the official letter was yet to be received from the Union Ministry of Road Transport and Highways, official sources told The Hindu.
Uncertainty prevailed over the development of the 318-km Thalapady-Kuttipuram NH stretch which the NHAI had proposed to develop in three reaches.
The delay in acquiring and handing over the land needed, opposition from people, and a lack of consensus on the width of the carriageway were the reasons for the NHAI decision, sources said.
The NHAI had been demanding the handing over of the entire land in these stretches for taking up the work.
The authority had also hinted that it would withdraw from the project if the width of the carriageway was reduced to 30 metre in the State. With the omission, the NHDP works in the State would now be confined to the development of the stretches, namely, Walayar-Wadakkancherry (55 km), Wadakkancherry-Mannuthy (22 km), and Kazhakuttam-Inchivila (43 km). Of these, work had started on the first two stretches. The NHAI had tendered work on the four-laning of the Kazhakuttom-Inchivila bypass up to Mukkola.
Minister for Works V.K. Ebrahim Kunju told The Hindu that the government would not go back on the development of the NH stretches and was committed to decongesting the roads. A meeting, to be chaired by Chief Minister Oommen Chandy and attended by his Cabinet colleagues and top officials, would be held on May 14 to discuss the issue, Mr. Kunju said.
The PWD had worked out a strategy to take up the development of the NH and it would be tabled at the meeting, sources said.
The Kazhakuttam-Cherthala and Edappally-Kuttipuram stretches respectively came under the 669-km NH-66 from Thalapady to Kaliyikkavila and the 160-km NH-544 from Walayar to Edappally.

Row between Sudheeran, Shanimol Usman snowballs
",": The row between Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) president V.M. Sudheeran and the former All India Congress Committee (AICC) secretary Shanimol Usman appeared to have snowballed with several party leaders expressing divergent opinions on Tuesday.
The opinions ranged from advisory by senior party leaders to shun controversies to clear positions supporting either Mr. Sudheeran or Ms. Shanimol Usman.
Minister for Home Ramesh Chennithala was the first to urge party leaders to keep off controversies and avoid hurting the sentiments of ordinary workers who were eagerly awaiting a positive result for the United Democratic Front (UDF) in the Lok Sabha polls. UDF convener P P Thankachan said the leaders had every right to raise issues within reasonable limits in party forums, but he was opposed to deliberate media leaks of discussions in such forums.
Besides, each member could approach the party high command for redressal of their grievances, he said.
The former KPCC president K Muraleedharan batted in favour of Mr. Sudheeran, stating that attempts to destabilise the KPCC president would not be taken lightly. He said the members should be under no delusion that they could raise any kind of issue in party forums.
Allegations against leaders should be substantiated by evidence, he said.
Alappuzha District Congress Committee president A A Shukoor continued to oppose Ms. Shanimol Usman in more harsh tones.
He said she had become a tool in the hands of the liquor lobby.
The main point of debate among senior leaders was whether a party leader could be prevented from expressing opinions in a party forum. There is also a section that feels that Mr. Sudheeran had overacted to the entire issue. Had he chosen to ignore Ms. Shanimol Usman’s statements, the matter would have ended there.
However, the KPCC president chose to link the entire episode to his opposition to the proliferation of liquor dens and criticism against him from what he called “unexpected quarters” for the stand.

Animal rights bodies welcome ‘Jallikattu’ ban
","Animal welfare bodies, led by the city-based Blue Cross of India, welcomed the Supreme Court judgment on Wednesday banning the use of bulls in ‘Jallikattu,’ a traditional bull-taming festival of Tamil Nadu, and other forms of entertainment.
The judgment “… will go down in the history of India as a landmark verdict by the Supreme Court to ban the use of bulls for entertainment,” said Nanditha Krishna, governing-body member of Blue Cross and environment activist, who has been working over the years for humane treatment of animals. The ban will be applicable to Rekla (bullock cart) and horse-and-bull races too, among many.
Commending those who worked for years to achieve this verdict, including the Animal Welfare Board of India (AWBI), Ms. Krishna, in her statement, thanked former Union Minister for Environment and Forests Jairam Ramesh for “banning the use of bulls as performing animals in 2011.” But then, the Tamil Nadu government sought to permit ‘Jallikattu’ through the Tamil Nadu Jallikattu Regulation Act, 2009. Earlier this year, the Environment Ministry withdrew its own Gazette notification through an affidavit in the Supreme Court.
“The AWBI, to its credit, refused to go along and fought the Tamil Nadu government, the ‘Jallikattu’ Federation and the Ministry of Environment and Forest’s stand in the Supreme Court. By its historic verdict, the court has vindicated Mr. Jairam Ramesh’s position and upheld the ban,” Ms. Krishna said.

Supreme Court bans jallikattu in Tamil Nadu
","Even bulls have rights against torture, the Supreme Court observed on Wednesday as it banned ‘jallikattu’ (bull fighting) and bullock cart racing in Tamil Nadu. The court also banned bullock cart racing in Maharashtra.
A Bench of Justices K.S. Radhakrishnan and Pinaki Chandra Misra said, “Forcing a bull and keeping it in the waiting area for hours and subjecting it to the scorching sun is not for the animal’s well-being. Forcing and pulling the bull by a nose rope into the narrow, closed enclosure or ‘vadi vassal’ (entry point), subjecting it to all forms of torture, fear, pain and suffering by forcing it to go the arena and also over-powering it in the arena by bull tamers, are not for the well-being of the animal.”
The Bench said the Animal Welfare Board of India had given details on the manner in which the bull fight was conducted across Tamil Nadu. It said the torture and cruelty meted out to the bulls was unimaginable. “Being dumb and helpless, they suffer in silence. We notice that the situation is the same in Maharashtra too.”

From the archives: No Imminent Danger to Periyar Dam
","
NEW DELHI: A spokesman of the Ministry of Agriculture and Irrigation said today there was no Imminent danger to the Periyar Dam.
The spokesman said the dam was built in stone masonry in lime mortar on the front and rear faces, and had hearting of lime concrete in surkhi mortar. Following considerable leakage of water through the body of the dam in 1933, the front face of the dam was strengthened which had resulted in substantial reduction of leakage. Between 1961 and 1964, grouting of the body of the dam had been undertaken which had helped reduce seepage further.
The spokesman said with the Idukki Dam being in position downstream Of the Periyar Dam the safety of the Periyar Dam had assumed greater significance on account of its design deficiency and age. While designing Periyar Dam, the conventional uplift forces had not been taken into account resulting in some tension under full reservoir conditions.
The spokesman recalled that the Member (Designs and Research) of the Central Water Commission, after an inspection of the dam Jointly with the Chief Engineers of Tamil Nadu and Kerala in May, 1978 had recommended that the full reservoir level should be kept seven feet lower at 145 feet, and also that the maximum water level, restricted to 147 feet, be brought back to 148 within 24 hours. According to reports received from the Tamil Nadu Government the present level of water was below 140 feet and, therefore, there was no imminent danger to its safety.
According to the spokesman, the Central Water Commission had called for certain data in regard to the construction of the dam and hydrology of the river to evolve measures for further strengthening of the dam. In February, 1979, the Central Water Commission had suggested to the Tamil Nadu Government the strengthening of the dam by earth-backing.
""As the information sought from the Tamil Nadu Government has not yet been furnished, the matter is being taken up by the Union Irrigation Secretary with the State Chief Secretary""

From the archives: Strengthen Mullaperiyar Dam: Kerala Writes to Centre
","
TRIVANDRUM: The Kerala Chief Minister. Mr.C. H. Mohammed Koya informed the State Assembly on Tuesday that he had sent a letter to the UnionAgriculture and Irrigation Minister on October 17 requesting him to direct the Central Water and Power Commission and the Tamil Nadu Government to take immediate steps for strengthening the Mallaperiyar Dam (Thekkady dam) in Kerala territory and under the control of the Tamil Nadu Government.
On the same day, he had sent a similar letter to the Tamil Nadu Chief Minister also drawing his urgent attention to this matter.
The Chief Minister was replying to a calling attention motion raised by Mr. P. C. Joseph (Kerala Congress-Mani group) on the condition of the dam. Mr. Joseph said the dam was in a dangerous condition and if it cracked, it would result in great havoc for the entire district. The disaster might perhaps be more than what they witnessed in the Morvi tragedy. He wanted the Government to take up this issue with the Centre and the Tamil Nadu Government.
The Chief Minister said the Mullaperiyar Dam (Periyar Dam) was constructed in 1897 on the basis of an agreement entered into by the then Maharaja of Travancore and the Secretary of State of India on October 29. 1886. The dam is 1,241 feet long and the maximum height from the river bed is 158 feet. The capacity of the reservoir is 15.662 million cubic feet. The dam is situated 55 kms. upstream from the present Idukki Dam. There is no record with the Government to show that the life of the dam is 50 years as reported in a section of the press.
In 1972 and 1973, samples were collected from the dam to test its strength. Though some discussion was planned by the Central Water and Power Commission in 1976, it did not come off On May 9, 1978, Mr. A. N. Harkouli, Member of the Commission, Mr. A. K.Pal, Director in the Commission,the Chief Engineers ofKerala and Tamil Nadu and other officials concerned examined the dam.
The Tamil Nadu Government was asked by the Commission on May 19, 1978, to furnish more information about the dam with a view to considering the steps to be taken for strengthening the dam. The Commission also directed that the water level in the reservoir should be kept at 145 feet, and if the level rose beyond two feet, it should be brought down to 145 feet within 24 hours.
On June 13, 1979, the Kerala Government again brought the issue to the notice of the Commission, and the latter replied saying the views of the Tamil Nadu Government had not been received. A subsequent letter to the Commission by the Kerala Government on July 18, 1979 also brought the same reply from the
Commission on August 4, 1979.
Later, the Chief Secretary to Kerala Government also sent a letter to the Chairman of the Central Water and Power Commission on September 27, pointing out all details and urging him to take immediate steps for strengthening the dam.

Bent on maintaining accuracy before declaring poll results: CEO
","The Chief Electoral Officer Praveen Kumar on Wednesday said that the Election Commission was bent on ensuring accuracy and the satisfaction of the stake holders before announcing the poll results.
Noting that extra time would be taken to announce the results this time, Mr. Praveen Kumar said this was due to increase in polling stations, more contesting candidates and extra rounds.
Making a comparison between 2009 and 2014 Parliamentary elections, Mr. Kumar said the number of polling stations in Tamil Nadu had increased from 52,000 to 60,000.
We are not in a race to announce the results as accuracy and satisfaction of the stake holders are important to the Election Commission, Mr. Kumar told reporters in Tiruchi. He was in the city to conduct a regional level training class for Returning Officers, District Election Officers, Assistant Returning Officers and nodal officers of eight districts in respect of counting of votes.
The second round would begin only after the completion of the first round and result displayed on the board and copies handed out to the agents, he said.
Mr. Kumar said the police had been asked to bring maximum poll-related cases to the court before May 16 when counting of votes is slated.
Over 3,600 election cases had been registered across the State in the run up to the Parliamentary polls, of which 1,500 cases were in various courts.
Conviction had been given in 200 cases, he said adding that the Election Commission was obtaining a daily report on the progress of these cases.
Replying to a query, Mr. Kumar said maximum efforts had been taken by the Election Commission to check distribution of cash in the run up to the elections.
Imposition of Section 144 in Tamil Nadu on the eve of polling had also helped to a large extent in checking it.
However, he said the officials had seized Rs. 55 lakhs from April 22 night to April 23rd night across the State notwithstanding the imposition of Section 144.
The Election Commission had put in place a set of regulations for the counting centres where multiple-layers of security would be in vogue.
The central para-military force personnel would be deployed at the counting hall, he added.
Returning Officers, District Election Officers and Assistant Returning Officers of Tiruchi, Perambalur, Dindigul, Nagapattinam, Thanjavur, Pudukottai, Tiruvarur and Ariyalur districts attended the programme.

SC allows TN to increase Mullaperiyar water level
","In a major victory for Tamil Nadu, the Supreme Court on Wednesday declared as unconstitutional the law passed by Kerala in 2006, constituting the Dam Safety Authority to prevent the State from >raising the water level in the >Mullaperiyar dam from 136 ft to 142 ft.
A five-judge Constitution Bench of Chief Justice R.M. Lodha and Justices H.L. Dattu, C.K. Prasad, Madan B. Lokur and M.Y. Eqbal, allowing the suit filed by TN permanently restrained Kerala from interfering with the rights of Tamil Nadu from raising the water level in the dam from 136 ft to 142 ft.
Justice Lodha, who wrote the judgment, also restrained >Kerala from enforcing its law on Tamil Nadu. By enacting the law and fixing the storage height of the dam at 136 ft, Kerala had nullified the 2006 judgment and usurped judicial power and thus interfered with the judicial functioning.
The Bench said the Constitution envisaged separation of powers among the Executive, Judiciary and Legislature and one should not encroach into the domain of the other. Independence of the judiciary and courts alone would ensure rule of law, the Bench said.
The Bench said a legislation could be invalidated on the ground that there was a >breach of separation of powers in enacting the law, though the Legislature might have the competence to do so. The Bench said “If the court finds that there was transgression of constitutional principles in separation of powers the court can declared the law void.”
The Bench said the Legislature could only amend the law but could not invalidate a judgment or a decree passed by the court. The law enacted by Kerala legislature was an attempt to interfere with the judicial functioning, the Bench said and struck the law as unconstitutional and void.
The Bench appointed a three-member committee with chairman of the Central Water Commission as the chairperson and representatives from the States of Kerala and Tamil Nadu to supervise and ensure that the water level in the Mullaperiyar dam was raised up to 142 ft.

Eight-year wait ends

To allay the apprehensions of Kerala, though none exists, the Bench said the committee should make periodic inspection of the dam, before the monsoon and during the monsoon and take all steps necessary for the safety of the dam. The Kerala government was directed to allow Tamil Nadu to carry out all repairs and take all other steps for the >safety of the dam. On a suit filed by Tamil Nadu, the apex court in 2006 permitted the State to raise the water level from 136 ft to 142 ft. Within 15 days of the verdict, Kerala enacted a law and constituted Dam Safety Authority to prevent Tamil Nadu from raising the water level beyond 136 ft. In April 2006, Tamil Nadu filed a fresh suit to declare the law as unconstitutional. On Wednesday, after eight years the apex court decreed the suit in favour of Tamil Nadu.

Kudankulam: India seeks to allay Sri Lankan fears
","Weeks after India signed the agreement for building units 3 and 4 of the Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant, New Delhi, at a meeting in Colombo, sought to allay fears in Sri Lanka over the safety of the project.
The safety of the plant, among other issues, came up for discussion at the meeting on comprehensive civil nuclear cooperation between the two countries held in Colombo on Monday and Tuesday, it is reliably learnt.
According to government sources in New Delhi, the two countries discussed possible collaboration in the field of nuclear medicine. Sri Lanka reportedly also sought training in the field, covering certain specialisations.
Indian High Commission officials in Colombo said Amandeep Singh Gill, Joint Secretary (Disarmament), Ministry of External Affairs, led the Indian delegation at the second round of talks, held as a follow-up to the initial round of discussions held in New Delhi in 2012.
While there has been an ongoing dialogue between the two countries on possible civil nuclear cooperation over the years, it was sidetracked by other issues dominating bilateral relations. All the same, following the Fukushima disaster, Sri Lanka raised concern at how safe the
> Kudankulam nuclear plants in Tamil Nadu are.
Government sources ruled out any possibility of India selling nuclear reactors to its neighbour. There was no specific request from the Sri Lankan side either, it is learnt.
They also said an agreement did not look likely in the near future.

Verdict on Mullaperiyar today
","The Supreme Court will deliver its verdict on Wednesday on the suit filed by Tamil Nadu questioning the law passed by Kerala in 2006, constituting the Dam Safety Authority to prevent the State from raising the water level in the Mullaperiyar dam from 136 ft. to 142 ft. 
A five-Judge Constitution Bench of Justice R.M. Lodha, Justice H.L. Dattu, Justice C.K. Prasad, Justice Madan B. Lokur, and Justice M.Y. Eqbal had reserved verdict in August last.
Tamil Nadu filed the suit in 2006, soon after the law was enacted within few days of the pronouncement of the judgment allowing the State to raise water level from 136 ft. up to 142 ft.
The Bench in 2010 had appointed an empowered committee headed by former Chief Justice of India A.S. Anand to go into the safety aspects and the report was submitted in April 2012. 
Tamil Nadu said the law empowered Kerala’s Dam Safety Authority to reach its own findings as to the safety of the dam and to direct it to suspend or restrict the functioning of the Mullaperiyar dam or even decommission the dam and the State was obliged to comply with such directives.
It argued that by enacting the law, the Kerala had not only encroached into the province of the judiciary but had also disobeyed the apex court judgment.
By enacting the law, Kerala had nullified the judgment and usurped judicial power.
However, Kerala had justified the law on the ground that it was intended to protect the safety of its people. Kerala’s case was that the impugned law related primarily to the modification of contractual rights under an agreement created prior to the commencement of the Constitution. It restricted the rights to use within the State of Kerala and a dam constructed within the State of Kerala would clearly be within the province of Kerala’s legislature.
It said: “By enacting the Amendment Act of 2006 and fixing the storage level of Mullaperiyar Dam at 136 ft., Kerala Legislature has not overruled the judgment of this court but removed the basis of the said judgment by curtailing the legal right to store water above 136ft which flows from the 1886 agreement. The law would not become invalid merely because there was a declaration that the dam was not safe if the water level was raised beyond 136 ft.”

Re-poll in two booths in Salem and Namakkal tomorrow
","The Election Commission has ordered re-polling in two booths — one each in Salem and Namakkal — for May 8.
This followed a snag in the Electronic Voting Machines in the booths when polling for the Lok Sabha elections drew to a close on April 24.
A snag was reported at booth number 213 in the Salem City Municipal Corporation Elementary School on Sengal Anai Road. The presiding officer noticed the EVM displaying the message ‘factory mode’ when he pressed the ‘close’ button at 6 p.m.
The issue was reported to Collector Hanish Chhabra, who brought it to the notice of Chief Electoral Officer Praveen Kumar.
The booth saw 77.61 per cent polling.
A total of 579 electors (268 men and 311 women) cast their votes, as against the total of 746 voters.
In Namakkal, a similar snag was reported in booth number 37 at the Panchayat Union Middle School at Kotapalayam in the Tiruchengode Assembly segment. The booth has a total of 897 voters (439 men and 458 women).
The booth witnessed 81.16 per cent polling.
Election officials said booth slips would be issued by 10 teams to all voters in that booth on Wednesday. Police teams, flying squads and video surveillance teams were deployed on Tuesday.
“Announcements will be made though loudspeakers and local television channels, urging the voters to exercise their franchise from 7 a.m. to 6 p.m. on May 8,” the Returning Officer for Namakkal, V. Dakshinamoorthy, said.

Counting will be transparent: CEO
","The counting of votes, scheduled for May 16, will be transparent as officials will come out with the latest tally at specified intervals, signing the votes in every round and declaring the numbers, Chief Electoral Officer Praveen Kumar said on Tuesday.
Officials would not move to the second round until the first round was completed. For every round completed, they would tabulate the results and hand a signed photocopy to the agents. They would also give a copy to the chief agent and then declare the results on board or screen, he said.
Mr. Kumar was here to launch the training in the counting process for the returning officers, principal assistant returning officers and assistant returning officers of the Lok Sabha constituencies in the Nilgiris, Dharmapuri, Salem, Namakkal, Karur, Erode, Tirupur and Coimbatore districts.
He said the Election Commission was keen on ensuring transparency to avoid allegations like the one that cropped up in the last Lok Sabha elections in Sivaganga, from where Union Minister P. Chidambaram was elected.
The declaration of results was likely to be delayed as there was a 20 per cent increase in the number of polling booths. Further, there were places where the number of candidates was high. But the delay would not be more than a few hours, he said, and early leads could be available around 1 p.m.
Once the contestants submitted the final expenses, the EC’s expenditure teams, comprising officials of the Income Tax and Customs Departments, would scrutinise the accounts. In case of any fudging, the EC would pursue legal options.
As for paid news, Mr. Kumar said his office went into two appeals and dismissed one. The decision on the other would soon be known.
From Coimbatore, the EC received complaints on the use of private buses for transporting people to meeting venues. After an inquiry, the EC found the complaints to be true and decided to add Rs. 31 lakh to the expenditure account of a political party.
Mr. Kumar said his office instructed the returning officers and other officials to expeditiously deal with the 3,000 poll-related cases registered across the State. Of these, 1,800 reached the stage of charge sheet.
The aim was to take as many cases as possible to court before May 16.

BJP, EC headed for showdown
","The BJP and the Election Commission appeared headed for a showdown after the Varanasi district administration on Wednesday denied permission to the party’s prime ministerial candidate, Narendra Modi, to hold an election meeting in the city on Thursday.
The refusal angered the BJP, which shot off letters to the commission alleging “partisan behaviour” by Returning Officer Pranjal Yadav and declared that senior leaders Arun Jaitley, Amit Shah and Laxmikant Bajpai would stage a sit-in at the Lanka Gate of Banaras Hindu University.
But the Election Commission rejected the BJP’s charge of bias. “Local authorities, the district administration there, who are directly in charge of law and order, have their assessment in the matter,” Deputy Election Commissioner Vinod Zutshi told presspersons in New Delhi. “The commission does not accept the insinuation of inaction or bias.”
Mr. Modi, who is the BJP’s candidate from Varanasi, was to address two rallies in the constituency, in Beniabagh, a minority-dominated area in the heart of the city, and at Jagat Inter College Ground at Rohaniya on the Banaras-Allahabad road.
While the district authorities gave the go-ahead for the Rohaniya meeting, they denied him permission to address the rally in Beniabagh, citing security concerns.
Mr. Modi’s proposed meeting with some intellectuals in the city and a puja on the banks of the Ganga were also at first disallowed. But late in the evening, the district administration gave permission for them.
Mr. Jaitley alleged that the Returning Officer was interfering in the conduct of free and fair elections.

SC continues ban on green clearances to U’khand power projects
","The Supreme Court, on Wednesday, continued the ban on issuance of environmental and forest clearances to power projects in Uttarakhand.
The Supreme Court order dated August 13, 2013 said the Union Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) and the State government must “not grant any further environmental clearance or forest clearance for any hydroelectric power project (HEP) in the State of Uttarakhand, until further orders.”
The same order directed the MoEF to constitute an Expert Body to “assess whether the existing and ongoing/under-construction HEPs have contributed to the environmental degradation and, if so, to what extent.”
The Expert Body submitted its report on which the second hearing was held in the Supreme Court on Wednesday.
The Expert Body, in its report, had elucidated the catastrophic role played by the HEPs during the June, 2013 deluge in the State.
The Expert Body, in its recommendations in the report, rejected 23 HEPs with an installed capacity of 2,870 MW, out of the 24 HEPs that were proposed for reconsideration by the Dehradun-based Wildlife Institute of India (WII). Only one project – 195-MW Kotlibhel 1A – out of the 24 proposed projects was recommended for implementation by the Expert Body, but, with some modifications.
Taking cognizance of the recommendations of the report, the Supreme Court, on Wednesday, ordered that no construction work should proceed on the 24 projects.
Former IIM Bangalore Professor Bharat Jhunjhunwala, who is the petitioner in the case, said, “Since the Ravi Chopra report [the Expert Body report] recommended that Kotlibhel 1A could be only implemented after modifications, the Supreme Court, for now, has said that no construction work must be carried out in the 24 projects.”
In the fifth meeting of the Expert Body, which was held in the first week of March, two Central Water Commission (CWC) and Central Electricity Authority (CEA) representatives withdrew from the Export Body after entering into a heated conversation with the rest of the Expert Body members.
The CWC and the CEA, then, submitted a separate report based on the ‘Terms of Reference’ mentioned under the Supreme Court order of August 2013.
Sources in the Expert Body said that in the Supreme Court the MoEF tagged the Expert Body report as an ‘activists’ report.’ However, Mr Jhunjhunwala pointed out that nine out of the 11 members in the Expert Body held PhD degrees, and that the body had experts in rock mechanics, glaciology, among others, so that the report could not be termed as an ‘‘activists’ report.’
On Wednesday, the MoEF requested the Supreme Court for the permission to form another Committee to review the Expert Body report. However, sources said that the Supreme Court has asked the MoEF to give reasons for the same.

The architects challenged the government’s decision to go for fresh tenders. Early this year, the government had accepted a new design by JJ school of Architecture principal Rajiv Mishra.
The state Public Works Department (PWD) filed an affidavit in the court on Monday stating that it had decided to junk the old design plans on the grounds that the new plan would incorporate more features in the same space.
The firm's senior advocate, Janak Dwarkadas, argued that the government was spending the taxpayers’ money to invite fresh tenders after expressing to his clients and other international bidders that only the winning design would be followed while constructing the statue.
At the last hearing the court had asked the parties if they could resolve the matter amicably. On Wednesday, the division bench recorded the submissions of the state that the dispute couldn't be resolved and kept the matter for hearing when the court re-opens in June.
The bench also questioned how Team One’s prayers for interim relief could be granted. They had prayed that only their design and no other be used.
The court asked the architect how they could claim monopoly over the entire project to which the architects’ lawyer replied that they had been granted monopoly. The court told the architects that they had the right to claim damages from the state.
The affidavit states that the new design could incorporate a marine aquarium, a Maratha library and a dolphin pool. The height of the statue itself has also been increased in the new plan from 94 metres to 190 metres.

Maharashtra govt mulls over a campaign to curb atrocities against Dalits
","Following reports of increasing atrocities against Dalits in Maharashtra, the state government is considering a proposal to initiate a campaign at village level to curb violence against Dalits.
At least three cases of alleged caste violence have been reported in last one week alone from different parts of the state. The ruling Congress-NCP alliance has come under severe criticism not only from the opposition but also from its own workers to initiate strict action to check increasing >crimes against Dalits.
On Wednesday, the issue was discussed in the state cabinet meeting. According to a minister who was present, Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan asked the home, rural development and social justice ministries to formulate a comprehensive proposal for a state wide campaign against such atrocities.
“We already have a ‘Tanta Mukti Abhiyan (Alternative Dispute Resolution campaign) at the village level. This campaign will be on the same lines,” said the minister.
Many Congress leaders termed it as an important step, especially at a time when state assembly elections are few months away.
The opposition too has demanded stern action from the government. BJP leader Gopinath Munde, who visited the village of Nitin Aage, a 17-year-old Dalit boy who was allegedly killed by upper caste men for speaking with a girl, demanded the resignation of Home Minister R R Patil. Shiv Sena leader Neelam Gorhe too has accused the government of inaction.
Nitin Raut, the Congress leader and cabinet minister of Employment Guarantee and Water Conservation, on Tuesday had demanded a special cabinet meeting on the issue.
“The increasing number of atrocities against Dalits is a matter of concern for the government which is in power for last 13 years. The cases have increase in last three years. This sensitive issue needs to be handled well-in-time,” said the letter sent by the minister to Mr. Chavan.

Tripura HC cancels school teachers recruitment
","In a significant judgement with serious ramification, the High Court of Tripura on Wednesday cancelled recruitment of all school teachers from March 2010. Total 10,323 under graduate, graduate and post graduate teachers would be axed following the order that termed the appointments illegal.
A division bench comprising Chief Justice Deepak Gupta and Justice S.C. Das who heard 58 petitions from aggrieved unemployed youths over past four months, delivered the judgement with certain directives to the government. Senior counsel Arun Chandra Bhowmik who represented several petitioners termed the verdict historic and victory for suffering youths who were deprived of job despite having requisite qualification.
The plaintiffs complained all appointment procedures and norms were violated in recruitment of 10,323 teachers. State government had in March 2010 appointed 4,617 graduate teachers, 1,100 post graduate teachers in August of same year and 4,606 under-graduate teachers in December 2013.
The judgement mentioned that despite cancellation of appointments, the recruited teachers can continue service till December 31 next. It directed the state government to ensure transparent recruitment of teachers as per procedure and made a point to consider age limit of bonafide candidates who were denied job in earlier recruitment exercises.
State’s school education minister Tapan Chakraborty said the government would take next course of action like moving the apex court only after reviewing High Court judgement. All opposition parties hailed the judgment and criticized CPI(M) led left front government for ‘political appointments in government organisations flouting set rules’.
When contacted, CPI(M) state secretary Bijan Dhar said he would not make any political comment in haste without knowing exact content of the judgement. Sources said the state government is likely to move the Supreme Court seeking a stay on the high court order.

“There is no sufficient evidence against Amit Shah. Hence CBI has not chargesheeted him,” CBI PI Vishwas Kumar Meena said in an affidavit filed before the special CBI court in Ahmadabad on Wednesday.
“It is most respectfully submitted that Shah was not named in the FIR of the case. CBI has also not named him in the charge sheet as an accused,” CBI affidavit said.

Snacking contributes to fatty liver, abdominal obesity
","Snacking on high-fat and high-sugar foods is linked to abdominal fat and fatty liver disease, according to a new study.
The study found that a hypercaloric diet with frequent meals increases intrahepatic triglyceride content and fat around the waist, but increasing meal size did not.
Studies have linked obesity to the accumulation of abdominal fat and fat in the liver, making non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) one of the most prevalent diseases of the liver.
“American children consume up to 27 per cent of calories from high-fat and high-sugar snacks,” said lead author Dr. Mireille Serlie with the Academic Medical Centre Amsterdam in The Netherlands.
“Our study examines if high meal frequency, with snacking, compared to large meal consumption contributes to increased intrahepatic and abdominal fat,” Dr. Serlie said.
For the study, 36 lean men were randomised to a hypercaloric diet or a eucaloric control diet (balanced diet) for six weeks.
Researchers measured IHTG and abdominal fat using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and insulin sensitivity before and after the diet.
Those subjects on the hypercaloric diet ate 3 main meals along with additional calories from high fat and/or high sugar drinks, with or in between meals, to increase meal size or meal frequency.
Results show that high calorie diets increased BMI.
Eating more frequent meals significantly increased IHTG, while larger sized meals did not.
Researchers found that belly fat increased in the high fat/high sugar frequency group and in the high sugar-frequency group. A decrease in liver insulin sensitivity was found in the high fat/high sugar-frequency group.
“Our study provides the first evidence that eating more often, rather than consuming large meals, contributes to fatty liver independent of body weight gain,” said Dr. Serlie.
“These findings suggest that by cutting down on snacking and encouraging three balanced meals each day over the long term may reduce the prevalence of NAFLD,” Serlie added.
