Paint it green
"," It sometimes happens that a student has something lurking on their application that they know isn’t going to make them look good. It could be a bad grade, a less than stellar test score, a disciplinary infraction, anything that they might be unhappy about in their past that, unfortunately, could affect their future chances future.
The thing about academic dips or issues in a student’s past is that they often have a good explanation, as long as you know the student and their context. But how do you communicate that to a college, who doesn’t know the student? How do you deal with potential red flags, if you have them?
For some students, their response is often to try and hide these issues, adopting the “put your head under the covers and hope the monsters go away approach”. But what works for an ostrich doesn’t work for college applications, and in fact, it ends up making the student look really bad if they have a big issue in their application and they haven’t dealt with it. The most common thing I see is a grade dip, or failing out of a class, and that’s an impossible thing to hide.
Owning up
When I worked with a student who had ended up failing a class, it changed the nature of the degree she would be getting from her school, which meant that she had a lot going on on her application that was important to make clear to a college. It may seem insane to you right now, what I’m about to say, but colleges do actually know that you aren’t perfect. They get it. They know you’ve struggled, and made mistakes, that you aren’t good at everything, that you’ve probably had difficulties dealing with some of your educational challenges. It’s okay to admit that, but how you do it can mean the difference between representing yourself as a mature thoughtful person with a full perspective on their life and… not.
The place you would deal with this would be that elusive tricky “additional information” section of the common application. It’s an optional section, and it was built for things like this. So how do you approach talking about something you know to be a potential problem in your application, something that might tip the scales from admission to rejection?
The first thing you have to remember is that what you are giving is an explanation, not an excuse. Candour, self-awareness and clarity are the watchwords of this concept. You need to talk about your issue, be clear and succinct about the problem, and then talk about how you’ve bounced back since.
So, if your issue was an expulsion from school, you would want to explain why you got expelled.Maybe, you were under stress and you acted out. Or you were dealing with some issues at home and it came out at school. Be honest, take responsibility for what happened, and define the emotional context of the issue without dipping into melodrama.
Then, you would want to talk about what has happened since this issue, how you dealt with this expulsion, how you turned it around, and how you’re back on track.
Remember, this isn’t a diary entry, and it isn’t a pity party. It’s a chance to explain yourself, to own up to your mistakes, and to make it clear that you have learned from them. So treat it seriously, but don’t avoid it. You aren’t defined by one mistake; don’t let your application be overshadowed by it either. It’s only a red flag if you let it be one.

Beat those exam blues "," Test anxiety is an intrinsic part of the Indian high-school experience. Stress levels reach their peak during class XII and remain the same until entrance exams end, till a college admission is secured. The National Eligibility-cum Entrance Test (NEET) is one such entrance exam attempted by students aspiring to pursue medical and dental courses. The result for this exam was announced on June 4, set off a whirlwind of emotions across the country.
One of the main reasons behind the immense pressure felt by students writing NEET is the increasing competition, which has culminated in a fixation to perform well, academically. Often, mental and emotional health is completely disregarded, when the focus on scoring is deemed paramount. “Many schools tend to disregard mental health and emotional intelligence as the focus is entirely on scoring. The system has to change to accommodate different kinds of learners,” says Mina Dilip, a child psychologist from Chennai.
Gap year option 
Another practice that is becoming progressively common among NEET students is opting for a gap year after class XII to improve scores. “I had no choice but to take another year to study, and I am happy I made that decision. I would have missed out on so many experiences in my final years of school if I had spent all my time preparing for exams,” says Karan S. Cheeran, a NEET candidate from Kerala.
This practice seems to stem from a sense of being overwhelmed, which is one of the many indicators of stress. While stress has inevitably become a customary part of student life, it is imperative that one is aware of the fine line between what is considered ‘normal’ and what could be potentially toxic. “Fatigue, irritability, loss of interest in social activities, appetite, and disturbed or inadequate sleep are a few signs to watch out for. When parents notice these changes, they must keep an eye on their child. If a child mentions feeling overwhelmed, or expresses a desire to get away, immediate professional help must be sought,” says Mina Dilip.
Parents play a crucial role in this process; simply having their support can significantly alleviate stress. “My parents were hesitant about the break year at first, but I was persistent about it. So, they were supportive towards the end. That was one thing less for me to worry about,”says Meghna John, a NEET candidate from Chennai. 
“Students must prioritise their physical and mental health. They must maintain a healthy balance between academic pursuits and overall health and fitness. Little things such as following a good diet, taking adequate rest, and engaging in daily physical activity can go a long way during exam time. Preparing well in advance can help ease the anxiety and yield better results,” believes Mina Dilip.

Tiding over dilemmas
"," I am 22 and have completed my graduation in physics from Delhi University, two years back. After that, I worked in an IT company, but resigned, in order to prepare for government exams. Meanwhile, I have developed a taste for history (archaeology, to be precise) and thinking of pursuing it as career. Is it a good career option keeping in mind that there are very few job opportunities in this field? Where do should I start? I mean should I enroll in undergrad or postgraduate courses as both the options are open, and most of the universities ask for a bachelor’s degree to get admission into M.A Archeology? Which universities can I apply to? Please advise me on this. Thanks and regards, — Roshan Kumar
Dear Roshan,
 What I understand is that you have developed a taste in archaeology (with a background in Physics) and would want to work in that field (as a researcher / teacher/ lecturer?) and/or become an archaeologist? To become a successful archaeologist, you first need to obtain a graduate degree, preferably in history, sociology, or anthropology — to get a deeper understanding of the subject. Further, check the admission and the eligibility criteria for related PG courses — Maharaj Sayajirao University of Baroda, offers a three- years bachelor’s degree in Indian History, Culture and Archaeology. Banaras Hindu University, offers two undergraduate courses — a three-years honours programme in ancient Indian history, culture and archaeology, and a three-years vocational programme in Museology and Archaeology. Then there is The Institute of Archaeology under the aegis of Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), New Delhi, which conducts a two-year post graduate diploma in archaeology. 
Jobs with Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) are available both at the centre and the state-levels. Postgraduates qualify for lectureship in various universities across the country. The National Eligibility Test (NET) or the Junior Research Fellow (JRF)-Lectureship examination is a prerequisite for the same. Success in JRF paves way paves the way to a for a doctorate degree in the capacity of a paid research fellowship.
What do you want to do? Are you sure this is what you want, and not just a fancy that you are smitten by right now? Identify and gain complete clarity on what you want first. Meet a competent career counsellor to affirm that you have the aptitude and the attitude (plus personality) for this career choice. All the best to you!
I am unable to talk to people while looking them in the eye. I try my best to stay confident, but I feel uncomfortable. I also want to bond with them, but I don’t know how. Over socializing gives me headaches, literally. Should I seek medical help.— Anonymous
Dear Anonymous,
The inability to look at people in the eye whilst talking could be due to an array of reasons. Maybe you don’t like to socialise and genuinely seek solace. The person at the receiving end, however, might feel that you think, you are ‘better off’, ‘smarter’ or have a ‘higher social standing’ than him or her. This can beembarrassing for you and demeaningfor the latter. It can create disturbance in friendships and relationships.
It can also stem from the fact that you have not organised your thoughts well, or you don’t want to share much — you say too much or too little and make a mess of the communication. The pressure for this ‘performance’ itself must create so much anxiety that it must be nightmarish to meet people. Friends can also feel offended and uncomfortable. You will greatly benefit from a therapist who specialises in behaviour modification, or a coach who can teach you this art.
I am 17 and I have just completed class XII. I am passionate about science and I want to pursue a related career. Ever since class X, I have always wanted to join IISER. But , I need to have a high percentile in the class XII board exam, about which I am unsure of. So, I have decided to try for medical entrance examinations, instead. But to prepare within this short period and being a person who has never attended any coaching, cracking the exams seems almost impossible. Meanwhile, I cracked the JEE Mains, but engineering is not my cup of tea. I am also thinking of going for a repeat, but my family is against the idea. Is going for repeat a good idea?I also have this issue with confidence. At times, I feel like I am good for nothing. Please guide me — Ankita.
Dear Ankita,
Congrats on cracking the JEE mains.What was the ranking? You certainly don’t need to repeat the year. I am assuming that you wrote this email before your class XII results were announced and the uncertainty caused you all this anxiety and fear. What was your class XII score? You can easily apply to IISER. 
There are three channels of admission to IISER. The first is Kishore Vaigyanik Protsahan Yojana channel where candidates having a valid KVPY fellowship commencing from 2018-19 academic session are eligible to apply for admissions. Additional cut-off criteria may be applicable. The next option is Joint Entrance Examination of Indian Institutes of Technology (JEE) channel where candidates in General category, securing a rank within 10,000 in the Common Rank List of JEE Advanced 2018 are eligible to apply. For candidates belonging to reserved category (OBCNC, SC, ST, PD), their category rank should be within 10,000. Third, State and Central Boards Channel (SCB) channel where students who have passed (10+2) level with science stream in 2017 or 2018 with marks equal or above the cut-off percentage in their respective boards as given (CBSE - 88.3, ICSE - 93.3, National Institute of Open Schooling (NIOS) - 83.6) are eligible to apply. For candidates belonging to the Other Backward Classes (OBCNC) and Persons with Disability (PD) categories, there is a 5% relaxation. The cut-off percentage for the Scheduled Castes (SC), the Scheduled Tribes (ST) and Kashmiri Migrants (KM) candidates is 55% in (10+2) level for all boards.
Please get in touch with IISER institutes and get on with your admissions.
I am going to class X. I am concerned as to what to opt for in my intermediate. I want to study psychology and become a forensic psychologist, but I don’t know what to do after class X. Please help — Grace Advitiya
Dear Grace,all the very best for your class X. What board are you studying in? 
I think you would enjoy a B.Sc. in forensic sciences. A prerequisite for admissions would be PCM/PCB with psychology if possible, across your XI and XII. Also, please read the link given below; it will give you a course overview.

Way of the future
","The job market may have begun to lean towards a candidate who has a breadth of knowledge rather than single-minded specificity. But until this is the norm rather than the exception, students with diverse interests could continue to feel that they have to pigeonhole themselves to succeed. 
Soon, however, they will have the option not only to pursue these distinct paths, but perhaps find meaningful overlaps. Krea University, an upcoming institution at Sri City, will place ‘interwoven learning’ at the core of all its four-year B.A. and B.Sc. honours degrees. This means, stitching together threads from various disciplines to form a cohesive fabric, applied to solve problems in real-world settings.
R. Seshasayee, chairman, IndusInd Bank, is the chairman of the university’s executive committee, and a member of the university’s governing council. He discusses the gap in higher learning that Krea could potentially fill; why interwoven learning was made a priority, and how it can shape leaders of the next generation.
Higher learning 
What the real world requires from those coming out of higher learning institutions is diverging more from what institutions can cater. We have to address this — create something that is more appropriate for the 21st century.
There are many of us, including N. Vaghul, and Raghuram Rajan, coming together for Krea University, because we believe something needs to be done in higher education to prepare the right kind of leaders for the future. Education is central to anything we dream about. 
In the U.S., liberal arts and science colleges give you access to a multiplicity of disciplines. So, you can opt for two or three subjects you are interested in. For example, economics and theatre studies. But merely pursuing these interests separately isn’t what society requires of graduates, and isn’t what would bring out the best in them. So we thought of interwoven, or interdisciplinary learning. The threads from different subjects aren’t just left as loose strands; they’re woven together to produce a pattern and a fabric. This is reflected in the university’s logo too. It is about multiple disciplines coming together for a purpose — to solve problems, or address an opportunity — not just to satisfy curiosity or interests.
Working backwards
We first examined 10 problems each in the fields we wanted to teach. When taking social science, for instance, we considered communal harmony. Next, we thought of the kind of learnings that one needs to address it. It could involve history to tell us which periods in India’s past had communal harmony. What do we need by way of data analytics? What about taking into account ethics, or social impact to make the right choices? It isn’t just a random choice of subjects; interwoven learning brings together relevant knowledge from different domains — it could be data science, political science, or social science
For the first year, students opt for core and required courses, and then choose a specialisation. But even after that, interwoven learning plays a big part. To make this more relevant, we will pick around 20 careers, examine the dominant issues in each of them, and decide what will equip the students to become competitive in that career. This is not abstract or open-ended because in India, students have to be able to take on a career when they come out of an institution. We will have corporates and social institutions partnering with us to facilitate placements. They will be our partners right from the start, involved even in tweaking the curriculum, in order to get the right kind of output from the institution.
Next-generation leaders
Leadersneed to be problem-solvers . Second, they must have an understanding of the major influences shaping the 21st-century. This includes keeping abreast of developments in technology, such as human-machine interfaces or artificial intelligence. It wouldn’t be about just learning C++, but knowing what tools in data analytics or technology are available to solve a given problem. The third aspect,is the most important. Everything is to be anchored on an understanding of ethics and social impact. Not just a moral class, but debating the ethics of the choices that we make to solve a problem.
We have an illustrious academic council. Some of them, like Srinath Raghavan and Gaurav Raina, will be teaching too. They have a huge network of faculty who have worked and trained with them that we may be able to tap into. 
Wedon’t want students to take just another exam. We will consider their past scholastic records, but our intention is to look at the candidate as a multi-dimensional person. The admission process is still being designed, and we plan to keep the student-teacher ratio tight. Admissions for the first batch will be opening later this year. www.krea.edu.in.

Metabolic mysteries
"," Heart disease is becoming more common today — what was once considered an elderly person’s disease today affects adolescents too. Scientists and clinicians have come to realise that many patients of heart disease and related problems have a set of traits such as a large waistline, high blood sugar and high blood pressure. These conditions are grouped under the term ‘metabolic syndrome’. 
In India too, this syndrome affects a significant portion of the urban and rural population (up to 25%). Until recently, doctors treated the symptoms individually, and were not successful at this. There can be no hope for a unified treatment without identifying the starting point. Reports also hint that metabolic syndrome patients are more susceptible to cognitive decline, but this too is not well-understood. This makes the area interesting for scientists like Dr. Asha Abraham, Associate Professor at St. Aloysius College, Mangaluru.
Animal biotechnology 
It is a field of applied biology where molecular biology, genome editing and other techniques are used for pharmaceutical, agricultural or industrial applications. Such research has given rise to genetically modified animals that synthesise useful proteins, have better growth rates or are resistant to disease. In Asha’s case, it is used to gather clues about metabolic syndrome.
The research
Since she cannot experiment on humans, Asha works with mice. To be suitable ‘models’ for metabolic syndrome, Asha needs to get her mice to develop the symptoms. The easiest way is to feed mice fatty food and wait for them to become unhealthy. However, Asha felt this was not realistic as most humans do not only consume fat. So she devised a high-fat-simple-carbohydrate diet for the mice that was more similar to diets followed by humans today. Simple carbohydrates are abundant in energy-dense junk food and sugar-rich items. These spike sugar levels as the body can easily break them down into glucose that accumulates in blood. This is less for complex carbohydrates like in whole grains and legumes.
Asha’s diet plan worked on her mice. They began to show metabolic-syndrome like symptoms. The mice are monitored and then eventually sacrificed so the protein and chemical levels in their brain can be measured with techniques like HPLC High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). Through her experiments, Asha proved that neurotransmitter levels in sick mice get derailed by this diet and this is likely causing mice to over eat. This could be happening in humans, too.
Academic path
After a BSc in zoology, Asha chose to study the relatively new (at the time) subject of biotechnology at Cochin University of Science and Technology. She continued this with a Ph.D and then obtained a post-doctoral fellowship from the Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR). She joined St Aloysius College as faculty after two years of research at the College of Fisheries in Mangaluru.

Gen M: What are you talking about?
"," “Is something wrong? You don’t look too well. Did you have a fight with Sujatha?”
“No, I was late for my chemistry class, and the teacher gave me a good banging.”
“Did you know that the expression ‘to give someone a good banging’ meaning ‘to scold someone severely’ is an Indianism?”
“Really? What’s the expression that native speakers use?”
“They have many. One of them is tongue-lashing! The coach gave a tongue-lashing to all the players.”
“Makes it seem that the coach whipped the players with his tongue! Anyway, I got a tongue-lashing from the chemistry teacher today — in front of the whole class.”
“Must have been quite embarrassing. What did you...”
Nodding acquaintance
“Listen, I have a test in chemistry tomorrow. Do you think you’ll be able to help me?”
“Don’t really think so. I have only a nodding acquaintance with the subject.”
“Nodding acquaintance? Does it mean you don’t know anything about chemistry?”
“That’s not what I mean. When you say you have a nodding acquaintance with chemistry, what it suggests is that you know only a little bit about chemistry. Not much.”
“I see. How about this example? I have a nodding acquaintance with Hindi and Bengali.”
“Sounds good. Suchi was able to help us because she had a nodding acquaintance with the new software. The expression can be used with people as well. When you refer to someone as a ‘nodding acquaintance’, you’re suggesting that...”
“That you don’t know the individual very well. You don’t really talk to him that much.”
“Exactly! You merely smile or nod when you see this person. I have a nodding acquaintance with most people who live in this building.”
“I really don’t know my new neighbour. We only have a nodding acquaintance.”
“You being part of Generation Mute, it’s not really surprising.”
“Generation Mute? What are you talking about?”
“A lot of young people today don’t really like to talk. They don’t talk to people when they are face to face with them or on the phone. But they don’t mind carrying on a lengthy conversation with others by texting or emailing them.”
“Since they prefer to write and not talk, they are a part of ‘Generation Mute’. They’re mute.”
“Exactly! Quite a few people I know are part of Generation Mute.”
“That’s true. Deepak says that he doesn’t have time to make friends. He is so busy...”
“Deepak? Are you talking about your cousin? That proud chap who is always...”
“He’s changed — he’s no longer proud. A few months ago, my cousins and I got together and cut him to size.”
“That’s good to know. By the way, it’s not ‘cut someone to size’ but ‘cut someone down to size.”
“I see. And before you ask, I know what the expressions means. When you ‘cut someone down to size,’ what you’re doing is ‘making them aware that they’re not as important as they think they are. You kind of deflate their ego.”
“Exactly! And you usually achieve this by criticising or making fun of them. After he became the President of the club, Chinthan became insufferable. His friends had to cut him down to size.”

Givers and takers
"," A friend was only half joking when she said, “I am in a give-and-take friendship with X. She does all the taking and I do all the giving.” Does this sound familiar? 
Those who study human behaviour divide people into two broad categories: the givers and the takers. Most of us fall into the midway bracket of both giving and taking, keeping a close eye on what goes out while forgiving ourselves and making excuses for taking; but the givers of the world give without counting the costs. Most often they act without thinking, like the man who threw himself on top of a young girl whom he spotted just in time as she crouched on the rails waiting for a speeding train. At the other end are people who are the very opposite: skilled at getting others to do their work and feeling no qualms about taking the credit, be it in an office or in a household where everyone is expected to pitch in. These are the takers of the world. They are also very good at making everyone else feel obliged to them and protecting their interests or making excuses for their inability to contribute what they should by rights have ‘given’. (“My husband was ill.” “ I was travelling.” “My daughter’s examinations…” )
How would you slot yourself? And more crucially, as far as happiness and lightness of mind are concerned, which feels better?
Happiness
Eric Barker whose insights have been widely appreciated (and even tested in small groups) is sure that in the matter of happiness, the data he has gathered over many years show that the crafty climbers who get promoted or rewarded financially are not necessarily happier than those who get left behind despite hard work and commitment to whatever field they might be performing in. By not trusting others, by looking the other way when others need help, the takers actually cut themselves short on what makes people happy. They are the ones who feel low for no reason at all. Who feel uneasy and keep looking over their shoulders. Double-dealing becomes a habit and gradually colours their whole existence. 
Those who donate regularly to good work, who spend time as volunteers, who offer to help before they are asked — studies have shown that these are the people who do not fall into depression or give into anger. They are optimistic about human nature and healthier because their self-esteem and levels of emotional satisfaction keep them happy. They might experience weariness, but rarely unfocussed rage which is an increasingly dangerous public expression of feelings in our fast-paced urban lives. 
Our best work
In a collection of articles produced in honour of a scholar of English Literature, Himansu Mohapatra, titled The Unbilled Hour I came across the perfect model of an academic giver. The long spells of reading, teaching, and writing outside professional requirements goes unnoticed academically but is received and remembered with gratitude by the many students, colleagues and friends who benefited from the generous nature of the scholar. Our best work, as the preface to the book says, is done in the unbilled hour. 
This month, which marks World Environment Day, is a good time to remember the endless giver of life we all depend on: bhoomimata. She gave us ourselves and waits patiently for us to return her dues. If we pay no other bill, that outstanding is something we will surely settle one day.

Dynamic headstart "," Tech Bee, HCL’s early career programme, aims at preparing students for entry-level jobs in the company. Srimathi Shivashankar, Executive Vice-President, HCL Technologies, gives a breakdown of the details. 
The programme
The Tech Bee programme is presented by HCL with SSN College of Engineering as the academic partner. The 15-month programme will train students who have completed Class XII and want to take up early careers. It will culminate in a diploma awarded by SSN. Upon successful completion, they will be provided assured jobs with HCL.
Vision
We look at these students as an alternative talent pool whom we can absorb into IT. When we have diversity in the workforce, it brings innovation and very different energy levels. Further, the current generation is choosy about what they want to do even in entry-level jobs. They want their careers to evolve over a period of time, but rapidly as well. They want dynamic job roles. In some households, there is also a need for children to start their careers early. Based on both the behavioural perspective as well as the demographic dividend which we want to leverage, this is the best time to pick up talent to bring into our larger talent pool.
Structure
The programme combines training with skilling. It comprises nine months of classroom training, on engineering and software fundamentals, and six months of job-specific training. While the training will take place at SSN, the students will be deputed at HCL for the last three months where they will be assigned to projects before they get absorbed as full-time workers. 
Curriculum
The diploma programme aims at providing a strong IT foundation and make students ready for entry-level roles in application and infrastructure maintenance. Students will receive technical foundation training, technology/domain training which will be stream-specific, and hands-on project work. They will also learn the fundamentals of IT, software tools and processes, and be exposed to emerging technologies.
The course content and learning pedagogy are mapped to our entry-level jobs. The four diploma streams are in mechanical automation, software engineering, support engineering, and products and testing engineering.
Career
During the programme, students will be paid a stipend of ₹10,000 per month. On completion, they will occupy engineering-level jobs at HCL, in KPO, development, support, testing, mechanical automation and so on. They could also continue their higher education while working, with the option of enrolling into IGNOU for a work-integrated 5-year MCA programme. This way, students will not be compromising on higher education. Weekend sessions for the course will take place at HCL.
Eligibility
Students from any stream with a cut-off of 85% (State Board) or 90% (CBSE) in Class XII, with Math or Business Math, can apply. Screening and selection will be based on an online exam, interview and group discussion.
Fee and scholarships
The programme fee is ₹2 lakh plus taxes. Students need not pay the fee upfront. They can pay it from the third year of work with us, on an EMI basis. Based on the performance during the training, the full fee or a part of it could be waived.
Applications for the Tech Bee 
programme are open. Visit www.hcltss.com or contact 1800 200 1117.

Staying ahead, education-wise "," Spot the similarities between Netflix, PayTM, Instagram, iPads and AirBnB — We can hardly live without them today, none of them are regular words in the English language, and none of them existed 10 years ago.
 However, the last one amazes me the most. These companies that provide income to thousands of people everyday, were mere pipe dreams 10 years ago. Back then, a student wanting to be a “game designer” would be asked to “Be more practical”. There were no bachelor’s courses in data science or digital marketing. How then, was a student graduating supposed to know that her passion for fiddling could be fashioned into toy design? Or that writing could make him a leading blogger one day? How do students graduating today know what the future might hold? Here’s a quick look at what the trends add up to.
What is happening 
The big change-makers are automation, artificial intelligence, globalisation, among many more. This is expected to slow down job growth for manual labourers, factory workers, tellers, security personnel, and others. But, automation is not an enemy. It is an enabler that frees human beings from repetitive labour. Here are the exciting areas that these trends indicate growth in:
Creative fields: Rising income means more people with time and money to invest in life’s higher pleasures such as painting, sculpture, films, and so on.With budget for events going through the roof, enterprising performers will find avenues to showcase their art. Online markets for paintings and stock photographs have opened up avenues for many budding and amateur artists.
Healthcare: Life expectancy has increased by about 30 years since 1841, and healthcare continues to be a major growth area. Cheaper health insurance, multispecialty hospitals, and so on are expected to expand the reach of global healthcare.The demand for doctors, nurses, and medical researchers is expected to boom.
 Investing in education: This leads to increasing demand for school teachers, tutors and education counsellors such as Byju’s in India, Changingedu in China, and Tutor Group in Taiwan.
Scientific research:  Increasing investment in biotechnology (think organ culture, genetically modified foods, and performance enhancement drugs), renewable resources and reducing toxic waste.
Media gets bigger: The Internet has exploded the speed and reach of media — be it news, short film,animation, serials, or advertising. With over one billion websites on the Internet, over five billion Youtube videos being watched every day, and Netflix releasing over 700 original series just this year, media has captured eyeballs and mindspace across the world.
Technology:  Automated assistants that buy gifts for your mom’s birthday, smarthomes that turn off lights, health monitors that call your doctor and cars that deftly avoid pedestrians on roads — none of these are science fiction today. Data analysts, interface designers, game developers and cyber security experts will be in demand, especially those who keep upgrading their skills.
Managers and strategists:  Marketing insights, advertising gimmicks, leadership training and strategy consulting will remain game-changers. Leaders who think out-of-the-box will remain at the top. 
Builders have to build: As people throng cities, rush to work and fly to holiday resorts, the demand for better homes, roads, hotels, malls, and more. Architects, urban planners, civil engineers, interior designers and art consultants all contribute to creating increasingly dense, utilitarian and beautiful spaces.
And lastly, the market swells for personal service and personal consultants — therapists, image consultants, hair stylists, masseurs, gardeners and even dog trainers that work for individuals to make their high-tech, fast-changing lives more fun and productive.

Road less travelled "," The intense, week-long new ventures leadership programme — the MIT Innovation and Entrepreneurship Bootcamp, held in Brisbane, Australia, this year, was a platform where entrepreneurs and students from around the globe could showcase their leadership skills.
“It challenged participants to develop a sustainable new venture within a week. Students learnt to practise critical skills required to become leaders, along with a core entrepreneurship curriculum taught at MIT,” said Amit Singh, runner-up of MIT Bootcamp 2018, Growth Engineer at Ixigo.
“Through this programme, I learnt about the strategies and roadmaps to validate any idea to its execution. This will further help in making a sustainable business model,” added team member Amit who is also Co-founder/CEO outsiteVR.
Kunwar Raj, a business development specialist, said,“After rigorous brainstorming, we came up with the idea of a smart bedsheet infused with sensors for infants to protect them against Sudden Infant Death Syndrome. This product will track their sleeping pattern, postures and will alert mothers on their phones in case the baby is in danger.”
“After returning to India, most of my work has been in a structured format and I have made considerable progress. The client base has grown by 25% in the three months following the Bootcamp. Apart from that, it gives confidence to work on multiple ideas and not be tethered to one’s comfort zone,” said Mr. Raj. “I recommend that entrepreneurs focus on their products and start reaching out to the mentors who have significantly good experience in that particular domain,” he added.

Economics, a way of life
"," Students today would ideally like to select a field which imparts skills that stand the test of time both in the professional and personal realms. Here is how, economics, with its emphasis on quantitative, problem-solving, writing, and critical thinking skills, helps students prepare for the future:
Quantitative skills
Why it is good for you professionally: Data-driven analytics has become the industry’s new favourite buzzword, and the periodical, The Economist, has declared data to be the ‘new oil’, in terms of being a valuable resource. Having the ability to analyse and derive insights from data sets is a crucial skill in the professional realm, with the World Economic Forum’s forecasts predicting that by 2020, data analysis will be in high demand.
Why it is good for you personally: Every activity and choice we make is another data-point. If like many other people, you worry about the lack of leisure time in your life, tracking your daily schedule and its variations can help you find more efficient ways to commute to get some free time to catch up on reading or the latest TV shows.
Problem-solving skills
Why it is good for you professionally: Having the ability to find what is relevant and discard the irrelevant in performing a function helps streamline work processes. The World Economic Forum’s Future of Jobs report projects that 36% of all jobs across industries will require complex problem-solving abilities as a core skill by 2020.
Why it’s good for you personally: Our personal lives are full of different problems that we are often stumped by, especially when it comes to our relationships with people. Complex problem-solving skills can help you become the best organiser for vacations, events, parties, or even in organising a dinner with friends.
Writing skills
Why it is good for you professionally: The written word is the basic language in which business is conducted. With the massive volume of written communication being produced every day, having the ability to use the right word to convey the right meaning is critical to operating businesses
Why it is good for you personally: Much of how we communicate with friends and loved ones happen through the written word, sent through messages across various channels. Being able to write something compelling can be the difference between getting into your favourite college or not, due to application essays.
Critical thinking skills
Why it is good for you professionally: Companies are always on the lookout for candidates who understand the world around them. Disruptive startups have used critical thinking to disrupt the normal ways of doing business, and this is a in-demand skill today. Even in an automated and AI-reliant future, critical thinking can ensure that you remain relevant.
Why it is good for you personally: Critical thinking helps us be responsible citizens in a democracy. Our ability to hold our elected representatives responsible for their actions and understand their motivations more clearly requires us to be able to critically analyse what they say.

Sparks from a conversation
"," A two-day gathering focusing on peace education explored the subject. Diversity of the panel members and audience ensured that quality questions were raised.
The issues
Any form of exclusion is violence, stated a panellist. The idea, at school, is to enable a sense of belonging, to blur the line between ‘us’ and ‘them’, said another. To what extent is this possible, one wonders, especially given that there is so much of ‘us’ and ‘them’ the society incessantly bombards a child with. The ‘us’ and ‘them’ of religion, of caste, of status, of nationality and more. A child has no role in any of these and adults have little clarity on.
An informal environment is a must — children must be free to ask questions. A panellist, in a separate session, asked whether there was any point in children having the space to question, when their questions were neither deliberated upon nor responded to. This is prevalent more in schools which like to believe that they are alternative schools, but perhaps end up subjecting their children to a poorer environment.
The deliberations also touched upon freedom. One stark point which was raised was that when one taught entirely based on the textbook, the question of freedom of speech did not arise. The topic ‘freedom’, elucidated pertinent responses from the audience. Do we need to first have freedom in staff rooms before we have freedom in classrooms? If speech is free can silence also be free? 
Caste too made its way into the discussions. Classrooms, in most of our schools, adhere to our caste system. Teachers belong to the proverbial upper castes while children bear the brunt. This is a strong point but reflects the teacher-centred classrooms we have, which espouse silence, and wherein is writ the teacher runs supreme. One of the panel members questioned why schools, including those claiming to be liberal refrain from discussing caste.
Our approaches, of late, have not helped. We have schools which levy fines on children for speaking their native language. Our sports have become far more aggressive; listening to cricket commentary for a short time will bring out lines in the nature of ‘shot like a bullet’ and ‘thrashed the bowler’. The scenario has changed to such an extent that what was previously the Education Ministry is now the Human Resources Ministry; in other words we are producing raw material for the market.
Way forward
On the way ahead, one speaker spoke on two possible avenues which could synthesise a non-violent brain; early childhood nurturing and mindful meditation. Another pointed to the need to have inner peace before expecting outer peace. A third speaker said that while we live in an imperfect world and face complex situations, we strive for perfect solutions. We need to work towards approximate and imperfect solutions — those that are attainable and will have us at peace.

Just say NO
"," Appearances are deceptive for, not all victims of drug abuse look the part — they rarely don the dazed, lost countenance of one in the vice-like grip of drugs. Nor do they stomp around in desperate, frenzied rage, even if temporarily denied their dose of ecstasy. Naturally, a chance glance at 19-year-old Trishna* would in no way divulge the trauma she has experienced.
Suffice it to say, Trishna too went through the run-of-the mill experiences when she joined a reputed liberal arts institute in Haryana. What started off innocuously as hanging out with her batchmates, in a bid to acclimatise herself to them, resulted in her taking the plunge and “doing the drag”, as her friends urged her to try, “just once”. She elaborates on how it all began in the campus smoking room. “No, it isn’t designated by authorities. Rather, it has become a hangout where faculty and students who crave a smoke go to,” she is quick to clarify.
“That’s how it began for me as well. A friend convinced me to give it a shot and soon, drugs became my go-to solution. There were times when I had been high for a whole week. My studies took a hit; I lost focus and became unproductive. I would turn to drugs to assuage my fears of not clearing the semester... it was a vicious cycle,” she shudders.
Flights of fantasy
For 20-year-old Niranjan, an English literature student from a reputed Bengaluru university, it was the trip of a lifetime, or so he assumed, when he tried his first dose of Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD). The rush he felt — bouts of calm and alternative creative surges — floored him. Colours around him seemed brighter, and he experienced an inexplicable communion with nature. He could practically “feel” the dormant parts of his brain awaken, as though from slumber. “I have never been a brilliant student, but that day, the essay I wrote for my assignment was of another ilk, something I did not know I was capable of,” he admits.
“But that’s what LSD is known for, after all. It is said to improve creative performance. That is why I decided to try it that first time. I had to do something about my falling grades...” he continues, his voice almost a whisper, a twinge of guilt, palpable.
Guilt, because, his “first” time did not stop there, and he went on to trip on LSD many times until he was addicted. After a few attempts, he discovered not all trips were happy ones that resulted in enhanced performance. Before he knew it, he began suffering from depression when his doses failed to help him perform in class.
Reality ‘un’ check?
Consuming drugs to satisfy one’s immediate needs, and eluding reality that has become too terrible to handle, has become a common trend. “This stems from youngsters’ need for instant gratification. The practice of persevering for a goal seems incredulous to them, and they seek refuge in drugs,” says Dr. Yusuf Merchant, a Mumbai-based psychiatrist.
Most youngsters who consume drugs — especially in the case of LSD — ingest small doses, a process called ‘microdosing’. They fallaciously assume that due to the almost negligible quantity, they will not experience any adverse effects, he continues.
Santhosh, a 24-year-old architecture graduate from Chennai, concurs. He elaborates on how he went through a stage where he was thoroughly disillusioned with life. He got into what he naively believed was a lasting friendship, only to wake up to the harrowing cognizance that he had been used as a “rich kid” pawn in their nasty machinations. “I began ingesting drugs. It was quite easy to procure. I knew someone who would get me whatever I needed from a source who operated from within the Chennai harbour premises,” he says. “Soon, I was a mere shadow of my former self. I experienced bouts of rage and depression if I didn’t get my regular doses. Life, back then, seemed to be a blurry, endless pursuit of waiting for Friday, which meant smokes, drinks, and drugs.”
The way out
For Trishna, quitting cold-turkey was ironically the result of being assaulted by a drunk friend. “I was in the smoking room when he took advantage of me,” she recalls. “Drugged as I was, I was not strong enough to overpower him. That absolute powerlessness I felt, made me quit overnight.”
Santhosh, however, explains that quitting was a Herculean task. When he approached a gym trainer to train him and the latter refused, knowing he was a junkie, it was the last straw that broke the camel’s back. “The trainer eventually agreed to train me after a month, if I returned with a clean blood report,” he says. “It was a torturous process. There were times when I would bite or physically harm myself not to give in to temptation. That was in the past. It has now been well over a year since I quit,” he says, the pride in his voice evident.
But, epiphany is not everyone’s cup of tea. 
Prevention
Dr. Merchant explains how all governments typically focus on supply-reduction measures. Naturally, the more one restricts supply, more the demand. “When it comes to school or college-goers, the answer lies in prevention — something about which the government is doing nothing concrete. A step in this direction is to involve youngsters. For instance, in conjunction with the World Health Organisation, my NGO — Drug Abuse Information Rehabilitation & Research Centre — conducted a programme where we trained students between 18-20 years and sent them to schools. There, the young trainers conducted a targeted intervention for school kids and taught them to deal with stress and peer-pressure — common denominators for drug addicts,” he elucidates.
“Another possible solution could be a scenario where educational institutions enforce the rule that those caught with drugs in their possession will be suspended for six months and sent for corrective action. Counsellors should be appointed on campus to scrutinise high-risk students — essentially, those who are regular absentees or continually underperform — and insist they meet the counsellor irrespective of whether or not they are under the influence of drugs. Thus, even those mulling over drug-related curiosity will think twice,” adds Dr. Merchant.
In Chennai, the Lifeline Centre for Prevention of Children from Alcoholism and Substance (Drug) Abuse in Chengalpattu, the State’s first de-addiction centre, was recently set up by the Department of Social Defence for children and juveniles in conflict with the law. “This is the first-of-its-kind centre in not just Tamil Nadu, but in south India. There is a centre in Delhi,” explains Chezian Ramu, the founder. “However, both models are different — while the one here is an open model, the former is a closed model, which is merely another observation home. Here, we believe children ought not be kept locked under complete observation. Hence, we decided that this will be a space where youngsters will undergo the process of de-addiction voluntarily, as opposed to being forced by family or society to do so. In other words, once the parents bring the youngster, we will ensure that the individual understands the de-addiction process that he or she will undergo, before opting for it. The parent can stay back here with the child for a week so that he or she too understands the situation,” he adds.
While innumerable measures have been taken to nip drug abuse in the bud, success seems elusive. However, in the words of Dr. Merchant, “Youngsters indulge in drugs to get away from the ‘here’. If we can find ways to make the ‘here and now’ better, drug abuse will surely and steadily decline.”

Don’t be a desperado "," 
What is the difference between ‘spat’ and ‘argument’? (B Mallika, Secunderabad)
In both cases, there is a disagreement about something between two individuals or two groups of individuals. ‘Spat’ is mostly used in informal contexts to refer to a quarrel about something trivial. The word, which can be used both as a noun and a verb, also carries with it the sense that the fight or quarrel did not last too long. In a spat, people usually lose their temper. This is not necessarily true in case of an ‘argument’; it is possible for two people to have an argument without any shouting. The duration of an argument can vary — it can be long or short. Also, in an argument, people may choose to convince the other individual by appealing to logic. A ‘spat’ is usually an emotional outburst.
Neeraja had a spat with her teenage daughter in the hotel lobby.
Ramu used to spat with his sister almost every day.
The students got into an argument with the police.
How is the word ‘desperado’ pronounced? (T Jagdish, Erode)
The ‘es’ in the first syllable sounds like the ‘es’ in ‘less’, ‘yes’ and ‘mess’; the vowel in the second, sounds like the ‘a’ in ‘china’. The ‘a’ in the third syllable sounds like the ‘a’ in ‘bath’, ‘path’ and ‘task’, and the final syllable rhymes with ‘no’, ‘so’ and ‘go’. The word is pronounced ‘des-pe-RAA-doe’ with the stress on the third syllable. There are many theories about the origin of this word. According to some scholars, it comes from the Spanish ‘desperado’ meaning a desperate or reckless individual; a criminal who is prone to violence and who is not unduly worried about the consequences of his action. Others believe it comes from the English ‘desperate’; a word which was once used both as a noun and an adjective.
Desperados frequented the seedy bar in the small town.
A couple of desperados robbed the priest.
What is the meaning of ‘pittance’? (S. Shalini, Nellore)
This rather informal word rhymes with ‘kittens’ and ‘mittens’. When you say that your salary or allowance is ‘pittance’, what you are suggesting is that it is not much; it is a meagre amount. You do not make enough to make ends meet. In your opinion, and perhaps in the opinion of others, you deserve to be paid a lot more.
Das needed cash; he ended up selling the house for a pittance.
For the amount of work Geetha does, she’s getting paid pittance.
The word was originally used to refer to the generous sum of money that rich people left for priests and monasteries. In return, on the occasion of the death anniversary, the priests/monks prayed for the departed soul of the patron. The pittance was used to buy food and wine. With the passage of time, the word took on a negative meaning because the amount of money willed to the religious institutions became smaller and smaller — they became paltry.
Which is correct? ‘Let’s go to the cinema’ or ‘Lets go to the movie’? (J Praveen, Tiruchi)
If what you want to suggest is ‘Let’s go to the cinema hall and watch a film’, then ‘Let’s go the cinema’ is correct. It is mostly used in British English. Americans, on the other hand, say ‘Let’s go to the movies’ and not ‘movie’.
Shyam and Vidya are going to the cinema/movies this weekend.

All about learning virtual reality "," We are in an era of digitisation. Technological advancements have an impact on almost every aspect of our lives on a daily basis, right from the way we communicate to how businesses are run. 
The impact of digitisation is also visible in the field of education and has effected major changes in how education is being imparted and consumed. Rote learning and reliance on printed material or book-based learning is fast becoming a thing of the past. A new era requires a recalibration of the education curricula to cater to new and emerging needs. Virtual Reality or VR has managed to do just that. 
Transcending barriers 
Though the use of books and other traditional tools have not been completely replaced as yet, VR technology has delivered an effective means through which digitisation and audio-visual aids can be more effectively harnessed to address current requirements of education and required outcome.
VR uses software-generated digital environment that allows a seemingly realistic interaction with simulated contents through VR-enabled headsets and embedded sensors. This medium has emerged as the ultimate in delivering digital contents as it gives way to an immersive learning experience. A learner can explore an archaeological site or explore the human anatomy right from within the classroom itself. 
The proliferation of smart phones and tablets capable of delivering VR contents and the reducing cost of VR headsets has made wide scale consumption of VR contents much more accessible to the masses. Though other digital formats such as PowerPoint, smart classrooms, audio/visual rooms, projectors etc., have been in use for quite some time now in education, none of them comes close to the immersive experience that VR delivers.
One of the highpoints associated with VR is that it transcends all logistical barriers of the real world. Students can walk the ocean floors or interact with the solar system from within the safety of their schools or colleges. In fact, VR can be effectively utilised in the training field as well, be it surgical training in medicine or understanding the working of complex machines. Training can be imparted in real world conditions without any associated risk through VR simulations. 
As opposed to passive learning through observation or listening, the simulated hands-on approach in VR has proven to be more effective in knowledge retention and VR contents can be re-used over and over again to reinforce key learnings. Other important outcomes of VR in education are increase in student’s motivation, improved knowledge absorption and classroom practices, etc.
It is therefore not surprising that the adoption of VR in the field of education is soaring. The traditional text books and digital aids will continue to co-exist for the foreseeable future. The technology associated with virtual reality itself is evolving and promises an exciting future. 
New technologies may emerge and new digital solutions may be invented but it is highly unlikely that any new intervention will have as much effect and supersede the role played by VR in revolutionising education.

Thriving in a state of flux "," Two opposing forces are pushing institutions of higher technical education into a tight corner. The first force is the rising industry demand for new competencies like IoT, engineering systems thinking, design thinking and entrepreneurship. Second, there are increasing concerns about student disengagement. The academic community is responding to these challenges by introducing changes in the curriculum. 
The 2018 AICTE curriculum is a case in point. It has proposed a reduction in the number of credits and an increase in industry-oriented courses so that undergraduate students are given space to pursue research and innovation. While the intent is good, a mere change in curriculum is not likely to address the problem. But implementation of the new curriculum without changes in pedagogy and practice may further disengage the students. It is important for engineering students to play a proactive role in this transition. Otherwise, they will be left with a degree, but no real competence. Let us see why.
A combination
In a recent industry conference, many leaders spoke about the imperatives for Industry 4.0. One of the key challenges pointed out, is the ability to translate emerging technologies like IoT into business value. Similarly, in the recent national conferences organised by ISRO, leaders were advocating the need for strong systems engineering competencies among young engineers, because, today, even sub-systems are complex and multi-disciplinary in nature. When the industry leaders refer to competency, they mean a combination of knowledge, skills and behaviours that emerges from practice in a certain real-world environment. They need engineers who can quickly acquire these and get into the practice. 
However, the academic model is not tuned to address the above need due to the following reasons. First, is the process of interpreting the need. The industry need is interpreted as packets of knowledge or courses to be added, modified or deleted. The skill and behavioural elements take a back seat. And course certification, in most cases, is about testing memory of facts and rules, not application of knowledge to real-world problems. 
Second, the pedagogy in engineering education has hardly changed over the years. Technology-enabled learning and access to a variety of digital knowledge bases has not fundamentally changed the process of classroom engagement. 
Third, is the inadequate appreciation of practice and learning by doing. Practice in an academic context is largely viewed as application of theory and accorded a lower status. Practice is not seen as a new form of knowledge.
Fourth, is the inadequate attention to project work by the students and the faculty. Final-year undergraduate students are more concerned about their future and use the project time to prepare for competitive exams, and the faculty also do not see potential for publications or patents in the projects. As a result, the little space provided for gaining competency is also not utilised.
Even if academic institutions make a sincere effort to adapt to the above challenges, the process of change is bound to create confusion in the minds of students. This is likely to happen both in existing and new institutions, public and private. New institutions may seem even more chaotic as they seek to develop their brands and institutional relations. Unfortunately, NIRF ranking may not reveal these micro-level instabilities. If students are not prepared for this transition, they can easily lose confidence in the system and the profession. On the other hand, if students play a proactive role in this process they can gain an extremely valuable competency — dealing with complexity, which commands a premium in the job market.

Tanvi Hemani's quest for knowledge "," Tanvi Hemani is a model student. Not only did she top in three of her five subjects earning her an overall score of 446/500 in her Class XII exams, she is also an artist, an athlete, and a dancer. This may seem ordinary for many but for Tanvi it is more than just that.
Accepting challenges
Tanvi is hearing-impaired and has been so since birth. At the age of seven months, it was found that Tanvi had profound hearing loss. Her parents had to make some tough decisions regarding Tanvi’s future. After coming to know about Balavidyalaya, which is considered one of the best schools for young deaf children, they made the choice to relocate from Kolkata to Chennai. Balavidyalaya helps children develop verbal language skills by making the best use of residual hearing, the ability to hear some sounds in spite of total hearing loss. The idea was that over a period of four years the training would help Tanvi and other children like her to be able to slowly start talking and eventually get fully integrated into a regular mainstream school.
When the time came for her to start Class I, Balavidyalaya helped find a school for Tanvi. From a list of possible schools that have had a history of accepting hearing- impaired children into regular classes, she eventually got admission in Sherwood Hall, Chennai. The primary concern for her parents was how Tanvi would be able to adjust into a more regular social environment and interact with other children. But the transition was smoother than expected and there was no looking back. Although initially struggling a little bit with language and speaking, Tanvi went on to excel at her academics as well as in various extra-curricular activities. She is an avid basketball player, winning numerous awards in sports as well as winning a State-level championship in painting. She was trained by her mother in lip reading right from a young age. She is also trained to pick up on vibrations from her surroundings, especially in the case of emergencies. This was a skill which she honed that helped her learn both classical and western dance. At the age of 13, Tanvi received her first cochlear implant in one ear and therapy with which her speaking and listening skills have vastly improved and she is able to communicate much better.
There were many challenges Tanvi faced during her studies. With the support of faculty and teachers at Sherwood Hall, she had been able to overcome them. One faculty in particular was Mrs. Anita George, the school’s academic consultant. She guided Tanvi through her difficulties, encouraged and motivated her during her Class XI and Class XII. Tanvi has currently received admission in Stella Maris College to pursue a Bachelor of Visual Arts, her dream degree. 
It only goes to show, that with perseverance, hard work, motivation and having the right kind of support system to back you up in any difficulties, no challenge can be too hard to overcome.

What makes a meaningful life?
"," Do you find that you have to drag yourself to college every day? Do you find the class stimulating, or do you switch off, the moment the professor walks in? Have you chalked out your short and long-term goals? Or, are you merely drifting along? In a nutshell, do you feel there is meaning to your life?
Of course, ‘meaning’ in life can come in umpteen forms. Some people derive satisfaction from academic pursuits, others from sporting achievements. Many derive meaning from relationships with family, friends and significant others. For some, their life purpose may stem from professional success, while others may lose themselves in a hobby. Some may find religious activities or a spiritual outlook providing direction to their lives. And, for most people, meaning is found in multiple domains. 
According to psychologist Michael Steger, people who believe their lives are meaningful, tend to do better on a number of dimensions. They are happier, more satisfied, feel they exert more control over their lives, and are more engaged in their work. Further, those whose lives are imbued with meaning also tend to be less depressed, are less likely to engage in substance abuse or have suicidal thoughts. 
Subjective
But what exactly does a meaningful life entail? Like many psychological constructs, iteludes definition. However, Steger argues that there are two major dimensions to it The first, purpose, relates to a human need to act and involves our goals and aims. The second, significance, refers to a pan-human tendency to make sense of our lives and our place in the world. Thus, Steger defines meaning in life “as the extent to which people comprehend, make sense of, or see significance in their lives, accompanied by the degree to which they perceive themselves to have a purpose, mission, or overarching aim in life.”
Of course, our sense of meaning also changes with time and circumstance. When the going is smooth, most people derive meaning from the various roles they are engaged in — student, parent, friend, lawyer, accountant or dancer. However, life also hurls googlies at us every now and then. And, when we feel we are at the nadir of our lives, meaning may seem as elusive as catching shadows. Whether we are battling cancer, mourning the loss of a loved one, regretting a failed marriage, feeling immobilised for getting the pink slip, or worse, if we are pummelled simultaneously on multiple fronts, we may feel rudderless, and life may seem devoid of purpose.
But, we need not despair that all is lost even when we are at the ebb of our lives. In fact, one of the most touching paeans to finding meaning in the most abject conditions imaginable is Viktor Frankl’s Man’s Search for Meaning. Imprisoned in gruesome Nazi concentration camps, he was surprised by “how much we could endure” both physically and psychologically. As he writes in the prologue to the 1992 edition, “Life holds a potential meaning under any conditions, even the most miserable ones.” For Frankl, his love for his wife was what gave him fortitude to withstand the harshest of realities. 
According to Frankl, “Everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms — to choose one’s attitude in any given set of circumstances.” So, no matter how dire your circumstances may seem now, the manner in which you deal with life’s blows is a “spiritual freedom” that “makes life meaningful and purposeful.”

An IIT course with a touch of engineering, medicine and humanities
"," The field of medicine, though a science, cannot solely rely on just that. Dealing with humans, their emotional and physical conditions, it becomes necessary for practitioners of medicine to rely on the human and cultural aspect as well. While some of it is learnt on the job, there are now increasing opportunities for students of medicine to draw on the knowledge of diverse but relevant fields such as literature, art, psychology, history, anthropology, music and much more, through the study of medical humanities.
The field of Medical Humanities is relevant to both practitioners and students of medicine because they are dealing with human beings, and understanding the various ways in which people experience pain, suffering, and well-being is important to enrich their knowledge.
Different perspectives
Interestingly, IIT Hyderabad offers Medical Humanities Course for students of engineering and allied sciences. The purpose, the Institute says, is to introduce students to humanities and social science perspectives about the human body, health, and illness experience. 
The optional course (worth 1 credit) is conducted by Shubha Ranganathan, Assistant Professor, Department of Liberal Arts, and Haripriya Narasimhan, Head of Liberal Arts Department, at IIT Hyderabad, who explain its relevance to students of engineering.
“Apart from encountering experiences of pain and suffering in their own lives, as human beings, engineering students will often go on to do research on applications in the field of medicine. Therefore, a different perspective on technologies and human experience would enrich their understanding and may enable them to apply some of these perspectives in medical innovations.”
For instance, for perspectives from literature and art, in one of the classes, a guest lecturer looked at the description of post-traumatic stress disorder among male soldiers who returned from the World Wars in literature. The course also covered a special issue of the online journal Cafe Dissensus (2016) which looked at works of art produced by differently-abled people.
Cultural notions such as gender, and class, and hierarchy also play a major factor in influencing medical experience and practice. For example, doctors may respond to people from different class positions in a different manner, or they may interact with men and women differently, explain professors Ranganathan and Narasimhan.
The course, they say, helps argue in favour of studying humanities along with engineering. “Humanities disciplines show students a different way of seeing the world, that the world/life is not about problems and solutions only; that one needs to understand the history and the context before one can proceed to ‘solve’ any ‘problem’. This course will bring the ‘human’ element to the centre of discussion...”
An interdisciplinary course like medical humanities can also add to the niche knowledge that students acquire in their undergraduate programme. Recently, one of the classes featured a detailed discussion about the social angle to the issue of disability. The social model of disability emphasises the role of society in designing and building environments that are accessible, so that people with diverse bodies can live fully enabled lives.
“While I was speaking about the psychology of a patient to one of my doctor friends, he was shocked by the way I was explaining a patient’s situation when they go to a doctor,” says Prithvi Gude, a former student at IIT-Hyderabad. “I feel a student needs to have a knowledge of multiple things for his development. Hence, when this course was offered, I was very happy to take it and learn many things, which I never explored before.”
Course details
Duration: 5 weeks, 3 hours per week

Writing for recognition
"," I look at the pile of answer booklets with some sense of anticipation — and a little trepidation. There’s always a tinge of hopeful excitement at the beginning of a new academic session, when we are on the verge of welcoming a new group of students and research scholars into the department. One group is screened on the basis of machine-read optical-character-recognition sheets, unmediated by humans. Another is evaluated in the old way, by people reading answers written out in longhand.
Apart from the usual difficulties that teachers face in evaluating subjective essays, there is an additional problem that we often face, and that has nothing to do with the substance of an answer, but its appearance. Some of the submissions are written in a script that is near impossible to read, the writing is an impenetrable scrawl, or the letters are so tiny that I wish I had a magnifier to make them visible.Often, dense writing covers page after page, with no paragraph breaks or markers to tell me that the writer is moving from one point or idea to the next.
Balancing act
I do get that students are tense and anxious, wanting to put down everything they know (or disguising what they don’t know) in the limited time available in an examination. By and large, evaluators are a tolerant lot; they understand the pressures examinees are under, and take a charitable attitude towards answer scripts — but at minimum, they must be able to figure out what’s in them.
Writing an examination is a delicate balancing act; you have to understand the question, pull out of your mind the specific bits of information that the answer requires, figure out the level of detail needed, and then fit it all into the time given. But writing an exam is only half the process. The person at the other end — the reader — completes the other part. They need to know that you have understood the question and its scope and have provided an appropriate and adequate response. If the writing and organisation of the answer does not allow for easy reading, it would be difficult for even the kindest and most charitable evaluator to rate it — let alone rate it high.
In recent years, the quality of handwriting (what used to be called “penmanship”) has received less attention, partly because of the entry of the computer. But all through school, and most of college, we are still required to write by hand. We don’t need to be calligraphists, but it would help to develop a clear, strong hand, one that can be read without too much effort. Keep in mind that the person who is reading the script is most likely faced with a big pile of similar answer books, and must have the ability to decipher several different styles of handwriting, while also looking for whether the key points and arguments have been made. The higher the level of the examination, the more crucial it is that the writing is clear in style, content, and appearance.
So, as you prepare to write that exam, make sure you work on achieving a reasonable level of clarity — in what you write, and how you write it. Remember, there’s a person at the other end who needs to understand it!

‘Rent-a-lab’ policy to bring revenues to institutions
"," The government has proposed a new policy that could transform scientific instruments in government labs into lucrative assets generating a steady rental income. It plans to hire out to researchers all lab equipment that cost more than ₹10 lakh. This would also reduce the amount of time such expensive instruments remain idle.
“To promote ease of access, sharing and monitoring, the granting agencies will henceforth tabulate and put all equipments funded by it costing more than ₹10 lakh on the Internet, to be accessed by researchers,” says a note on the website of the Department of Science and Technology (DST).
The policy, called the Scientific Research Infrastructure Management and Networks (SRIMAN), wouldn’t, “for the present,” apply to strategic sectors. The policy is open to public comments for a month.
Explaining the policy’s rationale, the government noted that it was “common” to find in Indian laboratories, expensive equipment lying idle. A “large number” are not shared and are plagued by issues such as maintenance and availability of spares.
“This adds to the burden of research infrastructure costs,” the document noted.
The new system, according to the policy, envisages institutions declaring on a website how often their instruments would be available for use by those outside the department or university. Those who would like to use, for example, a DNA-sequencing machine, would have to pay a fee and specify the purpose and time they would want it for.
Currently, the practice of researchers bidding for time-slots to use lab instruments is typically seen more with very expensive equipment, such as radio telescopes and particle-accelerators, which cost crores of rupees. A biologist with a government lab, who didn’t want to be identified, said the policy had set a “low bar (₹10 lakh) for instruments” and that could mean that the government could potentially deny funds to buy equipment to researchers. “₹5-10 lakh is no longer a prohibitive cost for the kind of research and results expected today. Because the bar is so low, a researcher could be asked to spend time scouring for minor equipment [to lease],” he said.
“There are several universities that cannot afford expensive equipment. At the same time, these aren’t used beyond 20%-30% of their life time,” said Ashutosh Sharma, Secretary, DST. The larger plan is to develop “clusters” of instrumentation facilities.

Integrating body and mind "," The whole world is turning towards the Indian subcontinent to find not immediate but long-lasting answers to the fundamental questions of life. “In that sense India is a spiritual oasis. However, there isn’t much of this holistic view in clinical psychology and therapeutic practices which are currently dominated by the western theories, both of the mind and the body,” observes Brinda Jacob-Janvrin, Founder, Studio for Movement Arts and Therapies (SMART), Bangalore.
It is to tap this rich spiritual reservoir of the East and employ it in the field of therapy, Samaghama, an intensive course for professional counsellors and therapists has been conceptualised. Samaghama comprises of an eight-month training and a four-month research, it is founded on the basic principle that body, mind and spirit are all connected and are in continuum. Brinda asserts that it is not just the mental disturbances that cause diseases, but also bodily illness can result in mental sickness. “Therefore a holistic approach to overall health of the individual is the need of the hour which demands integration of knowledge from different disciplines and epistemic world-views that are hitherto disconnected,” she argues. 


“The course is aimed at raising awareness of the participants about the confluence of physical, mental and spiritual aspects in themselves,” says Brinda, who has designed the course along with Dr. Leonilla Ageira, a metaphysical practitioner.
This one of a kind course that is beginning in September is aimed at understanding the human expression, body, emotions, energies, health and well-being at a deeper level. “The participants of this course therefore need to have basic training in yoga, expressive arts, therapy or psychology,” says Brinda, who also conducts a programme in expressive and creative arts therapies and a workshop called ‘the body remembers’ at SMART. “Samaghama will be an advanced course to those who have attended the expressive arts therapy course,” says Brinda, who started off as a contemporary dancer and later ventured into art therapy and counselling in UK and India.
The idea to begin such a course actually spurred when students of depth psychotherapy from John F. Kennedy University were at SMART for a two-week residential programme. “JFK University wants to explore further what Psychoanalyst Carl Jung theorised in India during the last century. The University is willing to collaborate and render its expertise to this course which also explores Jungian philosophy,” she informs.
“Only when a therapist finds a balance in her personal life, will she be able to serve her clients effectively. Unlike other professions, this one particularly demands mental clarity and stability from a therapist,” asserts Brinda, who feels that personal journey is as important as the professional.
Therefore, a course like this would take these professionals who work in the body-mind modality to a deeper understanding of themselves. “Isn’t it invigorating to explore deeper and come in contact with what lies within you?” asks Brinda.

For that edge in the workplace
"," In today’s competitive job market, having a degree may not get you your dream job, unless you have relevant work experience, which has become a mandatory part of the curriculum in today’s education system. Getting a degree can be a tremendous asset for gaining knowledge; however, it is not the only way to stand out, for potential employment. Today, work experience plays an important role in becoming ‘workplace-ready’.
In order to kickstart your career, having relevant work experience could set you apart from other freshers appearing for a job interview. It can prove to be an asset while appearing in the placement process. Often, students get confused about how they can attain work experience without working full-time in an organisation. However, there are a number of opportunities such as internships, freelancing, part-time jobs, and so on, which can be pursued alongside one’s studies. Here are some factors which demonstrate the importance of work experience:
Advanced knowledge: While academics ensure you gain subjective knowledge, working in the industry can bring an understanding of a workplace, which is important. Students become aware of the job, as well as work environment
Gateway to the dream job: Considering today’s job scenario, work experience can prove to be an added advantage to students’ resumes. Employers prefer candidates who have some knowledge of the industry. It becomes an important part of becoming workplace-ready. 
Skill development: Work experience is a great way to develop fundamental employability skills such as communication, problem-solving, creativity, teamwork, and so on, which ensures personality development.
Extensive career options: With work experience, your career options are not limited to the fresher profiles. An experienced student can apply for different profiles which ask for relevant work experience. There are a number of ways a students can obtain attain work experience while studying. These include summer, winter, and virtual internships, national and international volunteering, and active participation in college corporate events
Working in an organisation while pursuing a degree enables a student to implement essential concepts acquired from learning into the real working situations. Experience has become the need of the hour in order to become work-place ready.
Recruiters prefer candidates who are experienced in relevant fields. Though one can’t claim that academics is less valued than work experience, the practical implementation of learned concepts in training makes it more valid in the eyes of recruiters.

Time to choose
"," Much water has flown under the bridge, over the years, in the education sphere. The introduction of NEET for medical entrance, two years back, was one of the major developments that has now come to stay. The government’s initiative to upgrade the Stateboard syllabus in is on in full swing, with technology being used (QR codes) for classes I, VI, and IX text books which encourages teachers and students to enjoy the video sessions of the concept they are learning. There is a positive movement palpable in this regard.
Informed decision
Students are also exposed to various technological improvements. With over-the-top (OTT) media like YouTube, and other social media, the level of engagement with students has changed. Smart classrooms with technology support have changed the way learning happens in schools. AR/VR is being used to explain concepts in math and science so that students are able to understand concepts better. While on one end of the spectrum technology is taking the lead, the teacher-student relationship is also evolving. Thus, it is only relevant to ask a question which will be useful for students and parents — when can a student decide his/her choice of career, after class XII, and which is the ideal age for students to take an informed decision with the help of parents and teachers?
According to Dr. Rajmohan, MD, Bodhi, a professional assessment organisation administering psychometric tests for various levels, ideally, a student should complete his/her psychometric test when he or she is in classes IX or X for, that is when he or she has a little maturity to visualise the outcome of his or her decision. Psychometric tests, with their analysis and counselling, provide insights into candidates’ personality and helps them identify their courses for class XI. 
Another question to be asked is, who is responsible for students’ future — parents or teachers? According to Sivakumar Palaniappan, a professional speaker, in the earlier days of Gurukul system, the guru or teacher, was responsible for the shisya or students’ holistic development. Today’s modern day demands, however, have necessitated a dichotomy where teachers support and ensure that students understand the subject well, do well in the exams, and apply themselves better, while in terms of life skills, values and ethics, parents have a moral responsibility.
School education should build up the confidence of students with deep subject knowledge and also life skills, and it is the combined role of the family and school to ensure that students are on the right track. It is important to inculcate values and ethics in the students. Courses on civics and moral science still hold value as they form the basis of character building in students, the foundation on which is built their career and personal life.
Besides academics, students who have other extracurricular interests should be motivated to pursue them. Sports, music, artistic abilities, and more, should be promoted and encouraged by schools for, it is through such activities that team dynamics and interpersonal skills of students are developed.

‘We used to debate with our teachers’
"," While recalling his formative years, Kannada poet-writer-folklorist Chandrasekhar Kambar discusses the inspirational role played by his teachers.
Born in Ghodgeri village in Belgaum district, Kambar spent his childhood as a cattle herder until his uncle placed him in a government school. Kambar’s parents were blacksmiths. Accomplished novelist Krishnamoorthy Puranik was among his early teachers. At school, every week, one class was dedicated to poetry. Puranik encouraged the students to write their own poems and read them out to the class, recalls 82-year-old Kambar.
Kambar started writing stories when he was bored or to cope with personal problems. Puranik saw great potential in Kambar as a writer and therefore asked the boy’s parents to send him to Shivalinga Mutt where he would receive better education. Kambar would later go on to pursue his BA at Lingaraj College in Belgaum, where renowned scholars, which included A.K. Ramanujan and Bhoosnoormath, were his teachers.
“They made the class lively by interacting with us. Thanks to them, I started liking John Keats very much. Even after class hours, we would have discussions on a wide range of topics. We would often enter into a debate with our teachers,” says Kambar, who is president of Sahitya Akademi and a Jnanpith awardee.
When he went to Dharwad to pursue an MA degree, musician Rajeev Taranath influenced him, and later writer Kirtinath Kurtkoti. Among the qualities he has imbibed from his teachers was an ability to be inspired by one’s surroundings. His village became the inspiration for all that he wrote.
“The singing voices of villagers and drum beats would transport me to a world of myths, metaphors and symbols,” he says, adding that his songs were all born there. “I grew up as a cattle herder and during that time, the Britishers had quarters near the Gokak Falls. The villagers seemed to be charmed by anything English. Even though I was only a child, it bothered me that we were trying to mimic them, despite having a rich culture of our own. That was the theme of my first ballad which I wrote while at college,” he adds.
Much appreciation
The ballad became so popular that during his stint at the University of Chicago, Ramanujan asked him to post it to him, and the professor popularised it further. Kambar’s works were always appreciated and he was encouraged to write more.
“In the college magazine, my poem would appear on the first few pages. My poetry had long narratives and was steeped in folk culture drawn from my village,” says the Padma Shri awardee.
Kambar also used to constantly communicate with well-known poets of those days, send his works and seek feedback from them. His plays were also inspired by folk literature. He would grab any opportunity, be it a youth festival or a gathering of literary personalities, to offer his work as a recital. “I loved to sing” he says. To youngsters keen on writing, Kambar says: “Start by expressing in your mother tongue, you become more creative.”

Immersive learning
"," Having secured offers from the best universities in the U.K., I was juggling between them before finally deciding on Newcastle University. In this ultra-modern era, it is imperative to understand rapidly evolving and agile businesses, innovation, technology, and operations, and further apply the acquired knowledge in one’s professional career. Being tripled accredited and among the top business schools in the world, Newcastle University, through its MBA course, offers essential opportunities to enhance skills and create good leaders. 
Quality training 
The course is well-structured, and some of the best academicians in the world impart quality academic training. The modules are linked well with and can be effectively applied to real-world challenges, workshops and more. MBA students are given priority for major leadership events, to enable networking with reputed organisations, speakers and leaders. The cohort of students is diverse, comprising experienced professionals from across the world. They bring expert insights to the table, enabling me to continuously expand my knowledge.
Coping
Life in Newcastle is happening — the city and the university are highly rated by students for the lifestyle and cost of living. Being an international student, I was always in a dilemma about coping with a different way of living and mingling with foreign students. However, my worries disappeared quickly. There are ample Indian food chains, restaurants and supermarkets with items at reasonable prices. The weather is cold, with temperatures even dipping to -3°C at times. We get the opportunity to engage in fun activities and social work, which are either organised or supported by the students’ union. I have learnt a lot, something I will cherish for a lifetime.

Fixed or flexible?
"," You know that textbook picture of gears — wheels, spokes and plates that seem to be arranged in a perfect design that allows the wheels and spokes to turn? Some parts move, while others stay firmly in place, refusing to budge, even as the moving bits pull and push past them. It struck me that life’s a bit like that — it has things that remain constant and others that shift and change, elements that one simply has to accept, and others that can be altered. 
Some months ago, I had written about how it is important to understand the difference between a situation and a problem. A situation is something like those immovable, fixed parts of a machine, while a problem has both fixed and moveable parts, and the search for a solution is largely about identifying the latter and getting them to align with each other. Maybe not the best analogy,but it struck me that it could give us a way of getting through rough patches…or even just working our way through an everyday problem.
Break down components
It is useful to look at our lives at any given moment, in terms of these fixed and flexible components. There are some things that do not change, some that change with time (continuous but evolving factors), and some that can be controlled by us. If we are happy with the way things are and feel no anxiety, then, we may not need to fiddle with anything; changes will continue to balance with the needs naturally, as we go along. But if we are caught in a difficult situation, it helps to take it apart and see what these elements are, and which ones we can actually work on, rather than trying to push against the immovable ones which will refuse to budge and sap our energy, in the process.
Let’s take one kind of problem: a difficult college course that we seem to be stuck with. A refrain that we might often encounter is, “too bad, you are stuck with it, now deal with it”. But what exactly are you stuck with? How do you deal with it? You can pick apart the situation at various levels of detail. Let us assume, for now, that you do not want to walk away from the course, as it might involve giving up on the programme entirely, and an accompanying financial loss (apart from the disapproval of parents or others). So, the “immovable” factors might be —the course syllabus, instructor, schedule and location, and your presence and other academic requirements
There is no point wasting time complaining about these. The factors that are within your control include the effort you put in (inside and outside class), the help you seek, the resources (time, materials) you draw upon. These are the gears you need to move to make the output — satisfactory performance — happen.
In other situations, too, you can try to analyse the three kinds of elements so that you see where you can actually focus your energies, rather than worrying about those that you cannot change, or that arise from the larger circumstances. It is something like the serenity prayer, asking for wisdom to see the difference between the things you can change and those you cannot.

Get hands-on
"," Everyone has heard ‘experience needed’ while applying for jobs. However, what is confusing is how one could be a fresh graduate and have experience. A lot of students get caught in this dilemma and struggle to escape this vicious circle. A solution could be internships and part-time jobs.
Internships, is one of the best and the worst things that can happen to a student. While some of them are paid, others are not. However, an internship will always help you gain experience and add a lot to your CV too. 
Training
While theory classes help us understand the basics, internships and work experience help us learn about the real world through the ‘on-job training’ technique. While choosing a career option, one needs to take care that whatever one chooses, is going to be their daily work for a few years at least. Therefore, one should always be sure of what they want to do before they start hunting for jobs. In order to be sure, it is always helpful to first work as an intern for a while. “If you wish to know the nuances of any field, do an internship during your college life. I would recommend that internships should be a part of the course curriculum,” said Kush Kalra, Advocate, Delhi High Court.
Bhavna Batra, Assistant Professor, Amity Law School, feels that everyone “needs experience to get experience. Finding a job can be difficult if one does not have an experience. Internships are protracted towers to capture and attain valuable experiences and encourage the interns to acquaint themselves with the terrain they are interested in.”
No more coffee
Ashina Khurana, who interned for two and a half years during her three years of Bachelors shared her experience, “When I started to look for internships, five years back, it was difficult to get something suitable. And this meant compromising to get anything rather than what you wish for. But now it is easy. And thanks to social media and some internship related websites it has paved the path for students.” Talking about the same, Bhavna feels that the intern world has drastically changed as they can play an indispensable and integral role in bringing crisp and contemporary notions on the table.”
No job is small
While the people in West have never been shy of getting a part-time job in a supermarket or a diner, Indians have often assumed that these are jobs performed by people who belong to families of ‘lower income groups’ only. The youngsters are now trying to break out of this mind-set, calling all jobs as equal.
Naman Vasal, who is now a Business Development Manager, recalls his experience . “I wanted to work in a supermarket in India to earn money instead of asking for pocket money but to no avail. Not a very graceful job in society for someone whose father makes a decent amount to raise the kid.”
With the concept of part-time jobs and work experiences garnering attention, students get to learn various qualities and abilities that they fail to learn within the confines of a classroom. In order to develop communication skills, time management and so on its important to broaden our minds and take up jobs that break stereotypes.

Be confident, not officious
","What is the difference between ‘officious’ and ‘official’? (A Khelkar, Pune)
 The word ‘official’ is frequently used in everyday contexts to refer to someone who has the authority or the power to do something. People talk about ‘police official’, ‘government official’, and so on. The word can be used as a noun and an adjective when you talk about the ‘official spokesperson’ of a political party, you mean that he is the authorised or appointed individual. The word ‘officious’ (e-FISH-es), on the other hand, is used only as an adjective, and it has a rather negative meaning. When you say that someone is ‘officious’, you mean that he is an official who asserts his authority very aggressively even in the case of trivial matters. This individual has an inflated opinion about his importance. The word has another meaning as well someone who meddles in other people’s business can also be called ‘officious’.
The officious clerk seldom looked at people and always sounded rude.
What I like about Dilip’s parents is that they’re seldom officious.
How is the word ‘debonair’ pronounced? (V Anirudh, Secunderabad)
The ‘e’ in the first syllable of this old-fashioned word is like the ‘e’ in ‘set’, ‘pet’ and ‘get’, and the following ‘o’ sounds like the ‘a’ in ‘china’. The final syllable rhymes with ‘bare’, ‘care’ and ‘share’. The word is pronounced ‘deb-e-NARE’ with the stress on the third syllable. It comes from the French ‘de bon’ aire’ meaning ‘of good race’. Nowadays, the word is mostly used with men. When you refer to a man as being ‘debonair’, what you are suggesting is that he is a charming, confident and stylishly dressed individual. Ladies are usually drawn to his charm and sophistication.
Who’s the debonair man in the three-piece suit?
Girls swooned when the debonair professor walked into the classroom.
What is the meaning of the expression ‘meet someone half way’? (J Uma, Erode)
This is an expression mostly used in informal contexts to mean ‘to compromise’. When you negotiate with someone, what is it that usually happens? You make certain demands, and then proceed to negotiate with the other party. They may be willing to meet some of your demands, but not all. In order to reach an agreement, both of you compromise; you do not insist on all your demands being met. The two of you arrive at an agreement by each one of you giving up something. When two parties meet each other half way, they agree to do a part of what the other wants.
The bill couldn’t be passed because the Opposition wasn’t willing to meet the Government half way.
I wanted 60 lakhs for the flat and Abdul was quoting 50. We both met halfway and settled on 55 lakhs.
Is it okay to say, ‘You’d better take care of not shouting at Jyothi’?
 No, it is not. The expression ‘take care of’ is usually used to mean to look after someone. We normally talk about ‘taking care of one’s parents/children/health’, etc. In the example that you have given, you are not requesting someone to look after Jyothi. What you would like the person to do is not shout at Jyothi. We normally say, ‘You’d better take care not to shout at Jyothi’.
Raj better take care not talk to Satish’s girlfriend.
You’d better take care not to make my boss angry.

Bon app-etit
"," Studies have shown that there is a strong link between lifestyle and productivity. The more systematic one’s lifestyle, the better the productivity. An essential part of this is taking care of one’s habits as well as physical and mental fitness. Here are some apps that will help you stay on track.
Yoga Studio: Mind & Body
 Yoga is among the most holistic ways of maintaining fitness. If you don’t have the time to go outside to attend classes, this app will enable you to practise yoga in the comfort of your home. It features HD videos of more than 70 unique yoga and meditation classes accompanied by a teacher’s commentary.

Forest: Stay Focused
 Addiction to using smartphones is a valid cause of concern these days, and not without reason. It might seem ironic to use an app to beat this addiction, but Forest: Stay Focused does the trick. Here’s how it works. First, one needs to plant a seed in the app. This seed eventually grows into a tree. However, the moment one uses one’s phone — whether it’s for checking social media notifications, playing a game or watching videos — the tree starts withering away. Attached to the tree is a sense of responsibility and achievement, which helps one beat the addiction. (http://bit.ly/2LSTOGN)

Connect with your virtual teacher "," It’s not easy to take up the job of teaching when you love the comforts of your home, do not like being told how to teach and want a good pay at the same time. However, e-teaching is here to change it all and provide you with what you want.
With the pioneering of digitalisation in India, education sector has taken complete advantage of the opportunity of online education. E-learning in India is not new yet it is, in a way of approaching the students. With the advantages of studying at the comfort of your home, re-watching a video to clarify or revise and studying at a time comfortable for you, e-learning is giving a tough competition to the classrooms.
Virtual classrooms
Not only is it helping students but at the same time it is also a hot job these days for teachers who want to teach from home and do not want the hassles of arranging tuition classes. Not only does it save you time and money it also gets you to reach a far greater number of students than classroom teaching, and that’s what a lot of teachers these days are looking for.
Teachers can devote their time to prepare lessons comfortably just the way students can watch the videos at their convenience. The approach teachers take are not bound to organisational rules and have freedom to teach different topics. Not only do teachers prepare lessons but also solve doubts and pretty much cover all the aspects of classroom learning. 
Through e-teaching, teachers are able to help students to gain from the video lessons they provide through virtual teaching. The moral responsibility of imparting education to underprivileged students who are unable to afford expensive coaching is also solved by e-teaching to a great extent. Teachers can reach out to places where it is otherwise physically difficult to teach. It aims to provide education to all and to uplift students who can’t afford expensive coaching and travelling costs.
Sometimes, it is not possible for institutions to hire the best teachers due to financial constraints and sometimes the teachers do not like being associated with coaching classes. In fact, even the age factor can be negated when you teach online because you don’t have to consider the long hours of staying in school or the continuous coaching classes for hours together.
There is no spoon-feeding and hence students have to think on their own, try problem-solving without any help which benefits what they have been taught.
The constant increase in popularity of online courses among students are making teachers too take the path of online teaching as their main job. With accessible technology and the comfort it offers there is no looking back for the ones who opt for online teaching profession.

How relevant are entrance exams?
"," 


By introducing entrance exams and not enrolling people to major positions holistically, we have been able to control the problem of nepotism in educational institutions, to a major extent. To screen candidates from a population of 1.3 billion is a herculean task, and entrance exams help in selecting people for elite jobs and universities. To overhaul the current system, it should consist of more segregation to give a platform for the growing population to compete.




 Measuring the effectiveness of an applicant through competitive exams is not an issue, but giving them a majority weighage (min. 80%) is the real concern. Merely conducting personal interviews and group discussions is not enough, especially with 15% share. Better techniques must be introduced to analyse an applicant’s effectiveness. So, while competitive exams are necessary, their proportion in the overall student analysis should be reduced.




 The overhaul in the screening process is required due to the changing facets of education and competitiveness. Past experiences show that we are more concerned with the knowledge, but to serve the purposes of these exams, a synthesis of aptitude, attitude, and critical mental framework is required. 
Further, some new changes should be introduced in the exam patterns like UPSC such as increasing the weightage of disaster management and setting a level playing ground for the optional part. Also, the assessment process should be modified in a multidimensional manner.




Exams such as CAT and GATE are measure to judge students’ effectiveness. Cracking these exams is not a piece of cake, as they require discipline and patience, and hard work is the pre-requisite. So, they are not just exams but a journey where we get a chance to analyse our abilities. Also, if someone is not able to crack these exams, it does not mean he/she is incapable, as students often associate these entrances with success in life.

CEG @225: Illustrious engineering
"," Walking across the vast campus, opposite Gandhi Mandapam on Chennai’s Sardar Patel Road, is an illuminating experience. The winding tar road that leads you inside the campus, is flanked by monuments and shrouded in verdant stretches of land. On one side, is a temple-like structure, while on the other, is a gaggle of youngsters lazing around on stone benches, catching up on gossip, exchanging notes, or just grabbing some “me” time. But the pièce de résistance is the majestic Red Stone building that looms before you, filling you with an inexplicable sense of purpose. This year, the College of Engineering, Guindy (CEG) has entered its 225th year.
India’s first engineering college, CEG was started in 1794 as School of Survey, and established as a college in 1859. At present, it has 23 departments and 590 colleges affiliated to it. Over the years, the college has witnessed a sea-change in the manner in which engineering has evolved. Anna University’s Vice Chancellor, M.K. Surappa, traces the evolution of engineering over the years, his pride palpable. “A gradual paradigm shift, in our country’s engineering education, has been visible in the last 200 years. Today, technology which we had never imagined could exist, has moulded our lives in unthinkable ways,” he believes.
“During the pre-independence years, engineers were taught about surveying, building bridges, and canals. Soon after independence, however, we had innumerable challenges — we were below the poverty line, people were starving, and we lacked infrastructure other than the railways and the British canal systems. Gradually, engineers built steel plants. Public sector undertakings such as HAL, ITI, and others, emerged. Thus, our main focus was to ensure that we had engineering graduates who were adept in the fields of mechanical, civil, electrical, and aerospace engineering. Naturally, the intake in the field increased. Today, it has been further revolutionised with the advent of the Internet, paving way for the digital era,” the VC continues. “Today, engineering is no more a subject that flies solo; over the years, it has taken on an interdisciplinary aspect. It is not enough, for instance, for engineers to merely build machines. Now, they have to also study related subjects such as psychology, biology, and more, to understand the needs of people, and build technology that will also lend itself to solving society’s problems or bridging gaps that people didn’t know existed. And that is what CEG is preparing its students for — to not only be successful theoretically, but to be able to think critically, and meet the demands of the future.”
Then and now
The field, which was once deemed a male bastion, has over the years witnessed many women making a mark and carving a niche for themselves, an observation made by Dean, T.V. Geetha, who is also CEG’s first woman dean. “I joined the college as a student in 1977, and pursued electronics and communication. After graduation, I joined the college in a temporary capacity. I was one among the first women who had reached this stage, back then,” she reminisces. “The first class I handled was for the department’s technical staff. They were surprised to see me eloquently explain technical terms and concepts. Now, however, the faculty comprises a majority of women,” she exclaims.
Vish A. Viswanathan, CEO, UBICS, who passed out of the college in 1985, points out one other change in the field.“Engineering has now become competitive. From being a profession for only a few, it has now become quite popular with various sections of the society. Professionals have increased opportunities from both public and private sectors. In fact, the percentage of engineers in the private sector has grown disproportionately due to the increasing demand for such skills in private sector growth,” he avers.
Innovations galore
What many of CEG’s illustrious alumni are proud of is how the college took science and technology outside classrooms, providing young, untethered minds a chance to explore, innovate, and create. Viswanathan says, “As far back as 1900, our engineers were involved in nation-building activities such as survey, construction of monuments, agriculture and irrigation engineering, telecommunications (BSNL, AIR, for instance), and more. From 1920 to 1970, CEG was a breeding ground for outstanding graduates who were absorbed by government organisations to apply their conceptual learning and address real-world problems.”
An example of the most innovative work is that of an alumnus, Dr. Varghese Kurien, the father of the White Revolution, who created what is now Amul, says Vishwanathan. “He used the power of his engineering knowledge to revolutionise how the country’s dairy industry worked, transforming us from a milk-starved country to a milk excess country, in a matter of a few years. Yet another alumnus, Dr K.L. Rao, was instrumental in building various famous dams in the country including Nagarjunasagar dam, Hirakud dam, among others.”
Saravan Krishna, a graduate from the 2015 batch, concurs. “CEG has a glorious history of producing stalwarts in various fields. Students are constantly encouraged to involve themselves in activities and projects that transcend the realm of classrooms — we have over 20 student clubs focusing on techno-management, entrepreneurship, robotics, and so on. These clubs and their events give us tremendous opportunity to innovate and lead. This ensures that students tune themselves to the real world rather than merely being theoretically sound,” he insists.
Saravan believes engineers are the main players in the digital revolution, and to ensure India moves forward, technology, infrastructure and renewable energy are essential. “In terms of academia, it is time to improve quality and reduce quantity — there is an excess of engineering colleges which is not required. The quality of syllabus has to match the needs of the industry, and most importantly, teachers have to be trained to impart new syllabus. Today, many bright students go abroad to pursue research. Our government must ensure we stop this brain drain and create a conducive atmosphere for research in India with good grants and infrastructure. A public-private partnership will be the key to the growth of Indian engineering education,” he signs off.

ON HIGH ALERT
"," Have you ever wondered what will be your first reflex if a disaster occurs? Many say that they would simply try and run out of the place in the event of an earthquake or fire. However, people end up panicking when disaster strikes. 
A major reason behind this panic is lack of knowledge, and it can be worked upon during a person’s formative years. It is therefore important to train children about how to react in the face of a disaster or emergency.
A majority of the schools and colleges in India train children about the basics. However, when asked if the training was useful, some students said that though they had drills in schools, not a lot of them thought that it was useful.
“We had mock drills for earthquakes and went to the fire station to learn how to extinguish a fire. It was useful information, but from the way it was provided it looked more like a formality. Moreover, all we were taught was to cover our heads and lie under a table in case of an earthquake, not to use lifts, leave the building and so on. Though we have received instruction. we have not practised it. We were taught how to extinguish fire with a huge bunch of students; only the students standing in the front row could even understand something,” says Sahil Chhabra, who passed out from school in 2017.
This observation is not new. Bikramjit Singh Mann, who completed his schooling in 1986 from a Punjab school, says that even he was not taught about disaster management while studying. “I now have some training due to the nature of my job. If not for this, I would not be able to handle an emergency,” he says. 
Empowerment
Teacher Kanika Narula, who teaches disaster management in her school, recalls her own school days and reminisces about how she belonged to one of the fortunate batches who were taught about emergency situations. “The idea is that when a natural disaster strikes, we are already operating in the unknown, and to act fast is a prerequisite. If we don’t have a checklist or plan in mind, it only delays any efforts to minimise or curtail the damage. Knowledge empowers us to face what would otherwise be a completely intimidating situation — and so this training is absolutely essential, for just a basic familiarity with the tools and measures for disaster preparedness and mitigation,” she observes, while adding that there are steps being taken nowadays to help children understand the gravity of these situations. 
Col. Mohit Bawa, Dean, Student Life, BML Munjal University, explains how the university has taken steps to educate students. “We have a tie-up with VPS Rockland Hospital, who provide emergency medical services to our campus. Emergency trainers visit the campus regularly to refresh and train students, faculty and staff in emergency procedures and first aid, equipping them to handle earthquakes, fire breakouts, accidents and so on.”
The right way
 Technology has helped us in many ways; however, is learning about emergencies through movies or the Internet the right way to go about it? Bikramjit, who is trained for emergencies, says, “Learning without proper training can actually do more damage, so it is very important to learn the right way. For example, basic first aid tells us to put a person in a recovery position after checking for their airway and breathing. But if someone has not been put in the position properly and they have an item lodged in the throat, we could end up killing them instead of saving them.”
There is no doubt that the situation is improving, but it is not entirely clear if it is due to students learning the basics themselves or because of the efforts of institutions. In either case, the best solution is for schools and colleges to increase their efforts to train students.

Boon or bane?
","  


I never thought I would say this, but studying in a private university has finally paid off because we are not the victims of the cell phone ban.This wasn’t the best decision made by the government of Tamil Nadu because smart phones have become an integral part of a student’s life. How are students to share notes, access university portals online, get informed about where and when their next class is in case of any switch, know where their faculty are, check if the administrative blocks are functioning and even simply find their way around the campus? Cell phones are definitely a lifeline to the outside world and banning them is almost foolish! Students will have a hard time commuting due to lack of communication with their drivers and no information in case of road blocks.




While it is definitely at the discretion of the teacher to allow or disallow mobiles in classrooms, a blanket ban on its use is definitely retrograde. The reasons for imposing the ban, such as inappropriate filming of women students and malpractice in exams, must be addressed through other punitive measures and not by banning of phones. The benefits of mobiles far outweigh any harms associated with its usage. What is also dubious about the ban is the exemption of central institutions in Tamil Nadu such as IIT Madras due to the ‘knowledge of students there to use phones reasonably’. Is this based on a presumption that students from other institutions do not know how to use phones reasonably? The policy lacks sound reasoning and one can expect considerable backlash from both students and teachers.




The advertising brochure of my college proudly talks about the Wi-Fi enabled campus. However, a prohibition of smart phones inside it seems quite contradictory. One of the principle points raised against mobile phones is that the device would be misleading, diverting and a disturbance in class. Smart phones aren’t that bad. Sharing through a less time consuming means would beat the conventional time taken and definitely help students.




Every coin has two sides, and mobile phones too are a boon and a bane. It depends on how we make use of it. While there are tremendous advantages, there are just as many drawbacks. When mobile phones have a constitutive role in today’s world, it is irrational to ask students not to use them. Reasonable restrictions are understandable, for reasons such as causing disturbances inside classrooms or to other students. If college students are seen as adults, then it is only fair that we are treated as such and are trusted that we know how to use mobile phones reasonably. At the same time, we as students also need to be more responsible when it comes to how we use our mobile phones. After all it is ‘you’ and ‘I’ who decide what the pros and cons of it are.

The bailout was the last hope
","  What is the difference between ‘bailout’ and ‘bale out’? (Prabhu Kumar, Arakkonam)
It is also possible to spell ‘bale’ as ‘bail’. The phrasal verb ‘bail/bale out’ has several different meanings. When a pilot ‘bails out’, he jumps out of the plane wearing a parachute; he does this because there is something seriously wrong with the aircraft. The expression also has the meaning, to help someone who is in trouble. When you bail someone out, you help them get out of the jam they are in — usually, financial. When you ‘bail someone out of jail’, for example, you pay money for his release. The expression can also be used to mean to go back on your word; to go back on something that you had committed to — you do this in order to avoid a problem or some difficulty. These are just some of the meanings of the expression.
The aircraft went down very quickly. The pilot didn’t have time to bail out.
 Nitin promised to lend me the money, but at the last minute bailed out.
You get into trouble all the time. I am not going to bail you out of the next one.
The word ‘bailout’, on the other hand, is mostly used as a noun to refer to the money or financial assistance usually given by the government to organisations/industries, that are on the verge of going bankrupt. This is usually done in the hope that the loan will help the company recover. A ‘bailout’ can be given to a person, an organisation and to countries as well. 
Unless there is a government bailout, the textile industry will fold. 
How is the word ‘consummate’ pronounced in ‘consummate liar’? (K.Janani, Bengaluru)
There are several ways of pronouncing this rather formal word. One way is to pronounce the first syllable like the word ‘con’. The vowels in the second and third syllables can be pronounced like the ‘a’ in ‘China’. The word is pronounced ‘KON-se-met’ with the stress on the first syllable. It comes from the Latin ‘consummatus’ meaning ‘complete’ or ‘perfected’. Dictionaries define the word as ‘perfect or complete in every way’. The word can also be used to refer to someone who displays a great deal of skill at doing something. When used as a verb, the final syllable is pronounced like the word ‘mate.
Don’t believe a word that Vikram says. He is a consummate liar. 
 After her retirement, Nina led a life of consummate happiness. 
Do the two sentences ‘I won’t work for just anybody’ and ‘I won’t work for anybody’ have the same meaning? (C.Devender, Chennai)
No, they do not; they have different meanings. When you say, ‘I won’t work for anybody’, what you are suggesting is that you are not willing to work under someone. Perhaps, you want to be your own boss. Whatever the case may be, you are unwilling to work for or under someone. The second sentence, ‘I won’t work for just anybody’ suggests that you are willing to work under someone, but the person — your potential boss — has to be good at what he or she does. He or she needs to be someone who is well known or has a good reputation. You will not work for any Tom, Dick or Harry.
After 20 years in the field, I’m not going to work for just anybody.

Fuel your fitness quotient
"," Fitness is the new cool. Generation Z is preparing for the long haul. They hope to be on their feet for many decades to come — and to be looking just the way they look now. Young and well turned-out —50 is the new 30. 
At $3.7 trillion and growing (as per Global Wellness Economy Monitor, January 2017), global wellness is a high growth sector to work in. Career in fitness and mind-body training, health foods, health tourism, alternative medicine, anti-ageing and, of course, weight loss, are promising.
Fitness trainers
Perhaps, the best-looking specimens of our species outside of showbiz, fitness trainers are the sleek and well-toned leaders of the fitness revolution. They focus on exercise and muscle health, including cardiovascular training, strength training and stretching. They design fitness programmes, connect with clubs or fitness centres, reach out to potential clients, run fitness classes and monitor their clients’ progress.
Personal fitness trainers work one-to-one with those who can afford them, to build and achieve short-term and long-term fitness goals. They often work with celebrities to maintain body tone.
Group fitness trainers work in clubs, spas, health resorts and community centres to run regular fitness lessons across age groups. Some may set up running, cycling, and fitness groups, with large sponsored events as well as branded fitness gear.
Specialised fitness trainers advocate a whole system of fitness that includes nutrition, exercise and philosophy. They could specialise in yoga, pilates, martial arts, and so on. Yoga and pilates instructors conduct group and individual classes. Martial arts trainers are often practitioners with professional fighting experience, who now teach.
Nutritionists or dieticians 
Trained in the science of eating, these professionals have intimate knowledge of how our body uses food. They study catabolism (how the body breaks down food) and anabolism (how the body repairs and creates cells and tissue), food groups, body types, nutrition cycles, deficiencies, and food allergies.
Clinical dieticians may work with hospitals to plan patient menus according to their dietary goals and restrictions. They may work with specialised patient groups such as diabetics, those with renal or liver diseases, children with food allergies, and so on. 
Nutrition managers work with organisations that serve food on a large scale, manage menus and take steps to avoid large-scale contamination of food or the spread of food-based illnesses. This includes working with large hotels, school canteens, hospitals, office cafeterias, health resorts and spas.
Public health nutrition includes working with the government to design public health policy in government schools and define minimum health and nutrition standards for children, lactating mothers, or others impacted by the public health system.
Educators and researchers work with think tanks and universities designing training curricula for nutritionists, examining policies and their effectiveness, and researching the role of nutrition in handling diseases.
Private consultants work with people across ages and professions to provide one-to-one guidance on making and managing a personal nutrition plan. 
Compensation
Fitness trainers and nutritionists working with hospitals, clubs, hotels and so on getpaidbetween ₹ 15,000 and ₹ 40,000 per month at the starting level; when they work with gyms and clubs they could earn about ₹ 1 lakh a month. As they take on more managerial and revenue generating roles, salaries rise. 
Personal trainers and nutritionists who work with individuals can charge anywhere between ₹ 500 to ₹ 1 lakh for a session. Personal trainers of repute charge between ₹ 1.5 lakh and ₹ 5 lakh per client per month. Sounds too wide a range? Of course, you need to be a celebrity trainer with high-profile client credentials to demand those kind of rates!

Break down those walls "," Writing this in the month that marks yet another year of our Independence reminds us of physical orders that were marked off in different parts of Asia and Africa in the last century. It gives us a chance to think about walls of different kinds in our physical world while the www of internet operates in ether. Natural borders like the Himalayas have caused different kinds of linked societies to develop over the millennia but have man-made walls done well? The Great Wall of China did not. Nor did the Berlin Wall.
Ever since the Stone Age, people have lived in “trust” groups of 15 or 20 with whom they hunted or traded; or with whom they had children. Even a casual look at patterns of life in villages and small towns shows us that this has not changed very much. Why? Because people are by nature clannish and tribal. The reason large groups of strangers (or any stranger at all) is viewed with suspicion is because we immediately feel threatened with disruption or wonder which way things might go. Since it is better policy to be safe than sorry we “wall” off the stranger or strangers.
Paul Salopek, who undertook to follow the “Road out of Eden” travelling from Africa on foot, outward into different parts of the world, was recently in India where he found the borders between India and Pakistan utterly artificial. True there were Hindus amongst Muslims on one side and Muslims among Hindus on the other, but “People on both sides are Punjabis. They grow the same crops, like the same music, eat the same foods and dress similarly.” Salopek also dwelt at some length on the sociology of walls and borders saying that if you travelled at great speed over geographic terrain in a car or train or plane you never really come into contact with people except in artificial environments like airports.
As Salopek travels from country to country, culture to culture, he finds people to be pretty much the same. “I don’t see colour or language any more. Whether it is a Bedouin nomad in Saudi Arabia, a photojournalist from Turkey or a brilliant scientist in Georgia, they all talk about the same things — family, jobs, governments, climate change, about what they have or do not have. Worries are the same; so are their hopes.” 
Erasing borders
 Geographical borders are fluid; they might change with war, policies or famines but the border that divides our inner and outer selves is the ultimate border that should really concern us. They are walls of prejudice, of ignorance, of fear and worst of all — pride in being all of these things. They give us a false sense of security and safety.
Possibly because the world seems to be shrinking with electronic communication creating a borderless world, the walls in the mind are gaining strength. Do we still surround ourselves with fences and walls? Of course we do and the invisible ones are the hardest to break down. Most people feel safe in communities that subscribe to the same beliefs and norms and right or wrong cling to the same patterns of social behaviour. Surely therefore the ultimate border is the human skin: the wall between the inner and the outer self which is the border we can’t seem to get rid of. All spiritual quests have been journeys of the mind to get through this final emotional frontier, the fence of the self. Surely ‘independence’ is to control strong personal prejudices and communicate meaningfully with the other.

Sleep on it
"," The first class in the day can often be a fraught affair. Students may come bleary eyed and hungry, and teachers have to deal with yawns and glazed looks. I remember being distracted one entire semester by a student who sat in the front seat and more often than not, nodded off even before I could start speaking. As a young lecturer, I couldn’t help wondering if it was my fault. While the class may be redeemed by a minority that is wide awake and adequately fed, several sleepy students and an anxious or irritated teacher aren’t necessarily the ideal combination for learning.
Sleep deprivation is one of the major challenges for college students everywhere, and particularly so for those who live on residential campuses with a fair amount of freedom and no lights-out policy. Medical colleges and IITs are notorious for students pulling all-nighters for days at a stretch, sometimes using chemicals of various kinds to stay awake. In some cases, the workload is such that students feel compelled to push themselves to work long hours. But in others, it is more of a social pressure and that most millennial of anxieties — the fear of missing out — that makes sleep a low priority.
Quantity matters
Health writer Jane Brody, in a recent New York Times article, noted that adequate sleep is one of the most important markers of a successful college experience, citing studies that have shown that the quality and quantity of sleep are linked to academic performance. Most parents, when sending their adult children off to college, worry about the possibility of alcohol or drug abuse, and often spend a lot of time counselling them about such issues. Rarely, however, do we worry about abusing the circadian rhythm.
College can be an exciting time. The temptation to do it all, and stay awake through it all is just too great. The combination of social and academic demands can make the 24-hour day seem way too short. And then there is social media. The fact that libraries on many campuses stay open late makes it possible to work late, and so, students end up pulling all-nighters to complete papers or finish their reading. Outcome: those yawns and bleary eyes in morning classes.
There’s a certain romance associated with working late into the night, collaborating on projects over midnight chai and noodles, and these are certainly experiences that one wouldn’t want to argue away. But if one also has to be in a class early in the morning, too many of those late nights can become a problem. Of course, if you have a flexible schedule, you can catch up on your sleep in the day and be ready for another late night…but unfortunately, most academic institutions require students to show up during the day. Clearly, something has to give, and that something is usually your sleep. So why not choose your all-nighters — whether social or academic — and space them out, so that you give your body and mind the rest they need?

‘My true calling’
"," I came across an online internship platform in my first year of B.Tech. I became a student ambassador for the platform, and was responsible for spreading awareness about internships and the opportunities for students. Next, I worked as a campus ambassador for the entrepreneurship cell of IIT Bombay.
Ninja intern 
Later, I applied for an internship at Nearbuy and was hired. I was involved in digital marketing and content writing, which pushed me to explore a variety of fields. My tryst with internships didn’t stop there, and I applied to a business development internship at Unacademy. I got the chance to meet clients, and troubleshoot issues faced by potential educators. By the end of the two months, I had got 15 new educators on the platform. 
I then applied to a two-week internship at the United Nations Volunteers for their International Women’s Day 2018 campaign. My tasks were related to digital marketing, event management, and content writing, on Google Classroom. After that, I was selected as a youth marketing volunteer at the Kailash Satyarthi Children Foundation for their nation-wide movement against child trafficking and sexual assault on women, known as Bharat Yatra. My tasks were to closely follow the movement since its genesis and promote the event on social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter. I was also responsible for content writing and spreading awareness about Bharat Yatra on my campus. The best part of this internship was meeting with the Nobel Laureate Shri Kailash Satyarthi and actor Vivek Oberoi at Bombay Stock Exchange, Mumbai, during the curtain-raiser event of Bharat Yatra. I will always cherish how Shri Satyarthi embraced me and encouraged me to work towards the betterment of society. I even got the opportunity to be the gender champion of the Internal Complaints Committee of my university, owing to my previous volunteering experiences. I now work towards preventing gender inequality and sexual harassment in my college.
Throughout these stints, I realised how internships not only help us gain confidence and hone our communication skills but also figure out our true calling. I had no clue about the field in which I wanted to pursue my career when I started college, but now, six internships later, I know that I wish to work towards social and economic upliftment of women in our country.

For the love of art
"," In 2016, a casual discussion amongst a group of art enthusiasts resulted in a question — could a platform be created where artists all over the world could perform, and art lovers could have the chance to experience the beauty of their various art forms in a very unique way?
After a year of brainstorming and research into the minds of art lovers around the world, they hit upon an idea. With the intention of becoming a shared community for both online and offline art lovers to present, co-create and promote art around the world, the team of artists created Meraki Arts Hub. One of their first initiatives was Meraki Circles, where they could curate different art-based events. From that came the concept “Let’s Emote” — a one-of-a-kind event, where, for the first time in the world, they matched arts with emotions. They wanted to conduct an experiment — what if they, through art, could make their audience extremely happy and then extremely sad? How would they feel?
Evoking emotion 
The show, held on June 30, consisted of a series of art forms, each designed to invoke a particular emotion from the audience. “When you watch a movie, you experience an emotional overload. What is challenging is telling you the emotion in prior, then making sure you experience it. Here, for each art, we tell you beforehand what emotion will be evoked in you. Each act in the show will evoke one emotion, and at the end, with all of them combined — you will have experienced an emotional roller coaster,” says Prasanna Bharati R, one of the team’s founders.
Throughout the show, the audience was led through tragedy, sadness and anger, resulting in thunderous applause and a whirlwind of emotions when the curtains came down.
Through their other initiative, COFEE — Conservative of Future Entertaining Entrepreneurs, Team Meraki wishes to create an open and interactive community where any member of the public, if struck by an inspiring artistic idea he wishes to work on, can approach them with the idea, and if they wish, partner with Team Meraki to implement the idea.
Currently, Meraki Arts Hub is run by two teams — one in Chennai and one in Hyderabad. Several people in both teams are currently students, and all of them are artists in some way. “We have theatre artists, photojournalists, dancers, musicians, actors, and poets. We give students who are art lovers internships in fields such as graphic design, where they can experience what we do by helping out with sets and posters”, says Prasanna. “Anyone in the team can come up with any idea related to art. The idea is discussed, voted on, and if it gets votes from the team, we move on to the implementation phase. After that, each idea is given ownership to members of our team, and the team will discuss whether it is business-feasible or not”.
Looking further 
So, what is in store for the future? “We started off with ‘Let’s Emote’, and we are taking the show to different places. Every last Saturday in a month, we do a different show in Chennai, Hyderabad or Bengaluru. We are planning a show in Australia in September, and another show in the U.K., and one in the U.S. We plan to take the show to colleges and prepare each show with a college-level twist. We are also working with a few production houses right now to produce web series, with a series of very interesting topics that we hope will appeal to the Chennai audience. 
“We want to sustain art. We believe that there are two kinds of people in the world — those who know and love what art is, and those who don’t. We want to convert them to art lovers. We are experimenting to see if we can make the world love art, and if all of us can win,” concludes Prasanna.

Driving force
"," A typical Monday morning, I was impatiently awaiting my auto to get to work, all the while, mentally mapping out the zillion things I wanted to accomplish, this week. So engrossed was I, in my thoughts, that it took someone snapping her fingers in front of my face, to bring me out of my reverie. My auto woman had arrived, and without further ado, I was off to work. At the signal, a man in the vehicle next to mine made a passing comment at my driver — “These cab aggregators are giving more women behind-the-wheel jobs. Must feel good to don a man’s role and get out of the kitchen, right?” And that blatant, supercilious comment, laced with ill-concealed surprise that a woman could do it all, got the cogs in my brain furiously working overtime. Women from all walks of life, irrespective of class and creed, have perfected the balancing act since time immemorial. They have stormed every stage possible and emerged victorious too — whether it is the Mars mission, or at workplaces entrenched in Earth’s stronghold, many of them pull it all off with élan. Why then, the surprise? Who decides that engineering and coding are for men, and perennially relegate women to the kitchen-queen status?
Even as my brain continues to teem with such questions, there exists the reality that there are organisations across the globe that are taking a step forward towards gender parity and inclusivity. Uber has joined the exalted ranks of such organisations. Excerpts from an interview where five superwomen from Uber — Manyata Goyal, Charu Jain, Latika Vashishtha, Vanshika Srivastava, and Shivani Khanduja — describe their journey in the organisation, and the innumerable opportunities they have had, to establish their competence and combat stereotypes. 




Dreaming big
For Manyata Goyal, a career in engineering had always seemed the way ahead, right from when she was a starry-eyed 13-year-old who would sit in front of her computer, for hours on end, using a greeting card-making programme to design cards for her friends and family. Tinkering around and experimenting with different programmes then, paved the way for what she does now. “As a part of Uber’s maps team, I work on projects to improve the pick-up experience for people in markets with sub-optimal network conditions. The current project I am working on is about enabling transportation in emerging markets for users, in areas with poor network connectivity,” explains Manyata. 
Utter the word “coding” and the first image that is sure to strike most people’s imagination is a man at the desk, hard at work, cracking codes to save the day. This is where Uber’s Charu Jain and software engineer Latika Vashishtha are shattering stereotypes. 
An excited Charu, from Uber’s Vehicle Solutions for Rentals and Financiers team, quips, “My passion for writing code started in high school, when I began building C++ applications for fun. This love for writing code kept growing and I decided to pursue computer science in college.”
Now, she and her team build solutions for Uber’s vehicle rental business across the globe. “The work is gratifying. For instance, I recently had the opportunity of visiting our office at Sao Paulo, Brazil, to learn about the day-to-day challenges of the local operations team. We also met with some of our biggest local partners. This exposure helped us analyse how we are performing and scope out future improvements in these types of emerging markets,” she adds.
As a child, Latika loved solving puzzles and math problems. As she grew, so did her appetite for solving increasingly complex puzzles and problems, and she would frequently participate in Olympiads and quizzes. “Gradually, I discovered that engineering was similar and an extension of my passion. Coding allows me to dig deep into problems in mobility and therefore, my job excites me, constantly keeps me on my toes and allows me to innovate,” she adds, the excitement in her voice evident.
Challenges
Manyata explains how one of the first realisations that dawned on her was just how few women programmers there were. “Many times, I have been the only woman in the room,” she exclaims. “Fortunately, I have had strong female role models and supportive colleagues throughout my career. However, much like in the case of most women, it has not always been easy for me, given that tech still continues to be male-dominated industry. In my early days, there have been situations when I have had to be more persistent with my opinions and have had to back my ideas with undaunting perseverance,” she adds.
Shivani Khanduja from Uber’s uPromo team, who works on this financial platform for real-time credit and promotion liability analysis, doesn’t completely agree that the urban mobility industry is male-dominated. “Women are breaking barriers across industries and professions. From an engineering point of view, we are all working towards one common goal — make transportation reliable for everyone, everywhere. I have a mix of smart women and men on my team, and we are constantly learning from each other and getting better at what we do,” she insists.
 Vanshika Srivastava, a finance engineering in the organising concurs. “I joined here in 2017, and the journey, so far, has been enthralling. Here, the journey of an engineer is that of learning and implementing on repeat, with leaps of advancement. It is this cycle that enables me to innovate at a fast pace,” she says. Though it was challenging at first, it drove her to perform and fall in love with her job. “I started working on finance engineering with limited domain knowledge. Ramping up in Uber’s fast-paced development environment with deliverables that impact the company was a challenge, one that I loved though,” she admits.
Constant inclusivity 
So, what does Uber do to make its work environment inclusive? “We have a thriving LadyEng group that continues to take on new initiatives in keeping lady engineers plugged in and updated. We also get together as one group to discuss challenges and celebrate successes,” elaborates Vanshika. Shivani is quick to agree. “As someone new in the global workforce, I feel proud that there is a lot of focus around women and personal development. I am also inspired by seeing women leaders across the tech team that I am part of.” 
Charu adds, “As a woman, and one in tech, I feel comfortable working here. This women’s day, for instance, we started a series called Inspirational women of Uber where many women from different teams and roles were featured with their success stories. Also, we have started a Bengaluru chapter of the LadyEng series, where women in tech regularly meet and discuss ideas, concerns, issues and work together to address them,” she says, signing off.

Impeccable!
"," Housekeeping is an important aspect of running a hotel business. Regardless of the hotel category, a clean, hygienic and fresh atmosphere sends a strong message to customers. The field presents diverse career opportunities. 
Today, housekeeping units are adept at multitasking. This department is accountable for cleaning and maintaining the hotel building and premises, including the common areas, guest rooms, swimming pool, and so on. Besides main housekeeping duties, they also take care of gardening, laundry operations, superiority control, cost control and sometimes even guest relations. Apart from this, the section also handles procurement of items. In many hotels, the housekeeping division also helps the sales team in revenue generation. 
Skills
Hotel housekeeping requires a wide range of skills from emptying trash, cleaning windows and bed-making, to ironing and laundering towels and sheets, and cleaning rooms. Hotels train their staff in specific cleaning methods. This includes making beds in a particular standard, cleaning bathrooms using specific products, folding laundry to meet a set of criteria and so on. 
Housekeepers are required to use tools such as vacuum cleaners and mops, while also ensuring that they store cleaning carts with sufficient materials. Room setting is an important aspect of housekeeping, and these special touches are vital in setting a hotel apart from others. Washing, folding, ironing and dry cleaning hundreds of sheets, towels and clothes carefully, on a daily basis, is another aspect of the job. Housekeepers are also required to equip themselves with communication skills to aid in their interaction with guests. Students of hotel management can pick up these skills during their course.
Tips
To be successful, undergo hands-on training with valid certification and develop and maintain physical aptitude and strength. Keep in mind that hotels prefer experienced candidates since guest satisfaction is a crucial aspect of hospitality.
Opportunities
Admission to courses in housekeeping is merit-based or exam-based. Some institutes conduct entry-level exams to assess communication skills, personal skills, and so on. 
After course completion, students could get opportunities in hotels, resorts, tour and travel agencies, restaurants, lodges and guest houses in roles such as laundryman, linen keeper, tailor, laundry master, executive housekeeper, associate housekeeping manager and so on.

Top-up funds
"," It is no news that international students in the U.K. pay higher tuition fees than domestic or EU students, while funding their accommodation and living costs during their course. In 2018, students from the U.K. and EU enrolling in to English universities had to pay up to £9,250 as the annual fee. However, the fee for international students vary considerably, ranging from £10,000 and going up to £38,000 or more for medical degrees. Along with a high cost of living, the average cost of studying in the U.K. is estimated to be £22,200 per year, needless to say, studying in London is likely to be significantly more expensive.
Fortunately, there is support available and ample opportunities for part-time work for international students to top up funds and pay university fees. If you are an International student , and are enrolled into any full-time undergraduate or postgraduate degree programme at a recognised university, you are allowed to work part-time during the term for up to 20 hours a week, and full-time during the holidays.
 Here is useful information on employment preconditions and types of jobs that international students can pursue.
Range of jobs
There is a range of part-time jobs to expat students in the U.K. Flexible in nature, the KRAs of such jobs are designed such that they suit the life of a student. Websites such as indeed.com and studentjob.co.uk are most sorting by both employers and students for jobs such as:
Sales assistants in retail
Customer assistants inhospitality
 Research assistant in universities
Data analyst in corporates
 Event organisers
Catalogue distributor
Shopping assistant
There are other jobs like babysitting and pet-sitting as well. Paid internships can earn you additional money and give you vital extra skills, which is also beneficial for your CV.
 Minimum wages
The U.K. has set national minimum wages, which means you get paid according to your age and nature of job. The ‘National Minimum Wage’ is the minimum pay per hour almost all workers in the U.K. are entitled to. Regardless of the scale of an enterprise, they still have to pay the correct minimum wage. Such as:
21 or older: £6.70 an hour
18 to 20: £5.30 an hour
16 or 17: £3.87 an hour
25 and above: £7.20 an hour
Apprentices: £3.30 per hour
*These rates are as on 2016 and are reviewed annually by the U.K. government.

Dynamism in the classroom
"," Teachers are the backbone of any society. As they lead the young generation of any nation, they have always stood out as the most revered community. However much water has flown down the bridge over time. Today’s teachers are feeling the heat and resentment, as they face the many challenges in this profession. 
The foremost seems to be the discrepancy in the salary of private and government school teachers. While it is good that the government teachers are getting their due, private school teachers are overburdened with work and still do not get paid accordingly. The slightest lucrative opportunity elsewhere makes a teacher manipulative hoping to grab it. This results in high attrition rate and even the sense of belongingness to an institution suffers a setback.
Attending to needs
The second challenge to a teacher is posed within the class in the form of a diversified class. Teachers often not only grapple with the diversification of content but also the diverse needs of students within the class. Here we are talking about differently-abled children. A teacher needs to be sensitive to the needs of these children while doing their bit to sensitise other children for making an empathetic classroom. Teachers are expected to prepare different lesson plans to teach all categories of students across their class. This becomes challenging when there is the responsibility of course completion as well as preparing students for assessments within strict deadlines.
Next comes the tackling of knowledge outburst through technology. There is the ever expanding content within subjects which needs to be made concise and relevant for the students. The subjects today are not compartmentalised, but merge into each other demanding integrated learning from teachers. 
Today a teacher who is a jack of all arts and even master of one can only survive. They have to keep their antennae up for any new information and breakthroughs in the academic space. At times even the creativity and ingenuity of the teachers is compromised in the race to acquire more content knowledge.
Bigger role
 Further, while a teacher’s role is concentrated to a facilitator in academics, they also have a greater role to play in the emotional well-being of the child. The family orientation of today’s children leaves little space for his or her self-expression so a teacher’s role is crucial in becoming a guardian to a student. They need to talk to children as a group and personally too, more often. This paves the way for a compassionate classroom and better relationship dynamics between a teacher and student. Thus, a teacher now shares the liability of a parent too in handling the personality of the child in and outside the classroom.
In a nutshell, a teacher’s profession demands dynamism on their part to survive, thrive and accomplish the highest goal of moulding a young mind. A well trained teacher who loves this profession can only wade through the stagnancies on the job. A teacher should be given the support and motivation from the institution and society to strengthen his/her ideals. They should be given free time for capacity building in the area of their interest. They should also be given highest incentives for the job that involves emancipation of the human morale and ideas to its fullest level.

Staying in the lane: How engineering graduates can pursue a career in their line of study
"," Changes in society are driving up demand for experts in STEM industries, and unless we meet this demand, we are at risk of costing the local economy billions of dollars in the lost potential for additional GDP. The obvious solution is to depend on our higher education institutions. However, there is a trend where, on graduating, engineering students enter non-professional engineering occupations. So, what is putting them off? And what teaching methods can universities use to encourage more students to move into the engineering sector?
 One factor that might put these students off an engineering job is that other industries are offering more desirable graduate packages, including bigger pay-packets, particularly now that graduates are being left with burgeoning student loans to repay. With a variety of industries currently experiencing digital transformation, the skills developed during an engineering degree mathematical, analytical, technological translate into a number of jobs, not just engineering. Therefore, we must inspire these students by using more innovative teaching techniques and increasing employer engagement methods in higher education.
Approach for change
More ambitious and challenging project-based learning is the key. This teaching technique allows educators to bring their course material closer to real life and enables young people to get a hands-on experience so they can see that computing, maths and physics are very creative as well as technical. Capturing their imagination whilst at university can help ensure that students maintain their interest in engineering science into a profession after graduation. Project-based learning allows students to see, hear and touch what would otherwise be completely abstract and gives them a better idea of what a career in STEM might entail on a day-to-day basis.
Industry-standard software and hardware can also be used in education, giving students an experience with engineering tools and practices they will use in employment. For example, by incorporating industry-standard software such as MATLAB and Simulink, instructors not only keep students motivated but also prepare them for the working world.
We have also witnessed the success of global competitions such as the ROBOCON competition, where engineering students are acquiring skills that are directly transferable to real-world design. These competitions support teams who start with nothing and then must conceptualise, design, build, test and race their own solution, and then show their work to a panel of judges who determine how well each team explains the logic behind the design process.
Ultimately, we do not have time to wait for universities to change their stance on this issue. The engineering industry must take more responsibility and help support education bodies to incorporate these initiatives so that we have a steady stream of engineering talent entering the engineering workforce.

The big bang theory
","Joker, Harley Quinn, Enchantress and Sharpshooter have been cornered. They are about to be taken into custody at Anna Adarsh College for Women in Anna Nagar. A loud explosion rings out, and the super villains are lost in a haze of cloud. When the smoke settles, we find they have escaped the trap set for them. All thanks to the handy liquid nitrogen.
Education start-ups Infinite Engineers and Vaayusastra have recently started conducting such plays, interwoven with science experiments, in schools and colleges of Tamil Nadu. Science is not boring, they reiterate, jazzing up seemingly dry equations with the pizzazz of theatre. “We have teamed up with Vaayusastra, who have professional theatre artistes. They write the script and we design the science experiments. If a play is one and a half hour long, it will have about five to six experiments,” says Harish Srinivasan, who started Infinite Engineers with MA Aravind and MC Jaikanth. 
At their first play in a school in Erode, the central character was an alien with magical powers, who challenged Earthlings to a show of prowess. “So we had the students come up and take part in experiments with us, to defeat the alien,” he says. “To teach the children chemistry, we used butane gas fire that you can light on your hand, without causing any harm.” In another, they used a Tesla coil that lit up a bulb simply when it was is moved across it — electromagnetism 101.
Most of their experiments are flashy, and their characters have a certain touch of the magical, in order to re-spark the wonders of science that seem to have been lost in thick 1000-page books.




It all started with Vaayusastra’s founder Jagadeesh Kanna. Jagadeesh has a master’s degree in Aeronautical Engineering, but has also been in the drama circles since 2010, working with The Little Theatre. “We officially started Vaayusastra four months ago, but have been trying to merge theatre and science since last year,” he says.
Jagadeesh, who now writes and directs these plays with Infinite Engineers, started out with teaching children the concept of aerodynamics using small skits based on folk tales.Tracing back the roots of aerodynamics to our mythology, Jagadeesh recounts, “Look at The Ramayana, Ravana comes in the pushpaka vahana — which is a type of air chariot, a plane — to kidnap Sita. In The Mahabharata, there are so many references to ballistic missiles like the brahmastra. We can use these epic stories to inspire children in the direction of science,” he says.
Working in theatre while getting a degree in science had armed Jagadeesh with the belief that the two should not be separated. “STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math), the base of our education system has been a colonial product. Before that, Indian education had always involved learning sciences through art such as storytelling or dance. I want to bring back that system, in the form of ASTEM,” he says.




So when Jagadeesh teamed up with Infinite Engineers, it allowed Vaayusastra a chance to move out of just aerodynamics and expand with the range of science experiments . The latter has already been in the field for about four years, taking experiment boxes to students across Tamil Nadu.
Meanwhile, as science experiments are performed on stage, a different sort of experiment is brewing off stage. For Harish and his friends from Infinite Engineers, this is the first time they are acting, in the remotest sense. “The first time I went on stage, there were some 300 people facing me. I was nervous,” he says. “We are the ones conducting the experiments, and it may not always go right, so we also need to improvise.”
Harish has given speeches in public before, but never has he needed this sort of showmanship. “You have to be spontaneous and energetic, you have to get the audience to ooh and aah at the right moment,” he says, laughing. “We’re still in the early stages but it’s nice, we’re getting into the groove of it.”
On the other hand, Jagadeesh has taken up the role of being a science teacher to his actors from a non-engineering background — a little bit of learning for everyone.
The next Science on Stage play will be held on September 1 (4.30 pm to 6 pm) and 2 (10 am to 11.30 am) at IIT Madras Research Park. Call Harish at 9884190590 for tickets.

Second home Down Under
"," I’m happy to call Adelaide my home away from home. I am currently pursuing my final year of the Master of Speech Pathology programme at Flinders University which is located in South Australia. 
I chose this city as my study destination for a number of reasons, the main being my course. The Speech Pathology programme is one of the only programmes with a problem-based learning curriculum where we learn all our topics through case studies. I personally enjoy this method of learning and I am able to implement what I learn during my clinical placements in different health and education settings. As the university functions in conjunction with the hospital, Flinders Medical Centre, we have many opportunities to access and learn the different aspects of Medical Speech Pathology.
Extra-curriculars 
 Our main campus is situated on a hill and this promotes fitness with the need for frequent walks up and down the hill but you are rewarded with amazing views of the city and the sea. There is access to many free and helpful services such as those for careers, student learning and health. The university also encourages professional development apart from the set curriculum and the Horizon Development Programme, which I am a part of, awards students who pursue such with extracurricular opportunities.
Some of the other reasons that made me choose Adelaide were the affordable cost of living, the multi-cultural environment, and the support for international students. Adelaide has kept up all these promises and offered a lot more. There is something for everyone here, a range of cuisines to taste, if you are a foodie, conservation parks and trails for people who enjoy the outdoors, art galleries and cultural performances for the artistically-oriented and a good mix of both beautiful hills and beaches.
The people have been extremely kind and welcoming thus making the move away from home a lot easier for me. Specific organisations such as StudyAdelaide, the universities Student Association and the International Students Office provided me with opportunities to relax, attend fun events and support holistic student well-being. If you ever happen to feel homesick, you could always participate in the different events conducted by the active and vast Indian community here.
I have been able to easily adapt to the Australian way of life and study and I am thoroughly enjoying my time here. I would encourage students to consider study in the beautiful and friendly city.

‘Half-baked decision’ "," On deputation from the School of Education, Indira Gandhi National Open University, CB Sharma, current Chairman of the National Institute of Open Schooling gets candid about distance education in India.
Recently, the Distance Education Bureau (DEB) of the University Grants Commission (UGC) de-recognised many distance-learning courses, including several at IGNOU. Your view?
The UGC acts like big brother without the requisite expertise and is damaging the system and the interest of the learners who otherwise cannot attend regular education. Till 2013, the Distance Education Council constituted under the IGNOU Act was looking after the promotion and coordination of the open university and distance education system. It was a full-fledged body with more than 50 people. When it was merged with the UGC, it became the DEB, comprising less than half-a dozen-people. Given that distance education handles about 30% of the learners of higher education in India, it needs an independent, expert agency. 
So you are not in favour of the decision?
I agree that distance education in India needs an overhaul, and some courses and open universities de-recognised by the UCG deserved. India has around 15 open universities and hundreds of traditional universities that have a distance education wing. Many of these function simply as certifying agencies. So, such an exercise is important. However, the UGC’s decision is half baked and taken in a huff. There should be an expert body parallel to the UGC, with experts from distance education, who should take researched and considered decisions.
What ails distance education in India?
Ideally, it is an amalgamation of well thought-out and structured study material developed in different media, such as text and audio-visual that will help students understand a subject without regular access to a teacher, and personal contact hours for resolving doubts and evaluating assignments. All of this needs funding, and it is a misconception that distance learning is cheap. It is in fact, quite expensive and we are only able to subsidise because of economies of scale. However, this is often not sufficient and in the absence of funding, most places cut corners, reducing distance learning to correspondence courses where students rote-learn study material and give exams to secure certification. As such, there is little respect for it. Also, profit-making institutions often do not spend money on development of material and save major portion of the fees collected. This has damaged the reputation of distance learning. There is also some pressure to privatise distance education, with a large number of private players who have entered this domain. 
How does one overcome the challenges?
There should be an independent, expert agency to give a direction to distance education in the country, and it should become the custodian of all self-learning-material developed by different Open and Distance Learning (ODL) institutions. Gradually, private institutions should be allowed to enter the sector and also use the material. Use of multiple media should be a pre-condition for offering courses through ODL. The agency should be allowed to decide on what courses institutions can offer and should be the monitoring agency for ODL. As universities, they must also get the same type of autonomy that other universities have.

Get Ahead in tech "," A self-confessed proud Hyderabadi, Sreeja Kamishetty is a final-year dual-degree student who is pursuing her master’s in the machine learning lab under Prof. Praveen Paruchuri, and her main areas of research are artificial intelligence and intelligent transportation. Her work on developing a machine learning solution for prioritised (and better quality) routing of vehicles, especially during emergencies has culminated in a research paper. It has been selected for the annual flagship conference of the IEEE Intelligent Transportation Systems Society (ITSS) which will be held in November at Hawaii, the U.S. 
Rare honour
Like many other hopeful peers, 20-year-old Sreeja Kamishetty too applied for an internship at Google last year. She was hoping to have a learning experience from the interview and selection process. Hence, she says she wasn’t particularly disappointed when she didn’t get selected for the internship. But her application didn’t go unnoticed. Sreeja was instead chosen for the Get-Ahead programme for EMEA (short for Europe, Middle East and Africa regions). She was the only Indian selected to attend the retreat in London.
In an endeavour to create awareness of its culture, Google organised a programme called Get-Ahead, where women in tech were invited to workshops and related events. “As a part of the programme, the organisers conducted Kickstart coding competition for all the Get-Ahead participants. The top 20 were selected to the EMEA Google Students Retreat in London,” explains Sreeja. “Like any other Google Kickstart, there were two questions which we needed to answer in two hours. I have been practising coding, which helped me do well in the competition,” she says. 
Then there was the EMEA Google Students Retreat 2018 which took place in the first week of August. Ït was a platform for women in tech to strengthen skills, network with other attendees and engineers and learn about Google products and culture, during the course of the three days. Each day had a specific agenda,” elaborates Sreeja. “For example, the first day was dedicated to networking with other scholars. There were talks on Google’s culture, a talk on machine learning in YouTube, and an office tour of beautiful King's Cross office in London. The second day was technical, with code retreat workshops organised by Google employees. On the final day, we had panel discussions on stories of successes and failures, and talked about opportunities at Google.”
For Sreeja, the retreat was a wholesome learning experience which not only boosted her confidence but also helped in her current preparation for job interviews. “There was an activity where we were asked to write different things in which we are remarkable at. At the end of it, the facilitator made us realise that everyone was remarkable,” exclaims Sreeja. Another workshop she fondly remembers is ‘True Colours’. “The workshop left a great impression on me. It taught us how to work with people with different colours, where each colour represented a set of behaviours,” she explains.

The number game
"," The world is divided over math — almost everyone is taught the subject in some form or the other. By the time people hit their teenage years, the battle lines are drawn — “I love math” or “I hate math”. Well, I love math though I fully empathise with those who don’t — what do a bunch of squiggly symbols mean for the real world, anyway? Can we talk English, please? Or Marathi? Or perhaps…. Swahili, instead? For those for whom math is play, though, the world looks promising.
There was a time when a love for the subject primarily led you to academics or areas such as engineering or accounting. But today, “purer” applications of mathematics have emerged, giving you the opportunity to play with math while engaging with industries and customers. Here are a few such avenues. 
1. Big data: There is stock analytics, sports analytics, market analytics, health analytics, consumer data analytics — data is everywhere and businesses love to let creative mathematicians uncovers patterns and stories. For example, the Square Kilometer Array project aggregates data from thousands of radio telescopes, unmanned rovers, probes and observatories to figure out how the galaxy was formed at the “cosmic dawn”. Music companies collate data from sources including downloads, social media buzz and sales of merchandise to make the top charts and plan music releases, concert locations and dates.
2. Software: Emerging areas such as virtual reality, game development and artificial intelligence challenge mathematicians to define space, logic and response options to capture complex decision-making situations and train software to make sense of them. AlphaZero, the latest computer program that won or drew all 100 games against winning chess programs, taught itself the game in just four hours! Speech recognition by Alexa or Siri follow complex algorithms to make sense of the many things a speaker could mean. Another example is algorithm based stock trading where the computer analyses stock markets across cities, countries and industries to intelligently respond to stock movements and make four to five times the return that highly experienced human traders can.
3. Animation: Do you love geometry? Animation software goes into the geometric depths of every facial expression and bouncing ponytail. Animation variables or ‘avars’ are used to define the position of each segment of the skeletal model for characters. Woody in “Toy Story” used 700 avars of which 100 were in the face alone. Rapunzel’s hair in “Tangled” required co-ordinating the three-dimensional movement of 173 strands of hair in every scene.
4. Financial modelling: This area goes beyond accounting to predict the behaviour of people and markets, and design win-win financial solutions.
5. Actuarial science: Scientistsanalyse the likelihood of future events, represent risk in numbers and design financial instruments to create win-win solutions — for instance, life insurance policies with premiums linked to health indicators and even body part insurance. 
“A math degree provides students with the perfect platform to secure some of the hottest jobs in town such as actuarial analysts and data scientists. These jobs deal with analysing and interpreting large volumes of data in a logical way. It is important that students view mastering of mathematical concepts as a way to solve real world problems and not just as a means to pass exams,” says Jose John, Director and Appointed Actuary, Max Life Insurance Co. Ltd.
6. Bioinformatics: This field involves the application of math and computer technology to gather, store, analyse and integrate biological and genetic information. One fascinating area is gene sequencing, which is a bit like putting together a jigsaw puzzle with or without the target picture in front of you. Computer programs help examine the risk of genetic disease in patients, the evolutionary history and relationships of organisms, and help with forensic identification of criminals using their unique DNA sequence.

Driving innovation
"," Higher education is booming as governments across the world fuel their knowledge economies with skilled graduates. India is no exception. However, like many other countries, India has a shortage of places and a mismatch between graduate skills and what is needed to power economic growth and jobs creation. Foreign universities have a role to play in meeting these challenges, but they must help raise quality as well.
The way forward
The willingness of the Indian Government to open up opportunities for foreign universities would be a commendable step as it strives to increase the number of university places and drive up quality. But India also needs innovation in education. Indian youth needs people, places and ideas that drive innovation, such as practice-based teaching methods and unique ways of conducting classes. The creativity that comes from the students just needs the right push to help them achieve their goal.
 A robust registration of outcomes on a national platform will help in understanding the virtual success of all efforts. For example, British higher education is admired across the globe for its high academic standards and the autonomy of its universities — autonomy which India is only just starting to recognise as crucial to high standards of scholarship. Good regulation can raise quality and encourage innovation, while also creating opportunities for Indian students to study for British degrees in India.
Allowing foreign universities to develop expertise and exchange knowledge in academic collaborations can be a great mutual advantage for Indian students, which will certainly help expanding in-country provision and bringing in innovation, ideation and niche knowledge.
For example, Middlesex University London’s academic partnership with KM Music Conservatory in Chennai, founded by A. R. Rahman, enables students to experiment with fusions of Indian and Western music techniques. Students who complete their diploma at the Conservatory can progress to a full honours degree at Middlesex in London, but that should not be their only option. With KR Mangalam University, Middlesex is planning mutual recognition of degree programmes, joint degrees, mentoring, student and staff exchanges, internships and summer courses. 
Options
India should welcome discussing similar partnerships with other high quality institutions. While many Indian students want the incredible experience of studying and working in foreign countries, many others want a less expensive or more convenient option of achieving a prestigious, skills-based degree in India. Others will opt for a combination of local and overseas study.
Education is the key to economic and social progress, from high value-added industries to social justice and empowerment. While governments need to be vigilant of the practices that institutions are adopting, each institution must come up with a self assessment mechanism by unlocking the job market with the help of foreign universities. To develop and maintain the Indian education model, a working plan can metamorphose into an iconic programme that will last as a model to follow for years to come.

Time on the Stellarium "," An internship at IITB in 2015 left a lasting impact on my mind. Naturally, another internship there, this summer, was like a dream come true.
This time, my partners — Saloni (DA-IICT, Gandhinagar), Ram Mohan (IIT-BHU), and Jai Deep (NIT, Durgapur) — and I were assigned to work on an MHRD sponsored project titled Development of an affordable Open Sky Planetarium. This involved an integration of hardware and software like controlling stepper motors using some keys on a GUI running on a computer. As this project involved a sound understanding of celestial coordinates, we had to spend a significant amount of time looking at the stars. Thanks to Stellarium (a planetarium software that shows exactly what you see when you look up at the stars), we could see the stars even in the day. Initially, jargon such as right ascension, declination, and so on, were difficult to digest, but IITB’s competitive environment kept our enthusiasm high and helped us learn faster.
Team work works
This project required mastering new tools such as Qt, KiCad, Linux, and so on. All the members contributed to the project; Saloni solved software bugs, Ram Mohan had a bucket full of solutions for current/voltage related issues, and Jai Deep designed a complete PCB using KiCad. Occasionally, I too was of some help, integrating Arduino board with the peripherals. This time too, I fell in love with my lab, which was inevitable, given the ambiance.
Time flew by and finally, the day came when we were supposed to present the project before a jury of eminent academicians. We prepared ourselves with multiple rehearsals, articulating our thoughts and Googling possible questions. During the presentation, we showcased an affordable system that was capable of locating celestial bodies, and a script that could locate a particular star. As we built and ran the script, it drew everyone’s attention.
The last day was memorable as I attended the valedictory speech of Prof. D.B. Phatak. The internship for this cohort concluded with certificate distribution, and I got one for mentoring my fellow interns. It was then that I realised that my participation had been accounted as a mentor in Ekalavya Summer Internship 2017. The transition from an intern to a mentor had undeniably been enthralling and challenging.

Stop, think & go
"," Most of us, if not all, can relate to the pressures a student faces in his/her academic years, especially towards his/her final year of study. Amidst having to work hard for one’s final exams, there is also the struggle of figuring out which field of work one ought to venture into. “In our mainstream education system, students are taught five to 10 subjects chosen by the school or parents from limited resources confined inside a classroom for 12-14 years,” says Aneeta Pathak, founder-director of Anveshan — an educational unit of Auroville, Puducherry. “There is no scope for students to understand themselves, learn what their values are, or learn things that they are really interested in. After 12 years of this, students are expected to choose a field that they will ideally work in, for the rest of their lives.” 
There are those who, for the longest time, will know exactly what they would like to do with their future, but there are also many who find it difficult to find their way.
Handling stress
We often hear stories of youngsters who harm themselves because of the stress they face, especially in academics. Therefore, it is important that students learn to understand themselves. This need cannot be met by the existing systems of schooling, university or healthcare alone. One way to help overcome this difficulty is by taking a gap year between studies to try and figure out a career path. 
A gap year is a period, typically during an academic year, taken by a student as a break between school and college education.
This is where Anveshan comes in. It is an experiential learning and unlearning centre which works with the objective of designing and implementing design sustainable experiential learning courses for self-development and leadership development among the children, youth and adults of the world based on their inner wisdom. One of their new programmes is Anubhava — a pan-India gap-year programme for young aspirants between the ages of 16 and 25. 
Goals
The aim is to help young adults identify their core interests and guide them onto a self-designed learning path. It enables participants to find their innate interests before seriously pursuing one that will define their happiness quotient. There are no prior educational degree or diploma requirements to join the programme — learners can design their own year, unlearn, learn and experience with organisations and mentors on board.
The effects of a gap year can vary from person to person depending on the experiences during their time off. “I took a gap year after graduating from college to get a better sense of which career suited me best and then choose a postgraduate course accordingly. I did several internships at media and publishing houses,” says Bhawna Singh an M.A. English student at Delhi University. “Doing so during the gap year helped me gain practical experience in the fields that interested me I was able to make a more informed decision regarding my future pursuits.”
Whereas, for Lakshmi Gunashekhar from Chennai, the events after her gap year turned out differently. “I took a gap year after my class XII, six years ago. I worked at interesting places and eventually started my own organisation.”
Benefits of the programme include:
“Though there is no time frame to take a gap year, we encourage students to take one when they are at a crossroad, especially after high school or graduation,” says Aneeta. She goes on to add, “Anubhava is a unique year-long programme. The first month is orientation, where participants will discover their passion and will be given tools for self-design learning programme and will develop their own gap year. We have 35 organisations and mentors from diverse fields who are part of this and participants can choose the organisations and mentors according to their passion.”
The world becomes their classroom. There is also a lot of scope for transdisciplinary studies. Some of the expected outcomes are that the students should have a better clarity on what interests him/her and have started learning or working in his/her interest area, have networked with other people in their field of interest, developed life skills, and so on.
The programme is set to launch in October 2018 and the admission for the year 2018-2019 is now open. Visit gapyearindia.auroville.org for more information.

Do I really care?
"," Laughter and yells erupted at the table near ours at dinner in a restaurant. It didn’t seem to make the slightest difference to those diners that there were others in the same place trying to enjoy their evening out. 
In the life-plan of some people, no one else counts. 
Just once, observe how you become invisible in a corridor. A woman advancing from the opposite direction moves as if you do not exist. In other words she doesn’t have to recognise your presence and you therefore step aside to avoid collusion. What you realise after that split-second ‘encounter’ — if you can call it that — is that the other individual has not moved even ten centimeters to avoid crashing into you. Zero adjustment on the part of X and maximum on the part of Y (yourself).
Was it always so or is a rise in displays of poor manners and rudeness in public — be it a jumping a queue, callousness towards the elderly or grabbing a restaurant table — suddenly more marked? It is matched only by its close cousin in the scale of inhumanity: indifference. 
Root cause
 One is particularly astonished at the indifference to rules on our roads. A two-wheeler will drive so close to you that you can smell the driver or he will cut right in front of your car moving laterally to the other side of the road uncaring of the danger and inconvenience to you. If they get home safely it is only because drivers of cars struggle not to hit them. And if at all they meet your glance it is with eyes of stone: so cold and unfeeling are they as they break the rules and cause the person at the wheel great stress. In an unspoken understanding between two-wheel drivers, they will not frustrate one another only the rest of the public. Where does this indifference to the rest of the population come from? My guess is that it comes from deep-seated unexpressed anger and a need to feel superior in some way to the rest of the world and to make everybody else feel inferior; not to mention putting them at risk. For them the rest of the world on the same road might just as well not be there. That a city is filled with strangers is probably at the root of this situation. Politeness and courtesy are expensive in terms of time and the withdrawal of these marks of civility are therefore expressed in a form of indifference.
Another kind of indifference is not lack of feeling but a lack of imagination when it comes to recognising that another person is in distress. It does not occur to us that we ought to take notice. In the preface to his autobiography the rickshaw-driver-cum- writer Manoranjan Byapari wrote: “Here I am. I know I am not entirely unfamiliar to you. You’ve seen me a 100 times. Yet if you insist that you do not recognise me…take a look outside your window. You’ll see a bare-bodied goatherd running behind his cows and goats with a stick. You’ve seen this boy many times. That is me and my childhood.”
When will this boy be free?
Responsibility
 Two important events in our freedom struggle took place in September and both because people refused to be indifferent. The first was on September 25, 1916 when Annie Besant started another Home Rule League and the second was the Second Round Table conference on September 7.
Let us remember those who were not indifferent. They acted because they felt responsible for people they did not even know.

Be the change "," University life is all about experiences. While you are busy studying and socialising, finding time for some voluntary work can definitely add value.
Volunteering helps in a number of ways. First and foremost, it is a great way to make a real contribution to a cause you feel strongly about. Look at the list of societies that are part of your university, and you’ll probably find all the big names already established there: Amnesty, Save the Children, Water Aid, Cancer Research, and the list goes on. Consider what you feel most strongly about — children, cancer, stroke, heart disease, animals, the environment, or something else. 
“I have always loved animals and when I got to know about the volunteering opportunities available at the Crocodile Bank in Chennai, I was ecstatic. From learning about these reptiles to talking about them at show and tell sessions, my experience was unmatched,” recalls Anjana Srimathi, who has passed out of Madras University recently and continues to volunteer during weekends.

Aniket Giri, a student of Kirori Mal College, Delhi University, chose to volunteer in a gender forum because it helped him escape his busy and noisy life. “It provided me with an opportunity to learn about society as well as myself, and the best part is that it gave me satisfaction,” says Aniket, who organises nukkad nataks, quizzes, debates and discussions on gender equality issues. 
Volunteering can also help you have amazing new experiences. The more involved you get, the greater the sense of satisfaction. From starting your own cause to holding a bucket outside a classroom to raise funds, from flaunting off your baking skills for a bake sale to emceeing a fashion show to helping build a well in a village... the list is endless. 
It’s not just about the fund raising; volunteering also means getting to meet people who share a similar passion. This is also a chance to learn a lot, because of the diverse set of people you’ll be working with — all bringing different perspectives, experiences and skills. Suman Kumari, a second year student at Lady Shri Ram College for Women, says, “I chose to volunteer with my college club which was under the National Service Scheme. We have organised workshops to help children with personal development, hygiene and so on. Though I volunteered only for a year, it was a great opportunity to meet like minded people.” 
Career catalyst
Volunteering also boosts your employment prospects. When you go for a job interview, having student volunteering work on your CV is always a bonus. No matter which industry you’re applying to, employers always like to see part of your wider personality, and what you really care about. This can also be an avenue for getting internships — and in turn jobs. 
Agrima Soni, a fourth-year student of BTech at BML Munjal University, says, “I believe that volunteering starts with a purpose and motive. Hence, when engagement meets opportunity, impact is created. I organise Zumba sessions and mind healing workshops for NGOs.”
Madhur Garg, Shubjam Goyal and Shruti Jain, also students of BML Munjal University, have volunteered at the Savera Club, a college club to help destitute children. “I have been teaching underprivileged students for the last one year. What began as a stint is now a passion. My week is incomplete until I spend time with the children. Some have even cracked competitive exams and secured admissions for higher education,” says an elated Shubham, a third year student. 
Rashi Verma and Monica Manoj of the class of 2018 at Manipal Academy of Higher Education, Dubai, went a step ahead and started The Ojas Project with the aim of empowering blue-collar workers in the UAE with free education. “We crafted a course plan, gathered a team of enthusiastic volunteers and kick-started the project with the support of our university. At the end of two months, we were overwhelmed to hear that our students felt more confident.” 
Online platforms
Today, our favourite excuse is that we have no time. Apps such as Donate My Time, which currently has 45 NGOs and 150 registered volunteers, help solve this problem. This app will help you get in touch with events organised by NGOs near where you live or work. Organisations such as CRY also offer a diverse range of volunteering opportunities. Through them, you can not only contribute towards the betterment of others, but also undergo a transformational journey for yourselves! 
With technology, volunteering has reached yet another level where you don’t have to be physically present to actually contribute. For instance, Helpers of Handicapped (HoH), a Kolhapur-based organisation, ensures that its 500 underprivileged students receive quality education by providing them with online access to teachers based in Kolkata. Platforms like these offer you an opportunity to volunteer by creating and managing their websites. 
Do you know that two hours of your time each week could “make a difference”, especially to the lives of underprivileged children? Make A Difference, or MAD as it is better known, began in Kochi in 2006, when 20 young college-goers decided to help empower underprivileged children by giving them quality education.

A sense of self "," In Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, Dumbledore tells Harry, “It is our choices that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities.” As Potterheads well know, the venerable headmaster’s words often hold lessons not just for getting through the difficult years of school, but for life. At first glance, it’s the sort of thing that an elder tells a young person, and the sort of thing a young person tends to dismiss. But it’s also the sort of thing that needs to be unpacked, thought about, and internalised.
We tend to think of abilities as features of personality, either innate or acquired. We may describe them as talents, skills, or aptitudes, but in general we are talking about what we are good at or can do relatively easily and well. Some of us are good with language, or numbers, or art, music or sports, and while excellence in any of these areas demands practice and persistence, we come to think of these as part of who we are. Thinking of ourselves as having certain abilities can be a definite confidence booster, and there is something to be said for recognising — and doing — what we are good at.
Complicated
But the first part of Dumbledore’s statement complicates it all somewhat. If our abilities — the building blocks of our persona — don’t show who we are, then what does? Our sense of self draws from a complex set of features, some of which (depending on our beliefs) are taken to be hereditary and others a product of environment, opportunity and nurturing. I’m not going into the big question of how and why these “abilities” come to be, but let’s assume for the moment that we have them and are aware of them. So, then, how do our choices — and not abilities — determine who we are?
Looking at it this way moves us away from the deterministic, or fatalistic, approach that makes one say: “Oh, that’s the way I am, so I can’t help it.” Or: “I’m made this way, I can’t do any better/different.” Dumbledore would see this as a cop-out. Instead, we need to look at how we use those abilities at any given time. You may be an excellent communicator, gifted with the ability to move people with your words. You could choose a career that uses this ability to speak or write in a way that educates and clarifies the world for others. Or you could choose to work with words in a way that persuades in not so straightforward ways. Those who possess extraordinary physical strength can use it either to create or destroy — it’s the same muscles that are used in both cases, to different ends.
Implications
Choice doesn’t only have to do with abilities of this kind — the very possibility of choice also contains within it several directions in which one might go, each with a different set of implications. It’s worthwhile considering what different options mean — for yourself and for others (and, where pertinent, for the world in general). Our choices may be constrained by many external factors, but we need to get away from the idea that they are constrained by “the way we are”! If there’s one thing in the world we can change, it is, possibly, the way we are.

Happier days ahead
"," The introduction of the ‘Happiness Curriculum’ by the Delhi government is a milestone decision for the overall development and welfare of children. This curriculum was launched on July 2, this year, for all government schools students from nursery up to class VIII, in order to improve the current circumstances of diminishing self-worth and increasing mental problems among students. 
Blue Orb Foundation is one of the five leading companies that contributed in the modulation of ‘The Happiness Curriculum’. “The tendency of the education system is such that no emphasis is given to students’ overall development,” says Madhuri Mehta, CEO of Blue Orb. “As a mother of a young boy, I realised how students have been overburdened with excelling in every subject and are suffering under a lot of new age ethical dilemmas. The need of the hour is quite evident. The introduction of the happiness curriculum is to ensure the mental as well as emotional well-being of a child.”
“This initiative should be launched in all schools in order to promote stress dealing and problem solving abilities. If companies like Google have initiatives to introduce mindfulness for their employees, then young students who are just learning to deal with their stressful atmosphere should be taught these skills, so that they can become self-aware citizens,” adds Madhuri.
New initiatives
 “The curriculum is definitely bringing about a change in the current situation of government schools. Students get to interact and express themselves,” says Naraina, a Sanskrit teacher from S.K.V. “The introduction of meditation and thoughtfulness has increased the concentration levels of students and they take more interest in the classes. These classes have created a shared space of referentiality among the students and teachers. So, now teachers can impart knowledge and values by using familiar examples. However, due to the number of academic classes being reduced because of the inclusion of this course, teachers are finding it difficult to complete their course in a limited time.” The curriculum follows a similar book for all the classes. She suggested that this curriculum should be further specialised, in accordance with students’ age and need.
Pratiksha Pathak, a member of the spoken English Project, GSBV Tirampur says, “For the first few minutes, the teachers would let children interact with each other. At times, some teachers would also take them out for a stroll and make them observe. Gradually, it should lead to development of focus and concentration because not only would they report what they saw but also what they heard.”
“The set of activities involved are aimed at enhancing or developing a particular skill. Moreover, no one is penalised for not completing an activity. There was zero pressure to complete something within a stipulated time. So, they could innovate and conduct sessions as per their convenience and ease of the class,” she adds. “It is a good initiative, if implemented well. Lack of training and exposure can be negative but gradually that should be improved upon.”
The effect
Chavvi Sharma, a student of Std. VIII studying in Government Girls Senior Secondary School, New Delhi, shares her views on the curriculum stating, “The need to feel happy about oneself is important in a pressurising education system such as ours. This curriculum teaches us to feel confident about ourselves and rewards us with appreciation and encouragement when we follow the right path.”
“I always used to feel stressed when I didn’t score well or understand lessons being taught. I was shy about talking about my problems with my teachers and parents, but with the introduction of the happiness curriculum, I feel more positive. I have started interacting with my teachers which helps me to solve my problems,” says Babita, another student of Delhi Government School. 
“Parents from my colony were happy to see their children building perseverance. Children were told to collect rice bags for the underprivileged as a part of the curriculum activity. Many doors were slammed, and failure was disheartening. Yet, the constant efforts of students were able to feed hundreds of mouths. Such lessons will guide them through their lives,” Madhuri says, shedding light on the changes that this curriculum is bringing about in society.
Madhuri concludes, “Everyone knows what is right, but to be able to accept and solve life problems is what the curriculum will aim at. By learning about happiness, our children will be able to lead a more fulfilling life. Blue Orb Foundation offers similar courses for private schools and has already collaborated with many schools in Delhi and NCR.”

Erasing the margins
"," 



The MAEF schemes which include both grants-in-aid for construction of schools and scholarships to minority girls to pursue their education further, act as an impetus to empower these girls socially and economically. MAEF has provided 1,15,000 scholarships in 2017-18 alone and if this trend continues, it wouldn’t be long before literacy rate of minority girls’ population begins to alter substantially to a positive statistic.




When I first came across this scheme which has helped meritorious girls from minority communities since 2003-04, benefiting 3.89 lakh girls with about ₹392 crores in total, I wished I had known about it earlier so that my friends could have also benefited from it. This has always been the problem with the schemes — unawareness among prospective beneficiaries, mainly because of insufficient and inefficient advertisement.




 The extension of allowances which has increased to ₹10,000 and ₹12,000 for girls of classes IX-X, and XI-XII, is a commendable move. I hope that this scheme is advertised properly, especially in small towns and villages and girls who aspire to study can finally do so. Those who were denied education earlier and instead asked to help at home will for once be able to fulfill their dreams and see their dreams become a reality soon. 




Minority education should be promoted because it is a part of the fundamental rights — cultural and minority rights in Article 24 of the Indian Constitution. The government should take necessary measures to promote education with many such incentives. It goes with the spirit of deferential but equal treatment, to make sure that education be equally available for everyone irrespective of caste and creed.

Keep at it
","‘Ek baar jo maine commitment kar di, fir main apne aap ki bhi nahi sunta’ and the theatre erupts into euphoric catcalls and revelry. This is undoubtedly one of the most resounding Salman Khan one-liners, vital to the runaway success of a Bollywood blockbuster. This is a favourite Bollywood quip of mine.
I was talking to a fitness enthusiast the other day who seemed to have taken to running daily lately, “I’ve signed up for a #3Kchallenge — to run 3K every day for a month as I realised I had stopped running regularly. There is no getting away now.”
Commitment
A client who worked with me on accountability and life goals, once shared that her minimum daily steps commitment is sacrosanct, “If nothing else, I now complete my step-goal walking inside my apartment however seemingly numbing it is.” As I know, she has undergone an unprecedented shift in fitness and well-being, committing to small yet discernible changes in her daily schedule.
This is real life, made of small, yet defining personal victories. Such stories don’t make it to a bestselling autobiography but every inspiring autobiography is indeed a recount of personal challenges and hard-won victories in the writer’s milieu. The common thread being that commitments made to the self succeed well above the promises made to appeal to others or our own unfavourable impulses.
So, this month, as I watched Nike’s latest Colin Kaepernick commercial, it stirred connections to many stories of individual challenges and wins. To me ‘Don’t try to be the fastest runner in your school or the fastest in the world! Be the fastest ever!’ is a big leap and a deeper, more insightful personalisation of the ‘Just Do It’ mantra. It operates at two levels — one, it urges us to consider resetting the bar to break through personal barriers and redefine goals; two, it speaks to the prowling hero in each of us.
The truth is, no one wants to be found out, no one wants to look bad at the end of the race and more insidiously, no one wants a confirmation of not being good enough. This exists as we focus outward, pitching the self in comparison with the other who is winning. It is endemic. I see many, a morning walker, break into a run when no one is watching, ‘Let me try but let no one else find out’ — is a basic urge. When that focus shifts inward the self-dialogue is kinder — ‘Let me find out how it feels! Let me do my best.’
Confidence-building
Getting around self-debilitating urges is achievable. I also believe that getting to that place of committing-the-self is a road made of many confidence and character building steps where we make promises to keep them. When you say you will arrive at 9.00 a.m., you arrive at 8.58 a.m. When you are tempted to commit to call back in two minutes, you stop! Instead promise to call in 10. To wake up at 6.00 a.m., set up the alarm for 6.00 a.m.; no snooze mode, you just wake up! These simple yet vital wins foster tenacity. 
To win we must examine commitment as our very character on the line. No wonder we have to be unrelenting. Going a step further, we will publicise a commitment and deny it the cushion of anonymity. Small, frequent victories will form the bedrock of success and higher goals. Of course sleep, convenience, comfort, anonymity are collateral damage on this road. As Nike says, ‘Believe in something, even if it means sacrificing everything’.
And then we will witness our confidence and character grow deep, ingrained roots.

Avoid a meltdown
","“Your friend Akash tells me that the man who came to your school yesterday spoke really well. He had some interesting things to say about...”
“Akash may have liked it. But most of us didn’t. The man used too many jargons.”
“Jargon. The word ‘jargon’ is mostly used...”
“I know what ‘jargon’ means. It refers to the special terms or expressions used in a profession or field. For example, LBW, forward short leg, leg slip, and so on, are jargons used in cricket.”
“That’s right! But what I wanted to say was ‘jargon’ is an uncountable noun. The plural is ‘jargon’ and not ‘jargons’. I don’t understand the jargon of law.”
“I don’t think anyone does. The speaker used too much jargon yesterday. How was the annual party, by the way? Did you have a good time?”
Eventful
“Most of us were having a good time till the Marketing Manager had a major meltdown.”
“A major meltdown? Does it mean he became rather emotional and started crying?”
“It could. The expression ‘meltdown’ is mostly used in informal contexts. When an individual has a ‘meltdown’, he becomes very upset about something.”
“Usually when people get upset, they shout at others.”
“That’s right! A meltdown suggests an emotional outburst of some kind. You could either shout at somebody or break down because...”
“In other words, the person is no longer in control of his emotions. He loses his self-control. Serena had a major meltdown during the recent US Open final.”
“She did, didn’t she? Here’s another example. Taking care of triplets can’t be easy. I’m sure Revathi has a meltdown every now and then.”
“Why don’t you ask her husband? When I was young, my father used to have a major meltdown whenever he saw my report card. Was it the same case with your father?”
“In my case, it was my mother who used to have the meltdown. My father, on the other hand, didn’t really care. He was pretty laid-back.”
Composed
“Laid-back? Does it mean a lazy person? Someone who doesn’t really care about anything?”
“That’s not what it means. A laid-back person is someone who doesn’t get upset about things very easily. He seems very calm and relaxed all the time.”
“In other words, someone who doesn’t let the pressure get to him. Nothing really worries him. My physics teacher has a laid-back approach to everything.”
“I enjoy being in the company of people who are laid-back. When you’re in their company, you begin to relax. The term can be used with things as well. For example, compared to Mumbai, Hyderabad is a very laid-back city.”
“Compared to Mumbai, any city in India would seem laid-back. Raju says that the company that he’s working for now is pretty laid-back. They don’t have a dress code or anything. The only thing they care about is meeting deadlines.”
“Isn’t your uncle coming to your place today?”
“That’s right. He said that he’d be arriving in our place around six in the evening.”
“Arriving ‘at’, not ‘in’. You normally use ‘arrive in’ when you have a city or country in mind. For example, the children arrived in Hyderabad last week.”
“The President will be arriving in Singapore this afternoon.”
“Otherwise, it’s usually ‘arrive at’. We arrived at the airport a little after one.”
“By the time we arrived at the bus stop, the bus had left.”
“That sounds like you. You’re always late for everything.”

Firing the right shot
","I was always interested in space and defence technology and was used to reading articles to keep myself updated. After my second year, I did a six-week internship in the Small Arms Factory (SAF) of Indian Ordnance Factories Board, the Ministry of Defence in Kanpur. SAF offers opportunities for students from various departments with its sections consisting INSAS assembly, tool room, computer numerical control (CNC) machine section, MAG gun section, small component section, electrical department, IT cell, and a cell for management students. 
There are two ways to get this internship. If you are an ‘employee’s ward’ in which if you know any employee currently working under the Ministry of Defence, you can directly contact their HR department. The second is the one I went through — contact the senior general manager of the factory and send him your resume and a covering letter. If he finds your application suitable, the manager will forward it to the HR department. 
Levels of screening
The selection process is a bit challenging as they get 1000’s of applications for this internship and only 100-120 students are selected during summer. You have to undergo an interview with IES/IAS officers. 
During the interview, your knowledge on what you want to pursue is tested. They also check for your area of interest according to which you are allotted a section in the factory. The interview was unexpectedly easy for me as I had good grades and had an intensive knowledge about the defence field.
I was allotted INSAS Assembly Section which assembles INSAS rifles and INSAS Light machine guns (LMG). INSAS rifles are used by the Indian armed forces along with some foreign users. 
My work was to study the faults and the firing results of the rifle and to provide remedial measures to improve them. INSAS rifles, which are assembled in SAF, undergo a series of firing tests in the firing range by army/navy shooters who test it thoroughly. For me, the best part of this internship was to carry the INSAS rifles and to perform the shooting in the range. INSAS rifles have many faults such as BNC, cover fall, RBNC, light strike, and extract. And, to improve these faults, one needs to understand the details of the manufacturing of different parts of the rifle which are manufactured in the factory itself.
The people working at SAF are highly talented and have good knowledge of their specific sections. They are open-minded and ready to clear doubts. This internship gave me an opportunity to apply my theoretical knowledge and get an in-depth understanding about guns and machines. 
As mechanical engineering students, we usually deal with lathe, shaper, milling, and other machines in college while in the industry, the machines used are giant sized. Seeing closely how these machines operate and how gun components are manufactured was one of my major takeaways from this internship.

A class with a difference
","When I entered the Easy English School, Wakeshwar Vidyalaya Peth, Pune, an initiative by ITNL (IL&FS Transportation Networks Ltd.), it did not matter that I had had a long day’s travel behind me, or that the pitter-patter of the rain just did not seem to give up; what mattered was that this basic abode of learning housed energies, which were beyond just the average. For, perhaps, the ‘nth’ time I understood in life how many things, we humans, just take for granted in the run of a day, and that includes, of course, the countless blessings bestowed on us in our respective lives. I reminisced, with a sense of déjà vu, how difficult it is to learn something new, especially if the resources are the bare minimum; but, mind you, bare minimum is sometimes so much more than what these words just give away.
Unknown domain
I was invited by the headmaster of the school, Mr. Ashok Valse, to visit one of the classes in order to interact with the students, for whom English had not been a mother tongue, but who had gathered their guts, resources and wits to venture into a domain unknown — learning a language hardly used in their day to day lives. It reminded me of my days when I took to learning German — my ‘mother tongue’, whose learning evaded me till my later years. I understood the challenges of learning a foreign language, a language hardly used, but yet the will to master it — either to prove a point or to just to evolve. These youngsters were no different. 
I could relate to the efforts they made, when they placed words together to make sentences, when they struggled with vocabulary or shyness and insecurity, or when the mind would just go blank in front of an audience. I did understand, I did relate, but what caught me off guard was the determination to shine, no matter what. 
With reverence
Lalita Kashid, the English teacher of the class, is a lady who has carved a path for herself. Most of the language learning she now imparts has been self-learnt, polished with the passage of time, and experience, making her quite a force to reckon with. Her students adore her — not only because she is their teacher, but because she brings along with her a zest for learning, and an energy for living life to the fullest. Lalita invites Shrushti, a young girl, around 14 years of age, to speak in front of the class on the subject of superstition, which won the youngster the top position in a competition. Shrushti obliges; with powerful intonation and expressions, she completes her speech, leaving us all stunned — a young girl, from a village, in the middle of nowhere, aligns and modulates her thoughts so well! Her inspiration? Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, and his book Wings of Fire. Tanvi, another student, from the same class, talks about her family, comprising of 12 members; her narration captivates because of the meaning and emotion it carries. Sanika talks about how education is vital for the development of the girl child, and hence the community — the correlation of both these subjects is, in itself, a realisation. The expressions begin to flow as the class begins to ‘open up’ to a set of strange faces. We absorb and assimilate the experience.
It helps me re-assert to myself that for an individual to teach or learn, it is not the only the infrastructure and technology available that matter; they are, of course, facilitators; what matters is the human touch, which help transform pedagogy from mere transmission to transformation, accompanied with grit and determination to make a difference.
As I take my leave from the class, I look at the cheerful faces, with eyes that host a million dreams, and I replenish that fire in me to live life to the fullest, now and always.

Double-edged sword?
","



Hiking the budget on interest-free loans for students will not be of any real help to students in an economy with exponentially increasing unemployment rates. 
This policy will further increase their burden and force them to participate in an education which acts as a catalyst for the private funded university, as well an all-exclusive education which will encourage more students to enrol in such universities, in the hope of a promising future. 
Instead, the government should be utilising the money to build more government funded institutions that encourages more students, irrespective of the economic background they come from .




This will discourage students from pursuing a career in research or academia, as the brunt of the loan will be borne by the student and an immediate need for the repayment of the loan will not allow them to continue with the research, which reaps results, over a period of time. 
Is this a move by the government to completely do away with government institution for an interest-free educationloan ? 
This is a question we need to ask in times where, unemployment of the youth has become an issue of paramount concern for all.
 



Availing educational loans need a different treatment as they involve the future of students and are an investment. Loans to genuine students who are in need, and want to pursue their education should not be considered for the interest by looking into their past results. It is, by and large, the middle-class and lower economic groups who tend to suffer in matters of educational loans, as they struggle to arrange funds for their child’s education and assorted needs. It also burdens the student, which creates job and health issues. 




Education loans alone will not help the government in improving the country’s educational scenario. 
The system should be such that students are in a position to do away with the vicious circle of loans and the interest that follows. 
With this move, the burden of interest is removed and it will be an option for students who are unable to pursue their dreams due to monetary deficits, as most graduates lack the appropriate skills to land them into good jobs.

The language question
","India is a multilingual country; we publish newspapers in 35 languages. India’s languages are incredibly expressive; Himachal Pradesh’s 16 languages have 200 words for snow including one that means ‘falling when the moon is up’. Languages are fundamental to identity and social cohesion, but our shifting language policy is driven by the perceived primacy of one language, outdated assessments, and misjudging impact of choices. I would like to make the case for a sensitive rethink of language policy in education that bends towards multilingualism and recognises our needs of identity, creativity and economics.
Disruption
 Linguist, Claude Hagege says languages are not simply a collection of words; they are living, breathing organisms holding the connections of a culture. Ethnologue Editor Paul Lewis warns about the close links between language and identity; if people begin to think of their language as useless, they see their identity as such as well, and this leads to social disruption. Almost all higher education is in English and we must listen to Mark Tully’s argument that it must become a “genuine link language of the country, not just, as it is at present, the link language of the elite”. The demise of Indian languages has nothing to do with English; Firag Gorakhpuri and Harivansh Rai Bachan — two interesting poets of Urdu and Hindi — were professors of English literature. Our English is our own — recognised as a different syntax, phonology and lexical structure. But home languages are critical because they encapsulate our culture, who we are, how we think differently. We need a healthy attitude to languages that moves away from parochialism, build languages with time-tested traditions in homes, and scientific teaching of language in schools. Co-existence of many languages, races, cultures, and religions has been the essence of Indian heritage, with established traditions of a language at home, one for work and another for socialising, and we must retain that.
Creativity
Multilingualism is a key to creativity; it impacts cognitive development by affecting the function and structure of the brain, catalyses executive functioning, problem solving and task switching ability, and creates original thinking. In India, the role of English has become like Windows; an operating system because of higher labour mobility, it’s role in business and technology, and our economic trajectory towards services. Can that be enough? The Economist suggests that 2/3rd of 572 multinational companies credit multicultural teams for their success. The economic upsides of multilingualism are many but the most obvious is in jobs and wage premiums.
Harvard educator Nonie LeSaux suggests that language building needs an accumulation of experiences and interactions — at home and school — developing both skills and knowledge. Studies in African countries, possibly the only other linguistically diverse heritages, show that bilingual literacy teaching needs structured learning programmes, using high quality resources and training. Development of languages needs the support of aligned standards, sequenced curriculum, instruction, and assessments, and also renewed curricular approaches and resources. But our policies and assessments need updating first. We need to get to schools where identity, heritage and diversity are legitimised and there is freedom to work with languages based on the community needs, where early immersion in two languages replaces the jerky start or stop of the three language policy.
Countries are narratives and the stories we tell our children have long shadows. A multilingual India is more tolerant, more creative, and more innovative and hence more economically successful, politically stable and resilient than a monolingual one. People are ahead of politics on this issue but schools are held back by policy. Set us free so we can do two languages well.

","The National Testing Agency (NTA) has come out with a two-pronged Joint Entrance Examination (JEE)-Main for 2019. Compared to many other programmes, like the AIEEE in 2002, by CBSE, this scheme seems to be wholesome and a result of more mature planning.
The first factor of appreciation is to have complete sessions of the online test. All candidates will have to answer the same set of questions, as against the system like National Aptitude Test in Architecture (NATA), where each candidate will be served a different set of questions, randomly selected by a computer.
However, the different sessions will have different sets of questions, which may result in differences in the difficulty levels in the questions. This anomaly is proposed to be tackled by NTA by normalising a procedure which is simple, effective and acceptable to all. It consists of computing the percentiles of candidates in each mark list, leading to preparation of percentile rank lists, all of which will be merged to yield a single percentile rank list. (Ties will be resolved by standard methods).
Two chances
For the JEE 2019, NTA proposes two tests, one in January and the other in April. The intention is, if the first test is missed by a candidate for some reason, the second can be taken, without having to wait for a year. There are some areas where further improvement is possible. NEET 2019 will also be held in May. In practice, every student will prefer attempting both the January and April exams of JEE. Many will also attempt NEET. Thus, the students’ exertion on these entrance tests will be more than before, resulting in less attention to board exams, which may lead to reduced proficiency in the basics of physics, chemistry, math/biology. Further, both JEE and NEET test the candidate’s knowledge in physics and chemistry which are commonly learnt at the same level, by the candidates. Therefore testing in these subjects twice is redundant, causing avoidable strain to students. 
A scheme that was adopted in the Tamil Nadu Professional Courses Entrance Examinations (TNPCEE) that was being held until 2006, could be emulated. Accordingly, a common test pattern for (one set of) JEE and NEET can consist of a paper I on physical sciences (physics + chemistry), a paper II on math and a paper III on biology. Each paper can be of two-hours, all the three scheduled for one day, constituting one ‘session’, online. Admission authorities for JEE and NEET will consider the results of candidates in Papers I and II, or papers I and III, accordingly. This programme is plausible since the same agency, namely, NTA will be conducting both exams.

Time to act now
","I am a final-year B.tech student and have got a placement offer. However, I am not interested in it. I have always been interested in painting and shading. But I am unsure about a future in it. What opportunities do I have and are there reputed institutes where I can enhance my skills? - Vishnu Lasya Marthala.
Dear Vishnu,
I understand that you have a placement offer today post your B.Tech. Do you agree that many in your own batch are perhaps not lucky to have landed one? What have you done with painting and shading, so far? Is it a mere hobby, or have you witnessed success with art to a level that you can make it a profession? Certainly enrol into an art class and work on enhancing your skill set. Keeping it an active interest, however, by being merely romantic about it, is not the best decision, at this juncture. Thirty one million educated Indians are unemployed, according to the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy’s March 2018 report. You certainly don’t want to add a number and become a statistical entry.
It was my childhood dream to become a pilot. I am a science graduate, willing to pursue a career in aviation. I was hopeful of becoming a proud woman pilot until I heard from many people that it is an expensive course. I am holding myself back despite my love for planes. Is there any other course that that I can pursue, to join the civil aviation department, that also provides scholarship? — Aysha Ibrahim
Dear Aysha,
Becoming a pilot undoubtedly is an expensive dream, but certainly attainable. Please read the (recent) inspiring story of Captain Ankita from Mumbai, who faced several financial difficulties, multiple failures and opposition from her family, but never gave up on her dream of becoming a pilot, after seven long years. A PPL or a CPL certification in India could cost up to ₹18-20 lakhs. The Government of India provides scholarship under the OBC category for this course. You have to clear the Director General of Civil Aviation exams with a 70%, in addition to your course work. IDo write to the DCGA (http://www.dgca.nic.in) and get more information on the payment schemes and scholarships available. Other aviation careers available are across Ground Staff, Air ticketing and Cabin Crew.Good luck.
I am a B.Sc computer science graduate currently preparing for competitive exams — banking and SSC. There is extreme competition and I am worried about my future. Should I continue with this or pursue more courses that will equip me for better future? — Karmjeet Singh
Dear Karmjeet,
Don’t let anxiety and negative thoughts stop you from trying. Confront your fears and put your best foot forward. Prepare well, attempt the exams and the results will decide what the future holds. Of course there is crazy, unreal competition, but that doesn’t mean you won’t get a job. Do your best and forget the rest. B.Sc computer science is a good course that is in demand today. Artificial intelligence, machine learning, call centre jobs, computer-aided designing, computer science engineering, software design, development, hardware engineering, web designing or development, MSc in computer science, MCA, MBA have all good prospects and can help you get a good package in the IT sector.
I am an undergraduate doctor preparing for Pre-PG exam. I am excited and interested in working hard and giving it all I can, but I am unable to study alone and constantly require a library-like environment which is not available in my current city. Every time I sit alone, I keep postponing and neglecting my work. Please guide me. — Tanmay Bajpai
Dear Tanmay,
You say that you are excited about taking these exams, but are unable to follow your schedule due to studying alone, not having a conducive study environment and procrastination. How then, do you intend to take these exams? I realise that you may not have anyone in your city to study with, as you mentioned that you need company. But it is time to know that from now on, it is going to be ‘to each his own’. You are on your own. Take up the responsibility and start working on it. Step up, make your own plan, schedule your work, syllabus, maintain timelines and try and stick to them. Do your best to follow a schedule and stay consistent. Time is ticking, and these excuses will not result in adequate preparation for your exams. Make things happen.

Persistence pays
","Epitomised by Malcolm Gladwell’s 10,000 hours rule, success eventually boils down to ‘persistence’. If you pull in efforts over a period of time (called rigor), you will succeed — get into a college of your choice, learn a new skill, make your business successful, and so on. I have seen this principle manifest itself in pretty much all situations. Given that all people have a certain basic intelligence, and the IQ variation for most is within 10%, success (or lack of it) can only be attributed to rigor and resilience. 
Here are some student experiences to elaborate upon this point. A student was sure that the only school that he wanted to study at was the Harvard Business School (HBS). A laudable objective, but with acceptance rates well under 10%, HBS was not going to be easy! Further, he was an Indian male — one of the most over-represented demographic at HBS. To make matters worse, he was average — no spikes in academics, nor in sports or extracurricular activities and a fairly average professional experience at an IT services firm. His GMAT scores were also just about average — at about 710/800. The first time he applied, he could not get in. He applied for the second time but could not make it then either. The third time, he did not want to apply (and had already secured admissions from some other great MBA colleges) but eventually put in an application. His story, this time, was unusual. He talked about his resolve of getting into HBS at any cost. He talked about his past attempts and his failure to make it to the coveted institution. He also talked about the impact that it had on his career and personal life. And he capped it all with a dare — that HBS should consider itself lucky that someone is so persistent about getting there. Not taking him would be their loss and not his. He got an early decision admit at HBS with 50% tuition waiver. This is a story of persistence. Of not giving up. 
Perseverance is the key
Often, youngsters come to me with a clamour that they want to do something new in life. These are prospective college applicants, young entrepreneurs, people who are trying to develop a new hobby or interest, and so on. My usual response is a question — ‘How long have you been at it?’ The answers have always surprised me and hold the key to their lack of ‘success’ in their ventures. Most tell me that they have been at it just for a couple of days to a few months. Unless you have spent time at a particular vocation, you cannot succeed.
Another student came to us in the first year of her undergraduate studies. She had more than two years before her MIM application was due and she wanted to build a narrative that was powerful and representative of who she was. Over time, we realised that she was passionate about smells — she was particularly captivated by the smell of the ‘first rain.’ She chose to explore her interests in that area and went on to research and develop deeper skills and understanding of the subject. She travelled to the narrow by-lanes of Old Delhi, explored the process of ‘holding a smell in a ghara’ in the suburb of Kannauj, learnt to mix oils with Hyderabadi artisans in Begum-Bazaar, and explored a design-thinking approach to build out bespoke smells (more western method) in Bengaluru. This is an adventure of persistence woven through more than two years of labour. Her narrative was on ‘smells’, and in her application, she expressed an intent to be a part of luxury and leisure industry. She got into the best European colleges and is currently pursuing her master’s in luxury management.
A student wanted to be a soccer player. He kept coming back to it — as a player (he was a national level soccer player), possibly a coach (briefly he flirted with the idea), event management at local events and even soccer entrepreneurship. However, none of those turned into a durable career. However, over the course of three years that he spent at these soccer related vocations, he matured as a soccer enthusiast and in the process, built a ‘love for soccer’ profile that was unparalleled. He later applied to one of the most coveted programmes in sports management — the FIFA master’s (International master’s in management, law and humanities of sports) jointly conducted by three universities in England, Italy and Switzerland. This became a stepping stone not just for a promising career with Real Madrid as an assistant team manager, but also for realising his passion. Persistence eventually paid off.
You need to spend time in building your narrative to get into a top-notch school. Eventually, it does not boil down to your academics or generalised scores, but on the story that you are telling. And the only way that this story can become potent is by building this narrative over a period of time. Evidence-based inputs which give credibility to this story are a prerequisite to make it powerful and realistic.

Stand up for yourself
","You are in the midst of studying when a friend who is done with her exams calls and wants to discuss whether she should break up with her boyfriend. Deep down, you know that this is not a good time for you to talk as you have a lot to revise. Yet, you hear her out, thinking she will feel hurt if you cut her off.
A professor asks you to take part in an intercollegiate debating contest. You would love to participate, but your sister is getting engaged on that day. Your parents advise you to ask the professor to be excused this time. Just as you approach the professor, he pats you on the shoulder and says, “I have just submitted the form for the contest with your name. I know you won’t let the college down.” 
Voice yourself
In both situations, a student is worse off for not speaking up. This happens to all of us some of the time. But if you are a person who always puts your own needs behind, you are likely to experience chronic frustration. However, you can learn to assert yourself. So, even if you are always the one who ends up doing most of the work on group projects, you can learn to speak up and even get others to do their share.
One of the impediments to stating your needs or position is that some people erroneously believe that assertiveness is the same as aggressiveness. But, there is a wide chasm between the two behaviours. As Catherine Saint Louis writes in The New York Times, “You can stand up for yourself without resorting to bullying.” In fact, being assertive involves disagreeing respectfully. She provides the following tips to make disagreeing more agreeable to those of us who find it difficult to stand up for ourselves. 
First, stick to the point. As Saint Louis succinctly reminds us, “No is a complete sentence.” Don’t feel the need to elaborate on reasons why you may choose not to do something for someone. While some situations may call for extended explanations, like telling your boss why you didn’t finish the project on time, avoid long-winded answers if a shorter one will suffice. 
Next, if someone extends an invitation to an event, be it a party or a conference, and you would rather not go, you may decline graciously. “While I hope to goes really well, I won’t be able to make it this time.” Further, take ownership of your utterances by using ‘I.’ So, if a friend calls you for dinner in the last-minute and you are loath to go, instead of making an accusatory statement involving ‘you’, simply say, “I already have plans for tonight.” Never mind if those plans involve staying home and watching Netflix.
If you cannot decide on the fly and want more time to think through your options, ask for it. “I will get back to you about this by tomorrow.” Often, people give in because they feel pressured to respond immediately. But, in many situations, you can always buy time so that you can weigh the pros and cons of various choices. Finally, if you can predict what someone will request, as they seem to repeatedly ask for favours that you give into reluctantly, prepare what you will say beforehand. “I can’t come shopping with you this weekend to buy your mother’s birthday present, but I heard there are great sales going on in Globus Mall.” If they press on, as some people are wont, simply hold on to your stand. Once they realise that you won’t give in, they will.

Crossing the border
","The prospect of studying abroad can be both exciting and daunting. With extensive research required for making an informed choice of a country, university and course, the process is quite taxing. Yocket, an online platform, seeks to simplify the process and guide students in firming up their plans.
The essence of Yocket is its large and active community of study-abroad aspirants. “Aspirants can connect and seek help for planning their foreign education from current students, alumni, experts and representatives of international universities,” says co-founder Kashyap Matani. From guidance on test prep to comparing universities, from writing essays to applying for loans, Yocket aims to be a one-stop solution for aspirants.




A host of features
According to co-founder Sumeet Jain, the platform derives its power from the network. “Students are currently dependent on the information provided by counsellors. Yocket makes things transparent. We also connect users with similar interests and profiles to enable them to discuss plans and make an informed choice,” he says. Available as a website as well as a mobile app, the platform enables not only networking but also a handy set of features carefully curated to meet the needs of aspirants. Yocket also eliminates the constraint of geographical distance — every year, the platform hosts a graduate virtual fair, in which representatives from universities in the U.S. interact with students online.
Pressing need
The motivation to start the platform came when the co-founders were running another platform, stupidsid.com, a website providing college reviews and study material for students in India. A large number of queries about studying abroad, and a general obscurity in the process that led to several wrong choices, made them aware of a pressing need as well as a business opportunity. Today, Yocket not only helps in aggregating university platforms from across the globe, but also gives students access to reliable counsel.
Why not Indian universities? “Yocket’s vision is to make international education more achievable. We do plan to cover Indian universities, but from the perspective of international students who wish to study in India,” answers Kashyap.
Plans for the future are in plenty. “We are currently catering to graduate students. We will soon be expanding to cover undergraduates as well. We aim to make Yocket a default platform for all international students,” signs off Sumeet.

Research for change
","A professor and his students at the Indian Institute of Technology - Madras (IIT-M) have developed a technology to remove arsenic from water and make it potable. Over a period of 10 years since the project began in 2008, the researchers have finally seen the benefits of their work on the ground. The technology developed by the Institute is being used widely in West Bengal and Punjab to eliminate arsenic from water.
In as many as eight to 10 states in the country, the groundwater contains a large amount of arsenic — a chemical that is a major health hazard causing an increase in cancer mortality rate. States such as West Bengal, Assam, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Nagaland, portions of Uttar Pradesh, Manipur and Punjab bear the brunt of arsenic deposits in water. In these states, the concentration of arsenic is as high as 200 parts per billion litres (ppb) when the permissible limit is only 10 ppb. Until recently, the only solution was installing reverse osmosis plants, which were expensive. 
Cost effective 
 IIT-M’s solution was to develop a material that can selectively absorb arsenic from water. “Over nine lakh units have been installed benefitting 70 lakh people,” says T. Pradeep, professor of chemistry at the Institute, who leads the research. In Punjab, using the same technology, around 10 million litres of clean water are currently being provided.
The cost of removing arsenic is less than two to five paise per litre of water, which is far less compared to the budget governments must allocate to put up reverse osmosis plants.
“What is clear from this data is that all forms of water quality situations spread across the country, in arsenic affected areas can be tackled by this technology.
 In places where there is a genuine desire to solve this menace, this solution is being implemented. We can confidently say that the arsenic menace can be wiped out from the country,” says Pradeep. 
Way forward
“Right now, we have only community scale units, but we are still developing the technology that would make it viable for domestic use,” says Ramesh Kumar Soni, an M.Tech student who is now involved in the project. 
The material developed by the IIT-M uses no chemicals and is “by the water, for the water”, according to him. Ramesh is excited about the project which won the Millennium Alliance Award. He is now improving upon the material that can be installed for domestic use.
A native of Rajasthan, Ramesh says that in his state the problem is fluoride in water. He would get to that issue at a later date as his specialisation is understanding contamination of groundwater.

Exploring the new ","It is a hard decision to leave your country and family to go to a place you don't know much about, but if you have the right attitude and determination, it makes you independent and confident. That is when you tell yourself, “this is my chance and I can do it!” I left India with this attitude, not because I didn't like it there but because I wanted to explore the new. I wanted my creativity to find expression, both in engineering and music, which is why I chose to pursue my bachelor’s at Pennsylvania State University. 
A new world 
 Initially, I was nervous but I found that I could live on my own terms. Some might think that these choices are too risky to give to an 18-year-old, but I manage them well. I play music and study, but I do them on my own terms. I work on projects that have nothing to do with academics but everything to do with the world. I am thirsty to learn.
Each student has his/her own unique experience of college life in the U.S. and for me Pennsylvania State University is in every way the college I had hoped for. In the past one year, I have done a project with General Motors and performed at a couple of music festivals too. I have also been accepted into the honours programme at the university and I am hoping to do research in the field of alternative fuels. The U.S. academic system is flexible at the bachelor’s level. Students can choose the classes they want and when they want to take them, which gives them opportunities for extra-curricular activities.
Special moments 
Another new experience for me was taking up an on-campus job in the first year. Until then, I had never worked for money. I wanted to feel responsible for my finances and earn some pocket money for my weekend movies. I worked at my campus dining commons, cleaning tables and serving food. Initially, it was hard but I slowly grew into it. I worked hard and made a little money; when I spent it, I knew I had earned it. It is moments like these that make my experience in the U.S. special. 
While academic experiences always stay with you, it is these diverse and out-of-the-classroom experiences that teach us about the world outside. Pennsylvania State University gives me the opportunity not only to study electrical engineering with music technology, but also shows me who I am and who I can become.

","Indian School of Business & Finance (ISBF), New Delhi, a featured training institute of London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE) in India is launching its graduate diploma programme in data science with academic direction from LSE. 
Dr. James Abdey, assistant professorial lecturer, department of statistics, LSE, was in Mumbai recently to officially launch the course. Excerpts from an interview. 
Who does the course cater to?
Our graduate diploma in data science is designed for graduates wishing to broaden their skill-set enabling, them to become competent and confident data modellers and interpreters, with the aim of assisting management in their data-driven decision-making.
What topics are covered?
Students will pursue four courses — information systems management, machine learning, elements of econometrics, and business analytics, applied modelling and prediction. This combination of courses exposes students to an excellent mix of statistics, math and computing — essential disciplines for aspiring data scientists.
What skills will students pick up during the course?
Our programme blends theory and practice, with a particular emphasis on the applicability of quantitative techniques to real-world problems. Students will develop their modelling and IT skills (through exposure to software including R, Tableau and Stata), as well as their communication skills as the ability to interpret and explain analytical results forms part of the assessment in some of the courses.
What are the career opportunities after the course?
Data scientists are in demand in a wide range of sectors, such as finance, retail and transportation. Indeed, there is a greater push for evidence-based policymaking in the public sector as governments also look to harness the power of data.
What are the criteria for applying?
For access to this graduate diploma, you will need one of the following:
An acceptable bachelor’s degree, either in a quantitative subject or where you have passed at least two courses in satisfactory mathematical subjects.

Confidence boosters
","After learning from a cousin about the importance of internships for a college student, I started looking for internships through online platforms. I read about one of them in a reputed newspaper. So, without wasting much time, I applied for a few internships. Being an English literature student, I chose the field of content writing.
As I live in a tier-two city with hardly any in-office internships, I was not sure what to do, in the beginning. However, after reading about virtual internships, I thought of applying for the same. Initially, I was rejected by some companies, but I figured being a first year-student, the competition was more intense. So, I started to keep a track of my mistakes and read articles about writing a good cover letter.
A great start
My efforts paid off and I received mails stating that I had been selected for two internships — at Hunterest and Storieo. And excited as I was, I took up both of them. 
The selection for Hunterest was through a simple telephonic interview in which I was asked about my educational background and why I was interested in that internship. Storieo required its interns to have a special interest and skills in creative writing, and my resume must have provided that bit of information as I had included all relevant details, and was duly selected.
For Hunterest, I had to write two to five articles regularly on various topics such as lifestyle, tech, food, health, travel, and so on.
 Storieo, on the other hand, is a website which publishes short stories and book reviews. There were no deadlines or regular submissions. I could submit a short-story at my leisure and could extend the internship after every two months if I wished, until I completed 20 stories, which was the allotted target.
After the Hunterest internship got over, I grabbed my third internship at Trekteller. During this, I had to write three blogs every day on assigned topics, after doing research on the Internet.
The organisation works internationally and I was required to cover cities such as Paris and a few Australian cities for good hotels, spas, shopping centers, and restaurants that could help tourists.
So, I have worked as an intern for three organisations now in a span of seven months. I have learnt about the inverted pyramid structure for writing good articles for websites and e-commerce platforms. I have also learnt how to write good blogs while unearthing the storyteller in me. 
These experiences have brought out a confidence in me that constantly pushes me towards the frontiers of growth and self-development.

Polish sojourn
","It has always been my dream to go to a European country because of the varied cultural exchange. I completed my Bachelor of Architecture from Bharath University, Chennai and I wanted to get out of my comfort zone at home and explore the world outside my country.
Most people go to the US for pursuing further education away from India. But I preferred Europe. The primary reason I chose Europe is that all I would need is a single visa to travel to other European countries. There is also a student exchange programme called ‘ERASMUS+’ which allows students to travel to other European countries to experience different cultures, and learning with people with different approaches. As part of this programme, people from various universities across Europe visit Poland every year.
I chose Gdansk University of Technology in Poland for my education, which is the largest technical University in the Pomerania region. It is one of the oldest technical universities in Poland. Its architecture department has been ranked among the topmost in Europe and Poland. It is very well known for its neoclassical architecture, and is the sixth most beautiful university in Europe. Gdansk is a city filled with students and they are the front and centre of the city, and are found in every nook and corner. 
Wholesome
I am currently pursuing my masters in architecture here and it is simply amazing. The students and faculty are always open to fresh ideas, and are very encouraging. The faculty takes architecture to a whole new dimension with their teaching methods which always include a lot of group work. Despite being the only Indian in my department, I feel included, and part of the group. I have made a lot of friends from various parts of Europe who have helped and supported me all along.
While the education is definitely the best, that is not the only thing Poland has to offer. The cost of living here is much lower compared to most other countries. The whole city has special discount prices exclusively for students. Trams, buses and trains — all of these make it a very well connected place and ensure hassle free transit. The food here is varied, easily available and above all, tasty. The Polish make traditional dumplings called ‘pierogi’, which always remind me of ‘kozhukattai’, a delicacy from my community back home in India. The people are hospitable, warm and welcoming as a summer breeze and they always try to make foreigners feel at home.
Another thing about Poland is the language, which is one the most beautiful languages I have come across. With its beautiful and tidy beaches, top class education and affordable living, it is one of the best places to live in.

Is that people-pleaser, you?

It was not that she was asked to take the responsibility. She just volunteered in order to be helpful. It made her feel needed and vaguely important. She also hoped that everybody would be pleased with her. Indeed pleasing people was her chief strategy at home, at work, and in society as a whole. 
Does she remind you of anyone you know? She might. She is one of a large section of humankind who feel a disproportionate anxiety when they either disappoint or anger someone. She is what we might call a people-pleaser. What about a return for Remona? Who do you think goes out of his or her way to please her ? 
This article is not about the ethics of how you treat others but about how you treat yourself. 
Aim to please 
From early childhood, we are told that if mother / father is pleased with your behaviour, that’s good for you. And indeed it might be. But some of us gradually and subconsciously adopt this as a personal outlook towards everyone in our lives which also radiates into a social plan. To check whether we have this mild disease of pleasing others — even if we don’t really want to — we have to examine a few pointers. 
Is it difficult for you to get through the day if you’ve had even a minor argument with someone, especially someone you are fond of? “My blood pressure must be up…”; “ I wish I hadn’t said that”; “Now what will she think of me?” — These are the thoughts that haunt you during daylight hours. Night time is spent lying awake worrying tiredly about these same things and perhaps how you might retrieve the situation even if you know you were within your rights to have said or done something. 
Another kind of person wonders constantly how she might manipulate others into liking her or being pleased with her. Perhaps, even encourage others to see her as a victim. Anything to get attention, sympathy, and some affection. The actions of such persons are fuelled by how everything they say or do will cause others to view them.
An article in Psychology Today by Alex Lickerman described this condition as the Good Guy Contract — a contract you write with yourself. Maintaining this contract takes up a great deal of your time because you suffer when others don’t like you. 
How about tearing up this contract and saving time and stepping out of the great need to influence others to like you? Think how much more effective a leader you would be if you made decisions for the right reasons and not because your chief goal in life is to please everyone. 
Once you hit the road to recovery, you will form more genuine friendships based on mutual regard. So far, you have been telling yourself that you need the goodwill of others to pad up your self-esteem. Freed of the need to be liked, you will become more genuinely sensitive and also avoid dramatic fights based on imagined slights and minor rejections.
Remember, that being unable to say “no” usually leads to a mountain of resentment which can easily explode and crush you and your acquaintances. Think of the damage you can avoid and how much happier you can be. Think of the damage to yourself you can reverse.
Cancel that contract you signed with yourself!

Laws need to be reframed
","Rashika Sharma, M.A. English, Delhi University




The fact that Indian women — particularly from the film and journalism industries — are utilising this international campaign, is ample impetus to highlight sexual harassment at workplace. Though we have laws and government portals such as SHE BOX to register complaints, their inadequacy is revealed when more popular platforms are used to voice these issues. This is because of lack of awareness of government schemes and initiatives. Fortunately, the Minister of Women and Child Development has formed a committee of retired judges to take up the cases. The proceedings should begin soon as the victims have already suffered silently all these years. Second, it empowers more women to come forward knowing that they have a medium now along with other victims and supporters. Third, this revolution has the capacity to instill fear among patriarchs to remain within their limits, barring which their long-established image will be tarnished with a single tweet or an online post. This medium is apt for the urban middle class who have access to the Internet, but what about those who do not have such means? For this, women’s helpline can be made more efficient. Also, sexual harassment committees should be strengthened, and national and state women’s commissions must become more active. In the words of Vinta Nanda, “It is not women versus men, or victim versus accused; it is society versus patriarchy.”
Tarun Kadian, III, B.A(Honours ) Political Science, Shaheed Bhagat Singh, Delhi University, Gurugram




Sexual harassment at the workplace has existed for years and has been accepted as a norm, with the top management silencing victims. But now, in the virtual world with the support of netizens, women have gathered the courage to speak out against the perpetrators. The goal is to create conducive conditions for everyone at work, and this can be achieved through the strengthening and implementation of existing laws such as the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplaces (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressel) Act, 2013 which mandates the constitution of ICCs and ensuring that a fair probe is carried without any further harassment of the victims. We, as a society, should create a supportive environment to empower women to speak up. The stigma attached with the culture of raising voices in this patriarchal world should be shed to empower women.
D.Tejaswi, I, M.A.English, IGNOU, Hyderabad




While #MeToo is gaining momentum, it becomes important to check the authenticity of those being accused. One drawback of the online media is that anyone can post anything anonymously, to avoid coming under the scanner. Several individuals could take advantage of this and defame people they may not like. Nevertheless, it takes a lot of guts for women who are speaking up for themselves and for this, they deserve appreciation. 
Manish Kumar Pujari, I, Ph.D, JNU, New Delhi




#MeToo is a good platform for the oppressed, suppressed, and depressed voices to make themselves heard. However, this movement, much like other social media movements, has its limitations — it is a tool only for those who have Internet access and an account on social media. For supressed voices in remote villages, there is still a long way to go before their voices can be heard through such platforms.
Abhishek Mohan, Alumnus, Master of Communication Design, Royal Melbourne Institute of Design, Australia




It is the basic need of every individual to be able to pursue his/her aspirations in a safe and secure society. Unfortunately, the safety of our institutions is being questioned today due to the high prevalence of such malicious conduct. First, this situation can only be controlled by altering the behaviour of predators. Stringent laws on transparency of institutions and clearly-stated boundaries need to be legally enforced so that authorities in power cannot use their positions to bully or abuse victims. Second, such violations can scar anyone at a professional and emotional level. Hence, victims must be given the support system in the form of counselling services to be able to speak up. Such support systems must be able to provide a mechanism for victims to be able to hold their aggressors responsible without fear of punishment or negative consequences. This will help more victims to speak up.
Harikrishnan K.S, B.Tech, Civil Engineering, College of Engineering Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala




The movement indicates the absence of a competent authority to address such issues. With technology shrinking the world, the voices of the victims can be heard by a lot more people. This can be considered an improvement, as well as a matter of concern, as sometimes the platform is prone to misuse. To provide the justice deserved, the government needs to step up. An ad-hoc authority or tribunal, as in the case of Justice Varma Committee recommendations, which would provide satisfactory and quick redressal mechanism, is an option worth considering. Such an action, if successful in winning people’s confidence, will encourage victims to seek a more convenient path, rather than using informal sources in their quest for justice.
Deepak Kumar Beuria, Graduate, Bhubaneswar 
 


The #MeToo movement should reach the lower section of our society, where sexual abuse and harassment is more common. The movement should also be made a part of educational institutions across India to reveal instances of abuse by so-called teachers, lecturers, professors, and so on. This movement should be led in such a way as to reduce the incidence of rape, abuse and harassment. It should be accessible to everyone — men, women and the transgender community. The process needs strict and transparent laws for it to be effective.
Danish Firdaus, UPSC aspirant, Delhi




Online revolutions can impart great change and speeden law enforcement. #MeToo has empowered so many women to come and speak about the pain they have felt. This will help reduce the percentage of defaulters. While many famous people have been named and shamed as harassers, there are perpetrators have gone scot-free. Though recent laws can help, the legal process is too slow, and gives ample time to perpetrators to silence their victims. Since every law can be used and misused, it is better to each accusation thoroughly. 
H. Haripriyaa, II, B.Com(C.S), Bhaktavatsalam Memorial College for Women, Chennai




Over the past couple of years, social media has transcended from merely connecting people to becoming a tool to addresses issues and injustice meted out by society. This has become more common with the #MeToo movement. Women from different fields have shared stories of their abuses and are seeking justice. Eventually, it has gained momentum as the Ministry of Women and Child Development has come up with a committee to look into these issues. I hope through these means, women can call out their perpetrators as opposed to remaining silent victims. The right way forward is to take this up with the Supreme Court and bring out a rational verdict. Women can no longer be subjugated to obnoxious threats. We need to create a conducive and abuse-free environment for women.

Passion takes wing
","It is possible that Mahathi Narayanaswamy’s first baby cry sounded like a bird call. “My journey as a birder began in my pram days when my mom wheeled me around the campus and showed me the blackbuck and the egrets,” says the Class XI student, opening her laptop to show me her bird-work. 
The “campus” is IIT-Madras where her dad works. When she turned four, she began attending Prof. Susy Verughese’s annual summer birding camp for children. At age seven, she saw a large, colourful parrot on a mango tree outside her window and was hooked to the bird-world. After a brief pause over problem with eyesight, at age nine, she began summer birding, and at 12, went birding in winter. “I was rewarded with the sight of a brown-breasted flycatcher that migrated over Chennai. There has been no looking back since!” she says.
Through high school, she bird-watched in the campus with classmate Tanmay Jain. At home, she would read Salim Ali’s Indian Birds  volumes 2 and 11 — “my primers for bird-watching. These are mom’s; she is a birdwatcher too.”
Local surveys
In the last four years, she has recorded 122 species of birds in the campus, and along with Tanmay, she has surveyed and analysed the vegetation and bird species in the Guindy National Park and the IIT campus. She flips the pages of the neat, hand-written report that they submitted to the National Children’s Science Congress before giving me a gist of what they found: “The forests are similar, being dry-deciduous, except IIT has marshes and scrub as well. We identified 42 different bird species.”
Annual family outings are built around the bird theme. “We trek in the Himalayas every year in May-June, along with a few families here.” Her observations include the rise in house-sparrow numbers in the lower Himalayan villages — three to four species new to the western Himalayan region. “The steep high-altitude (2000-3000 feet) elevation makes treks tough, so sightings here are not well-documented,” she says. 
Mahathi logs her birding experiences at Indianfeatheredfriends.weebly.com and has joined bird portals for interactions with birders world-wide. Her profile is on birdcountofindia.com. She joins birdwalks/programmes organised by the National Conservation Foundation. She has attended Garima Bhatia’s workshops on birding. 
When she heard about the eBird online database, she began uploading her bird sightings. “It has reviewers for every district/state/country.” 
International experience 
Mahathi spotted an announcement about the Cornell Young Birders three-day programme in the eBird newsletter, applied, and was accepted. It was held from July 12-15, 2018 in Ithaca, New York. The event aims to bring together teenagers with a passion for birds and interested in pursing a career in the field. Participants meet people who have successful careers that involve birds — from ornithological researchers to tour leaders, to audio specialists and computer scientists. Preference is given to students entering Class XII and students who have previously applied.
“This was a major opportunity as India has negligible numbers of recognised university programmes related to birding,” she feels. “I met birders in my age-group from around the world, experience the university atmosphere in the U.S., and interact with scientists/researchers in the fields of ornithology and wildlife biology.”
The event featured two days of field trips, presentations by Cornell Lab of Ornithology staff including professors, researchers, and students, eBird and sound recording workshop, and a tour of Cornell Lab including the Macaulay Library and Museum of Vertebrates.
Mahathi plans on building a career around birds by choosing ornithology or ecology. However, “Even if I choose a different career, birding will continue to remain a passion. I may do a project that bridges my career and birds.” Mahathi makes a big pitch for birding when she says, “It is fascinating to see new birds; to be able to identify small differences in looks and behaviour of say, two babblers.” And yes, birding helps conserve the feathered species. 
Data on eBird help to infer how habitat change affects bird species, amateur birding-records help to make decisions related to city planning, public parks and gardens. So she listens to calls as she bicycles to the gate. “Anything that moves catches my attention.”

Beautiful, inside and out
","Today, beauty is emphasised as an important characteristic. attractiveness helps people fit into a demanding society that values and rewards appearance. The global aesthetic medicine market size is now estimated to reach more than $13 billion by 2021. and China have the largest population pool aged between 30 to 65 years, and rising disposable income coupled with the presence of a wide working population is generating demand for aesthetic procedures.
The introduction of technically-advanced systems enabling minimally invasive procedures is identified as the most influential factor. Moreover, rise in disposable income has greatly boosted the demand for cosmetic procedures. Thus, factors such as better awareness regarding the availability of these minimally invasive procedures and their products as well as affordable costs are leading to a spur in demand globally. 
Medical and personal care product industries are keeping up with this growing demand by a public interested in availing the latest techniques and products available in cosmetology and aesthetic medicine. A social phenomenon, dedicating a certain budget to beauty is now accepted as a norm. This translates into profitable economic activities, where physicians and cosmetologists play an important role and have a place of choice though the direct contact and care they offer to patients. Scientific and medical progress means that a wide range of solutions are available to the public, but only a trained practitioner will deliver effective treatment. 
Cosmetology is no more concerned with mere topical skin care. Laser treatments, injectables, facial peels and many more procedures, can be performed by a professional who has received adequate training, making his or her practice more lucrative. 
Opportunities galore
Cosmetology is also a full-time career option for trained technicians. With training in cosmetology, the professional can easily convey information and interest a patient in trying out safe, effective and sometimes life changing cosmetic solutions. 
Choosing to add aesthetic medicine as a speciality has the potential to enhance the physician’s revenues and to become a full-time career due to massive demand. Aesthetic medicine is one of the fastest growing sub-specialty that will continue thrive with technological innovation. Not only does it promise excellent outlook in terms of advancements in diagnostic, curative modalities and treatments, choosing to be trained in this is intellectually and humanely rewarding with beneficial career prospects. 
The real benefit of practising aesthetic medicine is the type of care that practitioners offer their patients. These procedures are elective and are performed on patients who do not suffer from life-threatening illnesses. They are usually healthy, but aesthetic care will have a positive impact on their lives. This, along with the lucrative business it represents, are the benefits any doctor can expect, by expanding his/her own practice or by recruiting an aesthetic physician position in a reputed hospital or a polyclinic.
The advantages of training in cosmetology and aesthetic medicine are manifold. They are fascinating disciplines that call for precision, patience, and allows a long-term relationship with patients. The results offered by the procedures are quickly visible and lead to immense patient satisfaction, making the disciplines rewarding. 
As a fresher, a candidate must have a basic understanding of beauty products, new trends and techniques. Some tips that will increase chances of employment:
A candidate must have completed a certificate or diploma course from a certified institute of cosmetology and aesthetic medicine.
If you are skilled enough to work as a professional under different circumstances, you are eligible for the job. Prior experience is helpful, but not necessary.
Attitude goes a long way too. Those who have confidence have an advantage over others.
There are multiple choices of beauty institutes, but aspirants should check the quality and facilities provided for practical training, certifications offered, training modules, faculty and post training employment opportunities, before enrolling of a course in an institute.
The pay package depends on the specific stream of profession chosen by a candidate. In India, a fresher can start at ₹ 1.5 to 2 lakhs per annum as a starting salary. With a professional degree, one can expect a starting salary of ₹ 50,000 per month.

‘We are not getting disruptive ideas’
","Innovate or perish — the corporate world now swears by this imperative. It is, however, no longer restricted to the corporates. Educational institutions, primarily those providing higher education, are under pressure to foster a culture of innovation.
By creating the Innovation Cell and the Atal Ranking of Institutions on Innovation Achievements, the Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD), Government of India, is sending out a message to these institutions that they have to go beyond the obvious.
In an email interview, Abhay Jere, Chief Innovation Officer, Ministry of HRD, Government of India, explains the dynamics of this new initiative. Prior to taking up this role, Jere was head of Persistent Labs and had a big hand in shaping and running Smart India Hackathons. 
What has been your understanding of the role of innovation or entrepreneurship clubs in colleges?
Although some colleges are trying to promote innovation, their numbers are small. I would say less than 5%. Innovation is still not the primary focus of a majority of the institutions. For educational institutions to reorient their focus, a comprehensive and systematic intervention and hand-holding is required from the highest level. A robust local innovation ecosystem also needs to be cultivated.
Currently, MHRD’s Innovation Cell (MIC) team is working on developing a comprehensive approach to hand-holding institutions to systematically promote innovation and entrepreneurship within their campuses. We have designed many initiatives, courses and also planning some policy interventions to address every component of the innovation ecosystem. It ranges from awareness and sensitisation, ideas generation, proof of concept development, pre-incubation to finally pushing the deserving products into already constructed incubators. 
All India Council for Technical Education recently asked all its affiliate colleges to start innovation clubs. What has been the response? 
To start with, we have decided to establish Institution Innovation Councils (IICs) across 1,000 institutions in India and handhold them using “hub and spoke” model. The initial response to our programme has been extremely good. The registration process is open and we are planning to launch these 1,000 IICs in the second week of November.
Any lessons from the corporate world that you want to bring to MIC?
My experience at Persistent Systems is helping me enormously. Industry always focuses on ‘outcome’ rather than ‘output’. At MIC, our primary focus is on ‘outcome’, hence we are very proactive and work in a time-bound fashion. 
Is funding a major issue students face to scale up ideas? 
Funding is not a problem for a real good idea. My major problem is that we are not getting or generating really disruptive or out-of-the-box ideas. We want ideas that will have global impact. 
How can MIC help fund projects? 
As MHRD works closely with the Department of Science and Technology, Department of Biotechnology and all other major government agencies mandated to fund innovative projects, MIC will guide innovators and act as a bridge between these funding agencies and innovators.
Can the Atal Ranking of Institutions on Innovation Achievements (ARIIA), an initiative to rank educational institutions on innovation output, help identify more budding entrepreneurs? 
Currently, a majority of the educational institutions do not primarily focus on innovation. ARIIA ranking will help us in reorienting their focus towards innovation as these institutions will get judged on innovation-related parameters. One of the key parameter is ‘number and quality of startups incubated’ by the institutions. This will push institutions to support good ideas from students and faculties and help convert their ideas into ventures.
Hackathons are a great way to encourage digital innovations. Were there any new additions based on feedback from the previous editions for the Smart India Hackathon 2019?
Yes. Till last year, we were engaging only with Government ministries and departments for getting ‘Problem Statements’ that we used for challenging students. For the first time, for SIH2019, we are approaching a large number of industries for problem statements. We have received a phenomenal response from major industries. Problems from industries will be far more cutting-edge and challenging and will excite best student brains. This year, we are trying to increase the value of prizes, and we will also have ‘5 days Hardware Development Hackathon’. 
What are the other ways schools and colleges can drive innovation? 
The most simple and cost-effective way for schools and colleges to drive innovation is to conduct ‘Idea competitions’. Institutions should ask students and faculty to suggest ‘wild ideas’ (without violating the fundamental laws of science). Some of the good ideas can be felicitated and a selected few could be highlighted on their internal or external web portal. Also, schools and colleges can ask students and faculty to give ideas for improving their institution’s governance, and plug inefficiencies and revenue leakages.

Dream bigger, work harder
","I grew up in Kolkata and moved to the U.K. in 2015 to pursue higher studies. The University of Sheffield was my first choice because of its highly ranked engineering departments. It was the only U.K. university to offer a significant scholarship for Indian undergraduates which also influenced my decision. I was awarded their India Undergraduate Merit Scholarship for my academic achievements and all round performance at school. This motivated me to work harder, dream bigger, and set higher goals. 
Theory and practice
I am currently pursuing an M.Eng with a year in Industry in electronic and electrical engineering. This degree covers a wide range of topics such as analog electronics, digital electronics, software design, and photonics. The course is delivered through traditional lectures, problem-solving classes where we consolidate the concepts learnt in lectures, and lab sessions. We get hands-on experience using state-of-the-art hardware and software. Lecturers in the department are always available to support challenges that students face, be it technical or pastoral. 
The university has an elaborate range of resources available to assist students’ learning. I have had the chance to participate in activities such as sports, volunteering, and organising events. All students on my programme are required to complete the Sheffield Industrial Project Scheme, where we worked in a team and collaborated with a company to solve a problem for them. My team worked with the Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre to provide solutions for one of their manufacturing issues. It not only enhanced my technical skills but also gave me invaluable experience, working on a real-life industrial project. The degree has been designed to ensure that we work on many projects throughout our course to fully understand how to apply the knowledge that we gain in lectures. 
The international student community is strong and well-integrated, and the university works hard to keep international students happy by promoting various societies and their cultural events. 
I am currently on a year-long placement at Rolls-Royce Control Systems, working in electronic test engineering. I was assisted by the Engineering Placement Team who helped me through every step of an intensive recruitment process. From placement fairs to mock interviews, there was help whenever I required it, from them and from the University Careers Service. 
The city of Sheffield turned out to be welcoming and the people’s warmth made it easier for me to settle in. The city is surrounded by the countryside, and the Peak District is particularly popular among students for picnics and trips. There is a plethora of quaint cafes, restaurants, and food joints around the city too.

Make your time count
","Better time management is an important skill to have for every student, but is essential for class XII students, especially those preparing for competitive exams. Most competitive exams such as JEE and NEET also consider your board exam results, so, it is important to score well in both. It is difficult to juggle between preparation for such major exams, and students often get overwhelmed by the portions that lies before them — they don’t know where or how to start. Here are some tips that could help you manage your time better:
Fundamentals
Your boards help build theoretical knowledge and understanding of formula derivation, whereas competitive exams test your fundamentals through difficult problem-solving. One is closely connected to the other. While approaching a chapter, look at it as one unit. Pick one chapter, ideally the one you dread, and start studying the fundamentals. Understand the derivations and theoretical aspects of the chapter. This will be useful for both exams. Then, study the same chapter from your competitive exam syllabus, where you explore it in greater detail and apply your knowledge, by solving complex problems.
Slot your time
A day might have 24 hours, but with school, classes, and extracurriculars, you have only limited time dedicated to self-study. A question that’s asked too often is, ‘How much time should I study every day?’. There is no definite answer; it varies with every student’s grasping power, however, six hours is recommended. Split these six hours into slots of two hours each, and pace your studies.
Timetable in advance
Making a new timetable every day is counterproductive. You end up wasting a lot of time planning and not doing as much. You need to be able to look at what you will be studying, for at least a month. By splitting your day into slots, you have already made it easy for yourself. You can assign a different slot for each subject or you can assign slots for learning, revising and attempting tests. Ensure your timetable is flexible enough to account for surprise tests or any other unforeseen circumstances. No timetable will work unless you exercise discipline and maintain it. Within three weeks of sticking to it, you will be able to decipher whether the timetable works for you or not.
Revise
Any competitive exam syllabus also requires you to be thorough with your class XI portions. Once there are six months to your competitive exam, start setting out ten slots in a week where you re-learn your class XI portion and test yourself on it. Since it is something you have already learned before, it won’t take up too much of your time.
Take breaks
Stress is your biggest enemy and the only way to deal with it is to take a break. But, how do you know how many breaks are too much? Simple, each time you finish a slot, take a 15-minute break. You can do what you please during that time, but the idea is to turn off the thoughts of studying completely. 
Countdown
If you are worried about falling behind, or you are unsure about how you should map out the months approaching your exams, here is how you can divide your time to account for both boards and competitive exams.
12 months:
 Start learning theory, understand every concept in detail and solve basic, as well as complex problems from boards and competitive exam syllabi. Spend 70% of your time learning and 30% solving problems.
Six months: 
Attempt part tests for three or four chapters every day to see how well you have understood the concepts. Revise your class XI portions. Attempt test series and mock tests for your competitive exam.
Three months: 
You should have completed your portions by this time. You need to devote the following three months solely to revision and tests. Use 20% of your day to revise and 80% to practice.
A month: 
February should be all about your boards, only a few revision slots should be reserved to look at your competitive exam notes.
Try to solve as many questions as possible to ace your competitive exam. Attempt as many mock tests and make sure you thoroughly revise your notes. If you manage your time well, you can ace both exams with ease.

Insights into diplomacy
","The World Health Assembly (WHA) is the annual decision-making body of the World Health Organisation (WHO) which organises a summit annually and is attended by delegations from WHO member states, non-state, and other recognised stakeholders. International Federation of Medical Students Associations (IFMSA) is the representative body of 1.3 million medical students from 137 NMOs in 127 countries around the globe, and engages with WHO in multiple ways, including identifying delegation to WHA every year.
Preparation
I was selected by IFMSA through a rigorous selection process to attend and represent IFMSA and India at the 71st World Health Assembly which was held in Geneva in May. The delegation comprised 55 medical students from around 30 countries representing voices of medical and allied health students 
To prepare the delegation for highly-complex and fast-paced WHA, IFMSA organised a Youth PreWHA Workshop on Global Health Diplomacy and Governance just before the WHA, which aimed at preparing us through strengthening our advocacy skill-sets and improving their knowledge on global health topics central to the 71st WHA. The four-day workshop included keynote speeches, panel discussions, career events, and technical know-hows on preparing policy briefs and presenting it at the WHA.
We prepared policy briefs and presented them at the WHA in four streams: universal health coverage, discrimination in healthcare, antimicrobial resistance, and non-communicable diseases.
As a delegate, I had the unique opportunity to attend the opening ceremony, plenary meetings, Committee A and Committee B meetings as well as technical briefings. Overall, the experience was an eye-opener.

Stay ahead of the game
","While there is no single playbook about what makes a startup succeed, over the years, I have started believing in a few things that I could consider almost universal.
1. The most important thing I tell founders is, always recruit to plug your weaknesses. You may be great at vision but poor at execution. You may be great at technical skills but may have poor business acumen. You may be an introvert, but after a point you and your team needs someone to sell the idea to the world, so you may need a charismatic salesperson in your core team. Taking a honest stock of what your own pros and cons and acting accordingly to build your core founding team goes a long way.
2. Build for yourself or in your circle of competence. When I see entrepreneurs building a product for a customer they don't know well, I get worried. If you haven’t worked in an industry or faced a pain point you are thinking of solving, most of the time it is never a good idea to pursue it. To add to that, some startups tend to build a product first and then go to customers to take feedback. Again, bad idea. Getting feedback before you start building anything can save you tonnes of time and money. So, do not assume you can see a pain point without diving deep into conversations with your potential customers.
3. A good team at an early stage should have implemented restricted stock with vesting even before investors ask for it. For the uninitiated, vesting means the process through which the company can buy back a co-founders equity in case he or she decides to move out of the company earlier than a pre-agreed tenure. The tenure generally is four years, but that really depends on how the founders agree between themselves. The thumb rule is that the longer the vesting period, the better it is. Founder vesting is an insurance policy for all team members involved.
4. Never worry about the press. Startups are over celebrated by the press most of the times. In a startup’s journey, there will be times when everybody keeps talking about your competitors and how they are absolutely crushing it, raising a ton of money, hiring executives from the best B-Schools and so on. 
Always ignore the noise. It is not like your competitors aren’t worried about the same issues as you are. The startups that keep their head down and keep at it are the ones that win, eventually. 
5. Know when to let go. Many a times, founders are so in love with what they have created or trying to create, they fail to have the right perspective on whether they are really building a solution to a problem or building a solution that needs to find a problem to solve. Stepping back, once in a while, and re-examining the startup’s mission is always a good thing. 
6. Ideas are dime a dozen. Execution is all that matters. Ideas are 1%, execution is 99%. A great outcome comes from real hard work not just a random eureka moment.

A panacea for exams ","Much has been said about the ill effects of the exam system on a student’s psyche, yet they seem indispensable to our education system. Since they are here to stay, we must make the most of them, with some help from teachers. 
Here’s what teachers can do to make the students see the pros of exams. 
First, there could be special orientation classes conducted periodically to help students learn the ‘art of examination’. Students could be made to understand the importance of exams and the process of giving one, one of which is being prepared to face the challenges that life may throw at them. 
Second, exams could be made easier to take on by helping students learn time management and the importance of planning ahead. This will save students from stress and anxiety. Teachers must help them understand that just learning is not enough; the way the answers are presented is what will earn them marks. 
So, teachers could conduct mock tests to train students in this aspect, thus giving them confidence before facing the actual exams. 
Individual focus
The next level of preparation narrows down to individual needs of the students. The teacher must have a clear understanding about the specific problems of her students: some may be overconfident, some may prepare well and yet feel anxious, and others who do not care to prepare for the exams at all. 
Teachers could hand-pick students based on their needs or problems for exam-related counselling and remedial classes, if necessary. They could also employ peer-to-peer counselling by getting students who excel to share their learning strategies with others. This will have a lasting impact. 
The examination system should be a means to breed competition not among other students but with oneself. Students should be rewarded when they outperform themselves by providing extra time to indulge in their interests and hobbies. 
And lastly, a teacher must never give up on a student even if she faces failure. It is the duty of a teacher to help a student through a rough patch. 
Resilience is the richest lesson a teacher can impart to one’s students, and this will also have a far-reaching impact in their life. 
The teacher needs to work with the student on his shortcomings with a fresh approach that stems from a careful analysis of his personality and profile.

Going forward: Offline
","The Common Law Admission Test (CLAT) has been the gateway to step into the premier National Law Universities since 2008, and every year, a growing number of students write this entrance test to join these coveted law schools. CLAT, hitherto, was conducted by different National Law Schools on rotation with no permanent board/committee. In the last couple of years, CLAT has been plagued with errors in questions and answers, besides technical glitches in the conduct of the entrance test, thereby shattering the confidence and dreams of thousands of students.
Changes 
 In early October this year, for the first time, a CLAT consortium was formed to regulate the exam. The CLAT consortium has announced the date of the next exam as May 12, 2019. In a major move, the consortium has decided that CLAT 2019 will be an offline exam. This decision was taken following complaints from students across the country in the last few years about technical glitches in the conduct of the online CLAT exam. Though the exam is conducted by different law schools in rotation each year, this year, a permanent CLAT Secretariat has been established in the National Law School of India University (NLSIU) campus in Bengaluru. This is a much-needed system to streamline conduct of the exam. CLAT 2019 will be conducted by an executive committee of the consortium consisting of NLSIU (Bengaluru), NALSAR (Hyderabad), NLU (Bhopal), and CLAT Convenor of the year, which is NLU (Odisha) and the CLAT Convenor of next year along with few other member universities. The exam is expected to shortly launch its permanent website which will carry all pertinent information relating to CLAT 2019. With this arrangement in place, it is hoped that the exam will be devoid of errors and lapses.
With about six months to go for CLAT 2019, law aspirants must start preparation right away.
 Systematic planner
CLAT is a simple aptitude test which tests a students’ competence in subjects such as English, arithmetic, general knowledge, and logical and legal reasoning. Though the content of the exam is simple, it is the time factor and negative marking, which makes the entrance test challenging. The question paper has 200 questions to be tackled in 120 minutes and 0.25 marks deducted for every wrong answer.
English
This section tests the students’ vocabulary including Latin words, grammar skills and comprehension ability. Students who are voracious readers and those who have an eye for grammar usually do well. However, many students, these days, have trouble with this section owing to decline in reading habit.
Arithmetic
This segment tests students’ basic math skills by testing them on topics such as profit and loss, ratios, time, work and distance, simple and compound interest, averages and other general math topics which are learnt in the middle-and-high-school level. Since time is a constraint in this exam, students need to employ strategic thinking and “short-cuts” to arrive at solutions.
General knowledge
This segment aims at finding out students’ awareness of current happenings and general topics. A good memory and systematic preparation of a wide gamut of topics such as world organisations, history, everyday science, books and authors and such other topics are required. Reading newspapers is an indispensable requirement to ace the current affairs questions asked in this section. The availability of several current affairs apps and dedicated general knowledge websites have made students’ preparation quite easy.
Logical reasoning
To assess the lateral thinking of aspirants, this segment has been designed. Word and number analogy, direction sense test, puzzles, relationship tests, syllogism, critical reasoning form the core of this section. Thanks to the oympiad exams initiated by schools right from primary level onwards, most students can crack this section with confidence. However, the key to high score in this section is loads and loads of practice, as students need to hone these problem-solving techniques.
Legal reasoning
The selection test to study in top law schools will be incomplete without testing basic analytical reasoning ability of law aspirants. Since every legal professional needs strong deductive reasoning skills, this section has questions which include a legal premise followed by a situation and four plausible conclusions. Students are expected to choose the most appropriate answer on the lines of the given legal principle while remaining unemotional. This segment also tests students’ awareness of contemporary legal developments and basic legal awareness. Working out the past year papers of CLAT will give you a clear idea of what to expect in this section.
Tips and strategies 
1. Begin your systematic preparation well in advance, preferably six to eight months prior to the examination. Last–minute preparation hardly helps.
2. Take sample/mock CLAT tests to assess yourself. This will help you understand your strengths and weaknesses.
3. There are no quick-fix methods to tackle your poor vocabulary. Reading is the only time-tested method to enlarge your vocabulary, however, reading vocabulary building books does help.
4. Reading newspapers and quality books has in-built advantages such as widening your current affairs knowledge, improving your reading speed and building a robust vocabulary, all of which are required for a successful career in law.
5. Since time is a vital factor, taking mock tests and doing practice tests at regular intervals will improve speed.
6. Since the level of math tested is of basic standard, students should take it as an opportunity to develop basic arithmetic ability, which will be useful later in professional life.
7. Students aspiring to study law must develop a keen interest in the functioning of the Constitution and other laws. Further, a strong interest in political and international developments will kindle their enthusiasm to pursue law.
8. While there are excellent job prospects upon completion of law degree, students should not have myopic view of just placements and salaries, rather cultivate a desire for knowledge in all facets of law and hone excellent communication and reasoning skills to become a top-notch legal professional.
9. The preparation style for an entrance exam vastly differs from that of a Board exami. Constant test-taking and analysing test performances and varying strategies in approaching the exam hold key to success in this exam.
10. Finally, a strong will power, tons of hard work, perseverance and valuable guidance are truly the secrets of success in not just CLAT but any entrance test.

CERN sojourn
"," My college offers an opportunity to four students from multidisciplinary fields to conduct research internship at European Organisation for Nuclear Research (CERN), Geneva, Switzerland. Having a decent CGPA, I was selected for the interview. I was asked what I wanted to do at CERN and what my strengths and weaknesses were. I talked about the research I aimed to do at CERN, mapping my previous project at Jadavpur University, Kolkatta. I explained that entrepreneurship was my strength, and that’s when the interview took a different turn. A series of questions followed — difference between an entrepreneur and an engineer, and a physicist, and so on. I answered confidently and observed that the interviewer was convinced.
Before long, I was selected as a summer intern at CERN, funded by the Government of India. My head supervisor was Dr. Archana Sharma, the first permanent Indian scientist at CERN. 
The organisation has several experiments running together such as CMS, ALICE, LHC-b, and ATLAS. My supervisor would work at CMS, but I was asked to work on the ALICE experiment in the GEM lab under the supervision of two physicists: Chilo Garabatos, the project leader, and Robert Helmut Munzer. 
Challenge
My research interest was on the generation of time-efficient and cost-effective algorithm and its FPGA implementation mapped with the GEM lab. They had collected test data from the upgraded ALICE Time Projection Chamber (ALICE – TPC). However, the magnanimous amount of test data was in an unreadable format and couldn’t be analysed. I was responsible for programming that data into a readable format and analysing it using object-oriented data-analysis software, CERN-ROOT.
The work culture at CERN is amazing. There is no pressure, despite which everyone understands the importance of deadlines. I completed my work ahead of time and submitted a report when I was taken for an underground visit to the place where the actual particle detectors are located. They are located at different points of a pipe named Large Hadron Collider (LHC) which is 127 km in circumference, running 100 meters under the earth’s surface, stretching across France and Switzerland. I visited the part of the LHC named “CMS Point-5”. We were taken 100 meters below the surface of the earth in a lift and given a tour around the detector and the supercomputers. That five-hour visit to the LHC was truly a once-in-a-lifetime experience.

Fuel your thoughts
","If you are a reader of my column, you are familiar with my advocacy of habit building and deliberation of routines that lead to fundamental shifts and growth. This is foundational to the belief, ‘we are what we do’!
Today, I am digging a level deeper beyond the deliberation of doing, to the level of our thoughts and subconscious. You would be familiar with the notion that our outer world is a reflection of our inner world. To me, this idea in continuum with the Do-analogy implies that ‘we become what we think (most of the time)’.
For decades, psychologists have worked to understand the functioning of the human mind. Across Freud, Carl Jung, Maslow and may others, a common conclusion has been that in every way, our mental programming, built on context and life experiences, plays a decisive role in the way we think, feel, act and accomplish through life.
Thought patterns
Programming manifests in our thoughts. The problem is that our mind is not always a safe place. Our thoughts often take a gravitational spiral towards self-doubt, self-denial, paranoia and mistrust. The truth is we give a lot of mind-space to what we hate and what we can’t do, when the anti-self reigns inside the head.
Psychiatrist and mindfulness expert, Dr. Daniel Siegel, who coined ‘anti-self’, advocates pause-breaks for deliberate self-reflection, a ‘time-in’, when we can check-in where we are at emotionally, understand the thoughts and choose how to behave and progress. To demonstrate, here are a few foundational interludes of time-in:
1. Do you believe that you are always moving in the direction of your dominant thoughts? In times of stress, have you ever stopped to assess the thoughts in your head? 
2. In what way have your dominant thoughts attracted people? How about circumstances and situations in you life? Could a different thought have influenced outcome? If you get another chance, what will you replace these thoughts with?
3. Determine the three important habits or thoughts about yourself and others that you could develop to be more prolific and productive. 
In the 2010 sci-fi Hollywood film “Inception”, written and directed by the visionary storyteller Christopher Nolan, the protagonist Cobb is a professional thief who steals information and commits corporate espionage by infiltrating the subconscious. As the plot thickens, he is offered a chance to have his criminal history erased, as payment for the implantation of another person’s idea into a target’s subconscious. This time, Cobb won’t be harvesting an idea, but sowing one. Should he succeed, it will be a new frontier in the art of psychic espionage. 
If I just got carried away with the story there, it is because the premise of sowing a new idea to impact a desired outcome is dramatic. For me though, the real-life promise of inception of new, open thoughts into the mind is equally dynamic and empowering. 
To infiltrate the mind, we have to know what inhabits it, in the first place. Reflection is an answer. Yet, to me, ‘you can choose another thought’ is advancement over reflection. What I am addressing here is mindful, deliberate thoughts by ceasing the flow of anti-self and sowing new possibilities.
Every time you sense a thought-overload, you pause in a time–in —‘What am I thinking?’ ‘What is that thought doing to me?’— akin to screening the worthiness of a thought loop. By questioning it, you will stop the flow and over time, you will learn to incept a new, curious, open and accepting thought. Dreamlike or lifelike!

When work is a chore no more
","There is a song that’s been stuck in my head for a few days now, a childhood favourite: “In every job that must be done, there is an element of fun….” 
Much like a “spoonful of sugar makes the medicine go down”, you have to find the “fun” aspect of a job to make it easier to deal with. The grey-suited governess — Mary Poppins — gets a pair of unenthusiastic children to finish their chores by showing them how “a song can move the job along”.
But — I hear you say — not all jobs can be moved along with a song. There are many that are absolutely no fun, where the only pleasure is that of completion. How does one find that “element of fun” where none exists? Or, to put in a different way, how can one inject fun into a dull chore?
Let’s take college assignments, for instance. Sometimes, the assignment takes on a life of its own and becomes an enjoyable exercise just because of the subject matter, or because you find the topic interesting. But what if it is for a course that you have found dead boring, or one that you have no real engagement with? What can you do that lights a spark and makes the process more bearable? Almost all topics can be looked at through a variety of lenses and interpreted in multiple ways. Look for a way to link the boring subject with something that you are interested in. For instance, if you are a football fan, you can use the sport to speak to a number of concepts in science, marketing, history, and so on. If you enjoy keeping up with fashion, you can do the same — the industry depends on a whole range of processes and partnerships — materials science, adaptability to climate, aesthetics, and yes, even math.
Team work
Of course, this approach may not always be feasible, as some assignments are specific and do not allow you room for such interpretation. Another way of bringing relief to tedious or difficult work is to pool resources with a friend — what in common parlance is called “joint study”. Agree to work together in a way that motivates you — take short “chat breaks” to compare notes, egg each other on, and share ideas as you work, and give feedback on progress. Group assignments are usually structured in a way that you need to work with others, and this can be fun and well as productive, as you are combining ideas and keeping each other on track. Work becomes a shared project, not a burden you alone have to bear.
For some people, playing music helps them focus and release the tensions related to meeting deadlines, or addressing quality and completeness. In fact, music has been used even by surgeons in operating rooms, because it helps steady the nerves and achieve a working rhythm. This may not be true for all of us, of course, and for some, music is actually distracting, so you have to figure out which group you belong to!
Ultimately, the real fun is in getting the work done, in knowing that you have accomplished the task. But when the road seems long and hard, it doesn’t hurt to look for ways to make the journey not just bearable, but also enjoyable.

Inclusive move
","



Radhika Mall, graduate, B.A. (H) Economics, Lady Shri Ram College for Women, Delhi University, New Delhi
This is a move of great significance as there is no holding back for a disabled sportsperson now. Investing in the stadiums emphasises the importance of the differently-abled in this nation. This step will instill in them a zeal for progress and give them hope of prospective freedom. Moreover, it is a potential for reaping exponential talent from society. 
 


Dishant Passi, engineering graduate, Dronacharya College of Engineering, Delhi
There has always been negligence towards the differently-abled, and their aspirations are often compromised in all aspects and fileds. This move will empower them in many ways. The sense of independence that is manifest in every human being will be promoted, along with the physical assistance that these stadiums will provide.
 


Abir, IV, B.Tech (IT), Jaypee University of Information Technology, Himachal Pradesh
This move signifies that the differently-abled are not inferior to other athletes. They are equally worthy of opportunities and infrastructure which they are often denied of. Also, it promotes courage and talent. It shall help the society realise that disability is just a matter of perception and true talent is what matters.
 


Anjali Notandas, I, journalism and communications, O.P. Jindal Global University, Sonipat, Haryana
The setting up of these stadiums will definitely step-up our nation’s differently-abled. It will serve to encourage desire and confidence in them to play without the fear of being rejected or alienated. More importantly, it will encourage them to pursue their aspirations, despite their tribulations, which is the need of the hour.

MBBS curriculum revised after 21 years
","From August 2019, students graduating from medical colleges in the country will be trained not just to be good clinicians but also good communicators. After a gap of 21 years, the Medical Council of India (MCI) on Friday finalised the new undergraduate curriculum that acknowledges the importance of ethics, responsiveness to needs of patients and their families, and communication skills.
The MCI’s Board of Governors approved the document, which revisits the 1997 syllabus in context of emerging diseases and scientific advances. The revised document has been put up on the MCI website.
“The new undergraduate curriculum regulations are more learner-centric, patient-centric, gender-sensitive, outcome-oriented, and environment appropriate. The result is an outcome-driven curriculum, which conforms to global trends,” says the three-volume curriculum document.
Called ‘Competency-based UG Curriculum for the Indian Medical Graduate’, the new syllabus marks a radical shift from old times when rote and classroom learning was the norm in MBBS training.
V.K. Paul, Chairperson of the MCI Board of Governors, told The Hindu on Saturday that a course called Attitude, Ethics and Communication (AETCOM), which will run across all the years of MBBS, is a new addition to the syllabus. “The emphasis now is more on training students in communicating effectively with patients, and counselling people for organ donations or other challenging procedures. For example, they will be assessed on how well they handle patient relations in sensitive situations, offer care, and obtain consent. All these things will count along with competencies and skills,” Dr. Paul said.
“In a first, the new curriculum provides clinical exposure to students in the very first year instead of the second. A month-long foundation course has been introduced to help students from diverse backgrounds transition better. The foundation course seeks to prepare students for the MBBS duration,” Dr. Paul said.
Another new element is the introduction of elective subjects. Now, students can pick subjects of their choice. Dedicated time has been allotted for self-directed learning and co-curricular activities. 
The new curriculum also encourages the use of medical mannequins and models for clinical learning even though the use of human cadavers for anatomy training will continue. 
There will be more emphasis on mental health and public health. 
Stating that students need to be trained in soft skills, especially in communication, K.S. Ravindranath, former Vice-Chancellor of the Rajiv Gandhi University of Health Sciences in Karnataka, said introduction of early clinical exposure and electives, apart from focus on doctor-patient relationship, will be a game-changer.

Be kind to yourself ","Why did I mess up that exam? I am so stupid. I can’t believe that I lost my passport; I really am scatterbrained. When will I be organised enough to live on my own? Most of my friends know what they are doing after graduation. Only I seem to be dilly-dallying with options. Why can’t I get my act together?
Often, we are our own harshest critics. We hold ourselves to higher standards than our peers and berate ourselves when things go wrong. But, engaging in self-blame does little to repair our situations and only aggravates stress, which, in turn, makes us prone to committing more blunders. 
In fact, research suggests that we may be better off if we are kinder and more compassionate to ourselves.
In an article in The New York Times, writer Kristin Wong quotes psychologist Kristin Neff, who says, “Self-compassion is treating yourself with the same kindness, care and concern you show a loved one.” According to Dr. Neff, self-compassion not only makes us more accepting of our drawbacks but prevents us from amplifying our flaws as well. Learning to view ourselves from a more human lens can actually make us more resilient, contrary to what popular belief might have you think. 
Compassion matters
Many people feel that if they are soft towards themselves, they are being self-indulgent. Further, they worry that kindness towards themselves may lower their standards and make them lethargic. 
But research by Professor Neff and her colleagues, published in Self & Identity, suggest that self-compassion is positively correlated with “mastery goals.” 
In an article in the Oxford Book of Compassionate Science, Kristin Neff and Christopher Garmer lay down three facets of compassion. The first, self-kindness, involves being “supportive and sympathetic toward ourselves” especially in the face of our own drawbacks or failings.
 Instead of criticising our shortcomings, we should exhibit more empathy towards ourselves. Our internal self-talk should be comforting rather than confrontational. 
The second aspect recognises our “common humanity” and provides a humane lens for seeing our foibles and frailties. Further, we accept that strife and struggle is part of the human condition and know that we are never alone in our grief, contrary to what the worrywart in us tells us. The third, mindfulness, allows us to remain in the present moment and view our suffering for what it is. A mindful attitude helps us dissociate ourselves from our thoughts, especially the counterproductive ones, which only serve to increase our pain. 
So, the next time you lose your keys or miss the deadline for an assignment, don’t let your self-critic take over. If your best friend had committed these mistakes, what would you have advised him or her? Exercise the same compassion on yourself. Being kind towards yourself does not make you selfish. Tell yourself that everyone errs at some point or the other, and that’s an essential feature of being human. Also, learn to watch your thoughts without reacting to them in the first instant. You don’t have to believe every thought that arises in your mind. If the relentless critic in you is raising its voice, you can choose to quieten it with softer, soothing thoughts. 
And, if you are feeling low, don’t despair that everyone else has it all together. Suffering and pain is universal. Even if you are feeling singled out for having one of the worst lots in life, know that there are many others who are crying with you. Just as you would reach out to help them heal, do yourself the same favour. You deserve nothing less.

Re-think your approach
","With less than two weeks to go for the Common Admission Test (CAT) 2018, the nervousness and fear would have increased manifold.
Should I do only mock CATs now? Should I leave out some of the topics that I am weak in? My scores in two sections are good, but I haven’t been scoring well in one section. My scores are erratic, what do I do? How do I prepare for other exams while CAT prep is still on? There are too many concerns students are saddled with. But, the answer to almost all these questions is the same — Concentrate on what can be done rather than on what cannot be!
Acing the CAT requires two parallel distinctive approaches: Ensuring the full utilisation of the three hours in the exam, and ensuring the maximum returns for the hours invested prior to the exam (read ‘preparation’). 
Strategise 
However good one may be in solving problems of quantitative ability (QA) or data interpretation and logical reasoning (DILR), or good in vocabulary and grammar, the exam requires a special approach. It is much like adapting oneself to various formats of cricket (Test, ODI, T20).
Basically, the strategy is to ensure the following:
Read all questions in a section/set
Identify and solve the easy and medium-level difficulty questions
Identify and avoid difficult or lengthy questions
Have a cut-off time (stop loss) for every question/every set
Maximise attempts
Be systematic and clinical in your approach
The approach 
Ideally, by now, you should have come up with a viable strategy that works for you. The mocks that you have taken and the analysis that you have done should be enough to have zeroed-in on the best approach to the CAT exam. However, here is a quick summary of how a strategy for the exam can look like. 
Possible break-up of time limits:
QA – Do it in two rounds (35 min and 25 min) or six questions in 10 min
DI – 30 min (7.5 min for each set)
LR – 30 min (7.5 min for each set) OR
DILR - Give about nine to 10 minutes per passage and try to do five passages. 
Every set should be read for at least one to two minutes before deciding on doing the same or skipping it. 
Reading comprehension – 40–45 min (8-9 min for each passage)
Verbal ability – 20–15 min (depending on RC)
In every section, sticking to the time limits is sacrosanct. Within each set of say, DI/LR or RC, doing all questions is NOT the objective. Reading and trying to attempt them is.
The final leg
This is the time to forget all the books and concentrate only on Mock CATs and original CAT papers. 
If required, take up some sectional tests. However, there is really no point going back to the basics often or solving tons of questions from each chapter/area. 
Now is the time when writing the Mocks to finalise one’s strategy becomes imperative. At the same time, writing only mocks and doing nothing to improve one’s capability of solving more questions/different types of questions would be counter-productive. 
Take one mock in three to six days (as per your convenience) and then utilise the days between the Mocks for improving the marks in each of the areas. 
In quantitative ability, the important topics to cover are arithmetic, QE/polynomials/inequalities/logs, numbers, geometry/CG/mensuration.
Divide data interpretation into the seven types of questions: tables and its variants, bar chart, line graphs, pie charts, tournament and games / sports-based, max/minima and venn diagram, and miscellaneous like spider, triangle, scatter diagram, and so on. For each of the three days in between mocks, solve about 10 sets in each such type of questions.
Divided logical reasoning into the following: arrangements (linear and circular), selection, networks and routes, grouping, order sequencing and ranking, cubes and venn diagrams, and mathematical and logical puzzles. Everyday solve about six sets of the same type. Which means, in a day you will only do arrangements and take up five to six sets at one go. 
In Reading Comprehension, it is not enough to keep solving passages or taking tests. The scores will only improve if you figure out how to improve the accuracy levels while maintaining the attempts. 
The areas to work on in verbal ability are: Critical reasoning, para completion/summary/others, para jumbles, and words. For each of these areas, one should solve 10 questions each day from the mocks or sectional tests that one has already taken.
Two weeks of preparation can make a huge difference to your score. You can add a minimum of 60 marks than you are currently getting. That could mean jumping about 20 to 30 percentile in the final analysis. But what is more important is to work without the fear of failure.

Smogged celebrations ","



Deepavali has gone from being the festival of lights to a celebration of irony and anarchy. A quick post-mortem of the streets revealed the burnt remains of firecrackers littering every nook and cranny, and the violation of the Supreme Court’s ban too. It amuses the mind, if not the lungs, to see the perpetrators wear smoke masks the following morning, as they returned to their lives with irritated coughs and itchy eyes.




 In my hometown Gwalior, I have observed a trend over the past five to six years where the use of firecrackers seem to be on the decline. However, the situation this year was particularly bad, with an unexpected increase in the number of crackers and the consequent pollution. Clearly, the Suprene Court order has not contributed much to reduction in the usage of firecrackers, largely because of a hasty and reactionary decision in the face of an immediate pollution crisis, instead of taking and implementing the decision in a planned manner.




While smog blanketed New Delhi last winter, the SC passed orders to regulate the situation this Deepavali, which many transgressed. Though, unfortunately, we had to spend less time with crackers, it is crucial that we compromise. Recent reports show that despite the SC order, smog has been at large in the Capital, while in Tamil Nadu, air pollution decreased as compared to last year, which shows a sure sign of awareness.
 


 The Supreme Court had restricted the time for bursting the crackers, but only a few took the regulation seriously. The air quality is again hazardous, as it has crossed the limit of the air quality index. The situation is even worse for senior citizens. These are just the visible short-term effects; if things continue at this pace, then things could worsen. The Supreme Court, along with the government, should formulate stringent laws.

The word ‘bimonthly’ is rather ambiguous; it has two very different meanings. A magazine that is published twice a month — i.e. every two weeks — can be called a ‘bimonthly’. The term, however, can also be used to refer to a journal or magazine that is published once in two months. Americans, in general, prefer ‘semi-monthly’, and they frequently use the word to mean ‘twice a month’.
We decided that the new publication was going to be a semi-monthly/bimonthly. 
What is the meaning and origin of ‘happy as a sandboy’? (Vinod Ghai, Amritsar)
This rather old-fashioned expression is mostly limited to British English; the idiom was quite popular till the 19th century. The original expression was ‘jolly as a sandboy’. When you say that someone is ‘happy as a sandboy’, what you are suggesting is that the individual is extremely happy about something. The idiom has more or less the same meaning as ‘happy as a clam at high tide’. In the old days, the word ‘boy’ was frequently used to refer to a man who did menial work; a male worker of low status. This probably explains why the men who look after cattle and work on ranches are called ‘cowboys’, and why men who work in hotels and carry people’s suitcases are called ‘bellboys’. Several centuries ago, sand was used as a form of floor covering in theatres, bars, houses, etc.; whenever someone spilt something or spit on the floor, the sand absorbed it. Sandboys were hired to spread the sand on the floor and also remove it at regular intervals. Though these individuals were seldom paid in cash, they always remained in excellent spirits — the free drinks that they received ensured they always remained happy.
Ramana was happy as a sandboy when the company promoted him.
He’s happy as a sandboy when his grandchildren play with him. 
What is the meaning of ‘moonstruck’? (G. Sailaja, Madurai)
Many people believe that the moon somehow influences the way human beings behave. There are many stories about how on a full moon night, some people transform into werewolves. When you say that someone is ‘moonstruck’, you are suggesting that the individual is acting in an odd manner — the person is in love and is therefore not himself; he is acting in a crazy or foolish manner.
Don’t pay any attention to Priya. She’s moonstruck.
When the actor stepped out of the club, moonstruck teenagers mobbed him.
How is the word ‘mollycoddle’ pronounced? (Nalini, Erode)
The first word rhymes with ‘jolly’, ‘volley’, and ‘poly’. The ‘cod’ in ‘coddle’ rhymes with ‘god’, ‘pod’, and ‘mod’, and the second syllable sounds like the ‘dle’ in ‘middle’ and ‘fiddle’. The word, which is mostly used to show disapproval, is pronounced ‘MO-li cod-el’ with the main stress on the first syllable of ‘molly’. When you mollycoddle your children, you are being overly protective. The word also suggests that you indulge them too much; in other words, you make sure that all their wants and demands are met. 
Like any grandmother, she took great delight in mollycoddling her grandchild. 
I don’t understand why the government is mollycoddling the power industry.

Blending biotech and writing
","Hoping to land a job, I began looking for an internship that would help me refine my profile as a bioengineer. Days of sifting through numerous job posts online led me to a post by Medgenera Tech, which was inviting applicants to write reports on the latest events in biotechnology and pharmaceuticals. This internship was a merger of both my passions — science and writing. Applicants were required to possess a basic knowledge of science and an ability to write.
A few days after I submitted my application, I was shortlisted and received a call for a telephonic interview. After an interview with CEO Pankaj Mishra, we discussed the work hours and I was hired as a biotech and pharma journalist intern.
Science writing
I was assigned a news item every day and was asked to write an article based on it by the end of the day. The news items included recent advances in the pharmaceutical industry, details of drugs approved or disapproved by the FDA, drugs clearing clinical trials, and so on. Writing these articles required me to research into the history of the respective organisations, different versions of a drug, and its current status of development including its marketing and market reception. Some articles required me to explain the mechanism of drug action and implications of introducing a drug into the market in layman’s terms. My mentor would edit these articles and publish them on the company’s website. We had regular conversations wherein she would share feedback and help me improve my writing style and content quality.
The internship provided me an opportunity to keep abreast with the latest happenings in my field of interest as well as hone my writing skills. I learnt to communicate with a diverse audience, keeping the gist of the subject intact. A lot of reading and researching being involved in the job, I enhanced my conceptual knowledge. Regular discussions with my mentor regarding my progress accelerated suggestions and constructive criticism.
The stint improved my research writing skill which has emerged as a crucial aspect for those working in the science field. The stipend I received was the icing on the cake. In view of my work, I was offered a full-time job in the organisation; I couldn’t accept it as I wanted to continue my higher education. Over the years, I have interned at various laboratories and research institutes, but this internship will always be one of my most rewarding experiences.

Q1 Auguste Rodin was a French sculptor and artist who was born on this day in 1840. He was a master of technique in sculpting, choosing somewhat unconsciously, to rebel against contemporary norms. He admired Dante, the Poet, and depicted him and his work in many of his sculptures. Rodin’s most famous statue, ‘Le Penseur’, known to us all by a different name, is also supposedly modelled on Dante. Rodin said about the statue, “What makes my _____ ____ is that he _____ not only with his brain, with his knitted brow, his distended nostrils and compressed lips, but with every muscle of his arms, back, and legs, with his clenched fist and gripping toes.” What is the name of this world-famous statue?




Q2 Sticky Rice mortar was invented using organic materials in inorganic mortar. Sticky rice soup was mixed with slaked lime to create a mixture that had high adhesive strength and waterproofing capacity and prevented weeds from growing through, and rivals modern cement. This application was used in the construction (around 500 CE) and renovation (around 1400-1600 AD) of a very famous monument. Which monument?




Q3 This footwear brand, using durable pigskin, was originally conceived for the U.S. Military, and later made footwear with ‘casual’ pigskin for the public. It was a hit in the 1960s and 1970s as a leisure staple. One possibly apocryphal story of the origin of this company’s name goes as follows: when a sales manager of the company was at a customer’s house, he wondered aloud as to why fried corn dough balls were called by a certain name. The customer responded that they were called so as they were fed to barking dogs to get them to keep quiet. The manager felt it would be a perfect name for the product he was selling, as hurting feet were as annoying like barking dogs. Which brand was thus born?




Q4 “Road to Sangam” is a 2010 Bollywood film which follows Hasmat, a mechanic, who is entrusted by the UP Government to repair a truck’s V8 Engine. He realises through a series of events, that the truck he is repairing was used for a purpose of national significance roughly 60 years prior, and had made its journey to the Triveni Sangam. For what purpose was the truck used?




Q5 A staple of Indian physics and chemistry textbooks, this scientist won the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1906 and is well-known for his discovery of an electron being a particle. His son won the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1937, for showing that the electron was a wave, and could be diffracted. Although these proofs were initially considered contradictory, it is now well accepted that electrons have a particle-wave duality. Name the father-son duo.

All the world’s a school
","Leaving home at 8 am with a half-eaten or skipped breakfast; competing for the top rank; copying notes mindlessly; rote learning, with little time for free play, sport, art or music. Many parents are opting out of the formal-school education system. Here’s what they do instead. 
“The best lessons are those we learn from people,” says Durgesh Nandhini, 32, mother of two daughters, Tamaraa and Thanvi Shankar, 1 and 5. The roads are the classrooms for Durgesh’s daughters.
Travel schooling simply means education through extensive travel. The traffic policeman, the lady who sweeps the streets, billboards by the roads, the beach… the full-time mom, who is a zero-waste practitioner and minimalist, says that everyday people and places have taught her girls much more than a regular classroom could. Her home is devoid of books, toys, and TV. She doesn’t sit with them asking them to study. No numbers, no alphabet. 




“Children learn by wondering,” she says. Durgesh remembers how her five-year-old asked her why most billboards featuring air conditioners were in blue. “She recognised a pattern in which blue is used by advertisers to create a cooling effect,” says Durgesh and adds that since Thanvi couldn’t read what the hoardings said, her mind was open to taking in other details.
From villages and sustainable spaces, to alternative schools and forests within India, Durgesh and her girls have experienced a range of environments. “This has made them adaptable,” she says. “They enjoy a village as much as they would a posh hotel.” She adds that they are able to treat all kinds of people equally. On the downside, there are bugs, literally. “Thanvi is quite irritated by mosquito bites. So I ensure that I carry a repellent,” says Durgesh. Her one-year-old, however, has grown used to them. “She’s been travelling since she was three-months-old. So she doesn’t complain.”
Five-year-old SP Sangamithra makes friends with people wherever she goes. She’s is chatty and full of questions, making her a people-magnet. “If she were in school, she would’ve only been friends with kids her age. But now, she has friends of all ages, including adults we meet at the vegetable shop,” says Sangamithra’s mother Senbaga Poonguzhali, 31, who home-schools her child, in Coimbatore.
Poonguzhali has formulated an informal syllabus for her daughter’s age group based on her research. “I write out numbers and letters for her and keep the notebook at home. She picks it up whenever she feels like writing,” says Poonguzhali. Sangamithra spends a major part of her day playing — a luxury for school-going kids. “She’s up by 7 am and plays, while my husband and I go about our work. Sometimes, she walks up to me saying she wants to write Tamil today or feels like studying numbers,” says Poonguzhali. “It’s entirely up to her. We don’t have a rigid pattern.”




Sangamithra spends almost four hours in the evening playing in the park at her apartment in Coimbatore. “There are a lot of kids there and she plays, cycles, and runs around.” Poonguzhali says that there are times when her daughter reminds her of a word she promised to teach her. “We go by her pace and interests. She loves to draw, and so she keeps at it through the day,” she adds. While she agrees that she has a slight fear over the mammoth responsibility that rests on her shoulders, Poonguzhali says that she’s growing confident seeing her daughter’s development — more importantly, seeing how happy she is. 
Kokilashree Vickneshwaran’s boys sow seeds, remove weeds, and water plants at their farm in Attappadi in Kerala. And oh, they also study there. Shivesh and Vishwesh, 10 and 7, spend most part of their day playing at their farm, among fruit trees, vegetable plants, and spices. “They do have books to study,” says 37-year-old Kokila, but she says nature is a dynamic place for children to grow and her boys have a natural affinity to the wild.
“We were in Chennai for Deepavali and they are able to talk about the difference in air quality in both the places,” she says. “They understand the essence of the goings-on at the farm by themselves. For instance, we recently planted 60 to 70 endangered species of trees and they got a complete picture of why this was necessary.” Kokila says that she and her husband believe in free play and free learning. “We wanted our children to have a stress-free early childhood,” she adds. “If they want to go to school once they’re older, we will be happy to enrol them in one.”




This transition, agrees Kokila, could be difficult for her children. “But the way they are schooled has made them flexible; they will be able to manage,” she feels. It’s not all wonder and excitement though. She also speaks of the challenges. “It is challenging to constantly be available to help them with their studies and interests,” she says. “Finding the right mentors is difficult too, so is balancing my work with the children’s. But these challenges help us grow stronger as individuals and as a family.”
Shivesh loves birds and animals. “He’s taken a liking to wildlife photography and walks around the farm with a camera, Vishwesh following him around,” says Kokila. The younger one, she adds, follows him around with a smaller camera.
We asked Dr Shraddha Kapoor, Associate Professor, Human Development and Childhood Studies, Lady Irwin College, Delhi, our deepest fears and doubts...
Are alternative methods of schooling, a social experiment?
Yes. There is a value to a normative child. It’s unfair to give a child choices that are far from the norm, without knowing what the end will be. Some children thrive in the environment of a school. School is not just studies and exams; school is friends; it is not having everything you wish for; school is not opening your lunch-box in the middle of a Science class. School is not so powerful that it will take away the values that you believe in. Also, it is open around 220 days or so a year, and parents have enough time to practise their beliefs. Tread a middle path — pick a school that’s closest to your philosophy.
What are the challenges involved in such methods? 
Parenting should prepare children to handle life without the parents. They should create opportunities for children to develop emotionally, socially, and physically. By choosing such [alternative] methods of parenting, you are narrowing down opportunities for children to develop.
When do warning bells go off? 
When the child is not developing and enjoying it. When they are not curious and active, something is not right.




Homeschooling parents, if you wish to enrol your children for board exams, here’s what you can do.
National Institute of Open Schooling: Also an examining and certifying authority, it has no upper age limit for admission. A candidate has to choose five subjects and has five years to complete them from the date of registration.
Homeschoolers can also give the Cambridge O Levels, AS and A-level exams as private candidates registered with a school or through the British Council in some metros.
The Tamil Nadu State Board lets private candidates appear directly for the SSLC exam, if they have passed Class VIII with English. Private candidates can appear directly for the Class XII exam, after passing SSLC or its equivalent. (Source: http://homeschoolers.in)

Q1. In April 1932, a prominent Indian businessman, who was also an aviation enthusiast, won a contract to carry mail for Imperial Airways, and the aviation department of his empire was formed with two de Havilland Puss Moths. The first flight was from Karachi to Bombay, piloted by his friend Nevill Vintcent, on October 15, 1932, and later expanded to commercial flights.
After World War II, regular commercial service resumed under a new name, and later, 49% of the company was bought by the Government. After a bleak period financially, efforts were made to privatise it again, with the last such attempt in 2017. Which airline is this?




Q2. It is a snack consisting of two small round layers of cake and a marshmallow filling, with a chocolate covering. Exports grew in the late 2000s, particularly to North Korea, so much so, that in lieu of cash bonuses (deemed capitalistic), workers at the Kaesong Industrial complex (pictured) were given these. When the complex was shut down and reopened, this snack was replaced by noodles, chocolates, coffee and sausages, and the country’s own brand of these snacks.
This created a huge black-market demand for the snacks of the original brand, and in 2014, South Korean activists released 10,000 balloons with these snacks in North Korea. What is this ubiquitous snack?

Commit to yourself
","I am 22 years old and have completed B.E. in electrical and electronics engineering. I am good at aptitude and reasoning. So I decided to prepare for bank exams. But this is not the actual reason for my decision. My passion is cricket and I have represented my college. After that, I did not get a chance to showcase my talent. I have never represented my district or state. I am feeling lost. I belong to a middle-class family, and cannot afford to take the risk of pursuing my passion without any backup, since we have only one earning member. I can get a job in my domain which will give me income to invest in my passion. But, I fear that once I get into the job, I will never be able to pursue my passion. Please help. — Anand R.
Dear Anand,
 Your clarity is so profound. I understand your dilemma. Cricket, in our country, is not a sport but a religion. It is almost impossible to make it to the big league without having exceptional skills and having tasted some success across district and state levels. Securing a job in your own domain and saving up to pursue your passion, as a serious, steady hobby seems to be the best plan going forward. You only need to make sure that playing cricket will become a non-negotiable commitment that you promise yourself as a self-care ritual and will find the ‘me time’ to pursue it irrespective of a busy work life. 
I am 20 years old and currently in B.A. second year. I am confused between a career as a civil servant and an MBA. I feel that if I pursue MBA and get a decent paying job, I can settle down soon and also have a backup while attempting the civil services exam later. But I am least interested in preparing for CAT because of the subjects involved. I could not score well in my class XII boards either, due to which my selection into the IIMs is difficult. I am in a dilemma about whether I should opt for coaching for the civil service exam or CAT as I just have a year left. Please help me. — Anushka Rao
Dear Anushka,
You seem to be sitting on the fence with two difficult choices — coaching for the civil services versus CAT preparation. It is interesting that you say you aren’t really interested in the CAT but keen as it will ensure you getting a job sooner than making it to the civil services and once you have a job, you can prepare for the civil services. I am not sure if that is the right criteria for selection. Please understand that both are tough exams and rightfully have a gruelling preparation procedure.
What do you see yourself doing in life at 25? What do you want to be and what do you enjoy the most? Please make your choice based on that and not merely on what is easy and doable and what isn’t. Every job, career, and work schedule, however interesting, has some percentage of boring tasks and that doesn’t matter once you enjoy most of what you choose in life, as it brings immense happiness and joy to you.
I am a B.Tech student currently in my seventh semester. I am interested in joining IAF as a pilot.

Dear Vaidehi,
It is indeed an honour to join the IAF as a pilot. Please apply for your class XII math exam privately and secure a good score to ensure that the process is smooth. 
I was so passionate about getting into St. Stephen’s that I worked 10 times harder than I ever had in my school life but, unfortunately I only managed to get about 90% which broke me so much that I didn’t even fill the admission form. I didn’t take admission in any other DU college and settled for Central University of Karnataka which doesn’t have a great faculty or any societies. I am helpless; I don’t know if I should waste one year and apply for other universities next year or stay here and waste the three most important years of my life. I am desperately looking for some advice. — Meha Gupta
Dear Meha,
I am so sorry that you had to go through this. What do you want to do? What course and what subjects do you wish to study? 90% is a good score, but yes, perhaps not sufficient to warrant admissions to St. Stephen’s or DU. So what? There are a lot of other good colleges across the country that would love to have you with that score. Why would you want to waste this score and your talent? I would urge you to meet a good career counsellor who can profile your choices and help you select and shortlist a course of your choice at the earliest. Good things await you; please move quickly.

Trading options for everyone
","In one of the earlier columns, we have seen how index funds can be used to get exposure to the stock market in a low cost way. We also learnt that by using direct mutual fund schemes, we can bring down the cost of the funds even further. In today’s column, we will revisit the concept of index funds and direct schemes of mutual funds. After that, we will also learn about a new financial product called the ETF or the exchange traded fund.
Simple alternates 
Do you recall what an index mutual fund is? A mutual fund is a collective investment scheme which enables small investors to pool their assets and build a portfolio. Say you have ₹10,000. You want to start building a diversified portfolio. You check out the market and you find that you can buy around 15 or so blue chip stocks after which you run out of money. You were looking to build a portfolio of around 25 stocks. How do you solve this? Enter the mutual fund. By collecting ₹10,000 from 1,000 people like you, the mutual fund can build a large, well diversified portfolio, out of which you get a share (1/1,000). This is a clever idea. 
Mutual funds have fund managers who actively select stocks for their portfolio with the aim of delivering better returns than the bench mark indices. Often, they fail in this endeavour as “beating” the market consistently is not easy. So was born the index fund, which simply “tracks” the performance of a stock index like Nifty or Sensex. In this case, the fund manger does not have to do anything clever and he also does not need an army of highly paid analysts. Therefore, the costs associated with manufacturing and distributing the index funds is lower. And all this savings come to you — the investor. You can do even better by cutting out the middle men and directly buying the index fund from mutual fund companies via the “direct plan”. The cost savings may look marginal — a percentage or so here and there, but remember, these are costs that you save every year. Over a period of several years, such cost-efficient investment products deliver great returns to investors.
ETF is another interesting investment product. This product is listed on stock exchanges like the NSE and you can buy and sell them the way you would buy and sell a stock. That is pretty neat, isn’t it? You can get the diversified exposure of a basket of stocks just by executing a single transaction without the need of an advisor. Cheap electronic trading platforms like Zerodha can be used to buy and sell ETFs. The financial outcome of an ETF is not very different from that of an index fund. In fact, most ETFs are manufactured by asset management companies. Yet, there are interesting differences between the ETF and index funds. In our next column, we will see what these differences are. Meanwhile, if you are really curious, you can do your own research and email me the top ETFs in the Indian market.

Going home to the stars: Finding meaning in travel
","The quest for meaning and purpose is one of the predominant traits of the millennial generation. This is true, not only in the way they think of their careers or how they interact with nature, but also in the way they experience leisure. Inevitably, the hospitality industry is seeing some deep transformations, that were once isolated niches, make their way into mainstream. Consumer expectations are changing and a growing number of travellers are in search of experiences that will make them grow as citizens of the world, or enrich them with uniquely satisfying adventures. Hoteliers are becoming purveyors of personal growth and realisation, rather than simple products to be consumed. However this poses certain challenges in terms of management and new priorities are being set, such as eco-friendliness, sustainability or safety in often quite remote locations.
The Ecole Hôtelière de Lausanne (EHL) gained access to one of the most remote and inhospitable scientific outposts in the world: the European Southern Observatory’s VLT (Very Large Telescope) site in the Atacama desert, and its legendary Residencia, to explore the challenges of extreme hospitality management, and to hear from the scientists on site. 
In this documentary, EHL professors Etemad (marketing/management) and Terrier share (psychology), insights into some essential industry drivers and how hoteliers can cope with these changes.

We are the world
","We are the world 
We are the children
We are the ones who make a brighter day, so let’s start giving...
It’s true we’ll make a better day, just you and me
The above is an extract from the chorus of the song “We are the World” written by Michael Jackson and Lionel Richie and recorded by United Support of Artists (U.S.A.) for Africa in 1985. Sung by a star-studded line-up of over 30 artistes including Stevie Wonders, Michael Jackson, Lionel Richie, Kenny Rogers, Diana Ross and Tina Turner, the song was remade as “We are the World 25 for Haiti” by an all-star cast of singers following an earthquake in Haiti in 2010. 
The song made music lovers across the globe feel that they are global citizens and have a role to play in making the world a better place to live in. The impact of the song on me was so great that it inspired me to work in the 1994-genocide-hit Rwanda in Eastern Africa for five years, and get to know the people of a different continent and appreciate different cultures. 
World Citizens Day is observed on November 19 every year.It is a wonderful opportunity to experience the feeling that we are part of a big global community. The occasion is a call for educators to raise these questions: Do we have a good inclusive education system in the country? Does our education system promote global citizens education? Do educators in India allow the student community to truly feel and joyfully sing “We are the World”? 
Importance
Today, quite unfortunately, people are becoming jingoistic and nationalistic. The feeling ‘My country, my language, my people, my culture, my religion’ makes people myopic and selfish, creates chaos in society and divides the country. The level of intolerance is so high that many are not able to digest differences and accept others as they are.
A good global citizen believes all people are equal, has concern for others, shows interest in the welfare of people, appreciates differences, demonstrates empathy and responds positively to various global challenges. Educators have the responsibility of producing global citizens and promoting global citizen education.
The broad objectives of global citizen education are: to make every teacher and student feel that they are part of the global society and connected to people in different parts of the globe, to enable them to become aware of global issues, and to respond positively to the issues and contribute to a more peaceful and inclusive society.
Role of educators
Educational institutions should sensitise teachers and students about the need to know about people of different countries, races, religions, and so on. This helps them appreciate otherness. Teachers should discuss global issues in the classroom and help students become aware of what is happening around the world. 
Labelling students based on their level of intelligence, background and performance is against the principle of inclusiveness. When teachers fail to understand the learning styles of students who do not perform well, they tend to label them as “slow learners”. Making every student feel comfortable and equal is crucial to promoting tolerance, acceptance and inclusiveness. 
In the era of commercialisation of education and unhealthy competition that kills inclusiveness, whether educational institutions can teach values is a debatable question. At a time when there is much stress on conforming to the status quo, whether the concept of development-oriented education is possible is another question. As optimists, educators should be able to see light at the end of the tunnel and prepare students to meet the demands of society. 
The moment we feel that we are global citizens, our world view will change. All our petty politics and divisions will vanish and we will value inclusiveness. We will recognise and celebrate otherness. We will joyfully sing, “We are the world. We are the children.” It is a dream. Will the dream come true?

Cut yourself some slack
","We love to make plans. Plans to accomplish big and little things within time frames long and short. Goals set for life, to be reached by the time one is this age or that. Even those of us who may not be obsessed by milestones and targets, may have a hazy sense of what we want for ourselves, and vaguely wonder how we might get it.
A student recently told me he was concerned that he would not be able to reach all the targets he had set for himself within the time frame he had planned. He said he had had it all worked out, that he would get to point A by a certain age, complete goal one, move towards goal two within a specific time, and so on. And now, it seemed, that it wasn’t going to happen exactly as he had hoped. He was already several months behind in his estimation, and he felt his entire plan was slipping away.
When you’re 18 — or 25, as in the case of my young friend — every year seems like an eternity. I remember thinking, at 18, that the best phase of one’s life ended at 25, that I needed to have things sorted and in place by then, that success (in the not-so-modest way I defined it) had to be realised by then. If not, I would have achieved nothing. Or so I thought.
Expect the unexpected
In the decades since then, I have realised that there is no point in setting certain kinds of time-dependent goals (first novel by 25, first patent by 28, first million by 30). Yes, by all means set goals for yourself, but be realistic about how and when you will achieve them. Most of our aspirations require a number of things to fall into place, and there are things that are beyond one’s control. In addition, as we go through life, we run into unexpected situations that require us to spend time and effort that we had not bargained for. So, even as we may not be progressing towards our pre-set goal, we are actually being productive in other ways — so, it is not all time wasted.
What is important is that we find a way to work steadily towards those goals — and look kindly upon some of those interruptions and distractions. So, let us say you have set out to finish five big things during a particular year. You need to be clear-headed about what time and effort each of those requires, and whether you can realistically do it. Some may depend only on your own discipline while others are contingent on many factors. If you get stuck on the idea that success means finishing all five, then, you are likely to be disappointed. Instead, suppose you set your goals without that deadline in mind. There are some things you want to accomplish. Some must be done within a certain time frame (a degree programme, for instance, or a project). But, others may be done over a longer period, and are more in the nature of aspirations that you will work toward fulfilling over time.
So that is the key. Differentiating between what must be done (and no two ways about allocating time and resources for this) and what can be done, time and resources permitting. My 25-year-old friend should probably go back and re-think his criteria for success and failure, and not blame himself too much.

Language of collaboration ","I recall a game from my days as a corporate training facilitator, which was a favourite with some companies. Teams would be taken on a short, one-day trip to a nature spot. They were encouraged to participate in leisure activities, relax and have fun. The particular game I am referring to required one member of the team to stand on a slightly elevated platform, with her back to the rest of the team standing on the ground. And then, on the facilitator’s cue, she had to close her eyes and fall back. The team would catch her, avoiding any injury. It was basically a blind, free fall and the litmus test of trust within your team. 
Though this was a fun, team-building activity, it helped uncover any inherent tensions or “beliefs” in a set of people working together. In teams that trusted each other and had a strong sense of bonding, the fall wouldn’t be an issue. But in the absence of those, the fall is a difficult task because you are not sure your team has your back. 
Organisations the world over now favour collaboration over individualism. While an individual’s talent matters, how she contributes to the team’s talent and strengthens the team as a unit, becomes more critical. 
This leads to the pivotal question: What makes a great team and how does a team develop mutual trust? In these days of agility, when our workplace encourages quick problem solving and faster business results, teamwork becomes especially critical. 
Team playing as a skill, is driven essentially by the desire to make the team succeed. This desire is fired by the motivation to help each other, communicate to each other clearly and honestly at all times, all the while led by a shared sense of purpose. It is, to a great extent, the leader’s responsibility to ensure such an environment is created in the team so that its members feel valued, secure and inspired. When the leader of a team creates the end goal and empowers the team to accomplish it, the team members feel inspired to pursue it.
But the onus is not on the leader alone. Once such an environment has been created for us by the leader, we must be able to apply our individual talent and autonomously take decisions that help the team. Such decisions must be made transparently and honestly, creating trust. Individual opinions must be sought and considered, contributions valued and responsibilities shared. All the while, open communication must be practised. 
Whenever possible, the team must also relax and have fun together in informal scenarios, which makes them feel at ease in each other’s company. Team lunches or trips are all ways in which teams can come together to have fun. But the leader must ensure that the camaraderie outside work is complemented by camaraderie and mutual respect at work. 
It is like playing cricket. Individuals in a team may have their strengths and weaknesses, but come together to win the game. As long as we speak the language of collaboration, taking that leap of trust shouldn’t be difficult. The team will have our back.

An exchange spree
","Perfectly predicting defects of designs in manufacturing, construction, and various biological aspects with attractive colour maps has always fascinated me and made me curious to know how it is done. That is why I was interested in pursing computational mechanics. 
I chose my undergraduate programme in Mechanical Engineering at SCSVMV, Kanchipuram, where things started to dawn upon me. Dr. Ratna Kumar Annabathula, Assistant Professor, IIT Madras, identified my interest towards Finite Elements as well as research. He encouraged me to pursue masters in computational mechanics through the programme called Erasmus Mundus. 
An Erasmus Mundus Joint Master Degree, is an integrated, international study programme, jointly delivered by an international consortium of higher education institutions. Subsequently, I applied and got selected in the Erasmus Mundus MSc in computational mechanics programme with funding which was more than enough to cover my monthly living expenses. 
The course is designed for students who wish to develop their knowledge in the field of computational mechanics with applications in solids, fluids, and other interdisciplinary fields. The programme also includes a component of entrepreneurship and innovation. 
It provides the skills for the modelling, formulation, analysis, and implementation of simulation tools for advanced engineering problems, as well as skills for understanding these approaches in the broader context of business and innovation. Mostly students may take the Master’s as a professional terminal degree, or in preparation for a Ph.D. 
This course is provided by international consortium of four leading European Universities in computational mechanics: Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya (UPC), Spain; Swansea University, the U.K.; Ecole Centrale Nantes (ECN), France; Universität Stuttgart, Germany.
One programme, two institutions
 Usually, students study in two universities: the first year in Barcelona, Spain or Swansea, the U.K.. The remaining two semesters will be spent at any of the other three institutions which is different from that of the first year. I did my first year at Swansea University and second year at UPC. Swansea University is considered as the birthplace for finite element analysis and its computational engineering department is named Zienkiewicz Centre for Computational Engineering after Professor Olgierd Zienkiewicz, who is the father of finite element methods. It is now lead by Professor Perumal Nithiarasu, an Alumni of IIT Madras. Both universities have excellent on-going research works and amazing teaching faculties. 
Swansea University, in particular, is very student-friendly. A faculty is appointed as a tutor who meets each student once in two weeks during which they can share all their personal and professional issues.
Also, being an exchange programme, students benefit from interacting with different groups of academics in an exciting international environment. It provides an amazing platform to understand different research collaborations happening in European universities.

The problem of burning out ","Over 10 lakh students attempt JEE (Joint Entrance Exam) every year. Only if one manages to get the top 3,000 to 5,000 ranks, (0.01% of the total students) will one be able to get a popular branch in the top five to six IITs. Thus, most students, however good they are, will not make it. Three to four lakh students also drop one year to prepare exclusively for JEE. 
Most good students in top schools have stopped attending Class XI and XII, as they seriously study for JEE, to the exclusion of everything else. We are thus producing a unidimensional work force. In addition, most undergraduates in every engineering college are burnt out.
Lateral entry 
I propose a solution to the JEE issue through an exclusive lateral entry approach into IITs. This will result in the following benefits:
1. Postponement of JEE advanced preparation to colleges, leaving school students alone. 
2. Ensuring that IITs conduct their own admission exams, thereby ensuring fairness.
3. Keeping the number of B.Tech graduates through IITs small, only twice of what they produce now.
4. Ensuring that only those who like engineering get into IITs. 
I propose that B.Tech admissions into IITs happen in the third year, after students spend two years in engineering colleges. After getting admission into IITs, these students may complete the education of III and IV years, and graduate with a B.Tech degree. It may be a joint degree with the institution that trained them in the first two years of B.Tech.
The entrance exam will be based on the first two years of engineering and science courses that one normally undergoes at the IITs. The syllabus for these exams will be based on the excellent NPTEL (National Programme on Technology Enhanced Learning) video courses, freely available to all. If NPTEL videos can be dubbed into all 22 Indian languages, quality study material will be within the reach of motivated students, rich or poor, urban or rural. 
The IITs may also mandate that all students who aspire to join the B.Tech course must know how to write at least one working computer programme. Although I mentioned only the IITs, other top institutions such as BITS Pilani and ICT (formerly UDCT) can be included in the above indicated mentoring list. Colleges that routinely send many of its students to the IITs can themselves move over to this mentoring group. 
As the portion for the exams is clearly defined, students will know what to study. Help can be given by the IITs to help clear doubts of students. IIT Bombay has successfully been running a programme ‘Ask a Question’ through which its professors have been answering students’ questions. 
This activity, spearheaded by the best teachers from all established institutions, can provide free of cost, the extra help a bright student needs, to make the cut. 
Joint mentoring
Many of the heads of departments at IIT Bombay gave their personal view that students selected in the manner proposed in this article will do at least as well as the current students. 
The IITs can be encouraged to closely work with colleges that send their best students: teacher training, joint guidance of students, joint master’s degree, applying for project grants, and so on. These colleges may also get higher ranking in accreditation and NIRF (National Institutional Ranking Framework) evaluations.
JEE Main will be conducted more or less in the same manner as we do now. Once all top level colleges and the IITs are selected to do the mentoring work, there could be 100 to 200 comparable colleges at the next level, with a total of about 50,000 seats. It should be easy for a good school student to get into any of these seats without extraordinary preparation. It will also be possible for a student to pick and choose a branch of his/her choice.
JEE Main may be kept comparatively simple; as not much distinction needs to be made amongst these 50,000 students. It would then be possible to reduce the syllabus of Class XI and XII, which the government has been trying to do for quite some time. School students will get a lot of free time, to play, create art forms, participate in social work, prepare for science olympiads, and so on.
The science departments of the IITs, freed from the teaching load, can work with smart school students, desirous of carrying out science research. It will also not be necessary for school students to drop a year to prepare for the JEE Main.

Lessons from leather ","BITS Pilani has a unique, standalone system in place which allows its students to get hands-on experience in the real-world projects through a programme called Practice School (PS). It’s an ideal platform for us to learn about an organisation’s culture and functioning. I was lucky to get my first preference, the Central Leather Research Institute (CLRI) in Chennai. It has a huge database and an economics department in place, which definitely was an ideal place for me, given my interest in applied econometrics.
On the first day, we reached the institute early morning and our schedules for the next two months were explained to us. For the next two weeks, we were given orientations of the numerous departments by department heads. Students, during the same time, were allowed to choose their own departments and the available projects on which they would be working. As I was certain about my preference, I went ahead and talked to the head of the economics department. After a detailed discussion, the faculty was convinced and agreed to mentor me for the project.
Headway
Initially, I was asked to look into the qualitative aspect of a project which did not intrigue me enough. So, I decided to share my concern with a member of the faculty. He explained how he was from the sociology department but would nonetheless speak with the scientist for my benefit, and a meeting was scheduled the next day. The meeting was unexpectedly fruitful, and he promised to help me with my project. The next couple of weeks were spent in discussing the details and other plausible explanations to the various prospects of the chosen project. 
My project involved analysing the factors responsible for the export performance of leather garments in India. This topic required a great deal of knowledge about the leather and export industry, and so I spent considerable amount of time in CLRI’s library going through the previous research papers and other relevant material. After collecting relevant data, a regression analysis was made to find out the significant factors that determined the price of the exported leather garments such as the availability of raw material and disposable income of consumers. I drew the conclusion based on my findings and suggested that we include other parameters like seasonal effects in the regression to obtain better results. The final report had some unexpected results and I discussed the possibilities of them being true. It opened a new channel of thoughts for which I was praised, given the time constraint in which I finished my project.

How effective is this?
","Spriha Shukla, M.Phil in English Literature, Tata Institute of Social Sciences, Mumbai




The objective exam pattern is an unfair means to judge someone’s knowledge. An individual’s understanding of a particular topic can vary, based on his/her socialisation which cannot be summed up in one word answers. Also, the pattern is highly problematic for the social science courses where there are no black and white answers. The answers are supposed to be backed by detailed explanation, which can vary from person to person, based on their experiences.
Supreet Aneja, IV, Journalism, Apeejay Stya University, Gurugram




This step seems to stand in contrast to the ethos of JNU, especially for departments of social sciences. The analytical and comprehensive ability to defend one's view has been taken away. The move also leads to the habit of cramming, where candidates fail to understand the concepts in detail. For the problem of evaluating lengthy answer sheets, a middle ground can be thought of.
Aishwarya M.R., III, B.E. (ECE), Sri Krishna College of Technology, Coimbatore




JNU’s decision principally in the field of arts will be inefficient in testing relevant skills of prospective students. Moreover, selecting students through objective entrance exams might not reap good results in the long run due to low complexity of evaluation. The pattern of the paper needs to be set in accordance with the skills required at the entrance level.
Sadia Anjum, Final Year, PGDM, Jaipura School Of Business, Ghaziabad




Online entrance tests are certainly a step forward towards fair selection. But the University will have to make sure that the holistic requirements, like knowledge and skills are tested despite this change in the exam pattern. Students, especially at the postgraduate level, must be gauged properly. It seems a little difficult to assess subjective knowledge through MCQs and therefore the effectiveness of this system can be challenged.

Stay competitive ","For generations, having an MBA has been considered one of the most sought after paths to success, in the business world. Every student is truly aware of the lucrative edge that an MBA in sales and marketing, finance, human resources, operations and IT could give them. In this modern era, the dream of studying at a top business school, passing with exceptional grades, getting a top management position and a handsome package, has been ingrained in students. 
Every year, approximately 1.8 to 2 lakh students appear for a mainstream MBA exam. This is not just restricted to final year college students or fresh graduates, but pre-employed professionals as well. It is a crazy rat race, and the consequences aren’t always pleasing. Not only is the probability of getting through a top college low, but employment is also a cause of worry. After all, general business programmes are in abundance and with everyone opting for the same course, there is no freshness that comes out. Everyone wants to be globally relevant but at the same time wants to work within sectors of the Indian economy. A strong inclination towards doing something unconventional is linked with the unlikely possibility of succeeding in the job market.
Evolving demand
Innovation is the key to staying competitive. As the cultural framework of the country evolves, a number of management institutes have realised the need for swerving away from traditional courses and offering niche management degrees. They are attempting to differentiate themselves in a crowded MBA marketplace with tailor-made courses that are relevant, compelling, dynamic, and not available elsewhere. They have not moved away from the traditional MBA; instead, they have drawn up a gamut of niche MBA programmes in order to adapt to the changing demands of the industry and students. These courses are a perfect blend of theory and practice, preparing students to meet contemporary global needs.
The following courses offer tremendous potential as well as a global competitive edge. 
Energy and environment: An MBA in energy and environment currently offers plenty of opportunities waiting to be tapped. This course is not only well-equipped to train aspiring professionals towards managerial, economic, legal, political and relevant technical competence, but also makes them a crucial link between the world of technology, business and sustainable development. It encompasses sectors such as power, renewable energy, energy efficiency, oil and gas, climate change and sustainable development, green buildings, corporate sustainability, global standards and environmental management.
Agri-business: This sector is growing rapidly, with the food and agriculture business all set to triple itself by 2020. An MBA in agri-business presents a challenging and exciting opportunity to help contribute to and engineer this demanding and dynamic revolution. This course works well in fields such as agriculture and WTO, agricultural export-import and agricultural finance, as it broadly covers marketing, finance, taxation and supply chain management.
Multiple B-schools provide high-quality niche MBA programmes. It is time to check out these contemporary career options that could not only match your interests but also help you improve your prospects.

Take the KVPY route
","The Kishore Vaigyanik Protsahan Yojana (KVPY) is a national fellowship programme in basic sciences, initiated and funded by the Department of Science and Technology, Government of India, to identify highly motivated students who could pursue basic science courses and research careers. Students of classes XI and XII, who qualify, receive a monthly scholarship up to their pre-Ph.D level or five years, whichever is earlier. The exam is administered by the IISc Bengaluru with only 2,500 students qualifying out of lakhs who apply.
The programme tests students at three levels: KVPY SA exam for students of class XI, KVPY SX exam for class XII and KVPY SB exam for first-year students of BSc, integrated five-year M.Sc, or integrated five-year M.S. 
Preparation
Students who are already preparing for exams such as JEE Main, olympiads or any other competitive exam through institutes need not worry much, as the pattern accommodates KVPY. Here are some tips. 
1. Manage your time with an effective study plan. Discipline is the key to following your timetable. Make a plan which is feasible, allowing you to utilise time effectively, while giving equal attention to all subjects and important topics. Keep aside an hour daily for self-analysis and correction. Segregate time for covering the syllabus concept-wise. While attempting the exam, it is always advisable to attempt the known portion of the question paper first. 
2. Utilise available resources efficiently. Understanding concepts is a must; choose study material which enable this. Make use of periodic physical interactions with expert faculty and group study to clear your doubts. Make short self-written notes for long-term memorising.
3. Evaluate yourself and reinforce your weak areas. Neglecting them can be your biggest mistake.
4. Stay connected with experts. Institutes which provide result analysis and doubt-clearing sessions on a regular basis could be useful. 
5. Judge your performance with periodic testing, after focussed study. Practise with as many mock tests as you can and make sure you go through previous year’s question papers. 
Subject-wise tips
Physics: The class XI syllabus forms the foundation of any competitive exam. Be thorough in it, especially if you are appearing at the SA level. Focus on topics such as optics, mechanics and electromagnetism. Do not leave any topic untouched, and go through thermodynamics, simple harmonic motion, and waves. 
For the SX level, practise numerical problems and keep all the concepts clear. Focus on kinematics, gravitation, fluids, heat and thermodynamics, waves and sound, capacitors and electrostatics, magnetics, electromagnetic induction, optics and modern physics.
Math: Basic knowledge of geometry and number theory is a must. Other topics include algebra, quadratic equations, series and progression, permutations and combinations, and basic geometry. Study of fundamental topics such as circles, trigonometry and sequence and series can guarantee good marks. Go through them at least once before the exam, as three to four questions based on them are expected. The SX level will include questions from integration, statistics, vector algebra and 3D geometry. Topics such as application of derivatives, matrices and determinants, and limits are high-scoring. 
Chemistry: If you are appearing for the SX exam, consult NCERT books for inorganic chemistry. Organic chemistry needs to be clear from the basic level along with regular practice. Focus on coordination chemistry and chemical bonding in inorganic chemistry, electrochemistry, chemical and ionic equilibrium, mole concept in physical chemistry and organic chemistry, atomic structure, and chemical bonding.
Biology: It is relatively easier to score good marks in biology in the SA category, compared to other subjects. If you are thorough with class IX and X NCERT and have gone through important topics from class XI and XII NCERT books, you can expect to score more than 80%. Genetics, cell and biomolecule, physiology (both animal and plant, especially photosynthesis in plants and control and coordination in both animals and plants), and health and disease are important. Read these topics from XI and XII NCERT selectively. Attempting mock tests and solving previous years’ question papers during preparation will help you score extra marks.

Change your course
","The most important thing we do in life is to take decisions. At a time of information overload, this can be particularly challenging. Yet, this is the time of year when students have to make up their mind on their future course of study. It is one of the most difficult and important decisions they will need to take, one that will impact the rest of their life. 
Trends suggest that there will be an increasing number of Indians opting for higher studies abroad, particularly in Australia.
Keep in mind
Do your homework: Basic research is important, but information overload can make decision-making difficult and confusing. It is important to decide what subject you would like to pursue, where you would like to study, whether you meet the entry and eligibility criteria and finally, whether we have the required funds to pay for it. Given the Indian rupee-Australian dollar exchange rate, studying in Australia is significantly cheaper than traditional destinations, such as, the U.S., and the U.K., which pose new challenges. 
How to apply: If you are going through an education agent, find out which education agents have been empanelled by the university of choice. For instance, the internationally-ranked University of New South Wales, Sydney (UNSW) has only 12 registered India-based education partners. No one else is authorised to process student applications. The list is available on the university’s website. Furthermore, empanelled agents are not authorised to charge students for services they render. Such payments, or commissions, are paid for by the university. 
Know ‘why’ you are pursuing higher studies: Simon Sinek, in his path-breaking book The Power of Why, stressed on the misplaced emphasis that many place on ‘what’ and ‘how’, without ever knowing ‘why’. If you know ‘why’ you are planning on a particular course of action, other things fall in place. In terms of sequencing, ‘why’ is where we first start. You can decide, for instance, to pursue an undergraduate course in finance and accounting, if you are clear as to why you would like to do so. Once you know your why, where is easy. 
Embrace change: Often, our parents, in particular, and sometimes even we, fear the uncertain. Living abroad, especially if it is the first time, can be challenging. Our parents worry about multiple things: Is it safe? What is the culture like? Will my son or daughter make friends? Will the studying and living culture cause problems? These are legitimate questions and anxieties. At the same time, if the decision is to study abroad, it is important to be open to change. Some things might be similar to what we are used to, but there will be big differences in other aspects. What is particularly fascinating is that ‘other cultures’ open up the mind to new ways of seeing and thinking and even, behaving. This creates a global mindset. It lies at the heart of what great education is all about. 
Learn with passion: We can learn every single day, but only if we are open to it. ‘Smell the roses’ we are told and yet, we rarely do. Employability is not a quotient of how many books we have read or quotations we know by heart, but how we are able to relate with our external environment. This is what employers look for because what they want are persons who can work in a team, take decisions and consequently, anticipate and solve problems without compromising on integrity and values. Great educational institutions recognise this and embed it into their pedagogy. It is what makes them stand out.

Leading the varsities of tomorrow
"," I have spent more than 20 years in the education industry, during which I have worked in positions that have presented opportunities to interact with people at the helm of the university leadership, both in private as well as in government institutions. 
Universities, around the world, are going through a transformation. Technological advancements, rising costs, reduced funding, increasing competition, and many other factors make the role of a vice chancellor extremely challenging, yet critical for a university.
Currently, universities select their vice chancellors from the applicants who meet the basic criteria (candidate with a Ph.D. with a minimum of 15 years of experience in teaching and research, having held posts of dean, director or principal of a university or reputed institution, is ideal). 
However, universities of the future will need a charismatic leader with excellent administrative, academic, financial and team management skills to be able to navigate the changes that are been seen in the horizon. It is time to think about how our universities ought to get ready to address the challenges of tomorrow, and what roles the vice chancellors would play, while they lead these institutions.
Purpose: Ability to drive results
Universities of the future will be built on the culture of meritocracy and performance. They will need to ensure that they deliver quantifiable and measurable results in terms of academic and administrative performance, as well as deliver student outcomes. 
Vice chancellors need to be pioneers, who value possibilities, and ignite energy and imagination in their teams. They must look at new ways and methods to accomplish things, to gain competitive advantage. They will need to use their imagination to derive extraordinary models of how things ought to work, to produce a result which transforms situations.
Financing
Universities are faced with a multi-edged sword: increased costs due to demand for higher quality, increased investment in technology and allied services, pressure to bring down tuition fees and a reduced funding from the government. 
Also, the pressure to continuosly improve the quality of infrastructure, increased pay for better qualified faculty, spending on marketing, increased investment in content for fast changing curriculum has made the situation increasingly critical. 
Universities will need to find alternate sources of funds to ensure that they are being able to fight the trinity of cost, quality and scale. The ability of a vice chancellor to mobilise funds from multiple sources including, but not limited to, endowments, charities, public allocations, and so on will become important.
Networking
Vice chancellors will need to play the role of the integrator, who values connection and draws teams together. Their ability to network profoundly with the components of the ecosystem is critical to drive the university. 
They must be able to communicate the vision of the university with passion and authenticity, pull things together at critical points, avoid arbitrariness and give focus to the process. They shall be responsible for the cohesion in the team and for making efforts comprehensive — pull different positions and perspectives back on track so that the greater good is realised.
Collaboration
The lines between formal and informal, degree and vocational, class-room and online education are getting blurred. With multiple guiding frameworks like NSQF, CBCS, LOCF and government focus on skill education at university level, it is imperative to identify the right collaborators who can add complementary and supplementary value to the university. Vice chancellors would need to collaborate with multiple agencies, frameworks, regulators, employers, academic and research organisations, national and international counterparts and funding agencies to get the desired results. 
They will need to be the guardians who value stability and bring order and rigour, a prudent guide to what is pragmatic and workable without resulting in organisational deficits across the board.
Teamwork
Leaders, in the university of the future, must value challenges and generate momentum; moving things forward, exerting mild pressure to get things done while respecting individual personalities. They must exert enthusiasm and foster energy to accomplish goals. They must goad the team into action, generating momentum to ensure benchmarks are met and time is managed so that desired results are achieved.
As the competition becomes fierce and expectations from students, higher, a vice chancellor’s ability to build a performing team to ensure greater productivity through responsibility sharing, using the unique competencies of each member to advance the interest of the entire organisation, shall be of great importance.
Universities will have to deal with a new set of challenges and must rise to new opportunities. It is order and stability that harness what is positive in attempts at innovation, and contribute to creativity being more responsible and realistic. Tagore’s magnificent view that ‘life should not be the infinite elongation of a straight line’, fits so well to define the risks of tomorrow. Universities have big goals and aspirations, and only a non-linear planning and a strategic mindset can help reach them.

When legacy meets innovation
","“The opportunities here are really exciting,” says Manya Modi, while on a brisk campus tour. Early on a Monday morning, Ecole hôtelière de Lausanne (EHL) is abuzz with activity. Manya is one among the many students clad in formal wear, heading to classes purposefully, gearing up for yet another busy day at school. There’s lots to do, lots to learn. In a way, the energetic atmosphere effuses EHL’s constant focus on shaping the future of hospitality through innovation. As it turns 125 years old, the spotlight is as much on the legacy of its past as it is on its ambitious plans for the future.
Located in the vibrant city of Lausanne in Switzerland, EHL is driven by a purpose — to be a pioneer in hospitality education. With its state-of-the-art campus in the world’s Olympic capital, the university consistently strives to be an ambassador for traditional Swiss hospitality. What started off in 1893 as a hotel school in a room of the Hôtel d’Angleterre in Lausanne has now grown to one of the top hotel management schools in the world. 
With more than 3,000 students from 119 countries, two campuses in Switzerland and a third one underway in Singapore, a range of undergraduate, graduate and certificate programmes and a strong network of alumni, EHL is going strong. 
“When it started, EHL was a vocational school. Today, we are a university of applied sciences in hospitality management, with the same spirit we had 125 years ago,” says Michel Rochat, Chief Executive Officer, EHL Group. “The Group is supported by a worldwide alumni network, produces research projects and partnerships which, in turn, generate an important innovation pipeline, and all of this while integrating cutting-edge digital evolutions and partnerships in its roadmap,” he observes. 
Looking ahead
The 125th birthday marks the start of an important period of growth for EHL. On the cards is an innovation village near the campus — with the aim of creating a unique hospitality ecosystem bringing together entrepreneurs, researchers, experts, investors, students, artists, alumni and so on. 
“We would like to inspire and disrupt the hospitality industry,” says Rémi Walbaum, Chief Innovation and Valorisation Officer. “For us, the combination of powerful local academic players, a dynamic VC scene, and the regional presence of large corporations is an asset,” he explains. Being a part of the ecosystem of Switzerland, which has been ranked first in the global innovation index for the seventh year in a row, surely adds firepower. 
EHL is also working on taking the rapid digital revolution in its stride. “Our students are going to walk out into the world tomorrow, and they have to make a difference,” believes Julia Aymonier, Chief Information Officer. To give students an edge in the market and better employability, the university has decided to focus on virtual reality and AI conversational interfaces. 
While the former will allow first-year students to experience working on real life problems, the latter will enhance the student experience by creating a virtual personal assistant. 
EHL also envisions a campus where robotic concierges answer questions about the campus and give information to students. One such robot is dubbed EHLie by the students. When coupled with Amelia, an artificial intelligence software, it could lend itself to useful applications. “Soon I will have a family of brothers and sisters to help me. We will be creating a digital EHL family,” quips EHLie, in a demo. Amelia agrees. 
Another milestone will be the inauguration of a new campus in Lausanne in 2021, with a host of facilities for students. According to Rochat, this is the last piece of the puzzle in EHL’s strategy for the future. 
The Indian angle
 There are 51 Indian students currently studying at the university. India has potential for EHL, though the concept of studying hospitality might be misunderstood. “Hospitality is not just in hotels and restaurants — it’s in banks, hospitals, luxury brands, even in technology. This is something we are trying to reinforce in the new markets, that we are entering. It has been working well, but we still have a lot of work to be done,” explains Sherif Mamdouh, external communications manager. 
For Delhi-based Manya Modi who is now in her second year, the academic experience is transforming her view of hospitality. “It’s a challenging course, but our teachers are always there to help us,” she signs off.

Believe and visualise ","I scored 94.7% in my class X boards. However, the main motivation for me to study was to impress a girl. When she rejected me, I totally lost a reason to study. Even then I tried hard in class XII. But, my efficiency plummeted. I scored 93.8% in my boards but failed to crack IIT. I joined NIT Durgapur for my B.Tech in ECE and I do not like the curriculum. I have lost the drive and thus score average marks. Please help me to regain my drive. – Anonymous.
Wow! 95% and 94% is rather impressive. You are still the same person who scored these marks in the X and XII! You need to believe it, that’s all. Please thank that girl for having ignited the motivation in you. Now you know you can, if you really want to. You seem to be disinterested, bored or perhaps heartbroken? You just need to switch on again! Equip yourself with a sound education (and you know you can do this), set a goal that you want to achieve and work towards that. You will find the girl of your dreams when the time is right. Can you move from ECE to another stream now mid-semester? What would you enjoy studying? Where do you see yourself post your B.Tech? Masters? India or overseas? Work aspirations? What industry? The best will happen, believe it and visualise it.
I completed my graduation in 2013 and started preparing for Civil Services. I wrote IAS and PCS Mains and still in the process of PCS Mains’ second attempt. I could not get the best guidance at the right time, otherwise I might have done a post graduation in some field. Now I wish to know what options I have to start earning by working in something? Are there any opportunities for those who prepared for IAS and can directly do something based only on interview, without pursuing further education. I need to start earning now. Also what courses I can opt for while working? Are there any good distance education courses in fields like journalism or law which I can join while having a career after a few years? – Sumit Sharma
Dear Sumit,
Yes, it is a tiring, excruciatingly tough, painfully long, and difficult process to crack. Unfortunately despite your attempts, there is no extra privilege provided during hiring and interviews for those who have prepared for IAS for many years though you can certainly share the information with the HR / interview panel.
What have you done your graduation in? Yes, it’s been a while since you graduated and you should start earning. Find a job that interests and excites you, get in touch with good friends and family (that are well placed and can provide you with suitable openings and leads), meet HR placement consultants and explain to them what you would like to do. You can shortlist a list online, with your city preferences. There are various online and distant education courses certified from national and international universities that you can sign up to, once you find a job. You will find a rich directory for these online as well, if you look for the specific courses. Good Luck!
I scored 70% in Class X and XII, after that completed my Bachelor’s in Technology (Mechanical) and secured 65% marks. I never had any interest in engineering. When I was in the final year I accidentally cracked my GATE exam, and everyone started thinking I am studious. But honestly I am not and I have no idea how I cracked it. Although my GATE score was just at par, it was considered a huge achievement since there were only two of us from my branch who cracked this exam. At that time I had no idea what the benefits of clearing this exam were. After completing my Bachelor’s I didn’t get campus placement and afterwards I wasted about nine months in Delhi preparing for SSC CGL. After completing the course I returned home and found a job as an installation engineer for three months and later realised that it wasn’t for me. Later I decided to go for Masters and got admission in Thapar University. After completing Masters, I worked hard with my partner and opened an automobile company. It’s been two years of successful working in the company and now I’ve realised that I am still not happy and want to go into civil services via SSC CGL. I am already 27 now and worried because the age limit for SSC CGL for the general category is 30. Should I try for SSC now or should I continue with my business? — Nischay Chauhan
I do believe that you are seeking the true meaning of your name — “Nischay”— a resolve, a final decision, and surety of your identity perhaps. What do you want to do in life? What gives you joy and happiness? You have a Master’s degree in mechanical engineering and running a successful company but what is it that you are seeking deep within? How are you so sure that you are cut out for SSC CGL and that it will be an answer to your search now? Would it be possible for you to meet with a proficient counsellor who can work with you in greater depth and help you understand and identify your interests, hobbies, fears and concerns. I would like you to be a little more realistic and not romantic. You certainly don’t want SSC GCL to be another escape exit for the next two to three years. 
My daughter completed her Class XII with a very good score of 95% in the commerce stream. With a keen interest, she took up economics as joined B.A Economics in Chennai. She wants to do her postgraduation with economics as major subject. What are her options in Chennai and other cities. She is not keen on pursuing MA or M.Phil. Please advice. — Sandhya 
Dear Sandhya,
Your daughter can do a MBA in Business Economics, M.Sc. in Applied Economics or, Mathematical Economics, a MBE — Master of Business Economics or a PG diploma course like Applied Economics or Econometrics. What does she want to do? Depending on that she will need to start looking out for colleges and universities across the country that offer the course of her choice. Madras School of Economics, Delhi School of Economics, St. Stephen College, Delhi University, Indian Statistical Institute Kolkata, Sri Ram College of Commerce, IIT Kanpur and Banaras Hindu University are some of the very well reputed institutions.

The rhythm of routine
","On Monday nights, Sheldon must have his mee krob and chicken satay (with extra peanut sauce on the side). Tuesday dinner is at The Cheesecake Factory, where he orders a barbecue bacon cheeseburger: the barbecue, bacon and cheese on the side. Wednesday, of course, is comic book night. As fans of the popular American comedy show “The Big Bang Theory” know only too well, Sheldon Cooper is a creature of unwavering habit; his routine is tightly regimented, and anyone who tries to change it does so at their own peril.
We can laugh at Sheldon’s commitment to — no, obsession about — his routine, his refusal to be flexible and his insistence that everything must be followed just so. But there is something about structuring one’s day — or week — in a certain way that allows us to develop a pattern of work that can actually end up being quite productive. While making sure that we build in time for the things we need to do, it can also help us mark out time for the things we would like to do.
Some people, for instance, set a time every day (or every week) to call parents, if they live in a different place. Others have a routine of going to the grocery store at on a particular day of the week, while still others earmark a block of time to play tennis or football with friends, and nothing can get them to change that — it is absolutely sacred.
Better use of time
The school or college timetable is a kind of routine that is made for us — some might say it is “forced” on us. But, there is a logic to it. It allows the big system of the institution to allocate teaching time in a fair manner, and gives students (and teachers) a basic plan around which to arrange the rest of their activities. A big chunk of a student’s life (and a teacher’s too) is earmarked for the routine of classes. But, there is a significant chunk of the day that is left for other activities, and it helps to create a routine for that time as well. Monday may be the library day, while Tuesdays could be the “catch-up-on-notes” day and Wednesday, the assignment review day. It is a way to build a comforting rhythm to your week.
If you read biographies of successful people, you will find that most of them had some sort of routine that helped them become productive. Successful writers set themselves a certain number of hours each day to write (good, bad, whatever, but those words must be produced). Successful athletes train routinely, morning and evening, no matter what the weather. Those who play the stockmarket have a routine that follows the major markets systematically.
Having a routine doesn’t mean that you have to bind yourself to it. It could then become an empty and meaningless ritual (Monday, at the library, might have you sitting and staring into space or at your phone waiting for your time to be up). You needn’t fill up your entire day with a pre-set routine. Leaving a bit of room around the edges of what you need to do will give you the flexibility to assign time to unplanned activities. The routine, then becomes the anchor that steadies you, and gives you a base from which you can wander away, but also one that you can come back to, and take comfort in.

Getting by with a little help
","Next week seems daunting. Besides completing and submitting practical records for three subjects, you have to prepare quiz questions for an intercollegiate fest that your college is hosting. And, yes, you also need to turn in your article for the college magazine. In case this isn’t quite enough, your parents are insisting that you attend your cousin’s engagement on Wednesday evening — bang in the middle of the week! 
If you are feeling overwhelmed by the barrage of demands being imposed on you, take a moment to evaluate your options. You have to finish the record work. No choices there. Can you ask a friend on the quiz club to help with the questions? Can you ask the editor of the college magazine for an extension? And, yes, you are attending your cousin’s function. When we are overwrought, we needn’t push ourselves to the limit. Instead, asking for help can help us tide through crunch times without falling apart. Recognising that we need assistance and learning to ask for it is a skill that can be developed by all of us, including those who vehemently believe in being self-reliant. For the truth is, we all depend on the support and cooperation of others in more ways than one. 
Political scientist, professor and writer, Anne-Marie Slaughter says, “It often takes much more strength on our part to acknowledge weakness than to pretend infinite competence.” Asking for assistance is often a sign of healthy coping as it involves an awareness of how much we can actually take on. We need to know our limits and how far we can stretch. And, we should be careful of extending ourselves too far lest we break.
Seek assistance 
So, when the going seems tough, it is okay to receive assistance. But we should realise that we may have to ask for it, and ask for it in the right way. In The New York Times, Tim Herrara cites the work of social psychologist Heidi Grant, who provides a few steps that can help us get help.
First, you have to ensure that the person you are seeking assistance from recognises your need for help. Don’t assume that they know the context of your current difficulties. While you may understand your plight, it may not be obvious to the other person why you would need their help. So, if you ask a friend to help you set the quiz questions, explain why are you making the request so that he doesn’t think you are shirking your responsibilities. 
Next, you need to specify the kind of help you need. Provide as much clarity as possible by giving details about the nature of assistance you are seeking. Also, the other person is more likely to help if you make it clear that you are not asking for help indefinitely but for a particular task only. This way, the person aiding you also knows how much time and effort is required of her. Last, be selective in asking for help. If you ask a friend who isn’t interested in quizzing, then it is unlikely to result in your need being fulfilled.
While it is perfectly fine to ask for help when you are in a tight spot, you have to be mindful that you don’t ask for help all the time. People are more likely to acquiesce when your need for assistance is genuine and well-deserved. If you habitually postpone your assignments and are always in a fix closer to deadlines, then people are less likely to pitch in. Asking for help should not be your default option. Rather, if you use it judiciously, more people than you realise will be happy to lend a hand.

Planning the future ","I studied Architecture in Mumbai University. It used to take me around two hours to reach college, thanks to the Mumbai traffic. The serious lack of planning in Mumbai made me realise that I wanted to pursue a career in planning, to be able to transform and improve the conditions that people live in. 
I chose the country, Australia, first before choosing the university. The Australian policies and strategic planning inspired me to want to go there and study. University of New South Wales (UNSW) is the best university there that offers a course on Master of City Planning. 
Another thing that inspired me to go there was that I was selected for the Future of Change scholarship. I had to submit a two minute video on how a scholarship at UNSW will help me achieve my aspirations. I think that pretty much summed up the start of my journey to the campus there. 
The master of city planning course is well structured and helps you develop your planning knowledge alongside choosing from the various specialisations that the university has to offer. Apart from studying, I also work as an architectural graduate at an urban planning consultancy in Sydney, alongside tutoring a bachelor of planning course at the university. 
Living on campus
UNSW has a really great campus. It is very different than what it was in Mumbai. Living on campus has made me manage my time well, and I think I’ve become more independent. Tutoring has also helped me improve my communication skills, and it makes me realise that trying matters. And that it’s not just about learning, but being able to teach others what you’ve learnt. 
The main difference that I found in Australia is that there is no hierarchy in the educational institutions. We don’t address the professors as “Sir” or “Ma’am” there. We can call them by their names, and it’s not rude! 
So far, it has been a great experience. The programme is flexible which allows me to explore the city, tutor and work as well. I even had the opportunity to meet the Australian Prime Minister, which was one of the greatest experience that I had. 
I plan on working in Sydney to gain exposure before returning to Mumbai and implement what I’ve studied at UNSW and contribute towards the infrastructural planning in the city.

Take the plunge
","Akshaypat Singhania, belonging to the fourth generation of the illustrious Singhania family, balances two worlds: the old and the new. He shapes his businesses with an eye on the future while up-keeping the vision and repute of the generations past. 
Currently the Chairman and MD of JK International, he was instrumental in the launch of Park Avenue, as part of Raymond Apparel. As part of JK Files and Tools, he warded off the Chinese threat through innovative cost engineering. He has experienced similar success in cement and engineering businesses of the group. He is at present involved with setting up business ventures in high growth industries such as finance, venture capital, private equity, wealth management, and angel investing.
Singhania chats with EDGE about his take on today’s graduates, the changing business scenario, and preparing for the family business.
How well-prepared are today’s graduates for the corporate world?
Today’s fresh graduates would be much more confident in their communication skills because they are products of the communication age. However, this does not necessarily mean they are prepared for the real world. While digital chats and texting work on campus, work communication is very different. Students should be trained accordingly. Universities must focus more on soft skills and meta-learning to prepare students for the ever-changing workplace instead of concentrating on a fixed syllabus. Essential skills cannot be learned by reading or talking about them; they must be practised.
What, would education for the current generation of learners encompass?
Some schools in India are talking about developing 21st century skills in children, but these schools are not advanced enough. For instance, all schools have closed classrooms where children are listening to a teacher. But, at work, nobody sits in a closed room and listens to one person all the time. To really change the education system, India needs to build new schools from the ground up with new learning spaces; where students work in groups on projects with the teacher acting as a guide rather than a content expert; and where school life and life after school are bridged. Schools must inculcate four skills: creativity, critical thinking, communication, and collaboration. 
How much has the Indian business scenario changed from when you started out to now?
With nearly 500 million internet users, India represents a digital economy with the biggest market potential for global players. India has shown promise and leadership in digital technologies over the past decade. Going forward, businesses should aim to bridge the gap between rural and urban India so we can all grow together. With Blockchain technology and artificial intelligence, we can have real-time participation, safer and smoother transactions, and a better-organised working environment. 
How different should one’s education, learning, or preparation be when entering a family business?
The three most important skills are entrepreneurship, leadership, and succession. Educating the next generation about the family business can be key to strengthening the bonds between the family and the business. This helps to build a sustainable, long-term vision for future generations and create a platform for sharing experiences within the family. Also, it’s important that people gain exposure in other countries and this experience can definitely help.
What are the unique challenges faced in a family business and how much of it can be tackled through the right, focused education?
The challenges faced by today’s family businesses are greater than ever: a more turbulent environment dominated by pluralistic social values, intensified competition, a global economy, and rapidly-changing politics and regulation. This is when education and experience can make you more adaptable to the work environment and you learn to manage the vulnerable situations at work. 
What do you value more — education or experience?
The right education and experience go hand in hand. For instance, while studying, you can apply for internships and gain knowledge and experience in the sector you want to work in. Hence, the fresher is exposed to large roles and opportunities in the real world and can tackle them once he/she joins the business as a full-time employee.

Mixing business with pleasure
","It was the end of the second term at IIM Calcutta for the Post Graduate Programme for Executives (PGPEX) Class of 2019, and 20 of us were headed to University of Strathclyde in Glasgow, Scotland, to participate in the immersion module which is a mandatory part of our curriculum. This module introduces one to industry and education in a different geography and culture. For most of us, it was a unique experience — discuss the pressing economic and business issues and soak in the culture.
We started the programme with a workshop conducted by Prof. Ian Wooton of the Fraser of Allander Institute, a leading independent economic research institute focused on the Scottish economy, on Brexit and the trade challenges that lie ahead for the U.K. in a post-Brexit world. During our two weeks at Strathclyde, we had the opportunity to interact with senior professors and discuss areas such as strategy, fintech, risk management, digital marketing, supply chain management, and so on. An interesting session was conducted by Prof. Phil Taylor on the impact of automation on business services in a global delivery setup, where we discussed various service delivery models and the probable impact of automation on jobs not only in India and the U.K., but across the globe. 
Experiential learning 
The classroom sessions were complemented by our visits to various businesses. We visited the Scottish Power headquarters and learned about the IT transformation the organisation is going through. We were treated to a boardroom experience at the Royal Bank of Scotland headquarters in Edinburgh, and understand how the organisation has evolved post the 2008 economic crisis. The icing on the cake was a visit to Will Grant & Sons — the home of “Glenfiddich” — to nose the various whiskies and to see the bottling lines in operation.
We also visited  Glasgow when the European championships 2018 were on, and were greeted with concerts in George Square after classes. “People make Glasgow”, the motto of the city, could be felt in all the venues we frequented. A quick weekend getaway to the Scottish highlands made us fall in love with Scotland. Unfortunately, the two weeks came to an end and we had to return to Kolkata to resume the next leg of our course, though with lasting memories of Scotland and a promise to return.

Power through your predicaments
","I am a 19 year-old engineering student and have no interest in making a career out of it. I want to drop out and pursue a career in motion graphics and VFX. Should I go ahead with it? - Mukunthan I
Dear Mukunthan, 
I understand you are struggling with your course, but how can I decide on your behalf? How good are you at motion graphics and VFX? What has been your previous experience with it? Have you tasted success, or is it something you fancy? If you are seriously considering dropping out, I suggest you do a complete career and personality profiling to know what field and course best suits you. It makes sense to take a calculated risk than just shoot in the dark. Good luck.
I am a mechanical engineer and have sat for many recruitments, but cannot pass them. Now, I am unsure about what to do next. The dilemma is perturbing. Do I wait at home for the next round of government jobs or do I apply for private ones? If I do apply for private jobs, then, by this time of the year, is it possible? My morale is declining. Please help. - Rahul Choudhary
Dear Rahul,
It is disheartening to hear that you are unable to get through a good placement. What is the feedback that you receive after the interview and the recruitment process? In future, please ask the panel to specify and articulate the areas that are not working for you, so that you can consciously improve in those. Private jobs are always open to hiring as and when there is a vacancy or a position that opens up. Sign up on some company portals that interest you. Also, sign up on online job portals and meet some aggressive head-hunters and placement offices. Discuss your area of interest in detail with them and explain the role/s that would excite you. Identify for yourself, what in the government sector interests you and meet a consultant who can perhaps guide you further for that as well, side by side. Accordingly, start your preparation for those exams.
I am 23, and am pursuing my LLB after graduating in commerce. After graduation, my parents asked me to opt for bank coaching and to get a secure job. But, I wanted to study further. It was my decision to pursue a career in law. Now, the course is in progress. But by this time, my friends have completed their studies and some of them got placed well too. At this point, I’m stressed. Even though my parents are supportive, they are not financially sound. I seem to have made a big mistake in my career. Now, I would like to do my master’s in law at Amity University, but I am in a dilemma over whether to study further or apply for a job. - Aparna Chandran
Dear Aparna,
It is but natural what you are going through. Relax. You made the right choice; don’t fret over it. Everyone has his/ her independent destination in life, and no two people take the same route. So, don’t let anyone overwhelm you.
When do you finish your course? Would you need to intern next or can you start working immediately? Have you considered working for a few years to be financially stable, before you do your master’s? Identify what part of law makes you happy and find a job in that area, specifically. You are young and there are many opportunities out there immediately after your course. Start networking and exploring options of where you would want to work and set the intent and the ball rolling. All the best.
I’m 17 years old, currently in Class XII, and also preparing for the JEE 2019. I have always been a good student throughout school, but things started to change as I progressed to class XI. I joined a reputed institute to aid my JEE prep. Things were easy-going at first, but I felt the stress, after some months. I don’t know what initiated such pressure, but it worsened when I entered class XII. I developed the habit of overthinking, because of which my mind has become so tired that I am unable to focus on my studies. This happens every day. As a result, my performance suffered at school and the institute. I just can’t make-up my mind to study. I see most of my friends studying for hours, but I am unable to. My determination has weakened. What should I do? Please guide me - Kshitij
Hi Kshitij,
You are perhaps going through severe performance anxiety and tend to overthink. Please breathe. The boards and JEE are just exams; yes, important for sure, but they don’t define and limit you. Set your personal goals, don’t worry about who is doing what and studying for how many hours a day. Be well-versed with the exam portions and focus on your journey. Make sure you are well rested, eat well, hydrated and work towards a timetable with specific goals. Where do you see yourself in May 2019?
This is the final leg; you need to be calm, rational and focused. Without that, you will make a mess of your class XII exams and that will bring down your confidence to do well at the JEE 2019. Regret is a wasted emotion. Please reset your ‘determination switch’. We are already in December and you only have a few more months to go. With the pre-boards and the revisions, you will be more than ready. Put your best foot forward.

","Two camps, a ball, and lots of good wishes gave Sanjana Ramesh the golden chance to join Northern Arizona University (NAU) in the U.S. After participating in the NBA Academies Women’s Programme camp in May at The NBA Academy India, Sanjana has become the second participant from The NBA Academies Women’s Programme to sign a National Letter of Intent with an NCAA D-1 School. Sanjana is the second Indian-born female player ever to receive a basketball scholarship from a D-1 school. 
“It is a dream come true. I hope this will encourage more people to take to basketball,” says Sanjana, who will be part of the NAU’s women’s basketball team for the 2019-20 North American Division I college season.
The scholarship will cover the entire tuition fee and accommodation expenses. If Sanjana chooses to take up accommodation outside the campus, she will receive a monthly stipend. The scholarship will also cover food and medical expenses.
She is keeping her options open as far as the courses she plans to pursue at NAU are concerned. “I am mainly looking at business administration or psychology. I will probably opt for courses related to sports management,” she reveals. 
For Sanjana, what started as a hobby, has opened up a host of opportunities around the world. 
She has participated in Basketball Without Borders Asia, a three-day basketball development camp for the top male and female prospects from throughout Asia, and was named MVP of the camp for the girls division. She captained India’s U16 team in FIBA’s U16 Asia Cup in 2017. She was also part of the Indian team at the 2018 William Jones Cup held in Taiwan. 
Sanjana, who is currently in Class XII at Delhi Public School, in Bengaluru, speaks to EDGE about her love for the game and the exciting new experiences that it has opened up.
Why did you take up basketball? 
I initially started it as a hobby, but once I got into the Karnataka team, there was a shift in how seriously I started taking the sport. 
I had a liking for the game and felt I have natural skill for it. Of course, I had good coaches throughout school, club, and at the National level who encouraged me and trained me. 
How did the scholarship come about? 
I was hoping to know about the process and scope at the Basketball Without Borders camp. I thought the camp would be a good opportunity to understand if playing college basketball in the U.S. was a possibility. I participated in the NBA Academies Women’s Programme which preceded Basketball Without Borders 2018 Asia camp. While it was meant to improve the players’ skills, they were quite open to discussing opportunities and were quite encouraging for me to try NCAA Division 1 college basketball.
How do you plan to balance both basketball and academics? 
I have my list of goals and ambitions about what I would like to achieve in basketball. As far as studies go, I intend to learn to further my interest in certain areas like entrepreneurship, management, and psychology, and maybe try to link it to sports in some way. 
How do you hope to inspire more people to take up this sport? 
Over time, if I can convince more players to take up the sport, I would be proud of that. At the moment, I am trying my best to encourage junior players to aim higher like the NBA training camps that helped me boost my skills. 
Since the scholarship announcement, quite a few people have been asking me about the possibilities and about how to apply. Being in a position to help out is something I take great pride in. Even after moving to the U.S., I intend to continue to follow up and I will always be in touch with Indian team members whom I know well now, and especially players in my age group. 
I will keep motivating players who are in my age group and younger to me. Many talented players are coming up and the numbers will continue to grow.

Making knowledge work ","The University of Bradford is one of the best technology universities with cutting-edge research experience that tackles major global challenges of the current times.
The university's mission is ‘Making Knowledge Work’ — making a real difference to people’s day-to-day lives and is at the heart of all that the university does. It has adopted three academic themes relating to the grave problems of the world: advanced healthcare, innovative engineering, and sustainable societies.
Newer challenges
 “The world is facing global challenges on a scale not seen before: ill-health, poverty, climate change, energy supply, food security, migration and terrorism. The university is conducting the research needed to understand these problems, and is teaching the next generation of world leaders who will have to find the solutions,” said Professor Brian Cantor, Vice-Chancellor of the UK-based university.
“We are very strong in automatic engineering. One which looks like a fairly traditional engineering programme in our university, in real are a cutting edge programmes. We are continuously refreshing the old programmes and introducing new ones, as outdated courses will not offer good jobs and will become obsolete in the dynamically growing technological world. We are launching the first applied undergraduate AI programme in Britain next year.”
He also said that the university has a strategic partnership plan with educational institutions in India. “We already have existing partnerships with CSIR-Indian Institute of Toxicology Research, IIT Kharagpur, IIT Madras, LV Prasad Eye Institute and University of Ahmedabad. And we are working on signing MoU’s for student exchange, staff exchange and research collaborations with IIT Delhi, IIT Mumbai, IIM Bangalore, HR College of Commerce and Economics to name a few,” he said.
Inviting students to study at Bradford, he said, “We have launched two programmes for scholarships. The first programme provides a £3,500 scholarship to all students of India. And the other programme will aim at awarding a 50% scholarship to students depending on their merit and entrances.”
“The traditional links between the Bradford University and Indian universities have always been strong, however, due to strict visa policies, the inflow of Indian students have declined over the years. However, we are trying to re-stimulate the bond by giving good scholarships to all Indian students,” he adds.

Want to be a phlebotomist?
","Blood bank technology and clinical lab technology fall under a wide range of fields in medicine. Technicians are usually trained as phlebotomists and work with patients to collect various settings, blood and labelling. They usually work in medical laboratories and blood banks, where they store blood of the donors for transmission. Apart from this, they ensure that the type of blood collected is safe and also examine the level of healthy molecules in the blood.The course which such technicians study come under the National Skills Development Corporation and by doing this course, one can be assured of a good future, and also contribute to the Prime Minister’s Skill India Mission. 
Nature of work
Most activities are office-based. Technicians work only in blood banks and laboratories, doing research with donor’s blood to know the type of blood, and especially to see how safe the blood is. It is the blood technician’s job to store that blood for emergency. Apart from this, it is the job of a blood bank technician to check the blood of patients in the hospital’s lab and to collect related information. In addition, the technician also makes a record of blood. Those candidates who want to pursue their career in this field must have the flexibility to work independently and should also have good analytical skills.
Course and qualifications
Aspirants must have a diploma or certificate course in blood bank technology from any recognised institute approved from the accredited Board after passing class XII. The course duration is one or two years, which varies from one institute to another. During this course, candidates are given attention in practical training, in where they are taught to check various kinds of blood samples. Apart from this, essential elements of the different types of blood are explained. They are also taught how to deal with emergency or any kind of disaster. One can also apply for a government post by passing the SSC exams. The main aim of the diploma is to train students and turn them into skilled technicians who ensure the smooth functioning of a blood bank.
Opportunities
 Graduates have new job opportunities in government and non-government departments. Apart from this, candidates can also work in private hospitals or labs. At present, there is a scarcity in the medical lab market and large companies such as Dr. Path Lab and Ranbaxy have opened their labs in every city, which have a lot of demand in the blood bank department. 
 Based on experience, one can become a research and blood bank specialist, where one can get initial salary from ₹ 10,000 to ₹15,000. But on the basis of experience, the salary increases. One can also set up labs, or work in private lab.

Anybody can teach? ","Few weeks ago, I read of a government servant, in Uttar Pradesh, holding a senior position, going to teach at a government school each Saturday. The newspaper article, of course, was highly appreciative of the ‘noble’ deed and how it would benefit the school. It also encouraged others to take up similar action. 
The article reminded me of a summer vacation, during school days in Gujarat, when we were supposed to teach the alphabet (or was it numbers or both) to underprivileged children. We were also given a book for this. But, neither I nor my friends ‘did’ anything on this front. We had no idea what to do.
Strangely, even schools display this behaviour. Last week, while reading a book on ‘schools that educate differently’ I got to know of one in West Bengal which used to send 150 students, each week, to the villages. This was to ‘reach out to the underprivileged students in the villages’. I had a series of questions including: Why are all students in villages underprivileged? Did the students in villages teach the city students farming or cattle-rearing? 
Not up to the mark
In most cases, where it is assumed that the task is so easy that anyone can take it up, either the task ends up not being taken up at all or is taken up in a manner that is way below the optimal. One parallel that comes to mind is that of wildlife conservation organisations’ approach to nature education. When it concerns difficult activities such as research and monitoring, they look for specifically trained people. However, when it comes to a simple activity like nature education, they convey the message that anyone can take it up. In the end, few organisations, if at all, end up carrying out nature education in a manner that matters. 
On the one hand, schools and other education institutions are struggling to get good teachers and facilitators to meet the needs of the day. They are increasingly investing more in the existing people so as to enable them to deliver better. These include efforts not only towards ‘content and pedagogy’ but also touch upon areas of ‘motivation and personal conduct’. While on the other hand we have this belief that anybody can teach. 
So, what leads to this belief? Is it the arrogance of the urban over rural or that of the affluent over the deprived? In other words, of those speaking and writing English over those more familiar and comfortable in the vernacular. Does this depict the position in which we hold our teachers or a power position that we, adults, hold vis-a-vis the children? Is it about priorities? 
Or is this just how we address our craving to ‘do good’? But, we do not appear to be in a rush to become drivers or doctors for one day a week. So, is teaching perceived to be easy and hence the only area where we exhibit this behaviour? 
Flexibility and change are welcome in the classrooms, but a potter teaching pottery is different from a banker working in a city (consuming resources like city dwellers do) and then going to teach nature education at a village school. While the potter may end up acquainting students with a craft, the city-bred individual may end up meeting only his (or her) needs and not that of the students. 
Coming back to the government servant, I wondered if she felt the need to get familiar with the school, its teachers and students and their needs before teaching. Did she plan with teachers and the principal and check on other aspects which mattered. This ‘other aspects’ can be a long list in itself. With all the good intent, was she adding value to the school’s functioning or disturbing the schedule? What is the message that she is giving? That anybody can teach?

In the times of VR ","In 1990, the box office watermark “Matrix” and its 360° pans, slow-mo bullet trajectories, left audiences gobsmacked, and the iconic visuals lingered in geek memories for years. This film set a benchmark for virtual reality (VR)in the entertainment world, and since then, technology has taken a dimensional shift from the regular to the out-of-the-box. 
VR has been extensively employed in the gaming industry. Its foray into education is relatively new and yet to prove its potential. However, it has the potential to revolutionise learning, retention and content delivery exponentially. One can learn to play musical instruments, fix a computer, and draw a painting in the virtual world. It is true that some gifted teachers have made classroom experiences unforgettable and met teaching outcomes outstandingly. 
High-impact learning
With VR, students feel that they are in a different place, doing something hands-on. It enables a high impact learning experience and helps them engage more with the content, besides giving them the space for exploration, and trial and error. They learn through constant simulation that helps them apply their knowledge faster, think quicker and experience real-life situations. 
VR has the potential to render physical tools and equipment, and place them in the hands of a student at no extra cost. Witnessing atomic collisions inside CERN’s Large Hadron Collider slowed down and virtualised to understand the action of electromagnetic forces might have sounded like science fiction 20 years ago. But today, virtual reality has changed the face of chemistry labs, engineering workshops and physics classrooms, altogether. Micro learning using VR can enhance learning practice and help students get first-hand experiences of different environments and retain what they learn, longer than usual.
Enhanced visual thinking
The capacity to create involved ecosystems enables the teacher to deliver knowledge in a more relatable and vivid manner than words. VR opens doors to the visual possibilities that students can access, explore or interact with. This makes understanding any new concept more natural and think on-their-feet. The other most important aspect of VR in a classroom is the instant emotional reaction of the students in various situations. It allows for the facilitator to monitor how students are responding to the learning and measure how immersive their learning is. 
Map individual learning 
VR-enabled classrooms allow real-time assessment of students with different capacities. There will always be students with different rates of lesson absorption, retention and ability for application. Checkpoints can be built into programmes that instantly test understanding, and learning pathways can be personalised to assess previously learned concepts upon which advanced lessons are based. 
 Access
Stephen Hawking will not be remembered as the only person who could tap virtual encyclopaedias on a wheelchair. VR can provide a platform for the differently-abled student. They can become a part of any classroom merely with the addition of a headset. VR can empower every learner with the tools to fulfil potential. 
In India, over seven million children are yet to be enrolled for elementary education, over 20% students drop out of schools and colleges after secondary education due to non-availability of educational establishments in rural areas. VR can change the way education is served in remote areas. A universal classroom can become a reality. Students can become a part of global education systems and instantly access latest breakthroughs in knowledge, practice and technology. 
No threat
It is important to understand that it would be incorrect to assume that VR is a threat to mainstream teaching jobs. In truth, VR is not designed as a substitute for the teacher but as a supplement. With it, teaching does not need to take a back seat, nor should it take place in a completely rendered, virtual environment. Augmented reality will allow teachers, trainers, facilitators and institutions the option to insert the digitally rendered VR elements and graphics into the real world to help students attain learning goals more efficiently. 
Industry 4.0 ready
Technology is changing industries at a pace that it must be constantly monitored, analysed and upgraded. For this task, experience and problem-solving skills are needed from the get-go. VR allows learners to obtain this proficiency in controlled and simulated settings. Students learning in virtual reality, and using its associated supplies, will become acclimatised to a new, innovative culture and be ready to embrace the possibilities of similar emerging technologies as they arrive. Virtual reality will help nurture creativity and critical thinking in students and help them become job- ready in the dynamically-challenged organisations of Industry 4.0.

Empowering the differently-abled
","



 Uniforms and text books are different from what our focus should be on. The priority should be to motivate students to attend schools and provide amenities such as washrooms and lifts. These reimbursements become meaningless without such facilities. One ought to check the number of schools which are friendly toward differently-abled kids and work accordingly. 




Education is the real need of the specially-abled, and not compassion or pity. This is a welcome move by the government. For the country’s holistic development it is important that every section of the society is empowered, and education is the best means to provide empowerment. Easy access to education will certainly help improve the condition of people with special abilities.




The government should ensure that the rights of the specially-challenged are assured. A sheer one percent of all disabled children are able to attend school. The reimbursement of books, uniform and transport will be a step towards progress. This will boost the admission of children with disabilities from this academic session, which will improve the current scenario.




While this seems to be a good move on the part of the government, it should take into consideration the other important aspects of the difficulties of differently-abled students. The government must make a holistic plan which must include proper infrastructure and special teaching amenities. This step will work as a stepping stone towards the welfare of the specially-abled.

Fabricating a career ","Having studied subjects such as electronic devices, digital design, microelectronic circuits, and microprocessors in my second year, I developed an interest in experiencing the fabrication of chips. My first stint with very-large-scale integration (VLSI) began when I got an internship at the Semi-Conductor Laboratory (SCL), Department of Space, Government of India. SCL is engaged in the research and development in the area of microelectronics and has developed a number of key very large-scale integrated circuit (VLSICs), a majority of which are Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) for high-reliability applications in industrial, defence, and space sectors, under this programme.
We were assigned a project titled Development of USB Interfacing using PIC microcontroller for data acquisition in the VLSI Testing Division (VTD). First, we were taken for a tour of VTD Division. We were asked to wear a coat before entering the testing area. We then entered a chamber where we were blasted with high-speed air from all directions, so as to remove any dust particles on the coat. The testing area is known as ‘clean room’, having a class of 10,000 (a parameter used to measure the number of dust particles per cubic foot of air). There, we found many machines placed sequentially, including two huge testers, a temperature-pressure calibrator, and many PCs.
On field
As a part of my project, I needed to study about the functioning of USB module associated with the PIC18F67J50 micro controller. A part of my project was already done by my seniors, so, I had to first study their work to complete the project. Starting with the study of data-sheet of PIC18F67J50 micro controller, I studied different processes including USB protocol, different types of descriptors, oscillator settings, and enumeration process. Side-by-side, I wrote codes in C programming language so as to implement the knowledge gained through the studies. I was working alongside learned technicians and scientists who helped me at every stage.
As our project advanced, I started developing an interest in SCL’s work culture. There were many presentations and demonstrations from students, employees, and people from other companies who came from India as well as abroad, to market their products. The dedication with which people worked at SCL motivated me. We were also given a tour of VLSI fabrication lab where all the ASICs and Micro Electro Mechanical Systems (MEMS) were fabricated. The main fabrication area was a clean room of class 10 which meant that there were less than 10 dust particles per cubic foot of air. So, we had to wear special shoes, coats, and masks before entering the area, as even a single dust particle could produce an error in the chip. 
As the last week of my internship neared, I focused more on developing reports and preparing for the final presentation. By this time, I had gained a lot of information about the working of industries and the work culture.

Take the wheel
","Can you believe 2018 is almost over? You read about the umpteen celebrity weddings that took place and it feels like this was the longest year yet; then you think back to your life and it feels like time went by in a flash.
Lately, I have been reflecting on how I spend my time and what I have to show for it. I realise that, looking back at the past week, past month or even the past year (no “Friends” reference intended), life has moved in autopilot. Work, eat, sleep, repeat. The same routine day in and day out, with slightly more emphasis paid on the “eat and sleep” part during the festival season. We are now in December and I have found myself hard-pressed to recall any new skills I have learned, any new opinions I have formed on things that matter, or an activity I’ve done that made a positive difference to someone. When did life get so stagnant?
Silver lining 
On the bright side, if December is here, that means 2019 is around the corner; and what better way to ring in the new year, than by crafting an ambitious set of resolutions that one may or may not (let’s get real, it is most likely may not) follow! If you are stuck in the same rut that I am, consider the following things with me to get your resolutions to stick:
1. Don’t be too harsh on yourself: This is pretty important. No point in crying over spilled coffee. You can have a brand new start to your life any day that you choose. So what if this wasn’t a year of spectacular triumphs for you? Take the bull by the horns and show it who’s boss. In December 2019, the movie poster about your life will say “Running Successfully: 365 days. Raging super hit!”
2. Start small: If you can summon the enthusiasm to make giant leaps in changing your life, then more power to you. However, if you are having starting trouble, why not start small? In my case, I finally downloaded a fitness tracking app to see how active I am through the day. The results have frightened me sufficiently into increasing my step count, and this in turn is the first step towards my healthier avatar.
3. Figure out where your time goes: This takes a bit of discipline but is a rewarding effort. Start by putting down what you want to accomplish for the next 10 days. Then, keep track of what you are doing with your time, the kind of activities you do and so on. At the end of the 10 days, compare your goals to your analysis of your time. Did you achieve what you set out to do? What kind of activities hogged the most space? What do you need to start deprioritising in order to make room for something more important? Then, run the same activity again for the next 10 days, this time making an effort to incorporate the changes to your schedule, and review your results.
Turning off autopilot mode and taking control is one of the hardest things to do because you are already comfortably ensconced in a set routine, but once you take the plunge, you will be glad you did.

Highly-rated option
","It is placement season once again and newspapers talk about the usual suspects hiring in large numbers from colleges. 
However, quite a few of you are tired of the generic careers that get foisted on the unsuspecting among us. In today’s column, let us explore an interesting and impactful career for those of you wanting to blaze a trail. Let us talk about the career options open to you as a credit analyst. 
I can see the questions coming from you thick and fast — Who is a credit analyst and what does he/she do? Why is that an impactful role?
Credit influencer 
A couple of months back, we learnt about the IL&FS fiasco. IL&FS had cooked their books and defaulted on the interest and principal repayments on some of their borrowings. 
But how were they lent such large sums of money in the first place? You see, without a process in place, lending and investment decisions cannot be successfully carried out in a financial services company.
Say, you are an institutional lender such as SBI or an investor like ICICI Prudential mutual fund. Such institutions have systems and processes in place to make sure that mistakes do not happen. Even so, every now and then we have rogue cases like the IL& FS. For now, let us just focus on the process. 
There are organisations called credit rating agencies, which as their name suggests “rate” the credit worthiness of the corporate borrowers. 
So, if you are a corporate borrower, it is in your interest to get yourself rated (more specifically, the debt securities that you issue). 
This is like a third party expressing an opinion on the credit worthiness of a borrower. In theory, the rating process is supposed to be methodical and transparent. In such a scenario, it makes life a lot easier for the borrowers and the lenders. 
The rating opinion by the rating agencies heavily influence the rate of interest that is charged for a borrower and more importantly whether he gets to borrow at all in the first place.
The rating agencies employ “credit analysts” whose job it is to analyse the industry developments of the borrower, study the financial statements of the borrower and ultimately give out a rating opinion to the rating committee which approves or rejects the rating opinion. 
Such work is highly analytical in nature and is ideal for folks who are interested in how businesses work along with a flair for financial accounting and general numeracy. This is a solid intellectual career for engineers with MBA or chartered accountants. It is a highly responsible job with numerous career paths if you are really good.
Some of the top rating agencies in India are CRISIL, ICRA and CARE.
So, if you are someone comfortable with numbers and are looking for a meaningful career then this is an interesting choice to explore.

It’s festive season
","What is the difference in meaning between ‘disburse’ and ‘disperse’? (Janani, Chennai) 
The stress in both words is on the second syllable; it rhymes with ‘curse’, ‘purse’ and ‘nurse’. ‘Disperse’ is normally used to mean to scatter or spread something over a wide area. It can also suggest that the thing being scattered is going in different directions. Things (clouds, seeds, and so on), as well as people, can be dispersed. ‘Disburse’, on the other hand, is mostly used in the context of money. When someone ‘disburses’ money, he is distributing it; he is paying someone. The word comes from the French ‘desbourser’ meaning to spend or ‘take money from the purse’. ‘Bourse’ means ‘purse’, and this perhaps explains why the treasurer of a college is usually called a ‘bursar’. He is the ‘bursarius’ or ‘purse bearer’ — someone who has access to the money. 
The police managed to disperse the unruly mob of students in ten minutes.
The funds for the project will be disbursed sometime next week.
How is the word ‘fete’ pronounced? (Sharoon, Bengaluru) 
Whether the word is used as a noun or a verb, most people pronounce it like the word ‘fate’. This is the standard pronunciation. In American English, however, some people make it rhyme with ‘set’, ‘pet’ and ‘get’. ‘Fete’ comes from the Old French ‘feste’ meaning ‘feast, celebration’. When used as a noun, it refers to an outdoor public event. These events are usually held to raise money for a charity. To ensure that the people who come to these events have a good time, the organisers have lots of food and refreshments on sale; they may also provide entertainment. In American English, any form of outdoor celebration is called ‘fete’. When used as a verb, ‘fete’ means to honour or praise someone publicly for their achievements. 
The author was surprised when the members of the media decided to fete him.
The church fete is tomorrow. Will you be coming?
What is the meaning and origin of ‘beware of Greeks bearing gifts’? (R. Uma, Tiruchi) 
This is a translation of a Latin expression that first appeared in Virgil’s ‘Aeneid’. When the invading Greeks find that they cannot conquer the city of Troy, they resort to trickery. They build a huge wooden horse and leave it near the city. The Trojans, believing that the horse is a peace offering, decide to drag it into the city of Troy. But a few among them caution the King that the Greeks are not to be trusted — that a wiser course of action would be to set the wooden horse on fire. Common sense does not prevail and the huge animal is dragged into the city of Troy amid wild celebrations. At night, the Greek soldiers hiding inside the horse slip out and open the gates; making it easy for the rest of the soldiers to enter Troy and capture the city. The expression, ‘beware of Greeks bearing gifts’ is mostly used to caution or warn someone that the enemy is not to be trusted. If the enemy is suddenly nice to you, do not trust him — you should become suspicious, instead. Like the Greeks, the enemy may have an ulterior motive. 
When I told my brother that my rival has been extremely nice to me all of a sudden, he said, ‘Beware of Greeks bearing gifts’.

Research connect

It is not unheard of when foreign universities look towards India to collaborate for future work, giving ample opportunities to students. Over the recent years, Britain’s Coventry University has been working towards developing and establishing its research partnerships with Indian universities and research centres.
A delegation from the university, led by Professor Richard Dashwood, deputy vice-chancellor of research, was recently in Chennai to promote the identification and growth of partnerships in all areas of the university’s research enterprise and innovation interest. These include business, engineering, computing, health, life sciences, arts and humanities projects.
“The university is trying to focus on building links with like-minded universities in India, which equip students for the world of work, not just focusing on academic excellence but also the transferable skills that are needed in the work place,” says Professor Dashwood. “It is also about research with a purpose — not to carry out just any research, but to ensure that there is a ‘customer’ for the research that is conducted.”
Collaboration
“We are starting with five areas that our governments have identified as priorities: smart cities, energy, water and food, future manufacturing, and cyber systems. The Government of India has identified its intention to encourage partnerships in areas related to manufacturing and transport, and we know there are many challenges for these topics in the country. Approaches to deliver affordable healthcare will be another major focus, and Coventry University has a history of engagement with India to address healthcare challenges,” he adds.
The university is also looking forward to working with industry partners. Healthcare is another key area in which the university wishes to focus on. According to professor Guy Daly, Pro-vice chancellor, Faculty of Health and Life Sciences, “There are a number of areas that need emphasis. One is in terms of health services where we are looking at innovations that can help improve health service provisions and health professions. Also, in terms of system leadership, how to get health systems to operate effectively. Third, in terms of health technologies which involve bringing different researchers from across various interdisciplinaries, not just health professionals but also those from as bio-tech, engineering, big data, artificial intelligence, and so on, working together.”
He adds, “We look forward to discovering how we can work with India leading universities and other organisations, both to collaborate in cutting-edge research and also to bring benefits to students and academics in both our countries.” The research is increasingly focused on those areas that deliver a global impact, as Coventry seeks to ensure that it distinguishes itself around its high quality level of international engagement. “We recruit many students from India, and other countries, but we also have a strong international research agenda,” continues Professor Daly. “We are committed to the internationalisation of our programmes and curriculum.”
Coventry University is to establish research partnerships with a group of Indian universities that have already expressed strong interest in collaborating. Just recently, the university had finalised an arrangement with the Institute of Chartered Accounts of India (ICAI) to launch a range of progression routes for the members; to allow them to complete the MBA (Global Financial Services) degree course from the university.
“We recognise the size and importance of India and we see our proposed activities as mutually beneficial. Coventry is investing significantly in all areas of research to enhance its international impact, and research cooperation within Indian researchers will help to ensure that we deliver global relevance through our programmes,” says Professor Dashwood.
The university is also keen to develop different forms of joint supervision for Ph.D students and is welcoming communications from Indian research universities and staff interested in collaborating together. The university has many new research areas it will be investing in, over the coming years. The activities are mainly transdisciplinary and ensure relevance and applicability of research towards solving current and emerging challenges that researchers face. “One of the things we have already launched is a scholarship programme for postdoctoral research. So, with our partners, we will have joint supervised Ph.Ds where they will spend time in both countries,” says Professor Dashwood. They also aim to bring innovations in teaching, promote the global mobility of their students and improve the prospects for long-term employability.

On the cutting edge
","Neuromorphic Engineering, a field that takes its inspiration from biological processes, especially of the human nervous system, and has its roots in physics, mathematics and engineering, is an emerging area for science students who wish to work in the cutting edge areas of technology. The scope of the subject is only highlighted with significant number of countries and giant corporates such as Intel, IBM, Qualcomm and Samsung setting up teams to work on neuromorphic systems in the last couple of years.
Speaking about the relevance of the field in the present scenario, Andre Van Schaik, Director, International Centre for Neuromorphic Systems (CNS), Western Sydney University (WSU), Australia said, “performance of devices which was hitherto being enhanced by increasing the number of transistors, is now witnessing a dead-end as we have reached a point where we are forced to think of newer means to improve it. Neuromorphic engineering can address this problem effectively as it can help receive accurate data, cut down the number of steps in processing and then revert it quickly in the same form.” Professor Andre Van Schaik was in Bangalore recently to sign a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore. According to him, neuromorphic engineering is about equipping a device to sense the environment, process information and make decisions similar to the neurons of human brain.
For effective automation and scaling up, he said, “it is necessary that technology makes sense of complex human thought process and behaviour. Neuromorphic engineering aims at mimicking the working of the nervous system by creating a similar architecture artificially.”
The MOU between CNS, WSU and IISc enables students from both institutions to seek co-operation from each other with regard to the study of neuromorphic engineering. If three Master’s students get to do their final project for a period of six months at WSU, three Ph.D candidates from IISc can spend about 12 months in WSU completing their thesis under the joint supervision of professors from both India and Australia. “Apart from this, one master’s graduate from IISc will get a grant to do her/his PhD with us for the full period,” informed Schaik. An International scientific symposium on neuromorphic engineering will also be co-organised and hosted by IISc next year in furtherance of this collaboration. The student exchange programme will begin from January 2018.

 Teaching through games would be a good decision to innovate the classroom experience for students. These techniques are already popular in countries like Japan and the U.S. They could also be successful in Indian education following the current trend where outdated rot learning does not help the students in the long run.

Paras Rajput, Graduate, BCA, IP University, Dwarka
 In gaming, the most important aspect that students learn is perseverance and acceptance of failure only to do better. Learning through games may become an efficient step in making students learn to deal with everyday hurdles and mental stress. This can also become a way to deal with the rising problems of suicide among students due to failure.

 While most of the technologies are transforming education into a fun mode of learning, it is also depleting the physical activities and practical ways of learning in day to day life. Completely focusing their attention on screens in an early age of schooling might become a problem. Therefore, efforts should be made to come up with a more balanced schooling system.

Anirudh Goel, III, Environmental Engineering, DTU, New Delhi
 It will help to revolutionise the learning and classroom experience. As per a research, playing video games can change the brain regions responsible for attention and visuospatial skills and make them more efficient. This in turn induces an environment of competition and enhances productivity transforming the scenario of a burden free classroom, prioritising knowledge and skills.

The math way of life ","Being a mathematics and physics teacher, I have had the privilege of interacting with thousands of parents and students from diverse backgrounds. Also, being a part of one of the world’s largest education companies, I have also had the opportunity of interacting with some of the finest educators from around the world. 
In all of these conversations, a question I am asked often is why, despite a rich ancient mathematics culture, India does not produce great mathematicians. Is it a reflection of the quality of math education in the country? Does it demonstrate a common aptitude amongst Indians? Is there a ‘gene’ that determines whether you excel in this subject or not? Well, I have a slightly different way of looking at it and I believe there is no better time to share this than with the National Mathematics Day around the corner on December 22.
Being good at math versus being a good mathematician are two very different things. A mathematician is someone who is a specialist or an expert and is most likely pursuing research in this field. Being ‘good at math’, however, can be evaluated in various ways.
Everyday use
What is math at the core? It is merely a way of thinking. It is a universal language and the omnipresence of numbers makes it an integral part of our very existence. Be it calculating the distance to work or assessing the amount of weekly groceries, math is a part of our everyday decisions. According to me, your way of approaching problems analytically and logically determines how good you are in the subject.
If your way of thinking is logical, you can apply it to problems you face across computer science, coding, business, investing etc; research mathematics is not the only way to demonstrate our mathematical strength. Formal education and degrees aside, I strongly believe that conceptual clarity in math along with strong fundamentals can help students excel in any field.
Tackling the fear 
While the importance of math is uncontested, I see a common aversion to this subject across students of all age groups, especially young adults. Traditionally, maths has been taught in an abstract manner which makes it one of the ‘most feared’ subjects. Understanding and exploring math concepts is still driven by the fear of exams instead of the love for the subject. In fact, the fear of maths continues to live through most of our adult lives too.
In my teaching experience, though, I have not come across children who are unable to do math if you teach them the right way. The reality is that all kids are smart and it is our responsibility to identify what they are smart at and leverage that to teach them. For example, some students struggle to remember formulae. If you try to make them memorise it, they will never be able to perform well. However, the same child could be great at visualising things. Taking them through the same concepts visually — through a video or by taking them outdoors, and you will see they are able to grasp the idea easily. For all parents and teachers, the focus should be on explaining concepts using multiple formats because the reality is that different kids learn in different ways, and we should stop trying to fit them in the same mould.
It is also critical that we change our attitude towards mistakes. Take an example of your favourite video game — you don’t always finish it in one go. Yet, you don’t stop trying. That is because, instead of telling you that you are ‘bad’ at it, you are instantly given the option to try again. That is how math learning should be. Criticising mistakes and errors creates life-long inhibitions that prevent the child from trying again. Mistakes are not failures, and if treated right, there is no reason the child will not give his best in grasping the subject once again.
The biggest disservice we can do to our children and students is letting them believe they are ‘weak’ or ‘incapable’. Children, from their formative years, should be taught to understand and experience the ‘intellectual adventure’ that mathematics can offer them. Problem-solving is the heart of mathematics and learning this as a life-skill has long-term positive consequences which the students will cherish for life.

National Mathematics Day is observed on December 22.

Data analysis at Barclays
","I interned with Barclays for two months as a part of my summer internship. I cracked this opportunity through on-campus recruitment; it was one of the rigorous selection processes of four rounds. Working for a big brand like Barclays, at the start of my career, seemed surreal. 
It was primarily a workforce analytics project aimed at improving the net promoter score for the business and also to improve its employee performance. HR analytics is a relatively new phenomenon. So, the experience was quite challenging. There was a lot of self-learning that I had to do, but, in the end, the deliverables were appreciated by the Director (Operations), Vikas Anand, which was encouraging.
Exploring new domains
The final review of my internship is something I will cherish all my life. That was the day when all my hard work was acknowledged and appreciated by the senior management in the company. I had got an outstanding rating for my project which was very heartening and motivating. 
My project involved a lot of data analysis where I had to learn and work on tools such as R and SPSS, use techniques such as regression and factor analysis to provide them with data-driven recommendations to improve their NPS scores and employee performance. It also involved secondary research and usage of survey techniques to zero-in on the problem statement. With help from my mentors and other seniors, I was able to understand the processes of the business, the business model, the performance evaluation metrics and the kind of impact they had on the employee satisfaction.
This opportunity helped me explore new domains and assess myself in a profound way. The pace at which the technology and innovation are emerging today, one cannot afford to stay ignorant of these developments. Post my internship the comfort I had developed with these tools helped me learn more during my analytical courses in my second year of MBA. 
My experience at Barclays was enriching. I had the opportunity to interact with veterans and who were so motivated. It was also a great leverage for me in my campus placement interviews where I could justify my analytical and deductive reasoning capabilities by narrating my project outcomes.

Of literary experiences ","Studying 19th century French literature in one of the friendliest cities I have ever lived in, is proving to be exciting and rewarding. I am a PhD student in the School of Languages and Cultures at the University of Sheffield, studying the fictive works present in French novelist and playwright Balzac’s La Comédie humaine (a collection of around a 100 novels and short stories). These ‘works inside works’ are created by the characters of Balzac, and belong to a variety of domains (literature, philosophy, painting, music, science, law, and so on.), and exist in the texts as fragments
Having been obsessed with the works of Balzac for as long as I can remember, I learnt the language so I could read the works in original French. I studied in Sheffield for a semester during my master’s degree and I was impressed by the university infrastructure and the library services. My supervisor, Maxime Goergen, helped me focus my interest in the works of Balzac and guided me in developing a formal proposal for my research.
Plan ahead
For those considering a Ph.D, be clear about your area of interest so that you can approach the right people. Send your proposals well in advance to the academic staff who specialise in your field, with a description of their published research and research interests. Scholarship deadlines are always different from the programme application deadlines. So, it is imperative to plan in advance.
I find Sheffield to be a perfect mix of competence, innovation, and tradition with ample opportunities to grow and learn in an atmosphere where originality and critical thinking are appreciated and encouraged.
At my first ever academic conference, I had the privilege of presenting a paper on Balzac at the SDN (Society of Dix-Neuvièmistes) annual conference — one of the most prestigious academic clusters in my field of research. I shall also be presenting my research at Balzac’s house in Paris this month.
I enjoy the busy life in the school with interesting conferences and talks, almost every week. Postgrads are encouraged to participate in academic events not just in Sheffield, but in other universities in the U.K. and overseas as well.

Robotic puppeteer ","Not all things traditional are boring. Some, in fact, are downright interesting, especially when it involves the age-old tradition of storytelling with puppets and music. Now, mix tradition with today’s uber-cool technological advancements, and what you have is best of both worlds. 
Meet Jamoora, a music-interpreting robot designed by Varnit Jain and Anant Sharma, students from the Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology, Delhi (IIIT-Delhi), and faculty, Aman Parnami. The robot is named after jamoora or jamura, a performer who plays a specific type of sidekick role — one who demonstrates unquestioning obedience to the master's directives — in the traditional folk theatre.
The bot can be controlled using music and voice commands, instead of the usual manual command. “Our premise was to use robots that can be controlled without using hands. In the context of Indian puppetry, which is unique to our culture, there is usually an individual controlling the puppet and two or three others playing the music. But, what if there is just one person? How can he or she manage all aspects of storytelling, puppets, and music? With the help of this puppet, we play live music and narrate a story, and the robot emotes accordingly,” says Varnit.
Professor Aman Parnami elaborates on how the idea came to be. “At Weave Lab, our mission is to ‘weave interactivity into everyday objects and experiences’, and the call for participation in the Student Innovation contest to be held during the 31st ACM User Interface Software and Technology conference aligned with our mission. With the excitement to participate in this conference, I began looking for students, and couldn’t have chosen better people than Anant, a vocalist and musician, and Varnit, a programming expert, who were already working with me on other projects. We held several brainstorming sessions and ultimately zeroed-in on one idea that we all loved. Thus, Jamoora came to be,” he explains. 
USP
“We are using voice commands for explicit control of the actions of the robot, and music is used to express the way the action is to be executed,” explains Anant. He elaborates on how there is a direct analogy with dance, where the act of dance can be triggered by someone instructing people to dance. However, the movements and the intensity are driven by the music being played. “We use this concept by incorporating Indian classical music for music detection,” he adds. “The robot can be programmed to perform many functions. Raga detection can also be programmed, and can be improved to include western scales as well. This can be used as a tool kit for kids to create and perform their own stories. We often think of creative stories as children, but do not have a good means to express them.”
Functions
The robot is made for puppetry. The functions that can be performed by the robot are open-ended, depending on the performer. However, the hardware demo that the team created could make the robot perform actions like lifting objects, walking, running, and filling a vessel with stones to make water available for drinking.
Anant explains how the working of the robot will help in recognising the potential of inclusion of multiple functionalities in it. “Jamoora communicates through our laptop, where the processing happens. The laptop receives two signals, an audio signal from a keyboard/harmonium and a speech signal through the microphone of the laptop. The madari gives commands to Jamoora using keywords woven into a script. The way Jamoora executes these actions is controlled by the Hindustani classical music played with his command. We used the speech recognition library in Python which uses Google Speech API to detect the speech. Jamoora looks for the keywords in the detected sentence and executes the actions accordingly.”
Consequently, he adds, the audio signals received from the keyboard is processed in SuperCollider and sent to Python, where their algorithms detect the Hindustani classical raga based on the notes, and identifies the corresponding emoptions. For instance: 
Happy - Desh
Gloomy - Jaunpuriya
Angry - Shree
Serious - Kaafi
“Jamoora, now has information about the action and the way the action needs to be executed. The parameters of the movement are now changed according to the action to be executed and the emotion detected,” says Anant.
Benefits
 Jamoora, in its current form, is an excellent example of the fusion of technology with more human aspects of such as music and storytelling, believes, professor Parnami. “That is why we have been exploring other applications in the domains of entertainment and education technology. For entertainment, we are looking at it as a toy or a controller for smart home applications, whereas for education, we are viewing it as a tool to teach children about music, robotics, and storytelling. We are also open to other uses of our concept. Since music is an input to the system, a therapeutic use of it will be more of a side-effect rather than the direct purpose. However, if puppetry has an overall positive effect on patients, the bot will be suitable.”

A solution mindset? What’s that?
","The organisation I work in, recently conducted a conference for which planning had started more than six months ago. Thanks to impeccable attention to detail and early discussions, it was a success. Not that there weren’t challenges, but we had a bunch of people with ‘solution mind-sets’ who solved them for us. 
Life comes with its share of problems — at work and at home. But, the key to dealing with them is to look for solutions that work, and help us overcome these problems. Sometimes, it may not be a perfect solution, but it may help us tide over a tough situation. And that is where a ‘solution mind-set’ — an attitude that always focuses on solving problems, rather than getting stuck when challenges arise — is rather handy. Of course, I am not referring to anything or anyone who is unrealistic and may propose impractical solutions, but to people with practical ideas. 
We before ‘I’
I have a particular colleague in mind when I write this. It has always been a joy to work with him because of his exemplary positivity and solution-powered thinking. Whenever any problem crops up, even under the heaviest pressure, he is cool, calm, collected and always smiling. Whenever I have approached him with a request or a challenge, his response has always been, “We will take care of it… don’t worry.” And these are never empty words or promises. He always follows this up with a resolute action which reassures me every single time. He even inspires me to think of the brighter side of things. Such an attitude not only helps you to seek solutions, but also helps the people around you. 
This quality or skill is especially relevant today when communications, relationships, and all sorts of interactions are becoming increasingly infused with technological advancements. Experiences are becoming dehumanised, automated and programmed. A solution mind-set, combined with positive thinking, enhances relationships, inspires human beings and truly makes a difference to another individual. Such an attitude has the power to turn even the dullest day into a pleasant one. 
This is why we need to cultivate this skill consciously and proactively, to improve experiences and relationships at work and in life. While it is imperative to develop and demonstrate analytical skills, logical reasoning and critical thinking, we need teams that excel in finding solutions and positivity as well. 
When things go wrong at work, we need cool, calm minds that help all of us focus on finding solutions rather than people who will pull us further down. Of course, post mortems are required once the crisis has passed. 
Perhaps management schools and corporate training departments will do well to include a module or course in solution mind-set and positivity. As the year comes to a close, it is time to start nurturing this skill which will always be in vogue. With more individuals like my colleague, we can achieve more in the New Year and years to come.

Shift in perspective
","Remember the iPod shuffle? The basic edition of the first generation of the digital music player was designed to carry up to 240 songs and play them in random order — each time you turned it on, it would “shuffle” the collection, so you wouldn’t know what would play next. While some might think of this as a disadvantage (after all, many of us like the sense of an orderly playlist that you can control), the company turned this into a quirky feature: “life is random!” went the ad, proclaiming randomness as something special — and something essential.
It is a point that often comes up in software design — is something a bug or a feature? In fact, the magazine Wired recently discussed the source of this idea and its frequent misuse to the point of becoming an apology for shoddy work. But (as even Wired acknowledges), there is some value to considering whether a bug could be turned into a feature. When does a “quirk” cease to be bothersome and become instead, a valuable characteristic? When does an apparent defect end up becoming a source of value? A skilled carpenter will work around the nuances of the grain, in a piece of wood, in such a way that it becomes an intrinsic part of the design of whatever it is he is making. Tailors add embroidery and lace to ordinary seams and turn them into highlights.
Gain perspectives
To turn a possible disadvantage into an advantage calls for a shift in perspective. It means looking at something with an analytical eye, trying to understand elements of it that are unchangeable and seeing how you can work with them, instead of wasting time trying to change or rectify them. It means, going beyond the tired cliché of “what cannot be cured must be endured”. Of course, to begin with, one must see whether indeed it is a simple error that can be fixed. For instance, is what appears to be a blemish on the wood simply something that is external to it, which can be cleaned up, or is it part of the wood’s natural colouring? The first instance represents something that can possibly be cleaned up, while the second can be seen as adding to the natural beauty of the material.
There is a lesson in here somewhere for the way we live our lives and think about ourselves and the things we do. What, in fact, is a “flaw”? What can be considered an error that can be fixed? And what is just an element or an aspect of something? Can recognising and understanding the so-called flaw open up a new way of looking at the task or the product? Does it lead us into a different space of discovery or action? Sportspersons who understand their bodies well also know how to not only adjust for (what might be considered) physical shortcomings but use those very characteristics in strategic ways. This is also the kind of thinking that has motivated the disability movement, where an individual’s perceived weakness (or impairment) is instead framed as a special ability.
Even when the “bug” is not something intrinsic to the material but has emerged as an element in the product or outcome, it is possible to recast it as a feature — much like the randomness that became a special feature of the iPod Shuffle.

Retain teachers, not their certificates
","Recently, there were reports in the mainstream media that a young assistant professor who worked in a private college in Tamil Nadu committed suicide after the college allegedly allegedly refused to return his academic certificates that were retained by the college authorities at the time of his joining the institution. The sad news shook the conscience of those in academia who resorted to social media to discuss the legal and ethical aspects of private educational institutions withholding certificates. It is learnt that a few of them even wrote to the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) highlighting the problems encountered by employees who struggle to get their certificates back when they need to move to a better job. The impact is that now the AICTE has issued a public notice stating that it is illegal and unethical to withhold employees’ certificates. It has even issued a warning that it would withdraw the approval given to the colleges that flout the rule.
Violating rules
Most private educational institutions (schools, technical institutes, colleges, deemed-to-be universities, and so on.) retain their staff’s academic certificates at the time of issuing employment contracts to them. Some institutions collect all the certificates including mark sheets and retain them, making it really hard for the staff to apply for any other job during the academic year. It is true employees have a tough time recovering their certificates from their employers in many educational institutions, when they decide to quit their jobs. Many have to forego their better prospects as they are not able to recover their documents in time.
Is this problem unique in India? Yes, it seems to be. I worked abroad for five years. At the time of recruitment, my certificates were verified by the Educational Consultants India Ltd (EdCIL), Noida and during my service at the Kigali Institute of Science, Technology and Management, Rwanda, my academic certificates were quite safe at home in India. There were over 50 expatriates at the Institute and there was not a single case of anyone quitting the job without proper notice.
Indians who run educational institutions in Gulf countries retain all the original documents including the passports of expatriate staff. I have heard numerous tragic stories of Indian expatriates working in Indian schools who could not visit India when their presence at home very much needed. Isn’t withholding one’s passport a human rights violation? Yes, it is.
Is it a good practice to withhold teachers’ academic certificates and other original documents? Why do educational institutions indulge in such practices? I discussed this issue with some heads and administrators of some private educational institutions. A Principal of a well-known school said, “We retain the certificates of our staff only for security reasons. We do face problems when a teacher quits our school in the middle of an academic year. To prevent them from quitting we have to keep their original documents with us.” When I countered her with the question whether it would be difficult to find a replacement for anyone who resigned if the institution paid a competitive and decent pay to the staff and created a good working environment for them, she just flashed a smile. Yes, finding a suitable replacement is not at all difficult as there are many well-qualified and good teachers waiting for well-paid jobs.
Make changes
 Here is a different view. Another head of an educational institution said, “Teachers should not be treated as bonded labourers. Instead of keeping possession of any teacher’s original documents and certificates, educational institutions should issue employment contracts in which all terms and conditions are clearly specified. The contracts are signed by the employer and the employee and be honoured by both the parties.”
When teachers serving in government educational institutions and employees working in companies keep their original certificates with them, why shouldn’t those who work in private educational institutions be allowed to keep their original documents with them? The fact that there are some rare cases of teachers absconding should not make employers distrust every teacher. Academic certificates are the intellectual property of those who have received specific education after years of study and hard work. Therefore, the certificates should be with the owner and not with anyone else.
Employers can always state that they retain the certificates of employees with the latter’s consent. If there is a rule which specifies clearly that even with the consent of employees, employers should not keep possession of employees’ academic certificates, then employees will be safer. In the absence of such enforcement of laws, employees will have to be at the mercy of their employers.
Employers need not keep possession of any employee’s certificates for these reasons: i) Employees are at the receiving end because they have to get service certificates from the employer. At times, the employer serves as a referee when any employee quits the organisation and joins some other organisation. ii) If the employee has signed an employment contract s/he has to abide by the terms and conditions in the contract and legal action can be initiated by the employer against any employee who violates the contract. iii) No employee will dare to quit an organisation without proper notice because s/he has to get many other formalities completed before joining another organisation.
Retaining good teachers and not retaining the academic certificates of teachers should be the motto of educational institutions. Certificates are the intellectual property of those own them. Retaining the certificates of employees is akin to depriving them of their rights to own their property. It is true employees need jobs and at the same time employers need employees. Without employees, the word “employer” is meaningless. Both employers and employees are mutually dependent on each other. Employees need not be at the mercy of employers. Good employers make employees feel that they are co-workers and not servants. Therefore, they should have mutual trust and respect for each other.
Employers should be benevolent and happily bid farewell to any employee who decides to quit their job in order to move on to greener pastures. When will our educational institutions show such a gesture of goodwill?

Who says Facebook is a waste of time
","What if someone told you can make a living out of Facebook? Or that the more time you spend on various social networking sites, the richer you can get. Take for instance, the cases of Inderjit Vasudevan Moorthy, Karthi Sekar and Sorav Jain — a former TV producer, a gym owner and the third, an alumnus of Leeds University. They understood the influence of social media marketing and are now experts at it.
From multi-million dollar corporate companies to the store next door, it’s a tool everyone is investing in. Even celebrities and politicians hire professionals to make sure that their Twitter and Facebook pages are always abuzz. The job of the social media manager is not only to draw attention to their client’s social media profiles, but also keep visitors engaged with them. More importantly, ensure that the visitors return regularly.  These three men were like any other users of social media till they stumbled upon the business aspect of it. And now it gets them their bread and butter.

Sorav Jain, 27

Many of us may have forgotten Orkut, but Sorav owes his career to the site. “I started at 17 when I was a student at Loyola College. I used to work as a content writer and was learning about Search Engine Optimisation in an internet marketing agency. This area caught my fancy. Orkut was the first social networking site that I started with and I was an Orkut addict,” says Sorav, who joined a start-up after he returned from the U.K., where he studied international marketing management. “That was when I started blogging. The directors of a Spanish personal branding company approached me after reading my blog and asked me to join them on their board of directors.  I was too young to handle that and I gave them the option of outsourcing their needs to me. This inspired me to quit my first job and take the big leap,” says Sorav, who started Echovme, a digital marketing training and services firm. “I now employ 15 people and we have clients like Cashkaro.com, Apollo White Dental Care, Dr. Paul Multispecialty Hospital, Bosch India, Kay: The Fashion Bay and more. We also work for politicians and celebrities,” he says. He has also published a book titled Social Media for Business: Stories of Indian Brands that takes you through the social media journey from a business perspective.

Karthi Sekar, 40

Karthi was looking at opportunities to promote his gym and yoga studio when he discovered the potential of the social-media business. “My friends noticed the presence of my enterprises online and started asking me for tips. Soon I was helping them out,” says Karthi, who started Brand Width in 2011. He works out of Alwarpet and handles clients like Udhaiyam, KGS Developers and Kaizen.
According to him, the scope of online marketing is vast and each site reaches a specific group. He explains, “I was working for this NGO that required volunteers to work in rural areas. That entailed taking a break from their job to dedicate quality time in the villages. Most of the volunteers were foreigners, with very few Indians applying. I then decided to tap LinkedIn to get more volunteers. The strategy worked and we soon had the desired output,” says Karthi, who asserts that one has to always be on the lookout for opportunities and update knowledge to make social media a successful business proposition.

Inderjit Vasudevan Moorthy, 31

A high-school dropout, this entrepreneur never let that tag affect him. He worked as a producer with a TV production company. A regular on Facebook, he saw many people use the site as a medium to vent their ire about Chennai. He loves the city and decided to start a fan page. He started ‘I Love Chennai’. “I remember inviting two of my cousins, the next thing I knew I had more than 100 followers. I took the medium seriously. I started updating pictures, uploading articles celebrating the spirit of the city and uploading multimedia content. In no time, I had over 1,000 likes for the page. I started the page last May and by August I got my first sponsor. Our display picture had their logo,” says Inderjit.
That page is now called ‘My Chennai’ and now has 477,489 fans. He realised its impact and began exploring the social medium further. He came across the Chennai Traffic Police page on Facebook and noticed scope for improvement. “I met the (then) Additional Commissioner of Police (Traffic), Sanjay Arora, and told him about my plan to make the page more interactive. He was more than happy to help. Soon, a team was formed and we started reworking on the page,” he says. 
The page is one of the best maintained pages where people talk about their traffic woes, following which action is taken immediately. Now the page is completely managed by him. His company, Ikebana Consulting, now has a row of clients including the Sports Development Authority of Tamil Nadu and Chennai Metro Rail. He has a team of 11 that works for him. “I call this an industry still in its infancy. A lot more can be achieved because it connects people directly with their clients,” he says.

A rare treasure preserved
","When Varghese Angamaly (K.P. Varghese) got this book way back in 1985 the only thing that interested him was its antiquity.
Printed in 1804 at the Propaganda Press, Rome, on handmade paper using the ancient stone press, some of the pages of this book on Sanskrit grammar was moth-eaten, but still in a remarkably good condition. It became a prized possession in Varghese’s personal library.
The book, Vyàcarana seu locupletissima Samscrdamicae linguae institutio by Paulino A.S. Bartholomaeo who is known by several other names, the most popular one being Paulinus Padre, is credited with being the author of the first edition of the first Sanskrit grammar book Sidharubam seu grammatica Samscrdamica (1790) to be published in Europe. This work, together with Paulinus’ Vyàcarana and the grammar of Paulinus’ predecessor in Kerala, Father Johann Ernst Hanxleden (Arnos Padre) helped to cast light upon the sources utilised to teach Sanskrit grammar in the 17th and 18th centuries.
A published short story writer, Varghese who also writes travelogues and articles in most of the leading regional publications, browsed through this work occasionally and kept it back safely. “A couple of years back I chanced to read a book by Father Abraham Adapoor, a scholar who has made seminal studies on the life and works of Arnos Padre. He created a flutter by stating that the works of Paulinus Padre, all of them, were not original. The argument was that Paulinus, who had spent time in Kerala returned to Rome with the works of Arnos Padre, copied them and had them printed under his name. That was when I realised that I had one of the ‘original’ books of Paulinus Padre. I wrote about this in a regional weekly. Father Adapoor met me, took photo copies of some of the relevant pages but the controversy raged on,” says Varghese.
Things took a different turn after an interview with Carmela Mastrangelo, an Italian Sanskrit scholar, was published in The Hindu MetroPlus (February 27, 2014). Carmela’s noteworthy work was on Sanskrit grammar in 18th century Kerala pivoted on the work of Paulinus Padre. This was the subject for her PhD thesis and it aimed to reconstruct the history of the studies on Sanskrit grammar in Kerala through the work of Paulinus Padre, who settled in Malabar from 1776 to 1789. She focussed in particular on Paulinus’ Vyàcarana. Carmela states that Paulinus Padre brought Sanskrit grammar to Europe, studied in Italy but his work was hidden by the Englishmen of the Asiatic Society. Soome of the manuscripts have been lost, but some remain in the National Museum in Rome, she adds.
“I managed to get in touch with Carmela, who confirmed that the original manuscripts of Paulinus’ Vyacarana were still there in Rome. I told Father Adapoor about this and he was convinced about the originality of Paulinus’ works. And now I realise that the copy I have with me is the only one available in India making it so invaluable.”
This book of 331 pages is on Sanskrit-Latin grammar but provides interesting information on a whole lot of other subjects. “There are certain observations like origin of name of places like Kozhikode, it has an introduction by Cardinal Stephen Borge, it has a dictionary with sketches and the most interesting aspect is that Sanskrit is not used in Devanagari script but in Malayalam.”
Varghese, a retired bank manager, is the author of three books - Angamaly Rekhagal (2002) on the local history of the place, two short story collections, Punitha Varuvel Bandset (2013) and Kovilkalakal (2013). “I’m working on a novel and a travelogue titled Red Sea to Dead Sea. History excites me and that’s why after graduating in Commerce I took a post-graduate degree in History. Every travel is an exploration, a revisiting, of what I have read in those history books,” says Varghese.
Varghese has now decided to donate this rare copy of Paulinus’ Vyacarana to any institution, “preferably one involved in teaching Sanskrit and will promise to preserve this with care for posterity.”

Fold it like Gallaghar
","For somebody who started out as a sports reporter and presenter on BBC Radio Kent, Phil Gallaghar has a rather unusual title. He is known as Mister Maker, a tribute to his ability to skilfully fold, paste and create artefacts.
Gallagher does not regret the switch from sports presenter to maker of quirky artefacts. He thinks he has the best job on earth.
“I love making things. Mister Maker, the show, started in 2007. And even after all these years it feels like it just started yesterday. It's amazing how much the show has grown...I love my job,” he announces delighted. But seven years on, it must be a challenge to come up with new techniques and new projects for every episode.
“It is an incredible challenge but we have a wonderful team. We sit together and come up with various ideas. I write the script before the show.”
It’s a fast-paced, colourful and creative television show that aims to encourage youngsters; Phil hopes the kids continue with it, as he believes it goes a long way in increasing their creativity.
Phil has been travelling around the world for his show Mister Maker Around The World, where he puts together art pieces made of clay, cardboards, coloured papers and even some waste materials.
After a tour of the United Kingdom, he is heading to other places, including Cape Town, Rio and Sydney. He is excited about the prospect of meeting different people.
Of course, you must feel awesome, when you are a hit with the kids and they attribute every little creation of theirs to you.
Phil laughs, “When the programme took off, it was targeted at children aged six. Soon, we realised it appealed to children of all ages, parents and grandparents as well.”
The show has a following across continents and the master craftsman believes it is because the love of creativity is universal and transcends age groups.
He gives me the same advice he has given millions of his viewers, “Just have a go. Be creative and be proud of what you create.”

Mister Maker Around The World airs Monday to Friday at 5 p.m. on Discovery Kids.

Around the world with a camera
","There are those who click pictures while travelling and then there are those shutterbugs who travel to click the sights. Suraj Khan, Shiju S. Basheer, Sandeep Somasekharan and Venu Gopalakrishnan are some of those keen photographers who think nothing about hopping on a plane or revving up their cars and bikes in search of the next best shot. The shutterbugs talk to MetroPlus about their yen for travel photography.

Suraj Khan

“Every image has to tell a story,” says Suraj. Every other month Suraj travels the world to indulge his passion for photography. In fact, he’s just back from a photography-cum-business tour of Turkey. “The country’s unique juxtaposition of the old and the new – its heritage buildings, sculptures and culture, side by side with modern architecture and lifestyles – is a photographer’s dream,” explains Suraj. “On that note, Kerala too is a great destination for photography, particularly nature photography, because everywhere you go the greens and the blues make for striking frames. South East Asia, meanwhile, also has great scope for nature photography but its uniqueness lies in its street life that extends into the wee hours of the night. No where else in the world is street life more vibrant than in Cambodia, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam and the likes,” he says. Suraj, a management graduate who runs a travel business, has been interested in photography since his childhood days, particularly after his parents brought him a camera. “Thanks to my business, I’m able to travel for photography. I’ve always been interested in the play of light and colour. That’s why I call myself a ‘light’ photographer; I like capturing anything and everything, from landscapes and food to people and architecture.”

Shiju S. Basheer

Shiju is a firm believer in the phrase ‘a picture is worth a thousand words’. This keen photographer who plans “photo breaks” twice a year has trained his lens on several topics. While at first, “like most novices” he started out by shooting flowers and butterflies, he then graduated to capturing the life around him, especially the “culture and moods of the place and its people”.
Shiju’s fascination with photography began after watching a documentary on war photographer James Nachway. “The documentary captured my attention and I dreamt of being a photographer ever since. I love exploring different cultures, visiting strange places, meeting new people…. Some of these people I have met, fight to survive in extreme conditions,” says Shiju who has travelled to West Asia, Nepal and Vietnam, to name a few places, and more recently Ethiopia. “Before I plan my travels, I speak to friends who have visited the place and to fellow photographers to find out if there are possibilities for my intended frames. In Ethiopia, I have captured the Hamar people’s way of life.”
Shiju says travelling and photography has changed his perspectives on life and has gained him a lot of good friends across the globe.
He plans to travel to the Melanesian island of Vanuatu to study and capture the “Vanuatu tribal life.”

Sandeep Somasekharan

Sandeep’s shots abound with nature, animals at their candid best and landscape shots off the beaten track. “I like photographing the sights in uncharted territories, far flung places in the remotest corners of the country. The flora, fauna and the scenery in the Himalayas, the Rann of Kutch, picturesque Agumbe, near Madikkeri in Karnataka, or, Perumathura Pozhi, closer to home, for example,” says Sandeep, who often uploads his photos on Flikr or on popular environmental blog ‘The Green Ogre’.
“I’m the principal photographer of the blog. Until around two years ago a bunch of us from Green Ogre used to travel together. These days, I often go off on my own, armed just with my SLR camera,” he adds. It was while living in Mysore, eight or so years ago, that Sandeep, a techie who works at an MNC in the city, got interested in photography. “Mysore has a wealth of bird life and I got interested in bird watching and subsequently, bird photography,” says Sandeep.
These days he is also into minimalistic photography. “There is so much drama in a minimalistic shot. The best photographs are always instinctive shots, something that catches my eye, which I just feel would look good on frames,” he explains. Sandeep is off to the United States for an extended assignment this week. “The first thing in the suitcase was my camera!”

Venu Gopalkrishnan

Venu Gopalkrishnan is shooting in the Kanha National Park in Madhya Pradesh when I call him for an interview. Along with wildlife photographer Balan Madhavan and Belinda Wright, the shutterbug, who is wild about the wild, was happily clicking tigers and more.
Venu paints and sketches. Being a perfectionist, most of his works were left incomplete because he felt his paints could never capture all the reds of a sunset or the shades of greens of verdant forests. That is when he turned to painting with light – photography.
“As my father was a warden in the forest service, I have travelled to all the forests and wildlife sanctuaries in Kerala. Munnar, Thekkady, Wayanad, Rajamalai, Eravikulam .. Gavi is my favourite. Meeting Balan chettan's [Balan Madhavan] tips on photography gave me a flash of realisation into what wildlife photography was about,” says Venu.
Once the techie, who is CEO and founder of Litmus 7, amassed the financial muscle to bankroll his expeditions, his travels widened to wildlife sanctuaries in India and abroad. “In fact, I travel to click pictures,” he says. Kenya, Nepal and Spain were seen through his viewfinder as he trained his camera on flora and fauna.
The trip to Kenya was memorable because “we get to see encounters in the wild. Unlike dense forests in Kerala, in the grasslands, we get to see animals in flight, fights and feed modes. One of my favourite pictures is of two ostriches fighting,” he says. Next in focus is Antarctica.
Patience and luck, he says, are mandatory for wildlife photographers. While his camera is his companion for his trips abroad, he says that he has also managed to some great pictures around his home in Kochi.

Lessons for life
","“They used to call me Akka, then Aunty and now Paati,” chuckles Mrs. Leela Smart. “Most of the people in Tennur know me as Leela Teacher.” The 86-year-old former educator stays in a heritage cottage (one that she came to first as a tenant 56 years ago and her family went on to own eventually), but every line on her gentle face speaks of struggle and accomplishment.
Born in Musiri in 1928 as Irene Leelavathy James, Mrs. Leela was among the first batch of Secondary School Leaving Certificate (SSLC) students to train under the Emergency Course for Teachers at the All Saints Training School, Tiruchi, in 1946-47. “There was a severe shortage of teachers during the Second World War, so I decided to join the course after graduating from the C.S.I Girls High School in Thanjavur,” she says.
The trainees were put up in a hostel room at the old Bishop Heber College campus in Puthur. “We used always be a little hungry, because there were only eight ounces of food rations,” she recalls. “Once, I had come back from a match (the young Leela was a keen sportswoman), and had dozed off on my desk in class. Our principal Mrs. Ada Schubert woke me up with a gentle tap and said, ‘God will forgive you, but Time will not forgive you.’”
Those words have inspired her to stay alert all her life.

Always together

“Our marriage was one of the grandest in Thanjavur,” says Mrs. Leela, recalling the way she and her husband, Joseph Smart rode a decorated phaeton carriage after their wedding ceremony at St. Peter’s Church in 1952.
Mr. Smart (named by his father in tribute to the English organist Henry Thomas Smart) was working as a lower divisional clerk at the Railway Police office in Tiruchi. He was more famous as a virtuoso organist, having started playing at the age of 12 at St. Christopher’s Church in the Cantonment area.
“My husband was always involved in social work,” recalls Mrs. Leela. “He was on the board of directors of the Young Men’s Christian Association (YMCA) in Tiruchi and also an active secretary of Toc H (Talbot House, a Christian social service organisation founded in 1915 in Belgium).”
Managing on a modest salary (Mrs. Leela’s salary was Rs. 40 per month, while her husband earned Rs. 50) was not easy, but it had to be done. “Living in a joint family, we used to have a lot of guests, but I used to try and follow Mrs. Schubert’s advice of saving at least five rupees every month.”
Mrs. Leela’s third pregnancy in 1968, 12 years after marriage, was to prove to be a real test of her mettle. A tumour in her uterus was diagnosed at the same time, and treatment for it was not available even in Madras. But a greater setback was the stroke that left her husband paralysed on his right side. “We were both in the General Hospital (Puthur) at the same time,” recalls Mrs. Leela, “my husband was in the upstairs ward, being treated for his stroke, while I was admitted in the ground floor maternity ward.”
Fortunately a healthy baby was born by normal delivery to Mrs. Leela, who had to start taking care of her husband’s physiotherapy when her son was just 16 days’ old. “You didn’t have home nurses in those days,” she adds by way of explanation. “And anyway, I was determined to take care of my husband myself.”
The stroke only strengthened her husband’s resolve to rehabilitate himself, says Mrs. Leela. Taking a little over a year as medical leave, he rejoined the Railway Police as a file copy superintendent overseeing a pool of seven typists. “I’d help him to finish the correspondence after I returned from school,” recalls Mrs. Leela. Mr. Smart retired in 1975. He died in 1994.

Schooling past and present

After a short stint at teaching in Thanjavur, Mrs. Leela’s career post-marriage started off with her as an office clerk at the All Saints Middle School (now High School) in Puthur. “I used to help out Miss Mary Ruth Anstine with the office work, and then was shifted to teaching duty after one year.”
Mrs. Leela started off as ‘Tamil pundit’ for the girls-only Classes VI, VII and VII, but had to give it up in favour of a lighter workload of general subjects with the junior (co-educational) classes when she fell ill with pleurisy in 1956.
Teachers of her generation had to follow a strict dress code, says Mrs. Leela. “We’d always have to drape our saris modestly, and pin our pallu with a brooch. An umbrella and a wrist-watch were essential accessories, and we had to always wear our hair in a bun. Nowadays teachers dress more like their students,” she says.
Fees were in the range of one rupee to four rupees at All Saints, and to be paid by the 15th of every month. “There was a fine of one anna per rupee for defaulters. Once we spent two days figuring out why we had an extra anna in our account, and then realised that I had forgotten to underline a fine payment in the ledger with red ink,” laughs Mrs. Leela.
She doesn’t deny her sadness at the passage of time. “I turned down the opportunity to upgrade my degrees because of my husband’s illness, even though I did attend the re-training courses in the early 1960s. But I find students and teachers don’t really know subjects in depth these days even though they study a lot,” she says.
Quite a stickler for her principles (she took a vow to give up wearing jewellery since her husband fell ill in 1969), Mrs. Leela has been staying alone since 2005, next door to her elder son. “My father always used to say that we should never be a burden on our children in our old age, and should cultivate our own circle of friends. I am used to being by myself now, and though I don’t go out as much, there will always be someone looking out for me,” she says.
“Many generations of this area’s children have been taught by me,” says Mrs. Leela, who retired in May 1987. “Some them are senior doctors and government servants, and possibly a lot of them have become grandparents. I am so proud to have been a part of their life.”

OMC gets MCI nod for 9 super-speciality courses
","Finally, there is some good news for beleaguered medicos appearing for the PG medical entrance test this year, many of them for the second time after the question paper leak scam. The Medical Council of India (MCI) has green-lighted nine super-speciality courses at teaching hospitals under the Osmania Medical College (OMC) from this academic year.
It is rare super-speciality seats like Master’s in neonatology (for treatment of newborn infants) and surgical gastroenterology that have received approval from MCI.
“It’s a boost because getting such super-speciality seats means that we can now have access to speciality doctors in the government sector in the future. This is also an MCI endorsement of our capabilities,” OMC principal Putta Srinivas said.
In all, MCI has permitted two seats each in surgical oncology, urology and neurology, and one super-speciality seat each in nephrology, surgical gastroenterology and neonatology. Doctors appearing for this year’s PG entrance test will thus have access to the nine seats.
Since 1971, health authorities have been trying for MCI approval for a super-speciality seat in neonatology at the State-run Niloufer Hospital. Another rare speciality course, surgical oncology, which deals with the surgical management of cancer, has received MCI nod for two seats at the MNJ Cancer Research Institute.
“We need such PG seats to produce speciality doctors who can contribute a lot to government hospitals. OMC and OGH underwent extensive inspections from the MCI team before getting permission,” Dr. Srinivas said.
Estimates suggest that each of these super-speciality medical seats will be worth anywhere between Rs.2 crore and Rs.3 crore in private medical colleges.
“Now such seats will be available only for meritorious students, for free,” he pointed out.

CET off to a smooth start
","The Common Entrance Test (CET) for admissions to seats in government colleges and government-quota seats in private colleges began on Thursday.
The Karnataka Examinations Authority (KEA), which conducts the test, said in a press release that there was 96.7 per cent attendance for the maths exam, with 1.35 lakh students writing it. The biology exam recorded 73.1 per cent attendance, with 1.02 lakh candidates writing it.
Rakshitha M. from Mount Carmel College and Harshitha N. from Nayarana PU College, both medical seat aspirants hoping to get into Bangalore Medical College and Research Institute, found both the papers easy. “The additional option this time of pursuing pharmacy if not medical will benefit us as we will have a backup plan,” Rakshitha said.
Engineering seat aspirant Taniya Agarwal, from Delhi Public School, said the maths paper matched her expectations. “I am actually planning to pursue an engineering course in Singapore. But, if I score well in the CET and get into a good college like M.S. Ramaiah Institute of Technology, I will stay back. When I was preparing for the entrances, my parents suggested that I prepare fully and well for either the CET or the Joint Entrance Examination (IIT-JEE) as they involve different kinds of preparation. I stuck to the CET as the portions are similar to the Class 12 CBSE Board,” she said.
There were also students like Parameshwar Nayak of St. Joseph’s PU College, who was attempting the CET to test the waters. “I want to study BBM, but I wouldn’t mind studying civil engineering if I get a good seat and a rank. My preparations for the CET have not been great but the paper was not tough,” he said, after writing the maths exam.
Expert views on the papers were largely similar. Hanumanthacharya, head of the Department of Biology at BASE, said there was no ambiguity in any question. But he said several topics pertaining to animal and human life had not been “properly represented” in the paper. “The standard of the question paper was fairly high, and a well-informed student can score between 40 and 50 marks,” he said. As for the maths paper, H.S. Mahadevaiah, head of the Department of Mathematics at BASE, said it was a “well-balanced paper” of moderate difficulty.
Milind, vice-president, Knowledge Management, Ace Creative Learning, also said good scores could be expected this year in biology though the paper resembled a medical entrance test paper, while the maths paper, though it had an erroneous question, was of an “increased standard.”
The physics and chemistry exams will be held on Friday.

Where do you belong?
",": With the academic year coming to a close, students living in hostels are heading home for the holidays. For most youngsters, home equals heaven, coming close on the heels of a hectic round of attendance, assignments, internships, project submissions and, most often, bad food. Life in a hostel can be tricky, beginning with a sense of dread and displacement, leaving one vulnerable and homesick. It can also be a dream come true offering youngsters independence, friends and fun, so as they settle into a groove, they find themselves enjoying their life away from home. But when home beckons, can anyone resist?
The reasons may be many, but food and pampering are terms synonymous with ‘home’. “The fact that I can relax, eat home cooked meals, and not worry about expenses is what I love most about being home. It is just the comforting feeling of being someplace safe and happy,’ gushes Surendra Dat, who studies at Christ University, Bengaluru.
Abhimanyu Mukherjee, a student of BITS Pilani Hyderabadtoo echoes the sentiment, but adds,“I get to spend time with my parents; I truly didn’t realise their worth until I actually went to college. Home is home and hostel can never replace it.” .
The summer vacation is the most awaited event of a student’s life, at home they need not worry about anything for the next two months. However, a couple of weeks into the vacation, teenagers are craving to go back to college. “I love home, don’t get me wrong, but I hate the loss of independence that comes with being home. When I’m at college I get to make my own decisions. It’s slightly smothering being under parental watch 24/7,” admits Nirmal Gopakumar, a Keralite studying in Bengaluru.
Another negative side to being home is the lethargy that sets in. “Unless I have something planned, my vacations are usually just a bunch of lazy days, where I sit at home and do absolutely nothing till the point where I’m counting down the days for college,” says Yash Agarwala, a student at Manipal Institute of technology.
Still, there’s no place like home, students admit. From suffering from the ‘I-want-home’ syndrome to ‘How-long-till-college’ syndrome, most students come full circle numerous times in their college life. Even after going back to college, the itch to be home never dies, so it’s safe to say that home is truly where the heart is.

SC posts hearing on nursery admissions issue for Monday
","The >Supreme Court on Friday posted for Monday the hearing on the issue of >nursery admissions in the national capital and said that the relief in the category of inter-state transfer can be provided only to those who have filed a petition in the court.
A bench, headed by Justice H L Dattu, asked the counsel appearing for the parents of the admission seekers in the inter-state transfer category to place before it the list of the applicants.
The court made it clear that it cannot pass a general order and relief will be confined to those who are applicants before it.
Senior Advocate Raju Ramachandran, appearing for the Department of Education, submitted that after consideration and consultation with the major schools it was not possible to increase the number of seats by 5 to 6 for the inter-state transfer category.
The apex court had on April 11 put nursery admissions on hold again in Delhi schools after it put a halt on the operation of the >High Court’s April 3 interim order directing that those children who applied and were selected in draw of lot for neighbourhood and other categories, be admitted.

Eyes set on bigger things
","A large number of students wrote the Common Entrance Test held in 21 centres in Dakshina Kannada, keeping their options to look elsewhere open. While 6,250 students wrote the Biology paper in the morning, 10,340 students wrote the Mathematics paper in the evening.
Gaurav Nayak, a student of Sharada College, and another student Soundari K. said they were eyeing seats in National Institute of Technology and Indian Institute of Technology. The two have written the Joint Entrance Examination (Mains) held in the second week of April. The marks scored in the JEE Mains will be considered for NITs. The two have qualified for the JEE (Advanced) — examination for IIT admission — which will be held on May 25.
Mr. Nayak’s classmate Kishan Bhat said his preparation had been focused on the JEE. “No separate preparation the CET. I am also writing the entrance examination by MAHE,” said Mr. Bhat, who plans to pursue mechanical engineering degree.
Vikas P.U. College’s Akash Patil, a medical seat aspirant, said he would be writing the undergraduate entrance test to be conducted by the Consortium of Medical, Engineering and Dental Colleges of Karnataka (COMEDK) on May 11.
“I have done well in the two papers. I hope to get a seat under the CET,” he said.
Swati Dilip Nayak of Sahydri P.U. College, said though questions in Mathematics paper were direct she did take a minute more to answer some questions. “Time for mathematics paper could have been increased,” she said.
The CET examination on Thursday went off without a hitch in all the 21 centres. SDM College Ujire and SDM Residential College were the two new examination centres this time. As many as 728 students from Belthangady are writing examinations from the two centres. There are 10 centres in Mangalore, six in Moodbidri and three in Puttur.
Vasudev Kamat, who is holding charge as the Deputy Director of Pre University Education, said there were no complaints or confusions in any of the examination centre.
Five officials comprising — two sitting squads, question paper custodian, central observer and Chief of Examination centre — were posted at each of the examination centre. Of the five, three officials were from other districts.

MCI denies approval for final year course in medical college
","Following yearly inspection, the Medical Council of India has recommended that the government need not give approval to the Indira Gandhi Government Medical College and Research Institute to start their final year course.
Every year, before admitting students into the subsequent year, the MCI conducts an inspection of the college to ensure that they have adequate infrastructure and staff. For the past four years, the IGGMCRI has been asked to clarify a number of shortfalls, including the staff shortage as well as the lack of infrastructure.
The Indira Gandhi Government Medical College, which started in 2010, has now applied for approval to start the fifth and final year of the MBBS. Following their inspection, the MCI has written to the Government of India asking that they not approve the college for fifth year admissions. The communication between the MCI and the Government, which is available on the MCI website, however does not state any reason for this.
According to Director of the college P. Jayakumar, the college expected to receive a detailed report within the next week. The report would also be available on the MCI website. There had been no intimation of the issues that the MCI had seen during their inspection and only after the final report could any comment be made, he said.
In a similar case, the MCI had written to the college in 2012 seeking clarifications on some of the deficiencies that the college faced. The main problem listed at the time was a 36 per cent shortage of faculty and a 65 per cent shortage of residents.
According to sources, since then there had been a number of recruitments, but many of the staff had also left the college. The college would wait for the final report before responding to the Government, Dr. Jayakumar said.

Hard work key to his success
","Where there is a will, there is a way, goes the saying and a poor student has proved it true with his hard work and determination. He secured 455/470 marks in the Intermediate first year.
Meet, V. Surendra of Vizianagaram who doubles up as a paper boy, distributing newspapers, to supplement his family income. His father, Gouri Shankar, is a daily wage labourer and his mother a homemaker. His sister Supriya is studying in class VII.
A student of RK Junior College in Vizianagaram, he aims to get a good rank and secure a seat in mechanical engineering. His routine: “I wake up at 4 a.m. every day and distribute newspapers for one-and-a-half hours. I return home and study till 7 a.m. I reach my college by 8 a.m. and return home by 7 p.m. and study till 10 p.m.”
“During examinations I used to sleep for not more than five hours a day. During the examinations I had a substitute to deliver the newspapers,” he says.
“A couple of months ago, I lost my bicycle when my father took it to the bus complex area and on return, he found it missing. I had to go to college on an autorickshaw and I borrowed my uncle’s bicycle for distribution of newspapers,” he says.
In recognition of his merit, The Hindu rewarded him with a bicycle and a college bag, and felicitated him in the presence of other delivery boys at a simple function in Vizianagaram. Newspaper agents and delivery boys applauded this gesture of The Hindu.

82 per cent students pass out from Krishna College
","Dr. V.S. Krishna Government College (Autonomous) has recorded a pass percentage of 82 in degree final examinations this year. Of the total 454 students, who appeared for the final year examination, 374 came out with flying colours. The pass percentage of different groups comprises B.A. 91, B.Com 84, B.Sc (Maths) 81 and B.Sc (Biology) 74.
Announcing the results at a press conference here on Friday, principal V. Chandra Sekhar said: “It’s only three years since the college got the autonomous status. Although we are happy about the fact that the pass percentage for the last few years has been satisfactory, our focus is more on its improvement”
It was an emotional moment for the students who understood the fact that nothing comes easy. “Studying five hours a day after college hours helped me excel in academics. You need to stay focused and plan your goal in advance so that you will face less stress during examinations,” Ch. Kalyani Pavani, final year student said.
While some of the students said they were confident about their marks, a few of them expressed apprehensions about the new format of the Andhra University Common Entrance Test – 2014. “We are absolutely clueless as far as the pattern of the test is concerned. We wish we had little clarity on the model paper and study material so that we can keep pace with the competition,” a student from Paderu Ch. Murali Krishna said.
The first and second year degree results will be announced by the month-end, he saidRector of Andhra University E.A. Narayana and Controller of Examinations K. Samrajyalakshmi and college’s Controller of Examinations Y.V.K. Durga Prasad along with the staff were present.

Another scam in the making?
","Applications for Eamcet’s medical stream has crossed a record 1.13 lakh – the highest ever in the exam’s history. What’s intriguing is that this list includes about 100 students who secured good ranks last year have applied again, raising fears of malpractice.
The applications of SC, ST and BC candidates, who were ranked above 5,000, and OC students who were ranked above 3,000 in 2013, and have applied this year, are being verified. Most of these students might have already been admitted into MBBS or BDS courses, and this has raised questions.
Moreover, these students have applied with the late fee, indicating that they were not long-term coaching students, who generally apply in advance. There could be genuine repeaters in some cases, but officials leaving nothing to chance, given that scams related to medical exams have surfaced in the State and across the country over the last two years.
“We have prepared a list of such suspicious candidates and will send them to the police for verification,” EAMCET convenor N.V. Ramana Rao said.
Officials are surprised that despite a late fee of Rs.5,000, 11 candidates on an average have been applying daily.
Prof. Rao said they were extremely cautious in view of the recent PG Medical Entrance Test (PGMET) scam that rocked the State, and also because of efforts to leak the paper using gadgets a few years ago.
In 2010, some candidates had fixed cameras and phones on their shirts to leak the paper, but were caught minutes before the exam began. Since the number of exam centres has also gone up this year – 520 (engineering) and 234 (medical) – extra care is being taken.
A meeting with the DGP and Intelligence officials has been planned on May 12 to discuss the preventive steps to be taken, Prof. Rao said.
Interestingly, applications for the engineering exam have come down by 8,000 this year.
Officials still expect the total number to cross four lakh as about 10,000 additional students have opted for mathematics and biology courses for their Intermediate course. Last year, 3.90 lakh candidates appeared for the test.
Prof. Rao said around 4.30 lakh Intermediate students are in the MPC stream this year and 1.56 lakh in the BiPC stream. Officials estimate that around 68 per cent of MPC students appear for the engineering exam while 70 per cent of BiPC students take the medical test.

The land left behind
","In this election season, when thousands are losing their sanity and, with it, control over the words they use, it is important to retain one’s equanimity. Think back to the Partition and the much-worse times that visited us. In such challenging times, there were people who retained their humanity, their sense of right and wrong. Mohinder Singh Sarna, known to today’s generation as Navtej Sarna’s father, is an eminent humanist and a perceptive Punjabi writer-poet. The recent publication of a translated collection of his short stories set into motion a trail of nostalgia. Though Mohinder penned his experiences, he could well have been expressing our own. Navtej says, “In terrible times too some people retain their sanity. There are bad Sikhs, good Sikhs, just as there are bad Muslims and good Muslims. My father talked of both, though he preferred to remember the good ones.”
It all comes through splendidly in Savage Harvest. Recalls Navtej, “My father hailed from Rawalpindi but unfortunately could never go back to the city. He had a fractured reaction to Partition. He would talk about our house there, food, fruits, the climate. He missed the books that he had to leave behind, particularly early Punjabi literature.” Listening to him, my mind goes back to Babur and his vivid description of Farghana; how he missed its climate, fruits, and people. Baburnamah is as much about Central Asia as it is about Hindustan; as much about the place and people Babur left behind as the new place he used to revive his fortunes.
For Mohinder, though, it was different. He had not set out from Rawalpindi to conquer Delhi; he was forced to begin anew. Navtej frankly admits, “At another level, my father probably did not want to go back to Rawalpindi because he had barely escaped with his life.” Unlike Gulzar, I.K. Gujral, Kuldeep Nayar, Mohinder never set foot in Pakistan once he made India his home. Adds Navtej, “I, however, did go back. I went to his college, found the road, the cinema he used to talk about. The house where he lived was not there. But there was still Raja Bazaar. Also Trunk Bazaar. There was Rose cinema, Imperial cinema. It was all very emotional for me.”
And so he decided to bring out the collection of stories. “My father wrote about the Partition but also wrote epic poetry, novels, social commentaries.” The most fetching, though, were stories of his childhood. Those were the stories of the good times, of happy memories of the places where he played, his mates.” One particularly engrossing story is Winter Evening; Deccan Evening which links 1947 and 1984. Hardly surprising considering Mohinder counted Krishan Chander as a major influence on his work.
The collection has been noticed in literary circles and those who know Mohinder Singh are not surprised that the work of the Sahitya Akademi winner still commands attention. Confesses Navtej, “I am surprised when I read the stories at readings/launches. The audience has many youngsters. They have questions too. While age-old memories have to be kept alive, hatred has to be killed.”
Amid all the talk of Savage Harvest, has Navtej ever thought of continuing his father’s ways by writing in Punjabi? “I have not felt competent enough to write in Punjabi. I am fluent in the language but not steeped in its literature.”

Key it in right
","“How do we give this candidate a job when he can’t key in his application without error?” asked the HR executive. He had a point. The e-mailed application for a programmer’s job was a mess. It was not just the odd spelling error that the HR executive might have overlooked.
The message was a keying disaster. The first-person “I” was not capitalised; the full-stops appeared two spaces away from the last letter of the sentence, inviting blue squiggly lines beneath; lack of space between the full-stop and the next sentence meant red wavy lines underneath; arbitrarily-placed upper-case letters had sprung at odd places. Ah, the words themselves were fine — they spoke of the candidate’s talents, his willingness to learn, his varied interests — but these were lost in the thorny, wavy jungle of poor typing.

Teach typing

A class of 70 high-schoolers told me “keying skills” were not part of their computer science curriculum. They were simply expected to know how to type. “As soon as we were allowed to use the computer, we worked our way around with the keyboard,” they said. A couple of them said they had taken lessons from the typing tutor, but that was for speed, not accuracy.
Schools don’t invest in teaching keying skills because they figure students are already proficient in using the keyboard. A school official said they were using “know-your-computer” time on more “important” matters since “kids already know how to type.” That is the point. Students know “how-to,” not “how-well-to.” Most students start typing on cell phones and tablets, using hunt-and-punch methods and never learn to touch-type (type without looking at the keyboard).
Since students come to school familiar with computer keyboards and cell phone keypads, educators accept the ad hoc habits of six-year-old computer gamers. Ironically, the same teachers spend hours teaching kids how to hold a pencil, how to curve the “G” stylishly — skills kids are likely to use less and less with schools accepting typed assignments. How much is perfect handwriting important in their adult lives?

Error-free typing

It matters how we type. Once I found an error in my medical report. The technician not only took a long time to type, but got a few words wrongly placed and misspelt my name. Automatic typing would have helped him concentrate on the screen and made his work error-free, but then, did he really know what ""error-free"" was ?
If you are preparing for a job that requires typing, isn’t it mandatory you learn it well? Isn’t it part of the job-skill requirement?
Then why isn’t it taught in schools and colleges? How come typing skills do not feature in even highly resourced, well-administrated training plans, personal development programmes or professional qualifications? Isn’t error-free typing the dominant form of creating words for most of the jobs?
Here is a sample of jobs that particularly demand accuracy in typing.

Marketing research manager: Has to design questions, prepare databases, use statistical models, write reports and develop presentation pieces; create the annual research budget, write research plans and proposals; use word-processing software for reports, spreadsheets for budgets, presentation software to showcase research findings — all of it requires error-free work.

Data-entry/processing: Have to enter data from the hard copy; type 60-70 words per minute to catch up with workload.

Medical assistants: Have to record patient-information, billing information, payment transactions.

Computer engineers: have to work with CAD (computer-assisted design) and CAM (computer-assisted mechanics) software programmes for building product models; need to use codes.

Teacher: has to maintain student records, write reports, prepare question papers, worksheets; manage software programmes to track attendance; make seating charts, construct lesson plans, create test banks and answer keys; plot graphs to explain student progress and soon.
Salesmen, human resource managers, web designers — who doesn’t need typing skills? Salespeople have to enter sales calls, orders. Human resource managers maintain records of employees on salaries, attendance, work history.
A web designer is using a keyboard all the time, designing, spacing, re-writing! And won’t we all be happier to see a doctor’s prescription typed out neatly and not written by hand?

Some tips

- Learn touch-typing so you can strike the right letter/number with the right finger without looking at the keypad.
- Slow down if you are making too many mistakes. Accuracy must be your goal. Speed comes with constant practice.
- Build up speed and accuracy by practising telephone numbers.
- Try online tutorials to improve 10-key skills. Many offer free trials.
- Explore the possibility of a typing skills programme in your college.

Script a success story
","When Nishant travels to college, he finds a comfortable spot for himself in the bus and reads books on his smart phone.
He doesn’t subscribe to any newspaper. Instead he browses online. There are instant updates and information is just a click away. For him, going digital has been a convenient transformation.
The publishing industry in India is waking up to this new reader. It is transitioning into a new platform, where there is a possibility of reaching out to a wider audience at a relatively lower cost and creating new revenue streams.
Bangalore-based publisher Pratham Books was among the first Indian children’s book publishers to make their title “Muchkund and His Sweet Tooth” available in the digital medium.
The title has got more than 6,000 views on Scribd till date.
Editors, designers, and content providers need to be aware of the expectations of online readers. K. Srinivasan, who publishes a monthly public e-zine — PR-e-Sense, says, “People do not like to read too much text at a time, online. They dislike scrolling too much to get to the end of a story and want to access information as quickly as possible. Also, cluttered pages look worse on digital platforms, people prefer a clean design.”
Additionally, digital publishing requires knowledge of technology. Tina Narang, Publishing Manager at Scholastic India, corroborates, “[Creating] vanilla versions of a printed book simply requires knowledge of the software that converts the book into its e-version. However, digital versions of books that are created especially for this medium requires a designer with specialised knowledge of the software and the processes involved.”
Some of the software used in the industry are Adobe Photoshop, In Design, Illustrator and Flash. Programmers normally use “xcode” for iOS applications and “eclipse” for Android applications. However, these may vary between organisations.
Apart from software knowledge and technical knowhow, editors, designers and content-providers need to have the latest devices and know the innovations to stay ahead of their game.
However, simply “knowing” the technology won’t be sufficient. Suzanne Singh, Chairperson at Pratham Books, says, “Digital publishing requires people who can help create new engagement models with readers. We require people who understand analytics, social media and are digital innovators. These are early days in digital publishing... [but] we look for out-of-the-box thinkers who believe in the transformative power of technology...”

Education

Digital publishing is at a nascent stage in India and a lot of skills are learnt on the job; although a few courses are offered in this discipline. For example, Chennai-based Digiscape Gallery offers a number of courses in digital publishing. In association with Digiscape Gallery, Annamalai University offers a BSc course in digital publishing.Internationally, courses in digital publishing are offered at institutions such as the Oxford Brookes University in the U.K. and at the Columbia School of Journalism in the U.S.
Students interested in a purely media-based job profile, such as working for digital editions of mainstream media, e-newspapers and magazines can also choose to pursue postgraduate courses in new media or digital media.
Students interested in working in this field can look for jobs with websites of various national and local newspapers and magazines, as well as online-only news portals and e-magazines.
A few local book publishers have a full-fledged digital division. They usually have a small team that converts print editions into e-books, which are mainly epubs or pdfs.
Parthibhan Amudhan at BookBox, an organisation that helps publishers digitise their books, says, “There has been a marked rise in publishers looking for companies to digitise their books. At Bookbox, we produce animated stories to help improve reading skills and language learning using Same Language Subtitling. We make sure the content is easily accessible across all existing and upcoming digital platforms such as YouTube, Google Play, Apple Store, Kindle and DTH.”
However, with rising awareness, digital products are being taken more seriously by book publishers. For example, Penguin India launched the Penguin App for smart phones in 2011 and rolled out its e-book publishing venture in 2012.
Hence, opportunities for working with some big ticket book publishers as well as external agencies that specialise in creating digital products exist.
Although jobs vary between organisations, some profiles that students can look at are online editor, online journalist, web-designer, videographer and graphic artist. Digital publishing also requires production personnel as well as software designers who can develop apps and other digital enhancements to bring the content to life. Students with an IT background can also take up a promising career in this field.

Surging interest in study abroad
","“No overseas experience is more powerful or more meaningful than education,” said the U.S. Consul General Jennifer McIntyre. She was speaking at the inauguration of The Hindu Education Plus International Education Fair. The fair, which is now in its seventh year, opened in Chennai on May 3, at the Taj Coromandel.
Speaking on the relevance of studying abroad, Ms Mac Intyre said,”There is no greater influence on international understanding – and through it on peace and progress – than that which comes from the opportunities for people of different countries and cultures to meet each other and spend time in each other’s countries.”
Despite fluctuations in the rupee, an international education has remained popular in the last few years. If the U.S. has about 100,000 Indian students pursuing higher studies, Holland has close to a 1000. This growing interest in going abroad for studies was evinced by the number of countries that had put up stalls there: U.S.A., the U.K., Russia, Canada, Australia, Malaysia, Singapore, Dubai, France, Poland, Sweden and Latvia included. There were about 60 stalls in all.
Ms Nirmala Lakshman, Director of Kasturi and Sons Ltd. said “
The Hindu, with its commitment to building partnerships in education, is happy to take part in the fair.”
Apart from education providers, the fair also saw the participation of banks and airlines which offered special packages for students Indian Overseas Bank partnered in the fair with its offer of education loans for students; British Airways was the official airlines partner; Thomas Cook the Travel and Forex partner and Radio one the radio partner.
Seminars were held by country representatives from all countries.

Mastering finance in Chicago
","I always wanted to be a Quant when I was in school and in my undergraduate college. This dream came true after I left my job and decided to be a full-time student and entered IIT Stuart School of Business’s highly reputed programme: Master of Science in Finance.
The city of Chicago is known as the Windy City because of its politicians, in fact in real life you can experience high wind gushes. Yes, it is windy, it is cold but far better than New York and most other business cities, because it is easy to commute here. Public transportation is available all across the city — buses, the subway and trains. Although I have stayed in cities like Mumbai and Pune, I like Chicago more because one can see bright blue lakes just like a coastline and lush green parks and experience less traffic nuisance; it is a peaceful city in its own terms.
The Stuart School of Business, ranked third in the U.S. and 26th globally for its Master of Science in Finance programme, by The Financial Times, is usually an initiator and innovator with development of new programmes.
It recently started a new programme, Master’s in Marketing Analytics and Communication, one of its kind. The professors here have great knowledge and understanding and sometimes provide personal or individual advice on what one should concentrate upon.
IIT Stuart School of Business is really blessed to have a good full-time staff; I got a chance to interact with most of the staff as part of my on-campus job at the Dean’s Office.
Apart from the full-time faculty, the school has many industry professors who have great wisdom and niche-knowledge in the subjects that they teach which I find more appealing. The school also provides some great opportunities to students in the form of organising various networking events and bringing in professionals from the industry to interact with students and build a relationship with them.
The school has programmes like Advancing Career and Education (ACE), where the students are taught how to work on their resumes, networking skills and are motivated to bring a taste of American culture in their own lives. This would give a perfect start to the career from an international student’s point of view.
The school also has affiliation with basics of the industry like CFA for the Finance student, IBM for students in MBA and Analytics where professors are dedicated to motivate and help train the students for such competitive assessments. The course structure of the school really provided a base for my preparation of CFA exam. It has societies like Stuart Investments, and Net Impact, which are solely run by the business students. It also has a Career Management Center exclusively for Stuart students.
At Stuart School of Business, one needs to take initiatives to grab the opportunities which can turn your career into a great life.

Engineering goes creative
","
What are the things the college will bring to students that are new and useful?

Mahindra Ecole Centrale is a collaboration of Mahindra group with Ecole Centrale Paris, which is the national engineering college of Paris, and Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University (JNTU), Hyderabad. There will be four streams: Civil, Mechanical, Electrical and Electronics and Computer Science, but the system makes sure that the student knows a bit of everything before specialising. Students pass out with a B.Tech and an integrated MTech degree.
Every student will spend time at foreign universities. Ecole Centrale has tie-ups for this with 126 colleges around the world, including in places like China, Europe, USA etc. Students will spend the ninth semester there.

What will be the role of the Department of Creative Sciences?

The Department of Creative Sciences will at the outset get the students to see the connection between a. Natural Sciences; b. Creative Sciences; c. Technological Sciences and d. Management Sciences. In the area of creative sciences we will see how ‘creative’ artists and society have interacted/cohered with each other through literature, music, dance, painting etc in order to see the various synergies happening between societal forces and technological developments, often thrust into one’s life. Yet people have learnt to accept it or worked actively to reject it too. Imagine studying a film like Chaplin’s “Modern Times” or Dickens’ ‘A Tale of Two Cities’ or Gulzar’s modernist poems to understand the context.

Will the students be examined in the above courses?

Of course, there will be standard textbooks and assigned film viewings on which they will have to write assignments, debate in conferences and make competent short films also. There will also be a mandatory French language and culture course.
The slightly long-term goal is to develop a full-fledged Digital Media Technology department with a proper course structure, syllabus, labs and faculty specifications.

Is there only a five-year M.Tech programme on offer? Will admission to the programme be based on the JEE (Main) score? How much will school marks matter?

At the outset there is only a compulsory integrated programme lasting five years offering both a B.Tech and an M.Tech, to match with the qualification system offered by Ecole Centrale. Every student should have cleared his or her JEE Main which makes them fit for the IITs or NITs. They may start applying earlier and keep their options open. Since all applications are only happening online, they can go in and update it as much as they want till the closing date.

When will the full strength of faculty be recruited and when will the first batch begin their classes?

The first classes for Batch 1 will start on August 4. And the full faculty strength should be in place by May end.

You mentioned that bank loans are guaranteed for the students. Would you elaborate on this and the fee structure?

Every student who gets an admission is guaranteed a bank loan if they do not have the financial capacity. These loans are repayable 5 years after they graduate. Most importantly every graduating student is assured placement by MEC in some organisation or the other, in India or abroad. The Mahindra Group is large enough to absorb the graduates and will ensure that no student is left behind!

Please give us an idea of the fee structure and the number of seats.

The fee for the course will be about Rs. 4 lakh per annum and students are sure to get loans repayable five years after graduation. In total, there will be 180 seats in all for Indian students (60 each for Computer Science and Mechanical and 30 each for Civil and Electronics) and 27 seats for foreign students. The student-teacher ratio will be 10:1.

One step at a time
","You return home from college with your head buzzing with all the things you need to get done. Being the class monitor, you have to coordinate the logistics of the upcoming class picnic. So you quickly post a note on your Facebook page asking your friends to sign up. Before you start working on your Chemistry record book, you plug your iPod into your ears to listen to the song your friends were discussing this morning. As you start recording your observations of the Chemistry experiment, your cell phone beeps. Your friend sends an SMS asking whether you are coming for tuition. You respond and then get back to your record book. Within a few minutes, your mom calls saying that she will be late. While talking to her, you quickly check your Facebook page for updates. Twenty-four friends have responded. You quickly send another message on What’sApp asking about the picnic. You also text your friends saying the song is really cool. You then get back to writing your Chemistry observations.
Sounds familiar? In today’s wired world, we all engage in some form of multitasking, often without realising it. How many of us are guilty of reading an SMS while we are conversing with someone else? Or, of checking Facebook updates during a boring lecture or shooting off a quick email while wolfing down the breakfast. And, despite warnings to the contrary, people continue to talk on their phones while driving, even on two-wheelers.
How would you characterise the work habits of those who juggle multiple tasks with relative ease? Efficient, competent and productive? Or disorganised, disordered and sub-optimal? We generally think of someone who does myriad jobs as being very productive. After all, time is a scarce resource and we would like to pack in as much as possible into every minute. But contrary to popular belief, research suggests that multitasking may not be the best way to go about accomplishing our goals. In fact, toggling between tasks actually compromises productivity rather than promoting it.
In a series of experiments published in the Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception & Performance, Professors David Meyer and Jeffrey Evans studied what happens when people switch between two tasks, such as doing math sums and categorising geometric shapes. They found that subjects lost time when they had to switch between tasks, and it took them longer to make the switch if the task was more complex or less familiar. When we flit from task to task, our brains have to not only adjust to the fact that we are making the switch, but also activate the demands of the new task. Thus, as we go back and forth between tasks, we may end up spending more time on them as opposed to completing one job at a time.
Communications specialist Clifford Nass of Stanford University and his colleagues, compared the cognitive performance of those who multitask on electronic media regularly versus those who do not. In all three experiments, the performance of high multitaskers was compromised compared to their serially focused peers. Thus, students who multitask often were poorer at ignoring irrelevant stimuli and were worse at remembering which items were repeated on a test.
Further, to the surprise of the researchers, the multitaskers were beaten even on a task that required switching between two sets of stimuli. Ironically, chronic multitaskers were worse than others even at multitasking! As Nass bluntly states in an interview in Stanford Report, “Everything distracts them.”
Even as you juggle between tasks, and flit from screen to screen, do you find that your ability to pay attention for a sustained period of time is diminishing faster than you would dare admit? If you answered yes, you are part of a growing tribe of Netizens who find it to difficult to concentrate on a single task.
Author Nicholas Carr aptly captures this phenomenon when he writes in his book, The Shallows, “the Internet seizes our attention only to scatter it.” The longer we shift and shuffle between Facebook, WhatsApp, Gmail and cricket scores, our brains get used to the instant but superficial gratification that the Internet provides. While every generation is more tech-savvy than the previous one, and is thus more prone to multitask earlier in their development, we may gradually lose other essential life skills like the ability to concentrate, deliberate and reflect. MIT professor Sherry Turkle cautions us in her book, Alone Together, that multitasking provides us with a ‘high’ that deludes us into thinking we are being more efficient.
And, finally, for those daring souls who swear that talking on their mobiles is not an impediment to driving, the findings of Professor Brian Scholl and his colleagues will hopefully deter them from this highly unsafe practice. In an experiment, they found that those who spoke on their mobiles while performing a task missed seeing an unexpected object in 90 per cent of instances compared to 30 per cent for those who were not talking on a mobile.
In the interests of both safety and efficiency, we need to curb our multitasking instincts. Slow and steady is better than frenzied.

ETS to no longer provide TOEFL, TOEIC tests for UK visa
","Dealing a blow to many visa aspirants especially students, British authorities have said global testing giant ETS will no longer offer TOEFL and TOEIC tests for U.K. visa-granting purposes, in the wake of a recent controversy.
Following allegations in a BBC programme in February this year that fraudulent measures were adopted by candidates to obtain Test of English for International Communication (TOEIC) accreditation, the British Home Office has announced that its contract with the global testing giant — Education Testing Service (ETS) — will not be extended.
As per the U.K. Council for International Student Affairs’ official website, “ETS is no longer providing TOEIC and TOEFL tests for people who want to use them in support of U.K. immigration applications. This is because of allegations of fraud.”
“The Home Office has been investigating the allegations of fraud and decided that in future it will change the list of English language test certificates that are acceptable in support of U.K. immigration applications. So that ETS tests are not included,” it says.
The ETS has confirmed this news on its Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) website.
“Following the broadcast of a BBC Panorama programme in February 2014 which highlighted an organised element seeking to circumvent the U.K.’s visa-granting process, ETS has made the decision not to extend our Secure English-language Testing (SELT) licence with the Home Office. As a result, TOEIC and TOEFL iBT testing will no longer be offered for U.K. visa-granting purposes,” ETS said in a statement on its website.
However, the organisation said, “The fraud uncovered by the BBC programme was limited to TOEIC testing,” and the security of TOEFL was not questioned.
“The fraud uncovered by the BBC programme was limited to TOEIC testing. Security measures around the TOEFL test were never under question,” the statement said.
The U.K. Council for International Student Affairs has advised students who use ETS tests in their immigration applications to take other English proficiency tests approved by the Home Office, or to contact the advisors at their education institutions for assistance.
The TOEFL test remains the most widely respected English-language test in the world recognised by more than 9,000 institutions in more than 130 countries.

‘Journalists must be adept at using digital media’
","In this formative era of the digital revolution, journalists not only have to be effective story tellers but also integrate their writing skills and technical abilities to attract readers. They need to be adept at using the digital media and take up the challenges of devising new formats of presenting news.
Robin Jeffrey, visiting research professor, Institute of South Asian Studies, National University of Singapore, said it was a great time to be journalists in India in this emerging digital revolution that provided opportunity to explore new means to communicate.
Prof. Jeffrey was delivering the Lawrence Dana Pinkham Memorial lecture on ‘India’s ‘Bully Pulpit’: Media in a time of digital revolution’ at the convocation ceremony of the Asian College of Journalism here on Saturday.
Tracing America's golden age of journalism in the early 1900s, he said the era of American President Theodore Roosevelt saw the media revolution wherein he had the ‘bully pulpit’ or an outstanding platform as it was known then. The journalists then were known as muckrakers who exposed injustices through research and writing.
“India too is entering a phase of media revolution in terms of digitisation.” Drawing a contrast with the downward trend of newspapers in the U.S., he said the growth of Indian newspapers remained strong in the past 30 years.
Mobile phones and the Internet transformed the ability to gain knowledge and converge various medium of communication in them. Indian journalists could build upon the bully pulpit or the outstanding platform of digital media to reach out to readers. The digital media also foster social equality that is otherwise absent largely in Indian media.
Pointing out that despite the advantages, India’s global media presence was small, Prof. Jeffrey said: “The digital media provides a platform to project Indian voices around the world.”
Earlier N. Ram, Chairman, Kasturi & Sons Limited, elaborated on the crisis that newspapers face and how digital media here are yet to yield a viable business model to rely on.
In all 169 students received their diplomas from Prof. Jeffrey. Sashi Kumar, Chairman, Media Development Foundation, stressed on the need to tweak curriculum to match the changes in the industry. Nalini Rajan, Dean of Studies, Asian College of Journalism, spoke.

Inter results: poor show by Telangana districts
","Intermediate second year results yet again reflected the poor performance of Telangana districts with two of them figuring at the bottom and the remaining except Ranga Reddy district securing results below the State average of 66 per cent.
Adilabad and Medak recorded a low pass percentage of 49 while Krishna district topped the State with 82 per cent passes. Ranga Reddy district with 73 per cent passes topped in Telangana.
But much to the surprise of officials, performance of Seemandhra districts was much better as eight out of the 13 districts crossed the State average. Since schools and colleges in Seemandhra were affected by the bifurcation, officials expected that the agitation would affect the results.
The results declared on Saturday revealed that the pass percentage increased marginally this year with 65.57 passes compared to 65.36 per cent last year. Out of the 8,01,419 students who appeared for the exams, 5,25,526 have passed. Pass percentage in government colleges stood at 65.
Students can collect marks memos from respective colleges from May 7. Any discrepancies in marks can be brought to the notice of the principals by June 1. Those who wish to apply for recounting have to pay Rs. 100 per subject while they have to pay Rs. 600 for photo copy-cum-re-verification of answer book.
The last date for this is May 9. The advanced supplementary exams will be held from May 25.
The evaluation of answer scripts of advanced supplementary exams will be separate for both Telangana and Seemandhra, said the Board of Intermediate Education (BIE) secretary, Rama Sankar Naik. The A.P. Social Welfare Residential Educational Institutions (APSWREI) Society put up a good performance with pass percentage of 85.04 as against the State average of 65.57 per cent, the Society’s Secretary R.S. Praveen Kumar said.

Big recruitments in banks to continue
","Recruitments in the banking sector that have been big in recent years, generating considerable interest among job-seekers, are set to remain so for the next few years as well. This, however, does not make it any easy for the aspirants as with bank jobs gaining currency, the competition is also hotting up.
Indeed, it is intense as the Institute of Banking Personnel Selection (IBPS), which conducts recruitment examination on behalf of public sector banks, says the number of applications received has been a whopping 1 crore a year for the last two years. The number of posts was 50,000 on an average a year. The break-up, sources associated with the recruitment process say, is 20,000 officers and 30,000 clerical cadre posts.
It is in this backdrop a Bangalore-based firm, with which many past and present bankers are associated, recently introduced an e-learning programme to train the candidates. Unveiling the course and website of BReT Solutions Private Ltd., Canara Bank chairman and managing director R.K. Dubey underscored the significance of better preparation for the candidates.
Other speakers, including non-executive chairman of Karnataka Bank Ananthakrishna, said with the examinations being conducted online, the candidates need to tune themselves from that perspective too.
Canara Bank recruitment this fiscal, Mr. Dubey said, was likely to exceed last year’s 7,800. State Bank of India was planning an online exam around June for selecting 1,897 probationary officers. A key reason for the massive recruitment in the banking sector is the growing emphasis on financial inclusion — spreading to unbanked areas. With many employees who joined in 1970s retiring, more posts are falling vacant.

Popular choice

A senior banker, who did not want to be identified, attributed the popularity of bank jobs to the reasonable salaries, job security, improved status in society and the opportunity to serve customers. Recruitment by public sector banks was 50,000 for the past two years. The same pattern would continue for three more years, he added.
In terms of applications, there seems to be more from Bihar and States where job opportunities were relatively less compared with States where employment was available in manufacturing and services sectors. On the level of competition, the senior banker said the date of birth was the decider when hundreds of candidates were tied at the same score. Seniority in age gets them the job.
On the competition, a senior executive of BReT Solutions said that according to IBPS figures only 10 per cent of the estimated 2 crore candidates who took the examination got selected for interview. Of them, a mere 2.3 per cent got the final selection notice.
Chairman and managing director of BReT Solutions Ashok Hegde, a former general manager of Karnataka Bank, said in the absence of proper training, clearing the examinations was not easy.

Titled Overlap,the show consists of works from both conventional and unconventional media. Post-card drawings and paintings are the main attraction, apart from prints and sculptures. Such a vast gamut of genre, style and ideas don’t easily gel, but the 110 feet wide Vismaya Gallery of Rangoli is an apt place for such an exhibition. “The aim is to throw open art works, which were endorsed in art school, to the public and engage in a dialogue with the common man,” said G.R. Mouna, whose work is on display.
According to H.A. Anil Kumar, who teaches in CKP, a certain stigma is attached to art school education, that it is something elitist and non-communicative. This would be proved wrong by interacting with the public, he added.

Group of schools refuses to begin RTE quota admissions
","The Tamil Nadu nursery, primary, matriculation and higher secondary schools association on Monday announced that their schools would not admit students under the 25 per cent quota mandated by the Right to Education Act, 2009 until the school education department committed on a time-frame for reimbursement of fee for admissions made in the last two years.
Starting May 3, schools in the State were supposed to start issuing admission forms for seats under the quota. K.R. Nandakumar, secretary of the association, said that they have been providing admissions for the past two years and had opened bank accounts as instructed, but were yet to receive the amount. He added that matriculation schools are also grappling with issues such as students migrating to CBSE schools because of Tamil being a compulsory language in many classes. The Association claims to have around 10,000 schools as members.
As per the Act, the government has to reimburse the schools for the admissions made. In Tamil Nadu, the amount to be reimbursed is either the fee fixed by the government-appointed private fee determination committee for the school or the amount spent by the government per child, whichever is lesser.
A school education department official said that schools would get the amount in 3-4 months and that they should not refrain from issuing admissions forms. An official said that last week, matriculation schools were asked to follow the government schedule on RTE admissions so that all seats could be filled this year.
Activist A. Narayanan said that the 25 per cent seats must be non-negotiable and should not be opened up for the general category. “In the survey conducted last month by volunteers from Becoming I Foundation, they found that close to 30 schools had the admission forms ready. Not conducting admissions is not the way forward. The department should have also been proactive,” he said.
According to a department official close 50,000 students were admitted in the State under the 25 per cent quota in 2013-14.

At seven, words are sacred to him
","L. Sanjan’s world revolves around words. Nouns, verbs and prepositions fascinate him.
Perhaps, that’s why this seven-year-old breezed through four oral and seven written rounds to win the National Championship in Category I, and the ‘Star Speller’ and ‘Best Performer’ awards at the MaRRS International Spelling Bee held at Faridabad in April.
Sanjan, with terrific enthusiasm, recounts his experience at the event. “You know, it is the ‘Spell It’ round I quite enjoyed. I spelt 47 out of 50 words right. It was the ‘chateau’ word that knocked me out. I knew it was different from the word ‘shadow’, but I didn’t know its spelling or meaning. Nevertheless, it was fun,” says the student of Bhavans Rajaji Vidyashram.
Asked if he was ever nervous during the competition, he says, “I was neither tense nor tired. I was just waiting for the prize!”
He admits that he is completely enchanted by the language. “You know what I like the most about going to school? It is English lab sessions. We have something exciting to do during all sessions. And since I’m regular to school, I have also got the award for holding the maximum attendance,” he says with pride.
Like his father, C. Lenin, Sanjan wants to become a doctor, an orthopaedician to be specific.
“It is quite interesting to see what my dad does. Hence, the decision to pursue medicine,” he says.
He is also a voracious reader and is interested in art. “He has also got awards in drawing competitions and won an interschool competition in Bhagawad Gita. He is very articulate and speaks his mind always,” says his mother, N. Anuja, a professor at Savitha Dental College.
Now, he is all set to compete in the International Championship scheduled to take place in two months. “I just take it easy and prepare at my own pace. I think it will be fun,” he says with a smile.

The paper trail
","Come exam season and students across all engineering colleges can be seen scurrying around for the right books to study from and breaking their heads over tricky questions. While many struggle to cram and get through the exams, others are clueless about how to prepare for it. To curb this last minute hassle, Paperhut, an innovative portal helps students in preparing for their exams. Offering previous years’ question papers and used books for engineering and MBA courses, Paperhut has grown to be a favourite in the student community. A start-up established by four students of Anna University, Paperhut now has over 10,000 users a day. “Paperhut was born when our professors said the simplest way to score 85 per cent was by going through previous years’ question papers,” says Krishna Murari, one of the founders. “Then as we tried to access these papers, we had to slog for hours in the library or head out to ask if our seniors had it. On an average, it took us about 3-4 hours to get the papers we wanted. We then contacted a bunch of friends from a few more universities across India, and it looked like everyone faced the same issue! Instead of cribbing about it, we decided to go ahead and solve this problem. And that's how Paperhut was born.”

Redefining study

The team of four consists of Krishna Murari, Raghavendra Ramesh, Sreekesh Krishnan and Thiru Venkadam.
Redefining the studying process for students during examinations and making it much easier, Paperhut makes old question papers and books accessible to universities across Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. They have partnered with four colleges in Tamil Nadu to offer their services, allowing the college management as well to share their internal papers and notes. Convincing colleges and universities to become a part of the portal is no mean task and Krishna Murari agrees. “While a lot of colleges have shown interest, we're facing a roadblock as the management boards in many are skeptical about adopting a newer technology in empowering their students. Communicating with colleges involves a lot of effort, including driving down to remote locations for each meeting to take it forward,” he says. But their high point comes during exams when Paperhut is put to its best use. “We spot a lot of students with question papers printed from our portal and that is a moment of pride and happiness for us,” he adds.

Developing content

Sourcing the papers from students, college seniors and Paperhut volunteers in colleges, they have an online tool which tracks and ensures that all the question papers reach them within a month of the end of a semester. “The question papers are then digitised and optimised before they’re uploaded in Paperhut,” says Krishna. He adds that the the pre-owned books are sourced from students, dealers in the city and college alumni. Quality checks are also done on the books to ensure its usability before putting them up for sale on Paperhut.
Having received the ‘Most Innovative Venture’ award from Microsoft at a start-up fest in 2013, Paperhut has progressed and is now Paperhut Education Private Limited. “We are excited to see how we can take this initiative forward to help students across universities,” explains Krishna Murari. “We are currently working on sourcing law, medical and chartered accountancy papers and we're halfway through it. We are also looking at expanding our student base, improving the logistics for Paperhut Books and see if we can do something about solving a few more problems that students face. It would help us in taking this initiative further if the managements across colleges could lend some more support in working with us,” he concludes.

Cherry-pick your habits
","Habit is when you crave your mug of beer, listening to Pink Floyd on your playlist while running on the treadmill. This exaggeration is to underscore my preoccupation with habit building and the opportunity I see us having in choosing a new one! Habits are ingrained, have automaticity, emotional memory, and have subcutaneous hold over us. Perhaps this, and many indolent reasons had me believe in my slavery to certain habits till late.
Habit loop
“The habit loop is a neurological pattern that governs any habit. It consists of three elements: a cue, a routine and a reward. Understanding these components can help in understanding how to change habit or cultivate new ones. The habit loop is always started with a cue, a trigger that transfers your brain into a mode that automatically determines which habit to use. The heart of the habit is a mental, emotional or physical routine. Finally there is a reward, which helps your brain determine if this particular loop is worth remembering for the future… The cue and reward become neurologically intertwined until a sense of craving emerges.” — An excerpt from Charles Duhigg’s The Power of Habit. 
To me, craving is most central to the debate on habit; it drives all habits and is critical to assess what is a habit and what is not. The strategic aspect in all habits — insidious and desirable — is that they get built on the expectation of reward: what do I get (or feel) off this habit.
To tell you how my understanding of habits evolved, I’ll take the reminiscing route into a habit once integral to my life. 
The habit: relaxation and fun equals drinking. 
The first time I drank alcohol, I hated it. But I liked the headiness it gave me and that lured me back to my next, until I loved the taste, the act, and the after-effects of an alcoholic binge. To confess, the habit rewarded me lasting memories of friendship, abandon, and experiences that always bring me a smile.
The question is does the habit serve me today? Was it possible — once I’d tasted the reward and repetitive influence of this habit as my only way to unwind — for it to lose its sheen and be replaced with a routine equally rewarding? The answer is a yes.
The habit would have persisted if I hadn’t found a cohesive reward from another source sometime later. It was the experience of unlimited alertness in a physical routine and discipline. In war language, the headiness of alertness was pitting against the lightness of oblivion.
It is the alertness I now needed in the midst of a physical routine that demanded my entire being to be alive and together for its completion, because the demand was to remain alert in mind, till only the body gave up. 
In Zoya Akhtar’s seminal movie, Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara, Laila, the diving-instructor, describes her experience of deep-sea diving as meditative as different from addictive. It is similar to the alertness in a bungee jump when one is fully awake to every sensation in and around versus the memory lapse between the fourth peg of alcohol, getting home and waking up in bed the next morning! So, here’s how the habit loop developed in my case: it replaced the routine of drinking to unwind with a daily physical routine — a far more energising reward with immeasurable repeat value. Repeated craving for the reward has built a default habit of physical activity as my preferred way to relax. 
To put it in perspective: I do enjoy my drink, but I no longer need a drink to enjoy. 
Going back to the idea that habits are mental and emotional too, frequent anxiety, procrastination, self-doubt, and victim mentality are also habits. When they get in the way of a rewarding life, we have a choice of cherry picking new habits and cultivating them, towards happy and engaged lives. 
Any habits you wish to swap?

Unleash the power of your brain
"," Dr Jose’ Foglia from Uruguay is a medical doctor with a double degree in Medicine, specialised in General Surgery, Haemotherapy and in Psycho-Neuro Endocrine Immunology; he was in Chennai this January, conducting a course on ‘The Meditative Brain, a Challenge to the Digital Revolution’. Excerpts from an interview. 
Could you please explain the complex functions of the brain briefly, in simple terms for a lay person? 
The brain is composed of millions of neurons processing information from external and internal (our body) environment to create its reality; by reality I mean what is present around oneself at that moment; at the same time it can also communicate itself to others through intellectual and manual capabilities.
What do you mean by the term, ‘self aware brain’?
The brain consists of two hemispheres, the left and the right, connected by the Corpus Callosum (a bridge composed of millions of nerve fibres connecting one hemisphere to the other); both hemispheres are sharing their information all the time, working together.
The left hemisphere of the brain is aware of ‘itself’ (self-awareness) and this is possible because it has developed the capacity to integrate information in special areas called “memories”, so it’s possible for the brain to say: “I am”.
With these definitions what is your brief advice to youngsters against addictive habits?
The ‘self aware brain’ is interpreting all the time the reality and constantly conditioning it.
Many activities of the brain are just reactions, conditioned by mere habits. One must be aware of any kind of habit formation and the influence of the same.
The abuse of digital technology is addictive for the brain, causing deficit of attention, deficit of memory, depression, etc., and this addictive process should be avoided.
How can the brain create different realities?
All the bits of information coming into the brain from the external and internal environment are processed in the brain, but only on a part of this information are we consciously focusing our attention and this is the process by which we create different realities. The reality created by the brain is conditioned by numerous factors.
Could you explain the ‘Dopamine Reward’ term in connection to addictions and creating different realities?
The dopamine reward is a mechanism that creates the impulse for the brain to satisfy its addictions, habits, and all the needs of the body. For example, the craving for eating sweets – when we keep away from sweets, the body experiences a sense of ‘longing’ to eat sweets. Once we eat sweets again, some areas of the brain releases dopamine and the craving is satisfied. This process can lead to addictions.
Please explain neuroplasticity and tell us specifically how to use it to avoid addictions of alcohol, tobacco and so on?
Neuroplasticity is the capability of our brain to change the quality of the connections between the neurons; to make it work faster or stronger or to make new connections or to destroy it. The same also, either increases the number of neurons (Neurogenesis) or decreases the number of neurons (Apoptosis). Because the neuroplasticity of the brain is creating ‘new pathways’, new connections every time one repeats these actions, it makes these connections stronger, eventually asking for more and more of the addictive material, whether it is alcohol or tobacco or any other habit forming material or process.
Could you explain the term ‘Mind’?
‘Mind’ is a term I don’t like to use as I don’t know the real meaning of it.
I would rather use the term, ‘psyche’ – the consequences of the brain activity.
Your advice to youngsters?
To use to ‘full’ all the potential of their brain to the maximum of the possibilities, because the brain is like a muscle and one must use and improve its functions. For example, meditation techniques can increase neurogenesis and the connections between the neurons in the most important areas that makes us ‘human beings’, increasing attention, memory, empathy, etc.
 Why do you say that all young people should be aware of the abuse of digital technology?
The abuse of digital technology will damage the brain - its short-term memory as well as the long-term memory. So one should be consciously aware of this and keep the digital technological devices to the required areas of use.
How early this awareness should start?
Up to two years of a child’s life there should not be digital influence; parents should be aware of this and should not introduce gadgets to young children as it will inhibit the growth of the neuron connections. Inputs should be in the form of natural interactions with the external world from the beginning.

Power to change
"," The power to bring about change can be derived from knowledge. And such power has been given to me by the University of Sheffield, encouraging my ideas to fly high! As I was pursuing B.E.(Hons.) in Computer Science at BITS Pilani, Dubai campus, I always had one question — how could I use my knowledge for the betterment of healthcare services? 
My parents suggested that I specialise in biomedical sciences by pursuing higher education. And thus, the hunt for the best university started. The University of Sheffield is amongst the top-ranking universities in the world for biomedical sciences. Among the courses offered in this field, it was this university that offered the perfect mix of computational studies and bio-mechanics — just what I wanted! 
Pro-reasearch
The M.Sc. Computational Medicine is a cutting-edge master’s course which would allow me to be part of the first generation of patient-specific modelling specialists. The amazing research facility, short programme duration and excellent future opportunities cemented my decision to apply to this university. Without wasting any time, I applied and also asked for a scholarship. I was confident due to my academics and research proclivity that I would get in, each day waiting patiently for my dream to become reality. And finally, on July 28, 2017, I received the offer letter with a student scholarship.
In September of 2017, I arrived in the peaceful city of Sheffield to start the journey that was going to change my life. Soon, I was part of The Insigneo Institute for in silico medicine which has £40 million of research income. Being part of this prestigious and one-of-a-kind institute gave me the opportunity to interact with many different professionals and understand the latest research in the current medical device and hospital industry. 
Further, as part of the degree I am required to complete modules which give me an overall background in patient-specific modelling skills, a better understanding of clinical data and a closer look at medical device manufacturing. The course is designed in such a way that it also trains you in real-life applications. Modules like Regulatory Affairs for Medical Devices will help increase my demand in the industry. The course also includes an opportunity to carry out the research of your choice as part of a 60-credit project.
The cosy city of Sheffield and the welcoming environment of the university makes a student like me, living far away from home, very comfortable. The university has top-notch accommodation, student facilities, and staff that are always ready to help. The library and computer access facilities, The Diamond and Information Commons do not fail to amaze me as they contain all the latest books, journals and updated software.
Dream big, because they do come true — as they did for me in the beautiful city of Sheffield.

Stand up, fight back
"," Bullying seems common, but what is it? It is verbal or physical abuse with aliases being ‘intimidate’, ‘harass’. It is the sadistic feeling of joy one enjoys when victimising the vulnerable target. Who is bullied more — men or women? Bullying knows no gender; although women are easy targets, sometimes, men have no escape either.
No convincing answer exists as to whether bullying happens more in university/workplace/home. Whilst your senior in school or authority at work victimises you openly, bullies exist at home too. The act is a torment trap from which victims know no escape. In principio, understand that bullies are human. We can handle bullies with inner strength and mental power.
Reasons for bullying range from bigoted attitudes, poor upbringing, insecurity, aesthetic appeal, employment, earnings, and more. Irrespective of the fitting reason behind this vilifying act, not all emerge stronger. Many have altered their circadian clock to end themselves. So, how do you handle bullying? 
Say no to self-pity
Whilst addressing this, I confess for no want of self-pity that bullying in my life started in my early teens whilst growing up in a traditional joint family system in Chennai (then Madras). My naiveté being profound, initially, I never realised I was been bullied. I was at a crossroads; having none to share my trauma with, as I was a single child, any solace I got was from my high school friends. I laughed outside, despite my mental turmoil within. However, external intimidations fed my mental strength with which I excelled in my higher secondary examinations. Mouths that previously bullied my academic modicum, now remained shut. I experienced a surreptitious self-confidence that bullies could be handled. Success followed successively, until, some in my family started bullying me for my wheatish complexioned, average looks. Recollecting it, it is amazing to see how people are enslaved to this feeling, not realising anything you love looks beautiful to you. Contrarily, my employment status was important to others, and my independence and poor knowledge of religious dogmas has now made me the talk of the town. Bullying has followed me like the little lamb that followed Mary to school. At work, harassment began when my male chauvinistic superior, from a different cultural background, began misusing his authority on me. Determined, I fairly succeeded in alerting many within the organisation. Finding opportunities my way, I have progressed further in my academic profession. Narrating my experiences was not to invoke solace but to make you aware harassments still exist.
Knowing that there exists a pusillanimous majority, getting many cues from victims can help save their lives. A look of disinterest on their face; a sense of depression in their conversations are clear signals; enquire if they are okay or require help. 
Instil confidence to harness the mental strength lying dormant in these victims.
Those suffering bullying, remember, seeking assistance helps. Talk to your close friend or confidante, else to a professional. If bullied, speak out boldly to let your trauma known. Do not despair; with mental strength, you can fight back. Becoming vulnerable victims is not an effective solution.

On the digital highway
","While we have seen currency changing forms — coins to paper and now the newer crypto variants — knowledge and education continue to remain the most important currency of every society. India is no exception. With a growing urban base, increasing Internet penetration, and rising millennial population, India is on the cusp of a major digital transformation. 
E-learning has the potential to be a harbinger of social change in India. With more than 400 million Internet users and more than 330 million connected smartphone users, and being a country for the second most social site users, India has immense opportunity to grow and tap the potential of technology in the field of education. 
Breaking barriers
There is an increasing realisation that initiatives like Digital India will have a major role to play in shaping e-learning in India. With focus on delivering education through digital platform, there is an opportunity to access learning sources through a global platform, providing accessibility to teachers as well as students, which can break socio-economic barriers to gaining quality education. 
However, to achieve the same, there is a need to have a targeted approach to improving education through digitisation. Integrating technology to our large and complex school system can have a major impact. In the academic field, development of e-learning teaching strategies that encourage greater engagement and also take into consideration different learning styles can help improve teaching effectiveness and academic achievement. 
Culture of learning 
The rate at which new technologies are being developed and adopted around the world is accelerating. While this acceleration of change gives us new opportunities to improve the learning process, we must not ignore what we have learned about good pedagogy from centuries of experience. 
Looking back, we have the example of equity and quality of education in ancient India which is unparalleled. From higher philosophy, which was usually referred as darshan shastra, to subjects like literature and science, vocational training had a very important place in our ancient education system. 
In medieval times, different education models were experimented with. However, the core system remained resilient and unchanged. In India, close relationship existed between the pupil and the teacher. 
The teacher paid individual attention on his students and taught them according to their aptitude and capability. We also find evidence of modern day skills deeply embedded in our ancient education system, such as memorisation, critical analysis, introspection, storytelling, hands-on method, and seminars. 
Way forward
The next few years will see India leapfrog in the field of education aided by technology. In the journey of reshaping education in India, it is important that a structure is put in place. There is a need for collective and equitable public-private partnership to address the large gap. 
The ecosystem should be spruced up to make teaching a profession of choice and not something that ‘happened by chance’. Teachers should be empowered in terms of improved competencies, better growth opportunities, and a sense of fulfilment. Furthermore, the education system should support the start-up ecosystem, and learning should be geared towards competencies. 
Much like in e-commerce and telecom models, we are seeing innovations and ideas that are India-specific. And these very ideas will increase the relevance of content, delivery, and access across the country. 
This will, in turn, lend itself to shaping the global e-learning industry as well. We are surely looking at exciting times ahead!

Time for a reality check
","After my graduation in 2015, I have been preparing for the Civil Services Examination. Currently, I am working. However, my job is not demanding and I can take out the time required for studies. I am also sure that I want to be a civil servant as my current job is also similar (but not permanent — just two years). However, I am not able to concentrate on my studies. I spend time watching interesting videos and do not study at all. I am concerned and want to get back to studies. Please guide me.
— Narendra
Dear Narendra,
If you are too lazy to plough, don’t expect a harvest. I don’t have sufficient information on what you do right now but you are very young. Focus on what you want. Your time is now! You have only shared the fact that you are not able to concentrate on your studies to take the Civil Services Exam, since you seem to get distracted by watching videos online. You need to make a choice and identify how badly you want to be a civil servant. What does it mean to you? Just being merely concerned is not going to help you get out of your complacency.
Why don’t you join a coaching centre of repute for the IAS exam? This will ensure that you become disciplined and regular, work on the assignments and also get a real sense of what the competition is all about. Hope you start working seriously towards your goal.
I am 26. I have completed an advanced diploma in tool and die making (4 years) and a bachelor’s degree in mechanical engineering, but instead of looking for a job in core companies, I am preparing for the Staff Selection Commission: Combined Graduate Level Examination. Please tell me if this is the right decision. — Yashudas
Dear Yashudas,
I really wouldn’t know if taking the SSC CGL is right or wrong as I have no idea of what you would like to do and what is it that you are passionate about. However, I look at the exams as a great opportunity for you, as you will have a few more options open up post the exams — various interesting postings across ministries, departments, and offices of the government.
In the meantime, I would greatly recommended that you take some time and introspect on what your core interest is — mechanical engineering/tool and die making or a government job. Happy soul searching!
I am 26 and preparing to get a suitable government job, but I am not interested in this. I am doing it only because of what my father wants for me. I am good at singing and passionate about it. But nobody in my family is supporting me; they only have demotivating things to say about a singing career. Please suggest what I could do. — Manish
Dear Manish,
I understand that you are completely disinterested in taking up a government job. You also feel that your family is pushing you to take it on and not motivating you to pursue your dream of becoming a singer. 
What is the evidence of you being a good singer? Do you understand how difficult it is to get a break in the music industry? Are you a trained musician? Please equip yourself so that you have the credentials to grow —secure a decent job first that would provide you with the flexibility to further your passion. Enrol in music classes, get a good music teacher, start auditioning and get a reality check of where you stand among the zillion other talented struggling singers. This process can take forever, or, you can get lucky if you are at the right place at the right time. It will certainly help being stable and secure (both financially and socially) till you realise your dream!

Why do we break rules ?
","Glance at the headlines in your morning newspaper — ah well, at your daily shot of web pages — and make a quick calculation. How many of the news snippets are about someone crazily trying to defy the law, rule, norm, moral code? So many, that if you’re pushed into thinking all the woes of life are caused by our contempt of common law, you’ve been pushed right. 
We defile monuments by carving on the walls our undying love for someone. We overstay, wander off in national parks, pluck leaves and flowers and break branches. We drive without putting on a seatbelt, use the cellphone while driving. We disrespect all limits — speed, drinking, decibel level of horns, number of passengers on vehicles. 
Inclusive
Rule-ignoring is inclusive. Everyone does it — class, caste, education, marital status, fitness no bar. All of us litter in public places, buy tickets in the black market, ignore stop-signs, negotiate with cops when caught, jump queues, park/drive on footpaths, or overtake on the wrong side. We smoke in the open, let our pets poop in the street and dump construction debris where people walk. We occupy public space with ramps outside homes. Is there an end to this list? Rule-breaking is a great leveller: no one gets punished. If you’re caught red-handed by a misguided watchman or an idealistic cop, you know how to wriggle out. 
“I am baffled to notice that people often don’t follow my rules even when stated clearly. These, by the way, are in place because they are the best way to do things!” wrote an anguished blogger. “I’m trying love and compassion instead of throwing people off the balcony, but I am aware that the latter is more efficient.” 
While flying, Indians pay little attention to evacuation instruction, says author Aakar Patel, writing in his blog Aakarvani. This cavalier attitude is why desis “make a grab for the overhead bins despite being told expressly to wait for the seat-belt sign to go off. A laptop bag once crashed down on my seated wife’s skull, as someone casually yanked stuff from the overhead bin. Heaven knows what sort of damage we do to each other every day in this Hobbesian fashion.” He points out how vehicles back up in our parts and even drive up the wrong side of highways. This utter disregard for rules of safety is a culture that is hard to break, he says. 
Free expression? 
Poor civic sense? A chalta hai attitude? Experts, sadly, do not agree on the “why”. Some argue rule-following is taught at home. The child is trained to follow ground rules — on cleanliness, politeness, right and wrong. Others say young people increasingly defy the law because the parental control is too strict for comfort. “What they can’t/couldn’t do at home finds free expression once they are outside and with friends.”
For the question “Why do we break primary traffic enforcement laws (seatbelt, cellphone use, parking, stopping behind lines)?” on a website, readers voted this as the best answer: We are careless or inattentive, we like to defy authority (who is he to tell me?), we feel we are young and therefore indestructible, we find it convenient (why waste driving time?). People think they rule the road when they are behind the wheel. And um, some genuinely don’t know traffic rules.
It’s a paradox, really. Most of us think we are honest, play by the rules — even when we litter, text while driving, mend the silencer in our vehicle, enjoy pirated movies/music, blow past speed limits, or lie to give our kids an advantage. When confronted, we offer a string of arguments in our defence. 1. I don’t always break rules, only when I can’t help it! 2. You talk as if I’ve stolen money! 3. It’s okay to break rules for others. 4. When so many get away with littering the beach, why should I look for a garbage bin? 5. Is that the rule? It’s not clear! And this clinching logic: When the big/powerful fish go scot-free why is the small fry caught? 
Psychologists have found that rule-breaking makes people feel powerful, smart, innovative. You break rules, you feel macho — “See, I gamed the system!” Also, one who puts his feet on the seat in front at the theatre, smokes in public, parks on the speed-breaker and shouts at workers is thought of as a guy who “gets people to listen.” Breaking one rule, say, jumping a queue, gives you a sense of freedom from all rules. One offender said, “It’s healthy to let off steam once in a while, you know.” When a minor crashed the family BMW into a median, the parent claimed, “He can’t help it, it’s his hormones.” A study by Josephson Institute found that when asked if lying and cheating were necessary to succeed in life, more than 50% of young people are likely to say “Yes!” 
We know the bottomline: breaking rules cannot be justified. No excuse is good enough. No violation of the law is legitimate. You follow rules because it is the honourable thing to do. Being law-abiding reduces chaos and ensures safety. Oh, yes, authorities everywhere try to ensure people follow rules. But the ultimate responsibility for following rules rests with every one of us. We should know right from wrong. We must see ourselves as honest people, in a positive light. Respect for rules is a necessary aspect of modern life. 
And, ah, yes, misdemeanours have a way of coming back to bite us.

Ruling the roost
","Benaras Hindu University in Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, has been titled as an institute of national importance by the government but is infamous for improperly dealing with sexual assault within campus and also lacks leadership by women. Kavita Shah is one of the few faces at the top of the hierarchy at BHU. She is currently the only woman director at the university. She leads the Institute of Environmental and Sustainable Development.
Education
Kavita started off as a chemistry student at women’s college at BHU named Mahila Mahavidyalaya (MMV). Years later, she would set up the first CIL — Central Instrumentation Laboratory here — a deck of necessary scientific instruments. But before she could do this, Kavita had to gather her scientific mettle. She did a Ph.D, also at BHU. Her research question involved a range of biochemical experiments. Following this were post doc stints in Japan and Switzerland. When she returned to India she took up lectureship in NEHU (North East Hill University) in Shillong. As an opportunity propped up, Kavita returned to Varanasi to teach at BHU. She brought her first PhD student with her from Shillong.
Research
Kavita’s scientific life now spans 24 years. After setting up the CIL in the women’s college that is still in use, Kavita moved to the science faculty and then the IESD, of which she is now director. Kavita’s scientific focus is on enzymes and how to make use of them. She won the ‘Women Scientist Award 2011’ from The Biotech Research Society for developing an enzyme-based sensor of the neurotransmitter dopamine. This sensor can monitor levels of dopamine in neurological patients to help administer proper dose of the drug to patients with Alzheimer’s/Parkinson’s diseases. Kavita had found another novel application of this enzyme. Using nanotechnology, she has created a pollutant biosensor from this enzyme. 
Dye houses that exist in thousands in the saree-producing Varanasi area are small units using chemicals affluents. “They discard the waste water directly in the soil after dying, but this water ultimately comes to their own tap water and drinking water or their agricultural land. It gets accumulated in the water table and then there is no way to remove it. To avoid such contamination we are preparing to give dyers the small instruments (bioreactors) at a very low cost so that the contaminated waste water can be treated. We have a prototype for testing it,” she said. 
Additionally, with her students she is involved in mapping polluting sources of the Ganga including sewage and prolonged use as funeral sites that has led to silting. She also has methods to make transgenic tomatoes, genetic sequences of common root rot and protein models of enzymes that come from rice.

Why you should define your fears, instead of your goals ","The difficult choices in life — what we most fear doing, asking, saying — to a large extent, are exactly what we need to do. How can we overcome self-paralysis? American author, and entrepreneur, Tim Ferriss, starts off by explaining how, as a youngster, he decided to commit suicide and had it all planned out. A few lucky coincidences prevented him from going headlong into the plan. However, what scared him the most was the “element of chance”. Ever since, he became methodical about testing different ways of handling ups and downs.
He stresses the importance of differentiating between what you can control, what you cannot, and doing exercises to achieve the former. One way to do this is to visualise the worst-case scenario that you fear, that prevents you from taking action, so that you can in fact, take action. This can be done by a process called fear-setting where you envision and write down your fears in detail — define a worst-case scenario, list ways to prevent it or, if the damage has been done, list ways to repair it. Next, write down what could be the benefits of an attempt or partial success. Finally, examine the cost of inaction .
Ferriss concludes by saying that some fears might be well-founded, but they have to nonetheless, go under the microscope. Doing so may not make all hard choices easy, but it might definitely make them easier.

A responsibility, indeed
","“Did you get caught in the heavy downpour last night?”
“Unfortunately, I did. It rained so hard that I hardly could see the road. I stopped for a while under a tree. By the time it stopped raining, the roads were flooded.”
“Stopping was a sensible thing to do. By the way, it’s not ‘I hardly could see’, but ‘I could hardly see the road’. When you use ‘hardly’ in the middle of a sentence, it should come before the main verb. For example, Devi was so tired, he could hardly stand.”
“How about this example? I was sitting right next to Joy and Dinesh. But they were speaking so softly that I could hardly hear them.”
“Maybe it was a secret that they didn’t want to share with you! We had hardly batted for five overs when it began to pour. The game had to be called off.”
“You’d have needed a boat to play in yesterday’s weather.”
“That’s true! How’s your cousin Remya doing? Does she like her new job?”
“She called up yesterday to say that she is coming here on work next week. Said that she loves the new job — but hasn’t been sleeping well because of all the responsibilities.”
“You know what they say. ‘Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown’. I’m sure she’ll...”
“Crown? What crown? What are you talking about?”
“A king usually wears a crown, doesn’t he? Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown is a line from Shakespeare’s Henry IV. What it means is that someone with a great deal of responsibility — like a king, for example — is constantly worried about the things he has to do, and therefore seldom sleeps well.”
“As Peter Parker’s uncle says in the Spiderman movie, ‘with great power comes great responsibility’. The more responsibility, the more worries.”
“Exactly! Kishore says that he hasn’t been sleeping well after having been promoted to Dean. Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown, I guess.”
“When Mahesh was offered the CEO’s post, he turned it down. Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown, he said.”
“Didn’t the company apply pressure on him to accept the post?”
Cowed into
“You know Mahesh. He refused to be cowed into doing anything he didn’t want to.”
“Cowed into doing something? Does it mean bullied into doing something?”
“I guess you could say that. When you ‘cow someone into doing something’, you frighten them into doing it. You intimidate them or threaten them. For example, the students refused to be cowed into accepting the new dress code proposed by the management.”
“Unlike Mahesh, my cousin Ganesh was cowed into accepting a position he wasn’t really interested in.”
“That is life! We are all cowed into doing things we don’t really want to.”
“Tell me, how is the word c..i..a..o pronounced?”
“It’s pronounced like the word ‘chow’. The ‘c’ sounds like the ‘ch’ in ‘chips’ and ‘cheese’ and the ‘iao’ sounds like the ‘ow’ in ‘how and ‘cow’.
“I see. I came across the word in a novel that I’m reading. What does it mean?”
“It’s an informal way of saying good bye.”
“In that case, I’d better go, then. Ciao.”
“Ciao!”
