On stage, exams must be more than memory
"," About fifteen thousand dance and music learners appear every year for exams conducted by Karnataka Secondary Education Examination Board (KSEEB) under various categories all over the State. Karnataka has been the only State in the country to have had the tradition of holding cultural exams at such an enormous scale. It has almost become customary for learners in most cultural institutes in the State to apply for these exams after they are adequately trained. While most gurus acknowledge the constitution of these exams for a variety of reasons, they equally observe serious impediments that are hindering their quality and propagation. The Hindu strikes a conversation with some of the noted Bharatanatyam, Kuchipudi, Carnatic music and percussion gurus and learners in Bangalore on the state, working and the relevance of exam in these performing arts. 
Serious practise of any performing art can be done without an examination system in place, as the legendary masters did in the earlier times. “But the idea of exam helps children get more engrossed in the art,” says Harini N.R. who teaches Carnatic music at the Percussive Arts Centre, Jayanagar. As children in their young age would not have developed sincere inclination towards anything in particular, it is easier to make them concentrate, learn and remember in the name of exam, she feels. “It sets a time-frame for students within which they are required to master a set of things prescribed by the syllabus. This streamlines learning which otherwise would take its own time depending on the student’s interest and calibre,” observes Harini, under whose guidance about 70 students have so far written junior and senior exams in Carnatic vocal category. 




“When it comes to performing arts, what is visible to the bare eyes is just the performing part of it. Students are astonished to know that there exists ‘theory’ for dance too!” observes budding Kuchipudi danseuse Prateeksha Kashi. It is the aspect of theory, emphasised by these exams, that acts as an eye-opener for many, including parents, she says. “When they take up junior exams, children realise that like any other subject they study in school, dance too is a discipline in itself and as expansive as the ocean,” she adds.
Another aspect that the dance exams make students learn is the application skills. For example, she explains, “though students would have tried out many hastas in adavus or items, when they get to know why these mudras are used, they begin to think.”




“It is not that teachers do not impart knowledge about dance, its various forms, styles, lineage of gurus and more in the regular classes, they do, at least those who are committed to disseminate their art form. But most of it gets dispersed in the air,” says Prateeksha. Only when the students have had the experience of attending one of these examinations, they pay heed to what is being taught, she feels. Therefore, for Prateeksha, exams have been responsible for transforming the attitude of some children which otherwise would have been an arduous task to achieve. “If some pay attention to their anga shuddi, others make sure they know the meaning of the sahitya they are dancing for, which are changes to be desired in any learner,” she states from the experience she has had at Shambhavi School of Dance, Kengeri.
As the performing items are often different from the traditional ones, a student of dance will get to learn the full margam of a particular style of dance, says a student who has given her senior exam in Bharatanatyam this year. 
As far as syllabus is concerned, the gurus state that it has been quite challenging at every level as it has been revised regularly by the luminaries in each field.




No doubt the intention of these exams which is to promote dance and music forms, provide job opportunities in public and private sector is a noble thought and has translated itself in the lives of many artistes by playing a prominent role in their career in performing arts, there are some systemic issues to be addressed by the Board, feel eminent gurus. 
The problem, firstly, is in the infrastructure and administration, points out Kiran Subramanyam, an established Bharatanatyam teacher. The practical exams are conducted in elementary school classrooms that are badly maintained. “Hygiene and aesthetics are essential for a dance presentation and that forms dignity for the art,” he claims. 
Over the decades, there has been a drastic reduction in the number of senior teachers as examiners. “The disrespectful treatment coupled with meagre remuneration has made many experts not to engage with the Board,” informs Kiran. 
As a result, the quality of experience that the student is required to undergo during the exam gets diluted, observes Kuchipudi exponent Vyjayanthi Kashi. Recalling her own experience of being watched by personalities as tall as U.S. Krishna Rao during the exams conducted by Sangeet Natak Academy, she reveals, “remembering those moments of dancing in front of them, still brings goosebumps for me.” For Vyjayanthi Kashi, the ambience of the room which includes the examiners should be a lifetime experience for anyone attempting this exam. It should be considered nothing less than an arangetram, she adds.
“Given the lack of engagement of senior gurus, the Board is forced to employ those who have just passed vidwat, as examiners for the coming year’s vidwat exam or a senior pass student to sit as an examiner for junior exam,” observes eminent mridangist T.A.S. Mani. He argues that they might have excelled in performance but in order to ask questions in the capacity of an examiner needs years of teaching experience.
For this reason, in Vyjayanthi’s observation, many well-known artistes do not send their own children and students to these exams as they are not convinced of the credibility of the examiners. 
“I have even heard that inexperienced examiners sometimes ridicule students which makes them feel embarrassed and rejected,” states Mani, who has trained hundreds of professional percussionists in India and abroad. 




Mani who has been imparting music education since five decades through Karnataka College of Percussion along with his wife Ramamani, famous vocalist, makes a couple of suggestions for the enhancement of quality of music exams. 
“Every year the committee should meet to verify the application of examiners and appoint adept judges for practical exams. The committee should make sure that the examiners are remunerated adequately and rotated once in two years,” he says. The involvement of prominent gurus to appoint examiners will not only regulate quality but institutionalises the process, keeping favouritism and corruption at bay, feel students.
Other than aiding to gain mastery over the art forms, the music exams lead the way for many to become art teachers in government and private schools. In addition to this, Kiran Subramanyam proposes that students who have passed such exams should be recognised for their extra skills during their higher education as in the US where certain credits are allocated for any special training. “This would take the music exams to a totally different level,” he adds.

Chip and beast
"," “I’m just the messenger. The message is from Nature.” This is the disclaimer that follows every segment of Thank You for Sharing, a new short-format sketch comedy podcast from Saavn’s in-house creative team. 
Hosted by Chip (Chirag Lakhani), who gives quirky facts about animals — like octopus, hippos, anacondas, bats, kangaroos, etc — each of the 12 episodes is sponsored by a fictitious service or product, voiced by Abhimanyu Mullick, Ishani Dasgupta and Shrey Sahjwani. Sketch comedy has been relatively unexplored in the audio world, especially in India. Lakhani says, “When we came up with the idea of having a guy on a beach, giving you animal facts, we thought it was funny, but we weren’t sure that anyone would want to sponsor a show like this. So, we created our own sponsors.”




Each episode opens with an advertisement from a fake, and hilarious, sponsor, followed by a real animal fact. To close the show, there is a sketch about what the product advertised earlier would be like if it were real. For instance, there is the Hmm App — which steps in during long, one-sided phone conversations that require little else from you except the occasional grunt to indicate that you are still on the line. The sketch demonstrates how the makers use it in their helpline, with chuckle-worthy results. Another innovative “service” is the Designated Drinker. If you like to socialise but do not want to take a cab back home, get someone to drink for you instead. The punchlines and sound gags make the three-to-four-minute-long episodes quite enjoyable, and draws a number of laughs. 
Mullick says that comedy is not an easy genre, no matter the medium. “Sketches generally translate better when there’s video that drives the jokes home. In the world of audio, that luxury cannot be afforded. While it had its challenges, the show was a tonne of fun to produce, and we’re looking forward to a second season soon, with more video packages.” 
Thank You for Sharing is available now on Saavn.

Netflix mulls ‘content code’ in India
","Global streaming major Netflix may consider joining a broader initiative to develop a content code that could help in self-regulation of the over-the-top (OTT) media industry in India, a source close to the company said.
Reacting to a news report that Netflix was likely to censor content distributed in the country — a report that Netflix denied in a terse one-line statement — the person, speaking to The Hindu on condition of anonymity, said: “There was a meeting at the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) event on October 30 that invited people from across the entertainment industry along with online portals where self-regulation of content was discussed.”
Discussions at the meeting touched on the possibility of setting up a self-regulatory subscription video-on-demand industry content code, similar to what is followed by ASEAN countries, according to the source. “I can’t confirm if Netflix will do something like this,” the person said, adding “but it stands to reason that they will look at it.”
A recent public interest litigation (PIL) filed at the Nagpur Bench of the Bombay High Court drew the court’s attention to ‘obscene and vulgar’ TV shows being streamed through online portals and sought prescription of some regulatory guidelines.
Delhi-based NGO Justice for Rights Foundation filed a petition in the Delhi High Court complaining of “unregulated, uncertified, sexually explicit, vulgar, profane, and legally restricted content” on online platforms in the country. On being asked by the Delhi High Court to intervene, the Central government admitted that there was no policy on regulating online content.
Last year, Amazon Prime Video removed a portion of the fourth episode of The Grand Tour — where Jeremy Clarkson drives a car made of animal carcasses — respecting Indian sensibilities. The move was largely recognised at the time by media outlets as a preemptive cautionary measure.
According to the source , a willingness to consider self-regulation was misinterpreted as likelihood that the platform may censor content.
“In my understanding, it’s something similar to, for example, parental controls and other measures that will protect children from adult content, a feature that Netflix already offers,” the person said, without elaborating.

It’s a game-off with guns and swords
","Veteran developers Treyarch have really turned the tides of war for this multi-player-only foray with Call of Duty: Black Ops 4, especially after WWII. Embracing the old saying that goes, if you can’t beat ’em, create your own versions of them, as they make the jump into an already-crowded arena dominated by Fortnite and Overwatch.




What’s it about? 
Gone is the single-player story in favour of multi-player, but there is a semblance of a story revolving around The Specialists from Black Ops 3, in the way their back stories unfold in the Specialist HQ. Black Ops 4 is dripping with personality, with a wicked sense of humour that permeates across all its modes. A combination of dead-serious military mumbo jumbo mixed with a dark wit, infusing the game with a raw charm.


How does it play? 
Think of Black Ops 4 as a collection of three multi-player games. One is the Overwatch-like component, with the specialists, who are hero characters with their own abilities and classes. Instead of a limited weapon set per character, you’re free to use any weapon in the game as your primary or secondary; like Destiny 2, each character has a signature power weapon and an ability. Pick a specialist and fight across several modes, like capture the base or heist across several maps. Also, there’s no healer class; instead, every character can heal using a rechargeable stimpack.
The real meat of the game is the massive 100-player Battle Royale, which is the best implementation of the game mode today. Black Ops 4 adds a quicker pace and a more realistic weapon sim element to the experience. Maps are not too big but have a higher density of hidden stuff to discover. There’s satisfaction in the shorter matches, that force 100 players to clash together faster, as the boundaries close in rapidly. The FPS experience makes the action more visceral, and traversal is fun as you run, gun and slide across the map, deploying various weapons and unique gear like shields to defend yourself.
Lastly, the beloved zombie mode that is the hallmark of Black Ops games makes it back with pulp humour. Letting you play through scenarios co-operatively with friends killing Zombies, as they disintegrate in fountains of gore, as you rack up points to open doors or loot chests to get better weapons.
Should you get it? 
A raw and refined experience, Black Ops 4 is the de
finitive multi-player experience that puts together all the best of what’s out there in the world into one package. Also finally, the world gets a refined military Battle Royale done right.
Gather round ye intrepid readers, as we take you back in time to a stage of history — the bloody story of scantily-clad fighters duelling to the death for deadly soul swords. A tale that no history book you’ve ever read has covered, unless of course you’ve taken history lessons in the local game arcades, in which case you’re familiar with the SoulCalibur series. Which emerges from the dark once more in SoulCalibur VI, with one grizzled and grey Witcher in tow.




What’s it about? 
SoulCalibur VI is essentially a reboot of the series, set in the 16th century, telling the story once more about the Soul Edge. A sword so evil that it twists the wearer who wields it into something horrifying, and only the polar opposite, SoulCalibur, can counter it. Packing not one but two story modes, one of which lets you experience the main story, interspersed with one-on-one combat. The second is Libra of Souls, which has you create your own character and fight through a full campaign that has you travel to points on a map. Which, incidentally, is set in India as well as China.


How does it play? 
If you’ve played Tekken, then SoulCalibur VI follows that same 3D arena battle system, as large characters duke it out across some well-animated levels. The game features 22 characters, each wields a different weapon and has a distinct fighting style. Even without going through the moves list, the game is easy enough to just jump in and hold your own. Though, if you get tired of button mashing, there is a surprisingly deep system that will make your head spin. Like the Reversal Edge, which has a complex rock, paper, scissors-like mechanism of countering and dealing with clashes.
It’s fun seeing all the characters appear in smooth HD graphics with detailed costumes. There are also little touches, like visible damage as they fight. The entire roster looks great, from the valkyrie-like Sophitia to the walking spike Voldo, to the overtly sexual Ivy with her sword whip. All of them look and fight great, with excellent battle animations. Fans of The Witcher series will be ecstatic at the inclusion of Geralt of Rivia as a playable character, whose moves are true to the game. That said, even the music kind of reminds you of Wild Hunt.
Where SoulCalibur VI does falter a bit is in its presentation, with slightly dated menus that you have to wade through, with a few rough edges. While characters had colour swaps, it would have been great if they had alternate costumes, just like Street Fighter V, Injustice 2 or even Overwatch. These are small nitpicks in an excellent one-on-one fighter with solid mechanics.
Should you get it? 
If you love one-on-one fighting games, then SoulCalibur VI is right up your alley. With an excellent single-player component and Geralt of Rivia.
The writer is a tech and gaming enthusiast who hopes to one day finish his sci-fi novel

Desire, be a lady tonight

Somewhere, behind closed doors in their solitary world


Somewhere under the sheets with an indifferent lover


Somewhere is the woman who will not be denied

So reads the cover of Sita’s Curse, a poignant novel about a middle class Gujarati housewife, Meera, who chooses to defy society’s norms and makes atypical sexual and relationship choices. According to its author Sreemoyee Piu Kundu, “We have a rich repository of erotic writing in India, but it had to take something like Fifty Shades of Grey for us to wake up to it. I found that exceptionally weird. What happened to the centuries in between?”
She isn’t completely wrong. Erotica is scarcely a new phenomenon in India. There is a deeply entrenched vein of sensuality running through the Indian literary and cultural history — the Kama Sutra, the temples of Khajuraho, the verses of poet-saint Andal, Jayadeva’s Geet Govinda are ample proof. Over time, middle class morality seeped into the system and desire for the sake of desire began to be seen as an illicit pleasure. Sensuality was equated to illogical hedonism and though isolated pockets did get seduced by the sexually explicit writing of authors like Kamala Das, Ismat Chugtai, Shasti Brata and Khushwant Singh as well as the odd anthology of short stories, the audience continued to be a niche one.
Until, of course, EL James’ Fifty Shades of Grey hit the market three years ago. It wasn’t impressive — the story-line was scarcely original (Pauline Reage’s Story of O, Anne Rice’s Sleeping Beauty Triology, Leopold von Sacher-Masoch’s Venus in Furs and Marquis de Sade’s Justine have used a similar theme before and a lot better I must add), the writing was pedestrian, the plot predictable, the characters clichéd and rather limited.
Yet the book sold over 100 million copies worldwide, was translated into 52 languages, it became the fastest selling paperback and talks of a film adaptation are underway. The massive response seems to indicate that this was the first time desire had been chronicled so audaciously.
But James is only a small part of a literary tradition that includes the verses of Sappho, the diaries of Anais Nin, novels such as Lawrence’s Lady Chatterley’s Lover and John Cleland’s Memoirs of Fanny Hill, Emmanuelle Arsan’s memoirs, the poetry of Octavio Paz and Pablo Neruda and many more—timeless classics that delved deep into the various facets of human relationships including sexuality.
However, James managed to procure a far larger audience and went completely mainstream, garnering a huge response from women.
What made it so markedly different? Why did so many women choose to read this book?
“I liked the book because of the characters and how they complemented each other. I did find the sex content exciting but she could have used better language to describe it,” says Rekha Ram, a freelance writer.
Adds Nandita Aggarwal of Hachette, “I think there is a need for women to express themselves and prove that desire is not a forbidden phenomenon. Most of these stories resonate with a lot of women who feel guilty about their sensuality. Perhaps one of the reasons that Fifty Shades of Grey did so well was that it started off by being an e-book. Women are a lot less inhibited online as there is a degree of anonymity.”
And what do women derive from reading these novels?
Sreemoyee says, “The aim of erotica is not a heightened sense of arousal but of consciousness. It is about understanding your body, your desires, your passions, your sexuality and knowing that it is okay to go after it.”
It goes beyond gender dimorphism because as Sreemoyee puts it, “Sex offers a beautiful sameness as two bodies and two souls coalesce. I want Sita’s Curse to be the beginning of a dialogue in which we can voice our needs without fear of being criticised, isolated and banished.”

Going beyond the “boy-meets-girl” pattern "," A lot has been written and debated about the new Netflix original series Sacred Games already. Ever since it hit the streaming platform, earlier this month, the online world has gone into a state of frenzy. While a section of the audience is showering the cast and crew with praises, another bunch is getting busy with the task of making and sharing memes. Either way, this is making the global giant, Netflix, a very happy company.
And, with his turn as the never-dying head of a gang, Nawazuddin Siddiqui, has officially become synonymous with crime dramas. He is, indubitably, the best person in Bollywood to play a gangster today. His character, Ganesh Gaitonde, has been crafted with so much sensitivity and cunningness that it gets hard to call him a heartless person. On the one hand, he kills scores of innocent people just to throw his weight around – and as part of revenge – and, on the other, he doesn’t shy away from acknowledging his love towards Kukoo. This form of duality is present in the other characters of the show, too. But, for now, let’s make Kukoo and Ganesh the centre of attention.
Kukoo isn’t a blink-and-you-miss character, or a passing cloud; she’s a trans-woman (played by Kubra Sait) who’s loved by a cis-hetero man. This phenomenon doesn’t happen every day in the Indian television space. It’s a Kodak moment, in the scripting-sense, that needs to be preserved and studied. The next-generation-filmmakers will take Kukoo as a point of reference to pen similar characters / storylines.
In a poignantly written-and-directed episode, this revelation comes like a storm and passes off like a breeze on the beach. Anurag Kashyap, who has directed these portions, throws breadcrumbs at us exactly minutes before going for the big-scene where Kukoo exposes her man-and-woman parts for Ganesh to look at, and for the bewitched audiences to understand her identity better.




Here’s how it unfolds: Kukoo smiles at one of Ganesh’s associates as he catches her peeing in a urinal in the men’s restroom. And, we think it’s funny because we aren’t accustomed to watching women do that often on-screen. But a heated argument is taking place between Ganesh and his friend (Paritosh, played by Muni Jha) behind a closed door where the latter is arguing about the disgust that Kukoo brings with her presence. He urges Ganesh to marry a “decent girl”. And, if Kukoo is still needed, he can keep her on the side, he states. Kukoo’s ears, unbeknown to herself, catch this piece of conversation. And, in a fit of anger, she walks off with sorrow and regret dancing on her face.
Kashyap uses this built-up tension to show how Ganesh’s heart is in the right place as far as Kukoo is concerned. Upon realizing that the love of his life might have gotten hurt due to Paritosh’s comments, he rushes down a flight of stairs to comfort her, and breaks open the door. After seeing her in a crumpled and hopeless situation, he takes a step forward to utter sweet nothings, and nudges her to “come out of the closet”. At his insistence, she unrobes a little to give a peek into her real-self, all the time yelling, she can’t give him children. However, Ganesh assures her that he’s not at all worried about that. He tells her he wants her, come what may, with a beatific smile.
This wonderful segment tells us that we’ve travelled a long distance in portraying relationships that go beyond the “boy-meets-girl” pattern on television. We’re no longer afraid of exploring newer pastures in the digital field. The makers couldn’t have taken up such subjects within the landscape of traditional TV. So, the onus has fallen on the streaming services to bring us these sets of groundbreaking stories. And, I hope their writers’ rooms are bustling with ideas to tell the tales of marginalized communities.

It’s more than just a feminine touch ","Since quite a long time, in most of the working areas considered for a long time as male domain, women have stepped in and made their presence felt in Bangalore. Take the case of M.R. Laksmamma who is among those rare models who balanced her domestic and social roles efficiently. In spite of being married by the time she was a ten year old, and becoming a mother of seven children, she pursued her studies, graduated and won gold medal in MA examination. Thanks to the support of her family. 
She was very much concerned with the issues of women welfare. In 1945 she was elected unopposed to the Mysore State Legislature. On September 4, 1947 along with. H.C Dasappa and T. Sunandamma, she took an active part in the agitation for the demand of responsible Government in Mysore State. When she was jailed, she had four children and had to leave them with family members. At the prison, she closely studied the pitiable condition of women inmates. She taught them reading, writing and simple calculations. Once she was released, After the release she became an even more stronger activist of the Congress party. She was responsible for the formation of several women organizations including Mahila Mandali Educational Institution which is going strong even today in N.R. Colony, South Bangalore. 
In 1954 AICC meet was held in Sadashivanagar. M.R. Laksmamma was the convener of the women wing. This brought her close to Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi and some other top leaders of Congress. This helped her to widen her sector of service to women. 
All these abilities enabled her to get selected to go to America to study their administrative mechanism. In addition to the given task she even met the vice-president Nixon and Patricia Nixon and discussed in length about the measures taken by them to empower the women. Throughout her tour of America and other countries she used to send her observations regularly to ‘Sodari’ a weekly magazine run by her for women. These well recorded and preserved documents are guidelines and eye openers for the present day elected representatives going abroad for study tours at the cost of public money.
In addition to ably managing various responsible posts, she worked as Girl Guides Commissioner for over two decades and was honoured with Silver Elephant national Award. It is through her initiative Consumer Protection Forum came into existence in 1970. 
In short, M.R. Lakshmamma stands out as a role model to the present day women administrators, politicians and 98 women corparators of BBMP
P.R. Jayalakshmamma is another example of a young girl married at the age of 12, but through her innate talent she grows to gain a prominent place in the who’s who of the city during 1960s. Her husband P.R. Ramaiah was a staunch follower of Mahatma Gandhi, and ran a very popular news paper namely Tayinadu. Influenced by his ideals and principles Jayalakshmamma also actively involved herself in social reformation movements. She was the vice chairman of the Social Welfare Board for quite some time. She was closely associated with several welfare organisations like the Abalashrama, Ashakta Poshaka Sabha etc. she ran a school and orphanage started by the Gokulam Educational Society. She was also a member of the Congress and later the Janata party. She represented Wilson Garden ward as a corporator during the late 50s and early 60s. These words of Justice Hombe Gowda epitomize the magnitude of her contribution to the growth of the city. ‘ … This Wilson Garden Area was a jungle site. Smt. P.R. Jayalaksmamma by her great and continued efforts has converted it into a beautiful extension.. Her work is appreciated by one and all. We, the residents of Wilson Garden are very grateful to her…’ She was also the first Deputy Mayor of Bangalore during 1963-1964. In this capacity also strived hard to improve the conditions of schools, hospitals, libraries run by the corporation .
Mahila Seva Samaja in Basavanagudi, ,more than a century old educational institution stands testimony to the service rendered by the ladies in the field of Education. In 1913, Parvati Chandrashekhara Aiyer founded this with a sole intention of to assist women to be independent. 
After about one hundred years even to the prestigious institution is completely managed by the women. Though Parvati was married at the age of nine, later with the help of oratory, which was a God given gift to her, she led the movement against the child marriage. She was also actively involved with her husband in Theosophy movement in Bangalore. 
When she was honored with Kaiser-i-Hind medal by the British, in January 1927, Right Honorable Srinivasa Shastry wrote that it was an honour to all the woman of India. In 1928, along with her husband Justice Chandrashekara Ayer she had gone to Delhi to meet the viceroy to make him realize the urgent need to focus on women’s empowerment in the country. She died there in a freak accident. Dignitaries like Sir M Visvesvaraya, Anni Baeasant, G.S. Arundale condoled her demise. 
The boulevard from Basavanagudi National High School to Prof Shivashankar Circle on KR Road was named after Parvati. Chandrashekar Aiyer. But it has paved the way for Namma Metro Station. A cement plaque with Parvati Chandra Shekar Aiyer Boulevard written is also missing. An elegant stone building In Vani Vilaasa Hospital premises with Parvati Chandrashekar Women’s Dispensary written on it is also gone. Yet, prestigious institutions such as Mahila Seva Samaja, and Theosophical society remind us of her invaluable contributions to the city. 
St. Marthas Hospital on Nrupatunga Road was started by Good Shepherd Sisters in 1886. Impressed by their selfless dedicated service to the people here, the Maharaja of Mysore gave them land of about 20 acres to continue their service to the city. What started as a fifty bed hospital has grown to become a globally known multi-specialty hospital. Hrudaya Pushpa was sent to Bangalore from Bombay about six decades ago with rupees 50 to start the Brahma Kumari Eswariya Kendra in Bangalore. 
But today, the organisation is a real feminine force, clad in white attire working for spiritual enlightenment of common people.
Sophia High School, Mount Carmel College on Palace Road, Mitralaya school on Mission Road, Karunalaya on Bull Temple Road, Sharada Stree Samaja, Women’s Peace League in Basavanagudi, Mahila Hindi Shikshana Samiti in Chamarajapete, Malleswaram Entrepreneurial Women’s Society, Malleshwaram Ladies Association, Sri Ramakrishna Vivekananda Balakiyara Vidyalaya in Cantonment Sumangali Sevashrama near Hebbal are only a few of the very big list of great ventures under taken by the feminine force.
These are random examples to show the magnitude of the contribution of women in various other fields like, journalism, literature, theatre, fine arts, research, science and technology, IT-BT etc.

From mike to the camera "," Sunethra Nagaraj, popularly known as RJ Nethra, has a gift of the gab; her successful career as an RJ is proof of it. Having interviewed many celebrities during her career and also being the elder sister of actor Rishi (Operation Alamellamma, Kavadu Daari ), it does not come as a surprise that Nethra too has been bitten by the acting bug. 




Having bowled over her listeners with her chatty shows, Nethra will be seen in the thriller 6ne Maili (sixth mile) which releases this Friday. The film is directed by See Ni and she shares the screen with the National Award winning actor Sanchari Vijay. 
Nethra is not new to acting; 6ne Maili is her third film after Aatagara and Ring Road Shuba. 
Ask her what the film is all about and the RJ says, “The film looks at the urban habit of going on weekend treks. Two groups go missing while on a trek in the Western Ghats. A few people get together to find out what actually happened to the missing trekkers.”
Nethra plays one of the missing trekkers. “There is a twist to my character in the second half. Sanchari Vijay’s character and my character have two distinct shades.”
Nethra doesn’t see much of a difference between being an RJ and an actor. “We are constantly emoting — with our voice, face and body. We are creative even when we interact with people and are spontaneous in the manner in which we react to others.” 
What she found challenging was to look good and fresh all the time on screen. “As an RJ I just had to sound good,” who adds that late night shoots were taxing for her. “I always thought I was a night owl, but, during the shoot, I discovered that I tired out easily at night. We had no network as we were in the middle of a forest. We would get lost and had to walk a few miles to reach the next point. We faced many challenges. We had to run in the jungles where there was absolutely no lighting. So certain parts were scary too,” laughs Nethra, who says she will continue with RJing and acting as “RJing is what has made me what I am today.”
He treks on differently




Sanchari Vijay, who has won accolades with his acting prowess will now be seen as a trekker in 6ne Maili. The actor, who won awards for his performance as a transgender in the film Naanu Avanalla...Avalu, says, “6ne Maili is a thriller. My role is challenging. I could relate to it. As a youngster I would take off on trips on my bicycle. These days people drive. Most don’t know much about the destination they are headed towards, but take off randomly and face difficulties once there. The film is about how they face such problems and tackle it.” 
Describing the film as “a director’s film,” Vijay says, “the story is the hero. The background score, the cinematography and every character is important in this film.” 
Talking of the plot, Vijay says, “There is a particular place called 6ne Maili where people disappear. We are 60 artistes in this film and every character will stay on in your mind even after you leave the theatre.” 
The film, reveals Vijay is produced by a neurosurgeon and a certain amount of profit from the film will go towards charity. “It is also technically very well handled. I am a little uncertain if I have done justice to my character as this is very different from all that I have done in the past.” Vijay then gives credit to the make up artist Uma Maheswar for giving him a new look in this film.
“People will connect with this film, which also has a tiny message for every trekker. Except for Nethra and me, every character is chosen to depict their own profession on screen. Like we have a Dr Janaki play a doctor in the film too.”

These TV shows bring mental illness to the forefront ","Because the Netflix algorithm has started to know me a little better, earlier this year I was aggressively wooed by two stories in particular: the controversial TV show 13 Reasons Why (whose second season was released recently), and the much lesser-known 2011 documentary The Woodmans, about the life and works of Francesca Woodman, a photography prodigy who committed suicide at 22. Both of these narratives prominently feature themes of anxiety, depression and suicidal tendencies (The Woodmans also throws in the art/artist dichotomy in the mix). They are part of a growing wave of recent films and TV shows that places mental health issues front and centre: BoJack Horseman, Jessica Jones, This Is Us, Shameless, Broad City, Please Like Me and many, many others.
Rewind to the ’90s
This is not surprising by itself: after all, back in the ’90s, after the stigma around HIV-AIDS was beginning to dissipate, we saw a bunch of excellent stories that involved AIDS, including the Tom Hanks classic Philadelphia, or the assorted works of artist and AIDS activist David Wojnarowicz. What is surprising about television in 2018 is that in most cases (This Is Us and Jessica Jones, in particular), the depiction of mental health issues is sensitive, often directly helpful for patients or caregivers. And in several cases, it is conceptualised by writers with first-hand knowledge of, say, the mechanism and physical symptoms associated with a panic attack. Nick Sheff, one of the writers of 13 Reasons Why, wrote a Vanity Fair op-ed not too long ago, defending the show’s treatment of its protagonist Hannah’s suicide (the scene, although well-shot, makes for deeply uncomfortable viewing). Sheff pointed out that the depiction was drawn accurately from the writer’s own suicide attempt — and similar experiences that he knew of.




It is not as if mental health issues were never touched upon by previous generations of filmmakers. But two things held back the quality of these stories. First, the undeniably widespread nature of the stigma against it. Second, the lack of scientific knowledge meant that characters on the entire mental illness spectrum were all painted with the same broad brushstrokes of ‘madness’ or ‘paagalpan’ in the Indian context. Take Beyhadh, the smash hit Sony soap opera of last year, for example: almost every episode has somebody slagging off the show’s villainous leading lady for being a ‘paagal aurat’ (mad woman).
Modern narratives
Today, however, things have changed for the better. The iconic mental health narratives of the ’70s and the ’80s had focussed steadfastly on the ‘covert’ or ‘private’ aspects of mental illness. Stories were set in lunatic asylums (Asylum, One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest), and key scenes invited viewers into the deeply private moments of mentally ill protagonists (think of Robert De Niro’s masterful mirror scenes in Taxi Driver and Raging Bull). The premises of the asylum were very important because the malefactor, the unspeakable mental illness itself, must be ‘contained’ effectively.




The major mental health narratives of the ongoing epoch are, conversely, concerned with the public — the negotiation of public spaces (schools, offices) while being mentally ill. BoJack Horseman must figure out how not to melt down while talking to Charlie Rose on primetime television. Hannah Baker (from 13 Reasons Why) curses the day she read out her confessional poetry (dealing with anxiety and peer pressure, among other things) in private to a friend; she is soon ‘outed’ as an anxious, probably depressed person.
Public vs private
The case of Jessica Jones (from the eponymous show) is the most instructive one. She is a private investigator recovering from PTSD (posttraumatic stress disorder) — on the surface, the kind of person who would never be publicly noticed. It is her business, after all, to be discrete, hidden away. But her other life, that of a superhero, forces her to take on viable threats in an ‘open and notorious’ manner: the climactic battle of the show, notably, is an open-air sequence with the oodles of space emphasised.




Jones must negotiate the outside world and all that it can throw at her, while being mindful of her PTSD. Her best friend and foster-sister Trish Walker’s case is the converse, although it also involves PTSD. Trish is a radio show host and former child actor, a blond, attractive celebrity. She is also a survivor of physical and mental abuse at the hands of her mother. As an adult, therefore, she is secretive, paranoid, almost to the point of being anti-social. Her flat has panic rooms and deadbolts.
For both Trish and Jessica, the public has bled into the private, against a backdrop of mental illness. And that is the primary conflict that reels in viewers: we see our own stories in these characters’ struggle to function in the public sphere.
Trigger warnings
This is not to say that there aren’t missteps along the way. For all its peccadilloes, I found 13 Reasons Why extremely compelling in parts. However, I do agree that Netflix goofed up big time initially, by not tagging the show with trigger warnings. If you are making mental illness one of your show’s draws, it is surely germane to anticipate the impact on your target audience? In this case, we had a show with brutal, unflinching depictions of rape, clinical depression and suicide. And for a while, it was easily accessible to anyone, without a single trigger warning. Thankfully, this was corrected soon after users spotted it and called out Netflix for the oversight.
Closer home, we do have the odd feature film like Margarita With a Straw or A Death in the Gunj, that treats this subject with empathy. But looking at the likes of Beyhadh, it is fair to say that we will not be getting a This is Us or a Jessica Jones of our own anytime soon.

‘Game of Thrones’ final season to air in the ‘first half’ of 2019, says HBO
"," HBO President of Programming Casey Bloys has revealed that the eighth and final season of Game of Thrones will premiere in the “first half” of 2019.
 According to The Hollywood Reporter, Bloys made the revelation during the the Television Critics Association press tour and also said the final season is “pretty great”.
“I’m not going to talk about what to expect (from the final season) although it’s pretty great. I don’t think we’ve announced a date yet so sometime in ‘19 first half,” Bloys said.
 He also talked about five Game of Thrones spin-offs and said that network is currently only working on one of them. 
“We are doing a pilot that Jane Goodman wrote. Out of five, we’d be lucky to get one that we’re very excited about it. We’re just starting the search for a director (and) casting director,” he said.
 The hit epic fantasy series first premiered in 2011 and its eighth season will marks its culmination. The show is based on the hit book series by George R.R. Martin.

To the Bard, with passion
","It was B.C. Ramachandra Sharma, the Kannada poet, who got Madhav Sharma interested in the works of William Shakespeare and taught him the beauty of words and language. “He saw my love of Shakespeare and encouraged it. I owe my love for Shakespeare to my uncle, K. Swaminthan, who was professor of English at Presidency College, Madras,” says Madhav, who has over five decades experience in the UK in professional theatre, radio, film and television. He is performing Bharat, Blighty and the Bard, directed by Miranda Lapworth, in the city.
The play explores how Shakespeare offered “a brave new world” to Madhav. “It’s wonderful to be back to my home town to perform,” says Madhav. “Shakespeare came from a little town. I am from Bangalore. Through this performance, I want to share my passion for Shakespeare with my fellow Bangaloreans,” says Madhav, who trained at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, London.
Madhav wrote the play after his visit to Kochi in January. “The Kochi Reading Group invited me for their Shakespeare Festival, the founder of the group Indira Outcalt suggested I write something about the similarities between Shakespeare’s life and my life, she told me, ‘you know there are parallels between your life and his.’ She said not to be shy and to write it. I contacted Miranda, whom I’ve known for many years, and we collaborated for this production. The play has some of Shakespeare’s words and some of mine.”
Madhav says Shakespeare isn’t just meant for the intellectual and the high-browed. “ I believe his texts are badly taught. His works need to be spoken and dramatised, that’s the best way to learn it.”

Bharat, Blighty and the Bard has been well-received by audiences in Kochi. Madhav says people must watch it to really feel the magic and the actor’s passion for Shakespeare. The play is being staged at Jagriti Theatre, Whitefield on May 3 at 8 p.m. and on May 4 at 3 p.m. and 6.30 p.m. Tickets are priced at Rs. 300 and are available at bookmyshow.com and at the venue.

Theatre group Sanchaya turns 30
","Among the longstanding theatre groups of Bangalore, Sanchaya stands for a set of values that are consistently being practised by its members, ever since it was founded three decades ago. For many in the theatre fraternity Sanchaya is a surprise -- because the troupe is not run by a single person but a group committed to meaningful theatre.
Sanchaya took birth in 1988 under the guidance of G.S. Rama Rao, a teacher at MES High School, Jayanagar. “It all began when we, as high school students, wanted to stage a play as a tribute to theatre personality S.K. Madhava Rao. After this performance, it became a regular practice to perform plays and soon it took shape of a theatre group,” recounts Keerthi Bhanu, who has been with the group since its inception.
Later it was moulded by the likes of C.G. Krishnamurthy, Suresh Anagalli, S. Surendranath, Joseph, Shashidhar Barighat, Iqbal Ahmed and others in different capacities. “It was C.G.K. who motivated us to ‘think big’ in 1992. He urged us to have faith in theatre. We were able to produce Anke Tappida Shankarlal with a budget of one lakh, a big amount in those days, only because of his encouragement and forethought,” recalls Bhanu.




Recognising a dearth of lighting technicians in Kannada theatre, Sanchaya held a workshop in association with National School of Drama about a decade ago.
“Five lighting technicians who are currently working for various theatre groups, are a result of that workshop,” says Bhanu.
A group of about 80 members practising different professions, Sanchaya has staged 47 plays so far, with every play being staged for at least 25 times. Some of their prominent plays are Pratibimbagalu, Tadroopi, Sahyadri Kaanda and Tempest. When other theatre troupes plan to cut down on the number people required to stage a production, Sanchaya has always made sure that more than 15 members are involved in presenting a play.




“It has been our policy to become larger, including more number of people each time,” adds Bhanu the spokesperson of the group that is thrilled to celebrate the troupe’s 30th anniversary.
At the inauguration ceremony of ‘Sambhrama-30’ on November 30, C. Basavalingaiah, Director, NSD will be the chief guest and television actor Srinivas Prabhu, senior theatre person K.V. Nagarajamurthy and film director Shylaja Nag will grace the function. Theatre director Abbooru Jayateertha, theatre persons Sundar Raja Rao and Uncle Shyam, Ananda Rao, N.E.S.F., Karnataka and K. Nagendra, retired Principal, MES School will be honoured as part of the celebration. The inauguration function will be held at H.N. Kalakshetra, Jayanagar.
Following the inauguration, two plays will be staged at Rangashankara on December 1 and 2. Dario Fo’s Kododilla Bidodilla, translated and directed by Krishna Hebbale, will be staged on December 1. William Shakespere’s Tempest will be performed on December 2. It is translated by Srikanth B.R. and directed by Joseph John.
The plays will be staged at 3.30 p.m. and 7.30 p.m on both the days.

John Krasinski on the rise
"," Jack Ryan, a former marine who now works as an analyst for the CIA, is a true patriot; an upright man with a strong sense of morality. 
The lead character of many a Tom Clancy novel is a readymade fit for the vacuum created by the slew of morally-ambiguous protagonists on our TV screens over the past decade. In John Krasinski, who has remodelled his career drastically since his days as a cast member on the sitcom The Office, the show gets a lead actor who’s got the right mix of charming good looks and intellect (he wrote and directed this year’s sleeper hit, A Quiet Place, after all). 
On paper, it’s a terrific set-up. Even though based on Clancy’s novels, co-creators Carlton Cuse and Graham Roland come up with an altogether original plot for the first season of the Amazon series, in order to reflect real-world conflicts and palatable antagonists. Ryan’s adventures, whether borrowed from existing material, or entirely invented, create the scope for a long-lasting multi-season show, and the streaming service gives Cuse and Roland the showcasing they envisioned for their big-budget TV series. With a plot that spans across six countries, and a bunch of massive action set-pieces, Jack Ryan is meant to be the kind of fast-paced spectacle audiences are more accustomed to watching on the big screen. 
With Cuse (creator of Lost) at the helm, you can be assured character development will be given importance too. The antagonist Suleiman, for example, is a terrorist driven by the atrocities he suffered as a young boy in Yemen, and actor Ali Suliman turns in the best performance of the show. This is firmly Homeland territory, with fanatical villains, world-destroying terror plots, and a righteous protagonist, but without the grimness that TV audiences are accustomed to with similarly-themed shows. 
And while that’s a tightrope walk we could’ve all welcomed, Jack Ryan falls prey to the worst clichés of the action movie genre it so desperately tries to recreate. The hero, for example, is always conveniently present in the wrong place at the right time; complicated plot points (cracking the password of an encrypted hard drive, for example) are resolved with lazily sketched-out ‘eureka’ moments; and dense conflicts are resolved quickly. A lot of it is great fun to watch, frankly, but keep your expectations in check.
Season One of Tom Clancy’s Jack Ryan is now streaming on Amazon Prime Video. Both seasons of Ozark are now streaming on Netflix.

‘13 Reasons Why’ renewed for season three "," Netflix has green lit the third season of its controversial hit series,  13 Reasons Why.
According to The Hollywood Reporter, the teenage drama will return next year with 13 new episodes.
 The announcement comes less than three weeks after the show, one of the most streamed ones on Netflix, returned for its sophomore season. 
 The core cast, including Dylan Minnette, Miles Heizer and Alisha Boe, among others - are all expected to return, except Katherine Langford.
 Langford, who played the lead Hannah Baker, confirmed her exit from the series after its second season bowed out.
 The first season of 13 Reasons Why explored why Hannah committed suicide and the follow-up installment saw the aftermath of her death - her ghostly manifestation for Clay (played by Minnette) or his delusions.
Season two ended with Bryce serving only three months of probation after being arrested on charges of felony sexual assault; gearing up to leave Liberty High School and Clay thwarting a mass shooting at the hands of Tyler - a ticking timebomb. 
Production will resume later this year.

'We'll learn on the job'
","Ask him what bugs him most these days and pat comes the reply, “Everyone seems to have only one question nowadays for me. I can’t understand the question, ‘Are you prepared?’ How can anyone be prepared for fatherhood or anything else as momentous as that?” What? He doesn’t get irked with people asking him about why he has only one film at hand? “That’s secondary. People are more interested in knowing how prepared I am to handle being THE PAPA!” he laughs.
Avantika, Imran's wife, is expected to deliver their first child in June. “We’ll learn on the job. A baby’s coming into our life and we’ve had some practice of being human now. So how difficult can that get? For things that we can’t handle and will eventually know how to handle there's no reason to get all stressed out,” he says, elaborating on his approach to fatherhood. Imran is possibly the first and only actor who decided to proclaim last month that he was officially on paternity leave. On the work front, the actor who was once very enthusiastic about Vikramaditya Motwane’s Bhavesh Joshi, has since opted out and has reportedly been replaced by Sidharth Malhotra (
Student Of The Year, Hasee Toh Phasee). “When I heard Sidharth was doing the film, I thought that was great. I still feel it’s going to be a fabulous movie. I opted out due to some reasons. Vikramaditya and I are not at war because of it. But I don’t want to disrespect our ethics by talking about what happened and why,” he says. Imran has signed Nikhil Advani’s upcoming film, reportedly on the lines of Delhi Belly.
Remind him of the ease with which he essayed that character, and he says, “It was the easiest role of my life. I was being me! That humour — sometimes deadpan, sometimes gawky — is totally me,” he says. Imran will begin work on the movie in mid-July. Ileana D’Cruz is expected to be cast opposite him.

Vallavanukku Pullum Aayudham: Strong lyrics, beautiful singing
","
What it is about

P.V.P.Cinema and Handmade films Production jointly comes out with “Vallavanukku Pullum Aayudham” presented by Pearl V.Potluri and produced by Param V.Potluri and directed by Srinath. The film is a remake of Telugu super hit movie “Mariyada Ramanna”. The audio was released by the director of the Telugu movie S.S.Rajamouli and was received by Santhanam and his unit. The cast includes Santhanam, Ashna Zaveri, Nagineedu, Mirchi Senthil, VTV Ganesh, and Rajakumaran (husband of actor Devayani). The director of photography is Shakthi and Richard M.Nathan, music is scored by Siddarth Vipin, edited by Saikanth, dances are choreographed by Rajesh Kanna and stunts are composed by FEFSI Vijayan and Dilip Subburayan and the art is taken care of by A.R.Mohan. How a young man runs from pillar to post staying in the same house of the people who wants to kill him forms the base of the story line.

What they say


Producer Param V.Potluri: We were having the rights of the Telugu super doper hit movie “Mariyada Ramanna” for nearly two years. We wanted Santhanam to do the lead role in the film but he was busy as usual. We did not want some other actor to do the heroes role in Tamil except Santhanam. So we waited and some months ago I met him again and asked him to act in the Tamil version of the Telugu film. He immediately said ‘yes’. That is how this film became a reality. Now that the film has been finished we are happy that it has come out well.

Director Srinath: I and actor Santhanam are good friends for more than ten years. I started as an assistant director to Kadir and Jeeva and acted in about 30 films as friend of the hero and other roles. My passion was to direct a movie. At one point of time Santhanam told me that both of us must do a movie.
I started writing a script for him. At that time he asked me to see the Telugu movie “Mariyada Ramanna”, which both of us liked and decided to do it in Tamil. I felt that Telugu film is like a talkie movie of Charlie Chaplin. We have done some changes to suit the Tamil audience and when I saw the film in Tamil now, I liked it very much. Bicycle will be portrayed as one of the characters and it will the highlight of the film.

Hero Santhanam: Few of my friends wanted me to do the lead role in the movie. I was happy to do the friends role of the hero and make them laugh to their hearts content. Producer Pottluri wanted me to do the hero role and showed the Telugu film. I was keeping my fingers crossed. When I decided that time has come for me to take a decision I decided to do the film “Vallavanukkum Pullum Ayutham”. Doing a heroes role is really tough as it needs full concentration and a perfect body to fight and dance. In a friends role I was using only my mouth to speak my dialogues. I have worked hard and all my friends also worked with me and now the film is over and I liked it and felt that they would also like it.

Music director Siddarth Vipin: I got a call from Santhanam’s office and I went and met both Santhanam and director Srinath. They told me three conditions and first is I must know music, second I must attend the phone calls and last but not the least, I must not treat the other person as if he is borrowing money from me. I was ready for all the conditions and grabbed the opportunity and worked with at most care and have come up with some good music. All the persons in the unit were happy about the music and appreciated my work.

Music Highlights: There are five numbers in the album and ‘Rail Ade’ written by Na.Muthukumar and sung by Naresh Iyer and Shreya Goshal is the best. The fast kuthu number ‘Takkaru Takkaru’ is mainly for the front benchers and ‘Otrai Devathai’ written by Madhan Karky and sung by Karthik is sure to win the listeners with its beautiful melody and singing by the singer. ‘Chellakkutti’ is written by Lalithanand and sung beautifully by singers Ranjith and Vishnupriya Ravi and the music enhances the number. Ananthu sings the last number in the album, which is the theme song of the movie written by Muthulingam who is always strong in the words.

A digital take
","Digital cinematography is the future of film making, says cinematographer C.J. Rajkumar, known for his work in acclaimed short film Aayeesha, Janaki Vishwanathan’s Kanavu Meippada Vendum and Gnana Rajasekaran’s Periyar. “Film cameras have become obsolete and the recent shutting down of Prasad Film Laboratories only proves it. With the fading away of celluloid film projection in theatres, going digital seems inevitable. Now, almost every film is shot digitally. Imtiaz Ali’s Highway was shot on a Sony F 65. A.R. Murugadoss’s Thuppakki was made with Arri Alexa digital cameras,” he says.
Rajkumar has written Pixel, a book in Tamil, on digital cinematography. It throws light on how cinematography and cinema have evolved with the times. The book, released recently, documents the history of digital cinematography and gives detailed descriptions of cameras, from DSLRs, Canon cinema E.O.S. cameras, Red cinema cameras, Arri Alexa series and Sony cine alta digital motion picture cameras to black magic cinema cameras and lenses. The 21 chapters in the book also cover the topics of data management, editing, post-production, digital colouring and details of cinema cloud computing.
“The book is a guide for beginners as well as cinematographers. I have shared my on-field experience of over a decade in the industry. I have used almost 90 per cent of the cameras described in the book,” he says.
Rajkumar says data management is important in digital cinematography. “Saving high resolution digital images is always a problem. I discuss software that helps one compress them in low-res format for editing. The changes can be recaptured and aligned with the original images,” he explains.
The book has earned appreciation from veterans in the film industry, including Kamal Haasan, late director Balu Mahendra, Mahendran and cinematographer P.C. Sreeram. Balu Mahendra had included Pixel as a part of the cinematography syllabus in his film school. “Their feedback has been encouraging,” Rajkumar recalls.
The author has also worked in films such as Mann, Asthamanam, and Panithuli. His short film En Veettin Mutrathil Oru Maamaram was selected in the competition section at the 59th Berlin International film festival. The Backwaters, another short film in Malayalam, was screened at many international film festivals.
Talking about the origin of digital cinema in India, Rajkumar gives examples from the Tamil film industry. “There have been experimental ventures such as P.C. Sreeram’s Vaanam Vasappadum, Kamal Haasan’s Mumbai Express and S.A. Chandrasekhar’s Mutham. But, it was success of films such as Thavamaai Thavamirindhu and Unnaipol Oruvan (shot in Red digital cameras) that made filmmakers take digital film making seriously.”
Rajkumar lists some of the must-watch digital feature films in the book. He says that 5D Mark II and III cameras are a boon to small budget film makers. Films such as Ballpen (Kannada), Vazhakku Enn 18/9 and Madhubaanakadai have been shot using these. “The market is flooded with thousands of digital cameras. The challenge for a cinematographer is to choose the right camera for the right script.”

The book, designed by Kalaikuviyal, and published by Discovery Book Palace is available at bookstores. Call: 044-65157525 for details.

'Killing Eve' review: a delightfully witty spin on a usually gruesome genre
","I stumbled upon the British comedy, Crashing, a couple of years ago — a sitcom about 20-somethings living on the premises of a defunct hospital. Apart from the wacky setting, the show had some of the most dysfunctional characters I’d seen, and some outrageous sequences. The lead character, and creator, a woman named Phoebe Waller-Bridge, went on to create and play the titular role in Fleabag — another comedy about a damaged protagonist. Both these shows were star-making turns for Waller-Bridge who, as writer, thrives on giving a bizarre twist to the most mundane occurrences.
Waller-Bridge’s latest work as writer/creator is on BBC America’s show, Killing Eve, an adaptation of Luke Jennings’ novella series, Codename Villanelle, about the battle of wits between an MI5 officer, Eve Polastri, and a contract killer, Villanelle. I haven’t read any of Jennings’ novellas, but Waller-Bridge’s quirky, feminist stamp is unmissable.
The first refreshing aspect here is that both, the detective and the killer, are women (female detectives, in fact, are a norm on shows like The Fall and Top of the Lake, but the antagonist is almost always a man). Gruesome murders, inter-departmental rivalry, and the fear and paranoia attached to other serial killer dramas are all part of Killing Eve’s DNA. But even while keeping these familiar tropes alive, Waller-Bridge makes the genre seem fresh with an inventive approach and loads of biting humour.
Killing Eve is the kind of show where, during a discussion about a spine-chilling murder, the protagonist is more concerned with finishing off a croissant, because it’s possibly her first meal of the day. Or when a character storms out of a room after an intense discussion, it turns out he’s only out looking for chocolate.
Waller-Bridge isn’t cast in any of the roles here, but you see facets of the characters she played on Crashing and Fleabag in both Eve and Villanelle. Eve, played by Sandra Oh, isn’t an ambitious detective; she in fact holds a desk job. But her fascination for specific killings around the globe, all of which — it turns out — have been committed by Villanelle, is what draws her to the case. Similarly, Villanelle (Jodie Comer) seems content wiping people off Earth’s face while leading a charmed life in her Paris apartment, but finds herself drawn to Eve’s investigation into her, and Eve specifically.
Both characters experience a deep sense of awe and mutual respect for each other, making it impossible for either to imagine their lives without the other. It’s a love story-cum-dark comedy-cum-procedural, all rolled into one, and the good news is: there’s a Season 2 on its way.

Love, lust and longing "," 
 There is a buzz in the little lane winding around a village in Vypeen island. Lokadharmi, a centre for theatre training, research and performance, tucked in Njarakkal in Ernakulam, is teeming with theatre lovers and thespians. A video camera has been propped up to record the in-house premiere of Shakuntalam, a play scripted and directed by the founder of the institute, Chandradasan. The director emerges out of his earthy-hued play house, speaking to his actors and tech team. A glint in his eyes tells us that he is excited about showcasing the Malayalam musical adaptation of Kalidasa’s Sanskrit text Abhijnana Shakuntalam. 
A modern playwright’s challenge is to recreate a classic text in a way that the contemporary audience can relate to. More than anyone else, Chandradasan, who has a penchant for choosing Greek texts like Medea, Shakespeare’s works like The Tempest and Indian classical dramas like Karnabharam, knows this. “If it does not speak to the times, it becomes a museum piece,” says the director. 
Originally devised for students of the National School of Drama for their academic exercise, the play, in its Hindi version, directed by Chandradasan ran for six houseful shows. 
In the Malayalam version, he scouted for young actors as he was looking for a bubbling energy on stage. “Actor comes first for me and not any other technical aspect. They are my medium.” Just then, an actor in her red flowing costume makes a dash for the director from inside the playhouse. With her straight hair flowing down till her waist and a meditative air, she looks every bit a wise sage. But, the child in the woman is evident when she clarifies with Chandradasan about some details about her hairdo; the conversation ends in a warm hug, with the director promising to visit the green room a few minutes before the performance. “I want them to feel the nuances of their characters and make the process touch the inner core of their being,” says the practitioner who follows the school of Konstantin Stanislavski, tenets of Natyashastra and Greek chorus motif.
Reworking on the text was enlightening in many ways. As he read through the original text, puritan concepts of the romance between Dushyantha-Shakuntala scattered away, he remembers. “When I read between the lines, I realised Shakuntala was just any other girl for Dushyantha, who is known to have numerous affairs. An embodiment of Kamadeva, he is seen with sugarcane bow and arrows made of flowers. For me, Shakuntala’s love for him is an attraction of an adolescent towards a man.”




The final episode of Dushyantha’s memory loss, Shakuntala’s journey to his kingdom and facing rejection from him and Dushyantha remembering her through the ring she left for him, are designed to move the audience to a cathartic climax. But, not without a serious introspection of the original text by Kalidasa through a critical eye and meta narrative. “In my play, Shakuntala does not believe in the ring any more and chooses to leave. Scholars such as Romila Thapar have pointed out that there is no mention of the ring or the curse of a memory loss in the epic. Dushyantha just abandons Shakuntala in the forest and leaves. Since Kalidasa is a royal poet, perhaps, he felt he had to keep alive the good name of the king. Two of my characters voice this thought.” 
Art inspires the playwright who thinks quite visually. Paintings and imageries define the space for his narratives. As we talk, Chandradasan multi-tasks between supervising the stage décor and offering suggestions to the cinematographer on the lighting spots on the stage, strewn with flowers. The entire milieu makes you feel you are in a forest. “The audience has to see something permanently to feel the nuances of the inner feel of the play. It could be static or moving. This is where paintings come to my help.”
Music is designed in a way to rekindle the memory of the 60s’ and 70s’ Malayalam cinema in the audience. Slokas have been condensed into six songs, written by the playwright. A padam composed by Irayimman Thampi has been set to a new tune by Bijibal to convey the sense of lament. “Rendering a sloka becomes ritualistic, distancing the audience from contemporary reality. Songs make them connect instantly. Actors will be singing some live, some are recorded; they will be played on stage with actors’ live renditions overlapping the recorded ones.”




 The fourth act, especially, has evocative moments where Shakuntala is bidding her famous goodbye to the birds, trees and animals in the forest. 
 So, while representing Kanvashram, the breeze, the trees and the birds, he does not use the conventional realistic set but the visual metaphors of paintings and art and set work, designed by Samkutty Pattomkary. There are Raja Ravi Varma-like paintings of women in the backdrop juxtaposed with installations of trees decorated with pink flowers and drooping leaves. The idea is to represent the conflict between the classical strokes of the former with the organic, tribal motifs of the latter. And, this in a way reflects the bigger philosophical conflict of the city vs the forest, which the play reflects on. 
 Dushyantha’s encroachment into the forest can be seen as the invasion of the city on the rural ecosystem, says Chandradasan. “Nature plays an important role in Kalidasa’s work. Shakuntala could be Nature, with Dushyantha embodying the male chauvinistic ideology. This is the central conflict of my retelling of Shakuntalam.” In a way, the location of Lokadharmi reflects its founder’s love for Nature and a raw way of living. “When we talk about Indian theatre, why do we limit ourselves to the metros? Lot of meaningful theatre is happening in the villages of India.”
(The play will be staged in October. Follow Lokadharmi on their Facebook page)

Waging war against Trump: A review of 'The Good Fight'
","There’s something about the Kings and great elevator scenes.
The Kings — Michelle and Robert, spouses and writing partners — created The Good Wife a decade ago; about a lawyer, Alicia Florrick, who gave up her practice to settle for a life of domesticity, but whose politician-husband’s sex scandal forced her back into the courtroom. The show had a stellar run of seven strong seasons, and even though it was created before the current spate of cutting-edge TV shows became a norm, The Good Wife has aged rather well.
One of the show’s most memorable scenes had all its major characters — Alicia, her estranged husband, the woman her husband slept with, and Alicia’s current partner — stuck in an elevator. The uncomfortable pleasantries and awkward silences told us more about these men and women than reams of dialogues could and the Kings showed, in other instances, they had a penchant for crafting simmering drama within the closed confines of a lift.
It’s no surprise, then, that The Good Fight, a spin-off that’s once again shepherded by the Kings (along with Phil Alden Robinson), has some terrific moments staged inside elevators. One of them has the protagonist, Lucca, stuck with an attorney she’s up against and who’s, ironically, the father of her unborn child. The tension is similarly palpable, and the banter bitingly funny.
The Kings, though, have managed to inject more than one winning quality of the original show into the DNA of the spinoff. Much like its origin material, The Good Fight excels in weaving in sociopolitical talking points, and taking a firm anti-establishment stance. While the first season, which premièred last year, flirted with the changing face of America under a new regime, the latest season takes on the administration head-on.
The consequences of ‘Trump’ aren’t just talked about in hushed tones, or serve as abstract plot points, anymore. Instead, The Good Fight takes its title all too seriously, and puts its protagonists on a collision course with several arms of the government. The trio of Diane Lockhart (the inimitable Christine Baranski), Lucca Quinn (Cush Jumbo, adorable) and Maia Rindell (Rose Leslie) have to fight off immigration laws, gun control and a grand jury indictment within a span of 13 tight-knit episodes, and even though they often come up short against an all too-powerful force, their hard-fought survival makes for compelling TV.
What The Good Fight does differently from The Good Wife — and why it will have carved out a respectable place for itself, independent of the original, in time — is wrapping hard truths and uncomfortable realities in a steady dose of humour and wit. A delightful thread running through the season has Lockhart resorting to mind-altering substances that lead to bizarre hallucinations which, ironically, seem to fit in perfectly with the reality of America (and, at times, that of India).
It’s like the Kings know, and want to remind us, that the personal battles of Alicia Florrick (awe-inspiring and enthralling as they were) have no place in the current world, where the fight for survival itself is top priority. In this new world, even the good guys have to get their knuckles dirty.

Marvel Comics legend Stan Lee dead at 95
","Stan Lee, who dreamed up Spider-Man, Iron Man, the Hulk and a cavalcade of other Marvel Comics superheroes that became mythic figures in pop culture with soaring success at the movie box office, died at the age of 95, his daughter said on Monday.
As a writer and editor, Lee was key to the ascension of Marvel into a comic book titan in the 1960s when, in collaboration with artists such as Jack Kirby and Steve Ditko, he created superheroes who would enthrall generations of young readers.
“He felt an obligation to his fans to keep creating,” his daughter J.C. Lee said in a statement to Reuters. “He loved his life and he loved what he did for a living. His family loved him and his fans loved him. He was irreplaceable.”
She did not mention Lee's cause of death but the TMZ celebrity news website said an ambulance was called to Lee's Hollywood Hills home early Monday and that he died at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center.
Americans were familiar with superheroes before Lee, in part thanks to the 1938 launch of Superman by Detective Comics, the company that would become DC Comics, Marvel's archrival.
Lee was widely credited with adding a new layer of complexity and humanity to superheroes. His characters were not made of stone — even if they appeared to have been chiseled from granite. They had love and money worries and endured tragic flaws or feelings of insecurity.
“I felt it would be fun to learn a little about their private lives, about their personalities and show that they are human as well as super,” Lee told NPR News in 2010.
He had help in designing the superheroes but he took full ownership of promoting them.
His creations included web-slinging teenager Spider-Man, the muscle-bound Hulk, mutant outsiders The X-Men, the close-knit Fantastic Four and the playboy-inventor Tony Stark, better known as Iron Man.
Dozens of Marvel Comics movies, with nearly all the major characters Lee created, were produced in the first decades of the 21st century, grossing over $20 billion at theaters worldwide, according to box office analysts.
Spider-Man is one of the most successfully licensed characters ever and he has soared through the New York skyline as a giant inflatable in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade.
Lee, as a hired hand at Marvel, received limited payback on the windfall from his characters.
In a 1998 contract, he wrestled a clause for 10 percent of profits from movies and TV shows with Marvel characters. In 2002, he sued to claim his share, months after “Spider-Man” conquered movie theaters. In a legal settlement three years later, he received a $10 million one-time payment.
Hollywood studios made superheroes the cornerstone of their strategy of producing fewer films and relying on big profits from blockbusters. Some people assumed that, as a result, Lee's wealth had soared. He disputed that.
“I don't have $200 million. I don't have $150 million. I don't have $100 million or anywhere near that,” Lee told Playboy magazine in 2014. Having grown up in the Great Depression, Lee added that he was “happy enough to get a nice paycheck and be treated well.”
In 2008, Lee was awarded the National Medal of Arts, the highest government award for creative artists.
Lee was born as Stanley Martin Lieber in New York on December 28, 1922, the son of Jewish immigrants from Romania. At age 17, he became an errand boy at Timely Comics, the company that would evolve into Marvel. He got the job with help from an inside connection, his uncle, according to Lee's autobiography ”Excelsior!”
Lee soon earned writing duties and promotions. He penned Western stories and romances, as well as superhero tales, and often wrote standing on the porch of the Long Island, New York, home he shared with his wife, actress Joan Lee, whom he married in 1947 and who died in 2017.
The couple had two children, Joan Celia born in 1950 and Jan Lee who died within three days of her birth in 1953.
In 1961 Lee's boss saw a rival publisher's success with caped crusaders and told Lee to dream up a superhero team.
Lee at the time felt comics were a dead-end career. But his wife urged him to give it one more shot and create the complex characters he wanted to, even if it led to his firing.
The result was the Fantastic Four. There was stretchable Mr. Fantastic, his future wife Invisible Woman, her brother the Human Torch and strongman The Thing. They were like a devoted but dysfunctional family.
“Stan's characters were always superheroes that had a certain amount of humanity about them or a flaw,” said Shirrel Rhoades, a former executive vice president of Marvel and its publisher in the mid-1990s.
“As iconic as Superman may be, he's considered a Boy Scout. He doesn't have any real flaws,” Rhoades said. “Whereas you take a Spider-Man, kids identify with him because he had his problems like they did. He suffered from great angst.”
Lee involved his artists in the process of creating the story and even the characters themselves, in what would come to be known as the “Marvel Method.” It sometimes led critics to fault Lee for taking credit for ideas not entirely his own.
He described his creative process to Reuters in outlining how he came up with his character Thor, the god of thunder borrowed from Norse mythology.
“I was trying to think of something that would be totally different,” he said. “What could be bigger and even more powerful than the Hulk? And I figured why not a legendary god?”
To give Thor more rhetorical punch, Lee gave him dialogue styled after the Bible and Shakespeare.
As for Tony Stark-Iron Man, he was based on industrialist Howard Hughes, Lee told interviewers.
Lee became Marvel's publisher in 1972. He went on the lecture circuit, moved to Los Angeles in 1980 and pursued opportunities for his characters in movies and television.
Through it all, he kept connected with fans, writing a column called “Stan's Soapbox” in which he often slipped in his catchphrase “'Nuff Said” or the sign-off “Excelsior!” In his later years, he gave constant updates via Twitter.
“Stan was a character. He was a character as much as any he ever created,” Rhoades said. “He created himself, in a way.”
He also made cameos in most Marvel films, pulling a girl away from falling debris in 2002's “Spider-Man” and serving as an emcee at a strip club in 2016's “Deadpool.”
The Walt Disney Co bought Marvel Entertainment in 2009 for $4 billion in a deal to expand Disney's roster of characters, with the most iconic ones having been Lee's handiwork.
By that point, Lee had all but parted ways with Marvel after being made a chairman emeritus of the company. But even in his 80s and 90s, Lee was a wellspring of new projects, running a company called POW! Entertainment.
“His greatest legacy will be not only the co-creation of his characters but the way he helped to build the culture that comics have become, which is a pretty significant one,” said Robert Thompson, a pop culture expert at Syracuse University.

Ambareesh was like none other ","The ageing and elderly Anand Kumar returned to his home in Mysore with his siblings after performing an elaborate ceremony to mark the first year of the demise of their younger brother, a doctor. Just when they were settling, he saw his siblings bundle into a car after hushed confabulations and leave in a hurry. It was only when he turned on the TV that he learnt about the demise of his brother Ambareesh. The family was worried about how he would take it since Anand Kumar had undergone multiple heart surgeries and injured his leg recently. His son’s friends rushed home and offered to take him to Bengaluru the next day. 
“They knew his fans would swarm the place. I went directly to Kanteerava Stadium and returned the next day for the cremation,” said the doting elder brother, his laboured voice conveying his loss. “My last conversation was when I invited him for a function to honour my son Chandan Kumar the flautist. He agreed, but didn’t turn up. I later learnt he had come to Mandya but returned due to ill health. One of my sons who was very close to him fainted and another rushed from the U.S. I sat with SM Krishna when the last rites were being performed and we reminisced fondly about their bond.”




I had met Ambareesh with Rajendra Singh Babu at Hotel Woodlands in Bengaluru where he had a permanent ‘cottage’. My first interaction with him came when I was visiting my friend cinematographer Gowrishanker. Gowri got a call from Ambi (as Gowri addressed Ambareesh),summoning him pronto because the expensive camera the actor had recently bought wasn’t working. Gowri asked me to accompany him since I’d done a course in photography. It was near noon and Ambi was in the kind of silken robe rich people in films wear when they retire for the night. We found that the camera was fine but the batteries had died. “Shows how much I know about cameras,” smiled Ambi. After some small talk, he insisted Gowri share the freshly prepared Biriyani while offering to get me idlis from a nearby eatery.
I wouldn’t claim to know him very well though we kept bumping into each other. There would be a flurry when he called the late R.T. Narayan, Ramya’s foster father, to announce he was visiting. A bottle of his favourite Scotch would be fished out and a Man Friday would mix it with the right amount of water before his arrival. There would be discussions about cinema and mostly the ever tumultuous political scene. He was as much a reluctant politician as he was an actor. He had to be dragged by his friends to Premier Studios where the screen test for ‘Nagara Havu’ was being held. Even his mentor Puttanna Kanagal tolerated his late coming, insisting he be in most of his films after ‘Nagara Havu’. “It was not intentional. I would be hosting friends from Madras. On the way to the studio I would think of excuses and Puttanna would sulk. He would say he was there to tell tales not listen to cock and bull stories.”




Everyone has an Ambareesh anecdote. His producer friend Hitesh Jhabak called from Chennai to say he was moved to tears watching the funeral. “I had come to Bangalore to watch a India-Pakistan cricket match with common friends but decided to stay back in Bowring Institute and watch it on TV since I would have to climb stairs at the stadium. My friends had left when Ambareesh who had heard about this swept in. He insisted I accompany him, bypassed security and took me to the ground floor of the pavilion. He got me a comfortable seat and then left. It was so touching because I didn’t know him as well as my friends. That’s Ambareesh and the reason people love him,” he said.
If you’re a prude you’d find Ambareesh's boisterous nature and language generously sprinkled with profanity and rude. Some people tolerated more than appreciated this side of his nature temporarily, till he effortlessly won them over with his large-heartedness and hospitality. I was once at the airport to receive my sister-in-law from Malaysia. Ambareesh, who had travelled by the same flight, obviously disembarked first and passed by after wishing me. After a few minutes, he returned and asked why I was there and left only after enquiring if I needed any help with Customs. These tiny gestures would disarm anyone. 
Sumalatha proved to be the magical calming factor in his life. In what is considered his most candid interview in print I asked if he had warned her that he was not marriage material. “I did. I never planned to marry. When I built a house, I wasted a dance floor, swimming pool and things I cannot mention. I wanted a Bohemian lifestyle. Now I feel if I hadn’t married her, my life would have remained incomplete,” he said, with a twinkle in his eyes. His friends like Rajni and Chiranjeevi advised him to give up smoking but he didn’t. “Believe me, my liver is healthier than Baba Ramdev’s, but I neglected my lungs. I could not walk one day,” said Ambi, with a tinge of regret.




Sumalatha laughed when I asked if she had consulted colleagues about Ambi who had the reputation of a Lothario. “There was no need. Suhasini asked me to watch out. People were full of stories. My make-up man advised me to not even sit close to him. Personally, I liked him from day one. I relied on the opinion of spot boys and their tales of his generosity. The set came alive after he entered. He drew me out and made me laugh. I knew I could not change him. Some things did bother me. He would be surrounded by fifty friends in the evening. It was the reason for quarrels, but later I took it in my stride because he was happiest when he was with his friends.” When Sumalatha called him, ‘Goddess’ flashed on Ambi’s mobile.




It’s strange why Ambareesh neglected his health since he had every reason to live long, not only for his doting wife and son, but the amount of love he received and gave to everyone he came in contact with. He confessed to sheer negligence. It was probably too late before he realised the extent of damage his indulgences had inflicted. People will miss him for different reasons but the Kannada film industry has lost its most colourful personality. He would have opened a bottle of the best Scotch to celebrate his reunion with Raj, Vishnu and Shankar Nag though. The good times continue for Ambi wherever he is. For once his mentor Puttanna Kanagal will berate him for coming early!

Sartaj Singh and Ganesh Gaitonde enter the Netflix universe
"," Vikram Chandra is amused at my opening question. I’ve asked him about the whereabouts of one of his protagonists from his 2006 Bombay Noir novel, Sacred Games – a somewhere-in-his-40s mildly successful divorced police officer with a grand sounding name – Sartaj Singh. Chandra bubbles over with laughter, “I tried very hard not to think of what he was trying to do. A lot of readers [love Sartaj] and especially women have a special relationship with Mr Singh. He has plagued me in that way,” he replies with dancing eyes and an indulgent look.
Singh is all set to play out in the streaming universe with actor Saif Ali Khan essaying the sardar inspector this Friday. Khan along with Nawazuddin Siddiqui and Radhika Apte headline the first original Netflix show to come out of India which is adapted from Chandra’s novel. The book, drenched in Mumbai’s politics – gangsters, the police and the film world – has an epic scale, neat storylines, is driven by plot and is replete with endearing characters – primary among whom is Singh and the gangster Ganesh Gaitonde (Siddiqui). I recently re-read the book, in anticipation of watching the show and feel possessive of its vast, well-researched material, its inside gaze on a city we all love to hate. How will it translate onto screen with integrity, I ask Chandra with some concern. He responds with surprising detachment, “I decided very early that [I] have to let go of the book. When [you] translate from one medium to another, if you do a literal translation you’ll leave all the poetry behind. It’s got to be a recreation. Even that is a bad word – it’s a transcreation for something like [Sacred Games] where [the Netflix show] exists in its own universe in its own right. They have done a fantastic job of achieving that. It’s quite compelling,” he says convincingly. I’m reminded of Chandra’s description of a Buddhist mandala being drawn by Tibetan monks, keenly observed by Singh in the book. The mandala, representative of the universe is meticulously drawn out and then later destroyed.




Room for ambition
Chandra moved to Mumbai after a longish stint at Mayo College, Ajmer, “I was sick of boarding school, the discipline and the tightness,” he shares. He spent three years studying at St Xavier’s College and fell in love with the city. “It felt like home. Thousands of people come everyday from all over the country of various classes and statuses and everyone finds a place. Then they develop this weird hate/love attachment [to Mumbai]. There’s an energy, that is very compelling and you thrive on that. There’s room for ambition – all of [which] make for a very heady mix,” shares Chandra while emphasising why Mumbai feels like home. At one time, he would come to Mumbai several times in a year, now reduced to two annual trips owing to school and teaching schedules. Both Chandra and his wife, writer Melanie Abrams teach at the University of California, Berkeley and have two children ages eight and ten. Chandra is also busy with his software business, Granthika that is in its beta stage. The software connects text with the knowledge created in it — born from the need of an author like Chandra writing a novel, like say Sacred Games – has potential to be applied to legal writing, journalism, corporate documentation and scientific publishing.
Writing an epic
So where did the spark for Sacred Games come from? “I had this very strange persistent image of Sartaj talking to a gangster on an intercom. I had no idea who that guy inside was,” he says. The image was recalled from a visit to a gangster’s den during the close-to-ten years of research that Chandra undertook for the book. “He had CCTVs up and down the street and this bank of monitors. He had been able to see us walking up the street from half a mile away. He had an armoured door and an intercom. That is where it started,” he says while describing the writing process. “I start asking questions about characters – who is the guy inside? Why is he there? It [was a] very slow process of discovery.” A discovery that was helped by friends like journalist Hussain Zaidi and police officers, several of whom have been acknowledged in the book.
Chandra had watched — like everyone else in the city during the 80s and 90s — the growth of organised crime, the increasing levels of violence. “That [in]famous (1991) shootout at Lokhandwala? We were living [in Lokhandwalathen] and my father and I were driving home one day. Suddenly, there was this automatic weapons fireechoing off the buildings. It was about three blocks down from our house and we had no idea what was going on.” Chandra has strong links to the film industry, which was under extortion threats at the time. “I had colleagues and friends who were targets. I knew people who had paid up, I knew people who had been shot at. I was curious about why it was happening. I asked my friends, Hussain Zaidi and a couple of cops that I was friends with to introduce me to people so that I could understand what [was] going on.” The intense research led to a sprawling novel that crisscrossed the country (and sometimes the globe) in its narrative and yet tied up all its loose ends in Mumbai. As he says, “It’s not like [I was] making a documentary but [I did] want to convey the feeling of texture of someone’s life.”
Pivotal to narrative
The show is being made 12 years after Sacred Games was published. So is it still relevant? Chandra’s response is quick, “Crime and corruption is ongoing, the use of religion and modern media in politics – all of which are as alive as ever. [The writers and directors] have done a wonderful job of integrating all of that in a re-visioning of [Sacred Games]. As stated before Chandra wasn’t a part of the writing of the series, but attached as a consultant to the show. “They’ve got a wonderful, hugely talented team of writers [Varun Grover, Vasant Nath and Smita Singh] and they would send me ideas and I would react to it. I think long-form television is the proper medium for [Sacred Games] – we are living in golden age of television. Chandra credits this kind of long-form content with doing what Victorian novels did, which is exploring an entire culture but cinematically. He’s also delighted by how the series has turned out to be a multilingual one. “There are entire scenes in Marathi and Punjabi. It’s the way that we Indians actually live and talk. The writers have done that effectively.” And what about the casting? Chandra’s approval is swift, “The performances from everyone, all the characters [are] just brilliant. I am very pleased and happy.”
Mumbai as a character
Did he ever think of the city of Mumbai as a character in the book? “Not consciously but I was aware how much the characters had a relationship with the city. Especially Ganesh [Gaitonde] in that he comes from outside as an orphan and tries to use this karmbhoomi make his way forward.” While Singh is the son of Partition refugees, another pivotal character Zoya Mirza is from Lucknow. “Then the local inhabitants have a very particular relationship with the city. Katekar is an old-time Maharashtrian guy, I was trying to get at their understanding of the city and in that – that inadvertently created Bombay as a character.” For Chandra, the beauty of the city lay in its details, “If Sartaj has spent his day on his motorcycle driving from one end of the city to the other then what does that feel like? When you do that naturally the city enters,” he states.

Teenybopper whopper: A review of American Vandal Season 2
","In a study conducted in 2017, it was revealed that American teens spent 27% of their time watching Netflix among all entertainment consumed; second only to YouTube.
Netflix has always been big on data. Back in 2011, they won a bidding war to produce their first original, House Of Cards, and green-lit the first two seasons of the show before even a single scene was shot. Why? It had data that showed audiences were a fan of the original House of Cards (UK), and that all Kevin Spacey films and David Fincher movies drew eyeballs on the streaming service. It was all the push they needed to make a 100 million dollar gamble and it paid off.
It’s not entirely surprising, then that Netflix is big on teen dramas at the moment, especially after the runaway success of 13 Reasons Why a couple years ago. Among them is Elite. Set in a prestigious educational institution, Las Encinas, which is nestled among the scenic mountains of Spain, the drama revolves around three under-privileged students who get a full scholarship after the building of their local school collapses. 
The show intercuts between a murder investigation being conducted in the present and the three students getting bullied by more influential students in the past. Following a 13 Reasons Why-meets-Riverdale-meets-How To Get Away With Murder-meets-Gossip Girl template, the show is overcrowded with ideas, and exhaustingly mundane. Another familiar element is the presence of actors from La Casa De Papel, another Spanish hit on Netflix, but their presence doesn’t lift the storytelling in any way. Avoidable.
The high school show to beat all others, though, is American Vandal, the sophomore season of which premièred recently. 
A satire that doffs its hat to some of the most stellar documentaries on Netflix — the plot of Making A Murderer and the narrative style of The Keepers — American Vandal is unlike other mockumentaries in that it’s not a story within a story, but strictly follows the rules of the most hard-hitting documentaries even while dealing with outrageous incidents. 
The first season began with drone shots of Hanover High School in Oceanside, California, as a solemn voice-over implied that the peace of the city would be destroyed by a dastardly crime — the vandalism of the vehicles belonging to the school’s teaching faculty, in the form of penis-shaped graffiti. It’s impossible to keep a straight face while watching an intense dissection about the implications of penis-shaped graffiti, and the first season kept the humour intact throughout its run.
But it’s the latest season where American Vandal really finds its tone. It begins with another ill-fated incident: students of St Bernadine school suddenly feel the urge to defecate after consuming lemonade during the lunch break, resulting in chaos as hundreds go pooping all across the school premises. It’s an incident that requires the thorough investigative abilities of Peter Maldonado and Sam Ecklund, the filmmakers whose Hanover High documentary travelled far and wide. 
While retaining its tongue-in-cheek wit, the new season isn’t only focussed on getting the laughs, but also in designing a thicker plot that gets you deeper in. It’s all quite silly when you think about it, but the skill involved in balancing rip-roaring fiction with somber documentary storytelling is what makes American Vandal unlike any other teen drama at the moment, on Netflix and otherwise. 
The first two seasons of American Vandal are streaming on Netflix.

Netflix to develop adaptations of 'The Chronicles of Narnia'
","The lion, the witch and the famous wardrobe of C.S. Lewis' 'Chronicles of Narnia' are all getting a reboot soon. Online streaming platform Netflix, has entered into a multi-year deal with the C.S. Lewis Company to develop stories from across the Narnia universe into series and films, a Netflix press release said. All series and films produced through the deal will be Netflix productions. The deal marks the first time that rights to the entire seven books of the Narnia universe have been held by the same company.
The C.S. Lewis books already have a presence in Hollywood with three movies being made on the series. “Families have fallen in love with characters like Aslan and the entire world of Narnia, and we’re thrilled to be their home for years to come,” said Ted Sarandos, Chief Content Officer, Netflix. 
The Chronicles of Narnia is a series of seven fantasy novels, considered one of the greatest works of author C. S. Lewis. Set in a magical land called Narnia, the books feature various adventures of the protagonists who are children, while also unveiling the history of Narnia. The majestic lion -- Aslan -- aids the children who get magically transported to Narnia with the help of a cupboard. In total the Narnia books have sold more than 100 million copies and been translated into more than 47 languages worldwide. 
Netflix has ventured into giving a reboot to children's fantasy fiction novels for quite some time now. Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events starring Neil Patrick Harris, Anne with an E which is based on the 1908 novel Anne of Green Gables, are some of the other books-to-web shows that Netflix has come out with.

Angad Singh Ranyal’s guide to comedy
"," “Stand-up comedy has the potential to influence people,” says Angad Singh Ranyal, who is in town tonight with his new show Kaafi Filmy. “Comedians are generally very socially aware and if that message is mixed with jokes, it tends to stay in the audience’s mind for longer,” he adds.
Family and friends
In his own mind, however, this was not the top career choice when he went after an MBA in Mumbai, de rigueur engineering degree already in hand. But fate decided to introduce him to stand-up comedy and, soon, he was hooked. “Quitting my job and moving into comedy was a well-planned decision,” says Ranyal, who cleared his massive post-MBA student loan before announcing the career shift to his family. After four — startled — months to get their heads round the idea, they are now enormously supportive. 
He shares, amusedly, that even for poorly-received shows, his family finds a way to blame everything other than his performance. “Once they said, the auditorium has bad food, so… how can people enjoy good jokes after eating bad food?”
Another force that shaped him is East India Comedy. As an intern, the opportunity was crucial in polishing his writing skills. Now, he does web series, sketches and shows with them.
Local influences
Ranyal is no stranger to Chennai, having performed here twice before. But audiences at tonight’s show will no doubt find plenty of new giggles. “Being a movie buff, I will talk a lot about today’s movie watching-experience,” which will segue into “my first fight in school, how it’s difficult to make new friends at 30, and why I hate long drives. I do a lot more of story-telling today; it’s great fun to take the audience down your memory lane”.
If you thought telling jokes was easy business, think again: it requires time and plenty of practice. With the current tour, which began in March, Ranyal feels he hits new levels with every performance and that his performance-readiness is now at 90%. “The more you perform, the better your writing gets. When I look at some of my old jokes, I cringe.” 
He prophecies this will be the case again, when he looks back at his current jokes three years hence. “And if that doesn’t happen, it means I haven’t grown as a writer!”
Religion is a topic he keeps away from and he tends not to add too much “local” flavour in his pan-India tours. “I’m from Delhi but still haven’t added any Delhi references when I perform there. Of course, my manager thinks this is an excuse, and I’m just lazy!”
In reality, laziness is not an option, given that Ranyal does some 150 shows a year. How does he find the focus to go on? “Once you start making people laugh, you just can’t stop till people stop laughing!”

'Narcos: Mexico' - old wine in an old bottle
","A recent article in Vanity Fair spoke about how the era of Netflix’s first phase of serial programming is nearing its end. House Of Cards finished its run (with a whimper, I might add) recently, and the still-popular Orange Is The New Black will bow out next year. With Bloodline, Sense8, and Marco Polo already gone, and the streaming service dropping at least half-a-dozen great new shows and original films yearly (the Coen brothers’ new film, The Ballad of Buster Scruggs, released last week), Netflix programming is at a turning point.
Strung midway, between nostalgia and the future, is Narcos, which returned last week in a rebooted avatar called Narcos: Mexico. Few thought the show would have legs after the demise of its most famous character, Pablo Escobar, at the end of the second season, but the real reboot happened last year, when showrunner Eric Newman and his team of writers rounded off the story of Escobar’s biggest rival, the Cali Cartel, in style. The third season made up for the lack of a magnetic central character with solid storytelling and marvellous moments fraught with tension and excitement.
 

Narcos Mexico: Of men and monsters


Narcos: Mexico, really, is more of the same, even though the creators would like us to see it in a new light. For starters, the show once again employs the redundant voice-over technique with the sole purpose of reminding viewers that the drama is, indeed, based on real events. The title theme, even though superimposed with fresh visuals, also remains the same (no complaints there).


What’s truly fresh about Narcos: Mexico — but which never quite realises its potential — is the willingness to take the spotlight away from the villain of the piece. Narcos always kept its bad guys in the forefront. DEA agents Steve Murphy, in the first two seasons, and Javier Pena, in season three, were the ones whose point-of-view we saw the story unfold from, but they never quite went beyond their role of narrators. At best, they remained the foil to the exploits of Escobar and the Cali Cartel.
Narcos: Mexico, instead, plays out like a battle of wits between two men on either side of the law — Kiki Camarena (Michael Pena) and Felix Gallardo (Diego Luna). DEA agent Kiki Camarena finds himself posted in Guadalajara, where he discovers that the Mexican drug business is a well-oiled machine, and the administration hand-in-glove with marijuana traders. Around the same time, Felix Gallardo is rising through the narcos ranks, using his sharp business acumen to unite warring gangsters under a single cartel. These are two very interesting characters, performed well by the respective actors, but both tied down by the constraints of the plot.
At the end of the day — real as the events may be — Narcos: Mexico suffers from all the familiar tropes that make a crime drama. Unchecked ambitions, a powerless law-and-order machinery, distraught families, etc. The writers infuse life in this hackneyed template with some outstanding moments from time to time, and which should be enough to satiate fans of the show… for now.
The question isn’t if the Narcos universe remains as fascinating as it was before, but for how long.

Sans logic or humour
","“Tuck your brains away. Don’t look for logic. Enjoy this full length comedy play.” This was the announcement just before Sowmya’s play, ‘Oodha Colour Ribbon,’ began. The play is written by Chithra Ram and directed by T.V. Radhakrishnan. The play was part of Kartik Fine Arts’ Kodai Nataka Vizha.
Looked like the audience implicitly obeyed those words for there was hardly a sound heard throughout. Of course, many tiptoed out of the hall while the play was in progress, disillusioned by the stale jokes.
It is time playwrights stopped depicting lawyers, constables and auditors in poor light. There are other ways to highlight the sense of humour in them. The dialogue here was just babble.
Addle-brained hero Madhavan with protruding teeth was an insult to Kamal Hassan’s ‘Kalyanaraman.’ Jeyasurya as Senior Advocate Varadachari was the only saving grace.
Every time the hero’s friend Ajith (T. Rajendran) had to deliver a lengthy dialogue, he turned towards the audience and said his bit in a stand-at-ease position. Sure enough, it had the audience in splits.
Now for the plot... Madhavan (P.T. Ramesh), a lawyer, joins Varadachari’s office and falls in love with a junior lawyer, without realising that she is his senior’s daughter. He plans a kidnap drama with help from his friends.
Veteran Karur Rangaraj, convicted because of Varadachari, escapes from jail with the intention of kidnapping his daughter. The friends, meanwhile, kidnap Varadachari’s wife. The captives are taken to the same place and both parties demand a heavy ransom from the senior lawyer. These scenes remind you of the film ‘Ullaththai Alli Thaa.’
The actors are to be sympathised with for being saddled with such a sloppy script.
Looks like the writer and the director themselves followed the announcement to a T. For, the play had neither style nor substance.
At Naradha Gana Sabha, 7 p.m.

Deriving the happiness quotient "," 
Dhanya Varma has scored a perfect 100 and her happiness knows no bounds. Well, when one is anchoring a talk show called The Happiness Project, the happiness has to spill over into the lives of the participants as well. Dhanya, hostess of the show on Kappa TV, which began in October 2017, has hosted 100 guests in her programme, all of which revolved around one’s definition and pursuit of happiness. 
Sharing experiences
“It has been a learning experience that has given me innumerable takeaways. Many of the guests, young and old, newcomers and veterans, have had deep, insightful views to share and each brought in a different USP to the show,” she says. 
It was not only the celebrities who had nuggets of wisdom to share with the viewers. There were pioneers, leaders and survivors, all achievers in one way or the other. 
“For instance, visually challenged Tiffany Brar is not all that well-known to our viewers. We showcased her and her story of courage and it was one of our popular episodes. There was so much one could learn from her. In the same way, Uma Preman has been and continues to be such an inspiration. Her indomitable courage and determination have touched the lives of so many people,” says Dhanya. 
Conceptualised by Sumesh Lal, content head of Kappa TV, the show has a mix of celebrities and bravehearts from different walks of life. Hosted by Dhanya with a great deal of grace, her style of conversation and questions put the guest at ease while they discuss myriad aspects of happiness. “Each guest has his/her happiness quotient. Young actor Kalidas Jayaram pointed out how important it was to spare at least one hour every day for your body. Apparently, his personal physical fitness instructor had impressed him with this simple explanation on the importance of fitness. I thought it was a piece of advice all of us could use. It was such an interesting insight on happiness,” she says over the phone from Kochi, where the full-time, hands-on mother of two lives. 
Refusing to choose a favourite among her guests, she says it would not be fair because all the guests are special and have some kind of inspirational quality or the other. So, how are the guests chosen? “We should feel like talking to them and getting to know them better,” pat comes the answer.
So there was Harish Sivaramakrishnan, lead vocalist of Agam, smiling from ear to ear while talking about the day his daughter was born. That, he said, was the happiest, moment in his life. 
Then there was writer P. Balachandran talking about his tryst with happiness, actor-model Kani reflecting on what keeps her inner light aglow, Nimisha Sajayan on her choices and so on. “V.K. Prakash was another delightful speaker. He says he is able to juggle so many projects because he never wastes time mulling over things. There is so much of positivity and energy about him,” she recalls. 
The only time Dhanya thought she had stumbled was while conversing with musician Shahabaz Aman.
 “It was on a very different level. Although I greatly enjoyed the episode, I wondered how viewers might take it. Later, I was pleasantly surprised when I won a lot of compliments for that particular episode,” she recalls, obviously pleased with the end result. 
She says it is a special privilege to be invited into the personal spaces of the guests. Unlike other interviews where the focus might be on work, family and other issues, in this show, the guest permits viewers to take a peek into his inner self and his mindscape. 
So, where does the show go from here?
“Wait and watch!” she laughs, signing off on a happy note.
(The Happiness Project is telecast on Saturdays at 9.30 pm and on Sundays at 10 am)

The Amazing Spider-Man 2: It’s all coming together
","Where director Marc Webb was finding his feet in The Amazing Spider Man (2012), coming to a big blockbuster after his small, intimate movie debut with 500 Days of Summer, in this sequel he displays a surer hand. While quieter moments are sweet and touching as always, the grand, eye-popping ones are delightfully gob-smacking.
It is graduation day and Peter is running late as he is busy spinning a web around Russian mobster Aleksei Sytsevich. As Spider-Man, Peter goes about saving the city from assorted bad guys but as Peter Parker, he struggles with the promise he made to Gwen’s father about keeping away from her. Peter’s best friend, Harry, returns from boarding school and on his father’s death takes over Oscorp. When Harry learns he has the same degenerative disease that killed his father, he thinks Spider-Man’s blood will save him. Peter is reluctant because he does not know what the side effects would be.
There is also electrical engineer Max Dillon who idolises Spider-Man but like all fans, turns violently against him because of a perceived insult. To add insult to injury, Max falls into a tank of electric eels and turns into a human generator. Peter also wants to find out the truth about his parents’ disappearance. There is a lot going on in Peter’s life and he would need his spidey super powers to stay on top of things.
The movie is engaging, thrilling and very funny. Andrew Garfield makes for a cutely conflicted super hero while Emma Stone as Gwen is the smart, sassy girlfriend we’d all like to have and Sally Field as Aunt May would win favourite aunt competition hands down. Jamie Foxx is self-effacing as Max and manic as Electro while Dane DeHaan looks like a very young Leo DiCaprio as Harry and suitably demented as Green Goblin. Paul Giamatti as Russian mobster and Rhino personifies the hammy and unstoppable.
The colours are happy, the web slinging zingy and the little details like a superhero doing his laundry and colouring all clothes red and blue is delightful. Just two postscripts: As always wait for the end credits to roll for that wee extra and nervous flyers have quite a bit to be anxious about!

Giving a new look "," Telugu cinema has undergone a seemingly imperceptible transformation not only technically but also content wise and I credit Mahesh Babu for a tiny bit. He’s the first Telugu superstar to be seen on-screen wearing normal, classy clothes rather than the garish costumes. He ‘spoke’ rather than ‘deliver dialogues’ and there was casualness about his on-screen demeanour both disarming and charming. For Telugu directors it was always a struggle between their sensibilities and what was perceived as the audience’s taste. The change started probably with getting gifted cinematographers from the Tamil industry on board like Pawan Kalyan insisting on P.C. Sreeram for ‘Kushi’. Incidentally, the camera was cranked by Jeeva, Sreeram’s protégé for the Tamil original. Anyway with these cameramen came classy art directors who made even ‘sets’ look lived in. There were no painted hills and blue skies in the background. Cinematographers like Ratnavelu are revered because they insist on getting involved right from the script stage rather than sign because they’re paid a premium. If the rawness in ‘Rangasthalam’ was applauded then the fine blend of audience aspirations and cinematic chimera in ‘Bharat Ane Nenu’ has set the box-office on fire.
Mahesh Babu’s career, in stock market jargon is full of lower bottoms and higher tops! For every dud like ‘Sainikudu’ there was a blockbuster ‘Srimanthudu’. Growing up on a diet of Rajni and Kamal films while studying in Madras, Mahesh like many of his generation apparently aspires to be a blend of both. He hasn’t shied away from experimenting, by Telugu standards from accepting a psychological thriller like ‘Nenokkadine’ which went kaput. There was the emotional choice, ‘Brahmotsavam’ when he seemed to feel family emotions are what works and the over ambitious ‘Spyder’. All three were duds and pundits were busy writing him off but he’s back with a bang.




‘Bharat Ane Nenu’ starts with swift ‘establishment’ scenes. Bharat jogs to collect his fifth ‘degree’ in a London college like Nagarjuna in ‘Geetanjali’ and even breaks into a song after that. Things turn sombre with an uncle informing him of his father, the Chief Minister’s demise. There are sharply cut flashback sequences of his ‘never at home’ father and a doting mother who instils values in him. There’s a hint of illness when the father asks if she’s ingested her medicines. Mother passes away and enter, the indifferent stepmom. A kind uncle offers to take the lonely child to London and the expressionless father (Sarath Kumar) accedes. Cut to the present and Bharat, on a spin around town is dismayed at the constant honking, rash driving and two-wheelers driving on pavements. There’s political turmoil with his father’s friends and adversaries aspiring to usurp power. His father’s buddy and political advisor decides to thrust the crown on Bharat. The reluctant son ascending the father’s throne is as old as ‘Godfather’ or is it The Ramayana? Anyway Bharat takes his job earnestly and starts by imposing a small fortune as fines for traffic violations. This is when he’s not ogling the typical heroine slurping ice cream and giggling like she’s being tickled by an invisible being. There are the political opponents and father’s pal who turns adversary when he realises his puppet has snipped the thread. The scenes of political intrigue, chicanery and father figure turning foe are succinctly written. Of course, the producer seems to prod the director periodically to add a song here and a fight there. The fact that a good intention alone, even when in power is just not enough in politics is convincingly established. The film abounds with clichés but handled with sensitivity. The director manages to keep you engaged with some pithy lines. The reason for Bharat resigning is pretty weak though but his rant blaming the press effective.
Mahesh Babu is terrific. You can see he likes the character he’s playing and there’s great improvement in his sense of timing and dialogue delivery. He relies on his charming presence more than bone breaking stunts and dances. Prakash Raj as the wily kingmaker steals scenes effortlessly. Kiara makes a confident debut in Telugu. Ravi K. Chandran and national award winner Thiru have cranked the camera and you can see why they’re respected. They impart a touch of class to the briefest of scenes. 
The quality of art direction has improved by leaps and bounds. In the end, credit should go to Kortala Siva who’s graduated from the crass to lend a touch of class. He’s discovered the dialogue writer in himself.
‘Bharat Ane Nenu’ is unrealistic and Utopian. It’s like expecting Kamal to become the next chief minister of Tamil Nadu. Cinema is what we want to see not what reality is. I hope Siva churns out an equally engaging sequel.

'Sanju’, a cinematic gift from Rajkumar Hirani to friend Sanjay Dutt "," 
Most biographies are convenient rather than cathartic confessions, written not to convey regret but convince about reasons for transgressions, moral and criminal if any. You can say it’s a little like history, interpretive and the perspective of the person recording it. Biopics are compressed versions, with a wider reach, condensed and coloured. Somewhere the wafer thin line between reality and what’s being related depends on the perception of the consumer which is what makes the whole process fascinating. Every person feels the vicissitudes he/she has experienced is fit for public consumption in whatever form but very few get the privilege. It could sometimes be more about the struggle than the success. None of us is born with a user manual and it’s the consequences of our choices and decisions that reflect the quality of our lives ultimately.
 

Ranbir Kapoor's 'Sanju' all set to cross ₹200-crore mark


I was not thrilled when I heard Sanjay Dutt’s story thus far was going to be immortalised in celluloid. Honestly, I’m not a fan of Raju Hirani’s cinematic recipe of simplistic solutions like a hug and chanting ‘All ish well’. His films are innocuous but for all his success I’d not bracket him with Hrishikesh Mukerjee or Basu Chaterjee. The most compelling reason to wait for and watch the film is the gifted Ranbir Kapoor and the challenge for him of playing an actor far less talented. It helped to be of similar height but the physical transformation, voice, gait and slightly stoned look are remarkable. Believe me, it’s not easy wearing a hangdog expression constantly.




‘Sanju’ is a cinematic gift from Raju to a friend he obviously adores. Blaming a drug peddler for addiction is like holding ITC responsible for smoking. Ironically Sanjay made all his choices as an adult. It’s not unlike superstars playing anti-hero in a film with a flashback justifying his indiscretions. Sanjay did not imbibe anything more than physical features from his highly respected parents. Raju Hirani paints him as an innocent sucked in by circumstances, but how can someone who doesn’t listen to his best buddy or father be called that. I was not amused by Hirani’s ‘bhalathkar’ brand of humour in ‘3 Idiots’ and there’s a similar sequence here too. The most serious indiscretions are treated lightly like bedding his best friend’s girlfriend and blaming it on her. It’s always a person, the press or the fact that he’s stoned and oblivious of his transgressions, moral or criminal. You can empathise with a star whose family is being threatened but he could have requested for police protection. You could buy a gun legally instead of sourcing it from the mob. Stars hobnobbing with gangsters were common in the nineties. Some did it to flaunt their connections while others were at their beck and call under duress. There is a terrific confrontation scene with Sayaji Shinde when Sanju refuses to attend a ‘visarjan’. This reminded me of Shahrukh Khan relating a similar sequence when I interviewed him. “I was invited to a religious function by people I thought were from the underworld. I declined since I was busy shooting. The next day they landed up at my shooting. I shouted at them for visiting my sets. They took me aside and pulled a gun. I was immobile, numb. I’ve never felt like that in my life. I always felt if someone pulled a gun I’d scream and push them away. But I could not move and he could have killed me. It turned out to be a lighter and they were there to apologise for trying to force me. It was like a scene from a film,” said Shahrukh. The genuinely engaging scenes are few and far between in a cinematic exercise to prove that Sanjay Dutt was not the villain he was made out to be. He was a victim of circumstances, bad company and a monstrous press. You can understand when a celebrated biographer in the film is sceptical to come on board when Sanjay’s wife approaches her to write her husband’s story. Her biggest worry is that truth will be a casualty.
Now I know why Kamal refuses to pen his autobiography. “I cannot be honest and if I am it will hurt a lot of people.” I also understand why Mani Ratnam smiled and murmured, “I’ll think about it,” diplomatically when Sanjay Dutt sidled up to him at a party after his first incarceration and said his life story would make an interesting script. Mani had a far more ambitious and interesting tale in mind about two close friends who turn into political foes. ‘Sanju’ comparatively is like a filmi gossip rag edited by a filmstar!

U.S. networks agree to end casting couch ","The largest U.S. actors’ union and the four major television networks on Saturday agreed to limit auditions in private hotel rooms and homes, ratifying a guideline the screen actors’ guild had enacted on its own following the #MeToo uproar, the union said.
SAG-AFTRA, which represents 1,60,000 actors, and management from ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox reached a tentative agreement on a three-year contract that also includes an array of pay increases, the guild said in a statement. 
The networks and union agreed to language similar to that from the union’s own Guideline No. 1, issued in April, which called for an end to auditions, interviews and similar professional meetings in private hotel rooms or at private residences.
SAG-AFTRA President Gabrielle Carteris said at the time the goal was to eliminate the potential for “predators to exploit performers behind closed doors under the guise of a professional meeting.”
The so-called casting couch has long been used by men seeking sexual favours from actors in exchange for roles in films.
The measures followed the industry outrage after news reports of sexual misconduct by Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein were published.

4K version of Rajinikanth's 1995 superhit 'Muthu' to release in Japan
","Rajinikanth’s 1995 superhit Muthu has been restored in 4K and will be re-released in Tokyo, Japan, this month.
The film directed by K.S. Ravikumar and produced by Kavithalayaa Productions will be released in other screens and cities in Japan by mid-December. 
This is the first time a restored movie is being released abroad. Muthu was launched earlier in Japan as the Dancing Maharaja, acquiring cult status. 
In a short, two-minute video, Rajinikanth has wished the people of Japan and welcomed them (Japanese audience) to watch the film. “This video will be played before the movie begins,” said Kandaswamy Bharathan, joint managing director, Kavithalayaa Productions. The video bytes given by the superstar will be used for promotions across Japanese TV and social media channels.
“We have restored the print in 4K and 5.1 CH surround. We went frame-by-frame and removed the glitches. We roped in a Mumbai-based firm for this purpose,” he added.
In addition to taking up 4K scan and repair work from original negatives, 5.1 CH digital remix was carried out under the supervision of music director A.R. Rahman. It took nine weeks to complete the entire process and give a new avatar to this movie. 
“In the 90s, we had monoaudio and so had to convert it to suit today’s technology,” said Mr. Bharathan. 
The film will be in Tamil with subtitles in Japanese.
Muthu was first released in Japan in October 1998 across 50 screens. The title of the film was Odoru Maharaja’ (Dancing Maharaja) and it completed over a 100-day run with the highest box office collection in the Japanese market then. In 2006, former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh made a special mention about the film in his address to Japan’s Parliament.
According to Mr. Bharathan, the Japanese identified Muthu as a movie of tolerance, compassion and with great human.
The new trailer has been released in Japan and has gone viral. 
Eden Entertainment, a Japanese distribution firm, and Kavithalayaa are working towards making this release a grand success. 
The film will run in over 25 screens with an average seating capacity of 250 each, according to sources.

Hansal Mehta, Apurva Asrani call out ‘Queen’ director Vikas Bahl over harassment allegations
"," Filmmaker Hansal Mehta and screen writer Apurva Asrani are among the first voices from the Hindi film industry to condemned “Queen” director Vikas Bahl over the sexual harassment allegations against him. Last year, a woman employee at Phantom Films, which had Bahl as one of the partners along side Anurag Kashyap, Vikramaditya Motwane and Madhu Mantena, had levelled allegations of molestation against Bahl, who she said behaved inappropriately during a trip to Goa.
In a recent article in Huffpost India, the woman has reiterated the allegations, sharing further details about the incident.
According to the report, in October 2015, the woman reached out to Kashyap and detailed her experience, but no action was taken while Bahl continued to harass her until she finally quit the company. 
Sharing the article on Twitter, Mehta wrote, “Will anybody do anything about this bloody creep or will the industry protect him like it always does?” 
Asrani said such incidents made him feel “sick”. 
“Why was no action taken against Vikas Bahl in over 3 years? To think that the victim had to continue to work in the same office and even be assigned to report to him is awful,” he tweeted. 
Critically-acclaimed filmmaker Onir said it was sad that some of the biggest stars in the Hindi film industry were still working with Bahl. “It’s sad that inspite of knowing the truth... studios and stars continue to turn a blind eye to the perpetrators.” 
Bahl is currently directing his next venture “Super 30”, featuring Hrithik Roshan in the lead.
Quoting the story, “Sacred Games” actor Kubbra Sait tweeted, “The details in here are gory. But necessary to read. May the girl continue to fight knowing that her story isn’t wasted. Thank You for the courage. #MeToo #TimesUp”. 
“Shubh Mangal Saavdhan” director R.S. Prasanna said the revelations were “shocking”. “This is so very shocking. #MeToo seems to have become the forest fire that it deserves to be,” he said. 
Producer-director Nikkhil Advani said serious action must be taken against the culprit.
“Serious action, serious introspection and serious correction is required from an industry that has forever been plagued with ill repute. This is not the story of one girl or one incident but symptomatic of a work ethic at large,” he wrote. 
In the article, which has since become viral on social media, Kashyap has admitted he had failed the woman, three years after he first learnt of the allegations.
“Whatever happened was wrong. We didn’t handle it well, we failed. I cannot blame anyone but myself. But now we are determined to do better. We believe her completely. She has our undying support. What Bahl has done is horrifying. We are already on our path of course correction and will do everything in our capacity to fix it,” Kashyap said.
According to the publication they had also sent detailed questionnaires to Phantom Films’s remaining three partners — Bahl, Motwane and Mantena.
Before the article was published, the four partners Saturday announced that have decided to dissolve their joint banner Phantom Films, without citing the reason for this decision.

Is Bollywood scared of Dalit love?
","In a country where only 5.82% of the population marries outside the community, the very idea of inter-caste marriage and choosing one’s life partner is fantasy. But it is fantasy and desire that are the two key ingredients of commercial Indian cinema. Not surprising then that a big production house like Dharma Productions grabbed the opportunity to remake the Marathi blockbuster Sairat,  which dealt with the theme of exogamy. The just-released Dhadak is Bollywood’s adaptation of Nagraj Manjule’s Marathi tale of a tragic romance between a Dalit boy and an upper-caste girl. 
Dhadak is the second mainstream Hindi film this year after Anurag Kashyap’s Mukkabaazto showcase inter-caste romance. So, are there winds of change sweeping through commercial cinema with major production houses daringly taking on the hot-button issue of caste? 
The answer is complicated. In Dhadak, for instance, the caste identities of the lead characters are different from those in Sairat. The hero, Madhukar Bhagla (Ishaan Khatter), is the only son of a lakeside restaurant owner, and the heroine, Parthavi Singh (Janhvi Kapoor), is the daughter of a renowned politician in Udaipur. 
It’s evident from their surnames that the young man and woman in Dhadak are both from the sacred-thread wearing upper castes. So, in Dhadak, the romance might be inter-caste but, unlike Sairat, both people are from privileged upper castes.
The other inter-caste romance of the year, Mukkabaaz, was also an upper-caste romance — Rajput boy and Brahmin girl.
Much bolder 
Unlike the mainstream films, in sharp contrast are some small productions that dared to centre the story on Dalit protagonists. Neeraj Ghaywan’s Masaan (2015) traced the lives of a Dalit boy and an upper-caste girl, both grieving the loss of their partners. The film ends beautifully on a promising note: the two find themselves on the banks of the Ganges in Allahabad and take a boat ride to the sangam. The ending is both optimistic and fantastical, all we see is the glimmer of a possible romance.
I explored two exogamous relationships in my film Chauranga (2016). One, which plays out as a fantasy, was between a Dalit boy and an upper-caste girl. The boy dreams of her, adores her, enjoys the sight of her but never approaches her. The day he writes her a letter, it turns his world upside down.




The second exogamous affair is shown as a possibility. The upper-caste man and the Dalit woman meet and mate in a cowshed, outside the confines of his upper-caste household. This realised fantasy meets a tragic end when the man accidentally kills her fearing the loss of his honour.
In fantasy
In Sairat, Manjule shows us in vivid detail how the love story of an upper-caste girl and a Dalit boy plays out in life. It looks like any other love story that breaks the ever-present societal barriers of caste and class, but the consequences of such transgressions soon become clear. 
Manjule’s first feature film Fandry also toyed with the idea of inter-caste romance. But it operated purely in the fantasy realm where a Dalit boy silently adores an upper-caste girl and never musters the courage to approach her. When he finally does, his caste and livelihood of rearing pigs is thrown in his face to show him his place.
The realisation of exogamy in Masaan, Chauranga and Sairat unmistakably involved migration to the city. In Sairat, the couple escapes a caste-ridden rural society to seek jobs and a possible future in urban factories. 
In Masaan, the boy and the girl migrate from a puritan Varanasi to Allahabad, the city of confluence. Interestingly, the girl finds a job in the railways and the boy is hired as a civil engineer, both professions distinct symbols of modernity. In Chauranga, the lone Dalit survivor boards a goods train carrying coal to save his life. The coal, train and migrant labourer, all three are necessary ingredients of modernity.
Unlike these smaller films that boldly dealt with caste and inter-caste relationships, the bigger Hindi films restrict their flings with caste to upper-caste romances alone. Clearly, their interest lies in only capitalising on the fantasy of inter-caste marriage and steering clear of the actual issue — the status of Dalits and their relationship with upper castes. Is Bollywood too scared to portray a Dalit love story?

Variety on a platter
","While the villages of Assam were busy preparing for the Bihu festival (which began on April 14), Guwahati and its suburbs were engaged in the evenings by the performing arts festivals that were going on from the last week of March. The prominent one was Uttara Purba Nat Samaroh, from March 31 to April 8, conducted at the Rang Bhawan, Maligaon, Guwahati, by the Sangeet Natak Akademi North East Centre in association with the Asom Natya Sanmilan, which has been working in Assam for the last 53 years for the promotion of diverse theatre.
The festival opened with the Assamese play, ‘
The Lesson,’ by Guwahati-based Rangapeeth and was directed by veteran Dulal Roy, the president of Asom Natya Sanmilan, who played a significant role in building up artistic theatre in Assam.
A translation of Eugene Ionesco’s absurd play ‘La Leçon’ (1950), it ridiculed the known and little known facets in humans through the interactions of a professor and his female student and a maid, who appeared occasionally.
The pressure of studies meaninglessly makes her resort to juvenile behaviour. On the other hand, it meaningfully reflects the amorous sentiments concealed within the aged professor. Naba Baruah and Karabi Pathak in the roles of the Professor and student respectively showed a wonderful onstage chemistry.
The Nepali play ‘
Hum Hi Apna Aap,’ inspired by Dongri writer Padma Sachdev’s Hindi novel, ‘Ab Na Banegi Dehari’, by NSD Sikkim Theatre Training Centre Repertory Company is about the agony of lovers.
Rewati, a widow, falls in love with the god man, Saint Giri Baba. She is prepared to leave everything to live with him but fear of society holds him back. Moreover, to strengthen the blind faith of the village folks in God, the saint has to take Samadhi.
The Bengali play, ‘
Ek Ananter Khoj’ by Natyabhumi, Agartala, written and directed by Sanjoy Kar portrayed well the irreverent attitude of today’s youth, who are not only mobile-facebook-internet savvy but at times into drugs too. The messages of Swami Vivekananda help them to regain a quality life. While the ideology was strong, the drama was less so in this light play that did profile well the talent of young Ankita Saha in the role of Mandira, the protagonist.
Written by Jyotishman Chattopadhyay, the Bengali play ‘
Krishnapurer Rupkatha’ by Nandipat, Kolkata, kept the audience glued to their seats in all aspects, which included the outstanding Kamal Chattopadhyay, who was superb as Gora, a villager. The honest, down-to-earth milkman of Krishnapur, Brindaban Ghosh ( played by Bimal Chakraborty, the director of the play), is transformed into the centre of power and lawbreaker, when he becomes rich by virtue of Goddess Laxmi, who has taken shelter at his home disguised as an old and almost blind woman. The play pointed out that corruption is not an inherent trait of any ‘system,’ but a global phenomenon that is linked to power.
The Hindi play, ‘
Jahajin,’ by Patna based Raaga, also made a strong political statement from a different angle. Written by Rajesh Chandra and directed by Randhir Kumar, it interrogates the concept of development advocated by successive rulers. Does development mean the welfare of the privileged and displacement of the sons of the soil? While putting forth the tribulations of the less fortunate, the presentation made suggestions about mutually supportive developments.
Unfortunately, the Manipuri play ‘
Nagamandalam’ (yes, Girish Karnad’s celebrated play!) translated and directed by Kshetri Jugindro and presented by the Imphal-based Manipuri Ensemble was a catastrophe.
But ‘
Model Vihar’ (Hindi) by Nisarg, Lucknow, on the following day was a compensatory feast. The entire credit goes to the brilliant Lalit Singh Pokhariya, who scripted, directed and handled four roles. The encounters of Sewakji, an acclaimed writer, teacher and intellectual, with city snobs were laced with humour –its hallmark. It was an unforgettable one-man show.
The Nagaon-based Rangalaya’s ‘
Koina Konda Shil’ (Assamese), written and directed by Mrinal Kr Bora, was the festival’s concluding play. The theme was a captivating, five-centuries-old Assamese folktale about the tragedy of a newly wedded royal duo and their entourage.
The strength of the play was primarily in its theme and the rich folk musicals, especially the mellifluous vocal renderings by young Amrita Kaur; nothing noteworthy from the actors.
All the plays essentially banked on dialogue-oriented long narratives rather than the language of the theatre and stage techniques. It also appeared that some of the directors are yet to free themselves from some of the typical NSD clichés. However, with two plays from the hosting state, the Uttara Purba Nat Samaroh successfully highlighted the recent developments, diverse facets and ongoing practices in the artistic theatre of these regions with statements on the aspirations of its people.

Not a godly tale ","The late 80s and the early 90s was a time in Indian history defined by riots and bombings, tussles over mandir and masjid, the rise of Hindutva as a political tool and so on. Smugglers and dons held sway over Mumbai and the city bore the brunt of the conflict, with the riots and the subsequent blasts changing the character of the city forever. It is this Mumbai of corrupt cops, slimy politicians, shady underworld dons, that is showcased in the first few episodes of Sacred Games, the first Netflix original series from India. Sacred Games delves into the city’s intricate web of organized crime, corruption, politics and espionage that lie beneath the image of India’s rise as an economic powerhouse. Saif Ali Khan plays Sartaj Singh, a cop with a broken family and a middling career, whose life changes, when he receives a call from an underworld don, Ganesh Gaitonde, essayed brilliantly by Nawazuddin Siddiqui. The series follows two timelines, one set in 2014, where Sartaj with the help of his trusted aide Katekar, and RAW agent Anjali Mathur (Radhika Apte) try to stop the destruction of Mumbai; and another which focuses on the rise of Gaitonde, from a toddy salesman to the don of Mumbai. It is helmed by directors Vikramaditya Motwane and Anurag Kashyap.
The plot and the characters differ significantly from the book, and the action is much more fast-paced and rushed. Gaitonde seems more menacing, and more focused on his goal of emerging as the top dog in the battle for Mumbai. Nawazuddin is excellent in his portrayal of Gaitonde and brings in the grey shades to his character. He makes you invested in the evolution of the gangster and keeps the audience on tenterhooks about his next move. His relationship with God and religion is also explored well, as is his gameplan of displacing the incumbent mafia boss, Suleiman Isa. 
In the parallel timeline, Saif Ali Khan is on the money as the hassled Sartaj but remains a character who is hard to empathise with. His reactions to specific situations, such as throwing a plate in rage at home or moping around in the city at night in his car make it hard to connect with him. The fact that his issues with his wife and superior officers are hardly explored also adds to the disconnect. His sidekick Katekar, seen as someone who struggles to maintain work-life balance is far more relatable. Issues the police force grapples with, including the spectre of fake encounters, the toxic mix of mafia and high end corruption is also showcased and draws a parallel to another Netflix series, Narcos, where the drug lords try to buy out the state. 
Religion and the city of Mumbai are characters in their own right. The religiosity of the masses is mocked at by Gaitonde, the fact that the G company is ‘secular’ is constantly emphasised, and there are plenty of references to the craze over Ramayana and the rise of Hindutva in the late 80s. The Bofors scandal, the corruption in Indian public life, and the communal tinderbox also make an appearance. Religious symbols are much more pronounced in the series, unlike the book where religion is always in the background. In one of the stand-out scenes, a group of characters, playing gods on television gulp down Apna Cola, a soft drink promoted by Gaitonde, for a TV commercial, even as the don indulgently looks on. Mumbai appears dark and menacing in both timelines. I quite enjoyed the setting, of the neon-lit shady dance bars of the 80s. Radhika Apte seems fairly settled in her role as the RAW operative, facing up gender stereotypes and focussing on the task at hand. 
The series scores on the screenplay and writing, and despite marked changes from the book, keeps you engaged. The scenes are short, cliffhangers are aplenty and there is enough to keep the viewer hooked. However, the assembly line of starlets constantly being harassed by the dons and their henchmen was a little repetitive and could have been awvoided. With its multiple story arcs, the massive cast of characters and parallel storylines, the first few episodes of Sacred Games seem to be hit the sweet spot. 
All episodes of Sacred Games premiere on Netflix today.

Azeem Banatwalla: ‘It’s the golden age of web series’
"," Tell Azeem Banatwalla about your problems and he may have a different take on the whole thing. How? Enter his ‘Problems’ Tour, his 20-stop tour across India which also features five international destinations: Singapore, Dubai, Bangkok, London and Kuala Lumpur. Hyderabad is the second stop and Azeem is fuelled for fun in one of his favourite cities, explaining, “I love Hyderabad; the city honestly has the craziest crowd. Over the course of one show, I received seven standing ovations and that was really something.” 
Sporting a short bio ‘I tell jokes for money. Your offence is free,’ the East India Comedy veteran will have your interest piqued. In April, he completed his part in the Melbourne Comedy Festival which exposed him to different styles of comedy of which he wasn’t aware. Do check out his Facebook page for a hint of what’s to come for Problems. Living in an age of political correctness and outrage culture, Azeem doesn’t shy away from artistic license nor does he deliver punchlines for shock value. This probably stems from the fact that he has a background in journalism. “Despite my background, comedy has opened up new avenues to explore topics I hadn’t prior to all of this, such as aspects of the beef ban discourse.”
“I’ll be addressing issues within our government as well as social dilemmas like overpopulation. It may leave some people thinking ‘okay that’s a very different way to look at it.’ I’ve been doing trial shows for the tour for about three months and I feel pretty geared up,” he explains, “and there was quite a bit of adjustment here and there. See, style in comedy is something that progresses slowly but surely. So I’m actually planning on implementing a Powerpoint presentation to add a bit of a kick to the show.” He chuckles a little right then. 
So how much of his set is ‘planned?’ He responds, “maybe 20% of my writing actually ends up on stage. There is an element of improv I see in other comedians’ sets but I do what feels natural. I find I tend to make use of the ‘on-stage down-time’ to formulate something fresh which does end up working on varying crowds. Plus my work on EIC versus The World on Amazon Prime was a great deviation off the scripted nature stand-up shows tend to have. I really enjoy that on the show; we sit and discuss issues candidly and that in itself fuels different comedies and perspectives. Engaging with different platforms is really important and, right now, it is the golden age of web series.”
So trust a guy who’s done over 500 shows all over India and Asia, and is pretty much a one-man-show. “I tend to do most of the planning and scheduling on my own,” he reflects, “and, in a way, that keeps my grounded, on my toes and away from complacency.” So bear witness to Azeem’s lack of complacency this weekend, for sure. 
Azeem Banatwalla’s ‘Problems’ will be taking place at Bhaskara Auditorium on October 6 at 8:30pm. Tickets are available via bookmyshow.in at ₹499 onwards.

Majlis confident of increasing tally
","Will the Majlis spring an electoral surprise this time? The answer is in the affirmative if the party’s upbeat mood is anything to go by. It is confident of wresting the Jubilee Hills and Rajendernagar Assembly seats in the city apart from the Nizamabad seat. A day after the polls, Majlis president Asaduddin Owaisi exuded confidence that his party would increase its tally to 10.
“We will retain the existing seven seats and are hopeful of adding three more,” he remarked.
The Majlis is not worried about the low percentage of polling in the city. In absolute terms, it feels, the number of votes polled have gone up by 2.27 lakh in the Hyderabad parliamentary constituency as compared to 2009. This is expected to benefit the Majlis’ prospects. Heavy voter turnout is usually seen as an indication of anti-incumbency factor. Since the city experienced moderate polling it is construed that voters are not unhappy with the Majlis’ performance. The party feels diversion of minority votes to other parties could be much less this time unlike in 2009 when the grand alliance of TDP, CPI, CPI(M) and TRS chipped away about 30 per cent votes.
Sources say a photo finish will occur in Jubilee Hills and Rajendernagar Assembly constituencies where the Majlis has put up a spirited fight. “We will get good number of votes of the majority community here as there is a resentment against the local MLAs,” Mr. Asaduddin said. He doesn’t think the Majlis will have any problem in Yakutpura and Nampally segments either. The Majlis leader refuses to go into minute calculations. “We have done our best. Even during my student days I used to write the exam and forget the result,” he remarked. He predicts an upper hand for TRS in Telangana region. “But whoever forms the government has to deliver the goods and fast. Otherwise people will throw them out,” he warns.
Mr. Asaduddin, who is rushing to Anantapur to campaign for the party candidate, is sure of YSRC sweeping the polls in Seemandhra. He said AAP would play spoilsport by cutting into the votes of secular parties. Will Narendra Modi become Prime Minister? “I don’t think so. If he occupies the top job, it would not be good for what India stands for,” he added.

Sibal trashes Jaitley’s objection to snoopgate probe
","Trashing BJP leader Arun Jaitley’s contention that the UPA government’s action on >snoopgate probe was illegitimate, Law Minister Kapil Sibal on Saturday said he “should go back to law” before making such statements and insisted that a judge to head the inqury will be named before May 16.
Defending the Centre’s move, the Minister asked why this was being questioned when the Narendra Modi Government had itself set up a probe panel to go into the issue, showing that there was something to be investigated.
He also pointed out that the Gujarat Government’s probe panel, which was supposed to give its report within three months, has not held a single meeting till date.
“A judge (to head the inquiry) will be in place before May 16......Jaitley has got cut off from law for a long time. He should go back to law and see this little more carefully before making any such statements,” Sibal told reporters at the AICC headquarters.
“If he takes a little time to understand, he will realise this is legally not possible,” Sibal said when asked if Jaitley’s remarks showed that in the event of the BJP winning, the next government will wind up the probe panel.
Both Sibal and Jaitley have been senior advocates of the Supreme Court.
Jaitley had said that all the judges approached by the UPA Government had refused to be a part of the “desperate” exercise and “political and malafide” move which would be an “illegitimate” action on the part of government.
“And if the government still goes ahead, it will be within the jurisdiction of the next government to consider them as improper,” he had said.
Dismissing BJP’s criticism, Sibal said, “When the State sets up a probe panel, it is fine. But when the Centre sets it up, then it becomes vindictive. What is this logic?”
He stressed that “communication” is a Central subject and snooping had been done in more than one State beyond Gujarat.
The Law Minister wondered how a probe panel set up by the Sate Government headed by Modi could investigate charges against him.
He also made light of the terms of reference of the State probe panel saying they were at variance with BJP’s statements which do not rule out the fact that snooping was done.
“Their real face has got exposed in the Snoopgate issue also. They set up a probe panel in the State fearing that the Centre may appoint an inquiry which could bring out facts that could create trouble for him (Modi),” Sibal said.
It was alleged that illegal surveillance was carried out on a young woman in Gujarat in 2009 at the behest of Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi and Amit Shah was the Home Minister of the State at that time.

From the archives: No Imminent Danger to Periyar Dam
","
NEW DELHI: A spokesman of the Ministry of Agriculture and Irrigation said today there was no Imminent danger to the Periyar Dam.
The spokesman said the dam was built in stone masonry in lime mortar on the front and rear faces, and had hearting of lime concrete in surkhi mortar. Following considerable leakage of water through the body of the dam in 1933, the front face of the dam was strengthened which had resulted in substantial reduction of leakage. Between 1961 and 1964, grouting of the body of the dam had been undertaken which had helped reduce seepage further.
The spokesman said with the Idukki Dam being in position downstream Of the Periyar Dam the safety of the Periyar Dam had assumed greater significance on account of its design deficiency and age. While designing Periyar Dam, the conventional uplift forces had not been taken into account resulting in some tension under full reservoir conditions.
The spokesman recalled that the Member (Designs and Research) of the Central Water Commission, after an inspection of the dam Jointly with the Chief Engineers of Tamil Nadu and Kerala in May, 1978 had recommended that the full reservoir level should be kept seven feet lower at 145 feet, and also that the maximum water level, restricted to 147 feet, be brought back to 148 within 24 hours. According to reports received from the Tamil Nadu Government the present level of water was below 140 feet and, therefore, there was no imminent danger to its safety.
According to the spokesman, the Central Water Commission had called for certain data in regard to the construction of the dam and hydrology of the river to evolve measures for further strengthening of the dam. In February, 1979, the Central Water Commission had suggested to the Tamil Nadu Government the strengthening of the dam by earth-backing.
""As the information sought from the Tamil Nadu Government has not yet been furnished, the matter is being taken up by the Union Irrigation Secretary with the State Chief Secretary""

Ishrat Jahan fake encounter: CBI gives clean chit to Amit Shah
","The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on Wednesday gave a clean chit to Gujarat's former junior Home Minister and Narendra Modi’s close aide Amit Shah in the alleged fake encounter case of Ishrat Jahan and three others, saying it did not have sufficient evidence to charge sheet him.
“There is no sufficient evidence against Amit Shah. Hence CBI has not chargesheeted him,” CBI PI Vishwas Kumar Meena said in an affidavit filed before the special CBI court in Ahmadabad on Wednesday.
“It is most respectfully submitted that Shah was not named in the FIR of the case. CBI has also not named him in the charge sheet as an accused,” CBI affidavit said.
Gopinath Pillai, father of Javed Sheikh alias Pranesh Pillai who was killed in the encounter, had approached the court of special CBI Judge Geeta Gopi to >arraign Mr. Shah and former Commissioner of Police of the city, K.R. Kaushik as accused in the encounter case.
Mr. Pillai had cited the >resignation letter of suspended IPS officer and one of the accused in the Ishrat Jahan case D.G. Vanzara in his petition.
Regarding the resignation letter, CBI has said in its affidavit that, “The said resignation letter contains general allegations and not providing any concrete information about the role of Shah in this offence. After receiving the letter, CBI examined Vanzara in the Jail. However, he has not disclosed any further details during his examinations.”
Mr. Vanzara had in his letter said that police “was following conscious policy of state government”, while conducting the encounter.
CBI has also given clean chit to >Mr. Kaushik, the then city police commissioner and has made him an witness in the case.

Counting will be transparent: CEO
","The counting of votes, scheduled for May 16, will be transparent as officials will come out with the latest tally at specified intervals, signing the votes in every round and declaring the numbers, Chief Electoral Officer Praveen Kumar said on Tuesday.
Officials would not move to the second round until the first round was completed. For every round completed, they would tabulate the results and hand a signed photocopy to the agents. They would also give a copy to the chief agent and then declare the results on board or screen, he said.
Mr. Kumar was here to launch the training in the counting process for the returning officers, principal assistant returning officers and assistant returning officers of the Lok Sabha constituencies in the Nilgiris, Dharmapuri, Salem, Namakkal, Karur, Erode, Tirupur and Coimbatore districts.
He said the Election Commission was keen on ensuring transparency to avoid allegations like the one that cropped up in the last Lok Sabha elections in Sivaganga, from where Union Minister P. Chidambaram was elected.
The declaration of results was likely to be delayed as there was a 20 per cent increase in the number of polling booths. Further, there were places where the number of candidates was high. But the delay would not be more than a few hours, he said, and early leads could be available around 1 p.m.
Once the contestants submitted the final expenses, the EC’s expenditure teams, comprising officials of the Income Tax and Customs Departments, would scrutinise the accounts. In case of any fudging, the EC would pursue legal options.
As for paid news, Mr. Kumar said his office went into two appeals and dismissed one. The decision on the other would soon be known.
From Coimbatore, the EC received complaints on the use of private buses for transporting people to meeting venues. After an inquiry, the EC found the complaints to be true and decided to add Rs. 31 lakh to the expenditure account of a political party.
Mr. Kumar said his office instructed the returning officers and other officials to expeditiously deal with the 3,000 poll-related cases registered across the State. Of these, 1,800 reached the stage of charge sheet.
The aim was to take as many cases as possible to court before May 16.

Five months after Govt. Order, Rajiv Arogyasri still on paper
","Five months after the formal announcement, Rajiv Arogyasri — the State government’s healthcare scheme for all above the poverty line (APL) ration cardholders — is still on paper.
The reluctance of corporate hospitals to get empanelled under the scheme has put paid to the plans of the government to provide high-quality medical treatment at low rates.
However, the Suvarna Arogya Suraksha Trust (SAST) that is entrusted with the implementation of the scheme attributed the delay to frequent transfers of top officials in the Department of Health and Family Welfare and the Lok Sabha elections.
A Government Order on the scheme was issued on November 23, 2013. The scheme, stated to be the first of its kind in the country, was aimed at making it possible for all ration APL cardholders (irrespective of their economic status) to get subsidised treatment up to Rs. 1.5 lakh annually in super-specialty hospitals empanelled by the government.
Patients have to pay only 10 per cent of the total cost (up to Rs. 1.5 lakh). Now, BPL cardholders are covered under the Vajpayee Arogyasri.
Citing low package rates, nine of the 80 private hospitals empanelled for the Vajpayee Arogyasri had backed out of the partnership.
Of the nine hospitals, one is a noted medical college hospital in Dharwad and the others are among the top private hospitals in Bangalore. Their main contention was that the low government package rates would cut into their profits and hit their “functioning”.
According to a spokesperson of a private hospital, although surgical procedure rates vary among the hospitals, getting empanelled under the government schemes means “all hospitals will have to follow a standard rate”.
As most hospitals are also empanelled for the Vajpayee Arogyasri, they are finding it difficult to cross-subsidise the scheme with patients who can afford to pay. P. Bore Gowda, Executive Director of Suvarna Arogya Suraksha Trust, said that eight other hospitals had also stayed away from the scheme after their initial empanelment. But as the number of patients in these eight hospitals reduced considerably, they decided to remain in the scheme. The higher number of admissions in the empanelled hospitals compensated for the lowering of tariffs, he said. He said treatment packages were priced following extensive consultations with specialists from government and private sectors.
The Rajiv Arogyasri scheme is applicable to 447 surgical procedures.

Gramin Congress, which was launched by former Congress MLA Subal Bhowmik after his defeat in the assembly elections in February last year, has been protesting against the alleged manipulation in West and tribal-reserved East Tripura constituencies that went to poll on April 7 and April 12 respectively. It blamed Chief Electoral Officer Ashutosh Jindal for ‘all wrongdoings’.
“We have called the strike in protest against massive bogus voting and manipulation in the elections. We have submitted complaints to the election commission along with evidences to the election commission, but no action taken so far”, Mr. Bhowmik told reporters.
CPI(M) has strongly opposed the strike call and termed the move as an attempt to run away from reality of an impending massive defeat in Lok Sabha polls. It also set aside allegations of manipulation in any manner in the elections which recorded an 85 per cent turnover.
Trinamool Congress that announced an agitation programme starting on May 5 has however said it would not support nor oppose the strike call. “Our leader Mamata Banerjee is really not in favour of a strike as it does not achieve much”, State chairman of the party Ratan Chakraborty told The Hindu.
Sources in Congress and BJP also ruled out possibility of giving open support to the strike. They would not oppose the strike as well.
The controversy over farcical elections surfaced after a local cable news channel aired footage over breach of election procedures at a polling station in Bishalgarh near Agartala. The election department is conducting a thorough probe into the charges.

Assam violence: Locals in Baksa refuse to bury the dead till Gogoi’s visit
","Demanding that Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi visit their area, people of Salbari in Assam’s violence-hit Baksa district on Sunday refused to bury their kin killed in attacks by NDFB-Songbijit militants.
Angry protestors in Nankekhadrabari area on Sunday said they will not perform the last rites of the bodies of the 18 people, including children and women, till Mr. Gogoi comes and personally assures to provide security to their lives and property.
“Does our life have no value? We are only demanding that we are protected and we are not attacked and killed in future” they told reporters.
“The district administration instead of providing violence-hit people security and protection, is now threatening to arrest us if we do not perform janaja (last rites) of our dead,” they alleged.
There is no immediate word from official sources about the Chief Minister visiting the area.
Heavily armed NDFB-S militants had gunned down 18 persons on Friday night and torched over 100 houses since the militant outfit started its mayhem against a minority community in the BTAD’s twin districts of Baksa and Kokrajhar from May one.
Altogether 32 people were killed in the violence, several others injured and thousands rendered homeless in the two districts.
Meanwhile, indefinite curfew imposed in neighbouring Chirang district of the Bodoland Territorial Administrative District (BTAD) since Friday night was relaxed for six hours from 10 am today, district administration said.

Animal rights bodies welcome ‘Jallikattu’ ban
","Animal welfare bodies, led by the city-based Blue Cross of India, welcomed the Supreme Court judgment on Wednesday banning the use of bulls in ‘Jallikattu,’ a traditional bull-taming festival of Tamil Nadu, and other forms of entertainment.
The judgment “… will go down in the history of India as a landmark verdict by the Supreme Court to ban the use of bulls for entertainment,” said Nanditha Krishna, governing-body member of Blue Cross and environment activist, who has been working over the years for humane treatment of animals. The ban will be applicable to Rekla (bullock cart) and horse-and-bull races too, among many.
Commending those who worked for years to achieve this verdict, including the Animal Welfare Board of India (AWBI), Ms. Krishna, in her statement, thanked former Union Minister for Environment and Forests Jairam Ramesh for “banning the use of bulls as performing animals in 2011.” But then, the Tamil Nadu government sought to permit ‘Jallikattu’ through the Tamil Nadu Jallikattu Regulation Act, 2009. Earlier this year, the Environment Ministry withdrew its own Gazette notification through an affidavit in the Supreme Court.
“The AWBI, to its credit, refused to go along and fought the Tamil Nadu government, the ‘Jallikattu’ Federation and the Ministry of Environment and Forest’s stand in the Supreme Court. By its historic verdict, the court has vindicated Mr. Jairam Ramesh’s position and upheld the ban,” Ms. Krishna said.

Sen, Modi and RSS
","This refers to two letters in this column under the heading “
>Amartya Sen’s views” (May 1). Responding to Nobel laureate Amartya Sen’s scepticism about Mr. Modi because of his right-wing links, the two readers have strongly defended the RSS as not being a communal organisation. To set the record straight, let me highlight the views expressed by RSS founder M.S. Golwalkar about non-Hindus: “The non-Hindu people of Hindustan must either adopt Hindu culture and languages, must learn and respect and hold in reverence the Hindu religion, must entertain no idea but of those of glorification of the Hindu race and culture... in a word they must cease to be foreigners; Or may stay in the country, wholly subordinated to the Hindu nation, claiming nothing, deserving no privileges, far less any preferential treatment — not even citizens’ rights” (cited from Guha, Ramachandra (2008), India After Gandhi: The History of the World’s Largest Democracy, Pan Macmillan, p.19).

Coal block case: P. C. Parakh questioned again

During the examination, Mr. Parakh was asked about the procedure followed during his tenure in the allocation of coal blocks. The CBI team headed by a Superintendent of Police also questioned him regarding reversal of the 25th screening committee’s recommendation to grant the Odisha coal block to public sector unit Neyveli Lignite Corporation Limited.
The agency had last year registered the case against Mr. Parakh, Aditya Birla Group chairman Kumar Mangalam Birla, alleging that in 2005 the former Coal Secretary had abused his official position to overturn the screening committee’s recommendation, in favour of Hindalco.

‘A.P. split may encourage similar demands’
","The bifurcation of Andhra Pradesh will have a serious impact on the other States where there are similar separatist demands, feels Mohammad Yusuf Tarigami, the State committee secretary of the CPI (M)’s Jammu and Kashmir unit.
The CPI (M) not only opposed the bifurcation tooth and nail, but also cobbled up an alliance for the general elections with Jai Samaikyandhra Party (JSP), founded by former Chief Minister N. Kiran Kumar Reddy. Mr. Reddy is not only pinning hopes on the judiciary to declare the division void, but has also made ‘unification’ his poll plank.
Talking to The Hindu on Saturday, Mr. Tarigami spoke on issues ranging from communalism to regionalism. He squarely blamed the Congress for not exhibiting enough foresight in handling the sensitive issue. It will indeed encourage aspirations in other States, where similar demands are being heard. “A mechanism has to be evolved to address the democratic aspirations of different groups. A word of caution from our side is that the situation should not be allowed to get out of hand,” he pointed out.
Mr. Tarigami said he saw a vast difference between the separatist feelings in Telangana and that which is witnessed in his State. In both the cases, developmental agenda should have been prioritised. He attributed the present situation in J&K to the ‘wrong policies’ of the Union government, while indicating the need to step up efforts to win over people.
Similarly, he sees communal forces emerging to destroy the country’s secular fabric. “A divisive feeling is all-pervasive across the country,” he said, referring to the Sangh Parivar adopting discriminatory policies. “They are not sporadic incidents, but reflections of the divisive mindset,” he warned.

Jagan slams Centre for neglecting irrigation projects
","YSRC president Y.S. Jaganmohan Reddy on Friday criticised the Centre for not clearing long-pending irrigation projects in the State.
Addressing a road show here, he asked how the State and Central governments forgot Polavaram, Pulichintala and Handri-Neeva projects, which were beneficial to thousands of farmers.
Terming late Chief Minister Y.S. Rajashekara Reddy’s tenure as the “golden era”, the YSRC chief asked as to what the State had achieved when the TDP had stitched up an alliance with the BJP earlier.
Alleging that the BJP’s prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi and TDP chief N. Chandrababu Naidu were trying to wrest the maximum number of seats in Andhra Pradesh by forging an unethical alliance, he said the two parties had no interest in people’s welfare.
Launching an attack on Mr. Naidu, the YSR Congress president blamed the Telugu Desam for lifting ban on liquor and encouraging belt shops in the State. “The TDP president is announcing sops which could not be implemented,” he said.
He appealed to electors to vote for YSRC candidates. YSRC Vijayawada Parliamentary constituency candidate Koneru Rajendra Prasad participated.

Deploy adequate forces in east UP: BJP tells EC
","The BJP on Friday asked the Election Commission to ensure adequate deployment of central security forces on all polling booths in eastern Uttar Pradesh for a “free and fair” election.
“BJP very earnestly requests the Election Commission to deploy adequate number of central forces on all booths of UP’s Poorvanchal region (eastern region) so that a free and fair election may get conducted here,” said BJP leader Ravi Shankar Prasad at a press conference here.
Hitting out at the Congress, Mr Prasad said they lodge complaints before the EC against Mr Modi like “kids with petty excuses”.
According to the Representation of People Act, a person can canvass at above a distance of 100 metres after casting votes. Mr Modi did the same thing as he spoke to the media at a distance permissible by the EC, the BJP leader said.
Replying to a query that the EC ordered the FIR against Mr Modi with a biased approach, Mr Prasad said, “we have full respect for EC but the poll body should have first enquired about the incident and then ordered for registering an FIR”.
“When leaders like Abu Azmi and Azam Khan gives hate speeches and remarks, why doesn’t this Congress complain to the Election commission,” he asked.
Leaders like Mulayam Singh Yadav, Lalu Prasad, Mayawati, Nitish Kumar, and Arvind Kejriwal are campaigning only against Mr Modi and speaking against him, he claimed.

Just one foot more, Veeranam to be full
","The Veeranam tank is just less than one foot short of attaining its full capacity owing to the recent spell of rain and the forethought of the authorities to bring water from the Lower Anicut through the Vadavar to the tank.
As the water level in the tank has reached almost its brim, it has brought cheers to the ayacutdars and Chennai residents. As the storage in the tank has reached a comfortable level it could sustain the 77 cusecs supply to Chennai to partly meet the metropolis’ drinking water requirements during the summer.
As on Monday, the water level in the tank stood at 46.15ft against the full capacity of 47.5ft. With the inflow pegged at 1,400 cusecs the tank is expected to get filled up soon.
It may be noted that to ensure uninterrupted water supply to Chennai the authorities had started releasing 5,200 cusecs from the Mettur Dam to the Coleroon and then to the Lower Anicut. From the Lower Anicut the feeder canal Vadavar is carrying water to the tank. The realisation at the Veeranam from this source had been in the order of 1,200 cusecs. With the good rainfall in the catchment areas the inflow into the tank rose to 1,400 cusecs on Monday.
The tank, a sprawling water expanse as it is, would replenish the groundwater to an appreciable extent. The farmers feel elated as it is a rare sight for them to see the tank full during summer months.
If the wet spell continues and if the Mettur Dam also gets its due share from Karnataka the seasonal water release could be possible in June as usual and it would certainly revive agriculture to its past glory in this tail-end delta region.
However, president of the Kollidam — Keelanai Paasana Vivasayigal Sangham P. Vinayagamoorthy in a representation to Chief Minister Jayalalithaa has sought the release of water from the Veeranam tank to fill up the ponds in the surrounding areas.
Mr. Vinayagamoorthy has stated that because of the deficit rainfall for the past two years the ponds and lakes in Cuddalore district have become dry. Hence, the villagers have been facing water scarcity.
Drinking water shortage has affected both human and cattle heads. Therefore, Mr. Vinayagamoorthy has appealed to the Chief Minister to release water from the tank, at least for two days, to fill up the ponds.
As on Monday Cuddalore district received a rainfall of 411.90 as against the average of 19.61mm. for the season. Annamalai Nagar recorded the highest rainfall of 51mm followed by Chidambaram and Kothavacheri — 49mm each, Vriddhachalam — 48.30mm, Kattumannarkoil — 46mm, Lalpet — 36mm, Bhuvanagiri — 28mm, Sethiathope — 24.20mm, Parangipettai — 24mm, Cuddalore — 16.40mm and Sri Mushnam — 15mm.

Chidambaram played fraud on budgets: Yashwant Sinha
","The spat between Union Finance Minister P. Chidambaram and BJP Leader Yashwant Sinha deepened on Friday. “I may have been the worst Finance Minister after 1991, but I did not commit fraud,” Mr. Sinha said in a statement on Friday. “Mr. Chidambaram has been the cleverest Finance Minister since 1991 and has played fraud on the budget not only this year but always.”
Mr. Sinha was reacting to >Mr. Chidambaram’s comments at a press briefing at Congress headquarters on Thursday where he had said that the BJP leader’s performance as Finance Minister “was such that he had to demit the office on July 1, 2002”. “I may point out that 2000-01 and 2002-03 were the worst years since liberalisation in terms of growth and Prime Minister Vajpayee was forced to replace the Finance Minister,” Mr. Chidambaram had said. “I thought Mr. Sinha would be happy to remain a distant memory for the people of India, however, he seems determined to remain relevant in his party.”
Earlier, in April, Mr. Sinha and Mr. Chidambaram had made similar remarks about each other’s tenures as Finance Minister. The two sparring Finance Ministers have been debating amongst other issues the true fiscal deficit, or excess of government expenditure over its income, for India.
In Friday’s statement, Mr. Sinha clarified remarks he made earlier this week in a newspaper interview about Mr. Chidambaram: “I said that the seeds of the present economic crisis were sown by Mr. Chidambaram himself in 2008-09…. I also added that the liberties which were taken with the fiscal then were still bothering us and that Mr. Chidambaram’s claim that he had restricted the fiscal deficit to 4.6 per cent of the GDP in 2013-14 was questionable”.
He stated that he had also added that Mr. Chidambaram “had played fraud in the interim budget and that the next government should come out with a white paper to expose his lies”. Mr. Sinha further stated that Mr. Chidambaram had in his 1997-98 budget targeted a fiscal deficit of 4.5 per cent of the Gross Domestic Product, however, the target was missed and the figure had ballooned to 5.8 per cent in the subsequent year’s budget.
The expenditure figures released by The Comptroller General of Accounts of the Ministry of Finance for April – February 2013-14 show that in actual numbers the fiscal deficit has exceeded Mr. Chidambaram’s revised estimates presented in February 2014 by a “whopping” Rs. 74,760 crore (from Rs. 524539 crore to Rs. 599299 crore), Mr. Sinha said. “Within six weeks the veracity of the figures presented by Mr. Chidambaram has been questioned by his own agency. Instead of challenging me on facts, Mr. Chidambaram has decided to attack me personally,” Mr. Sinha stated.

Modi’s 'selfie'
","BJP prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi’s action of displaying his party symbol after casting his vote is clearly a violation of election laws (“
>Modi selfie spells trouble,” May 1). It is nothing but a part of a deliberate attempt to orchestrate support for the BJP in the remaining phases of the election. Supporters and party spokespersons of the BJP cannot brush this gesture aside by saying that it was not an organised press conference. Has Mr. Modi forgotten that the “Lotus” is his party’s symbol?

J. Anantha Padmanabhan,


Tiruchi

On the face of it, the physical effect of Mr. Modi’s transgression could be less dangerous than one of jumping a red signal. But he has jumped the law, wantonly, knowingly, even with a shade of contempt. Where was the need to do this, for a man who has already decided that he would be the Prime Minister soon. Perhaps this thought itself was the trigger for his act. He was actually thumbing his nose at the Election Commission and challenging it, as it were, to catch him if it can.
Is this the way he is going to run the country, having his way no matter what? He was certainly not behaving like a leader to whom now millions are looking up to — a sad prospect indeed. He should have been immediately barred from campaigning for the remaining phases.

M. Balakrishnan,


Bangalore

Filing a first information report against Mr. Modi is a futile exercise because he is now above the law of the land. Let us not forget that he justified the Gujarat pogrom by saying that “for every action there would be reaction.” The brazen manner in which he went about taking his selfie shows that he will be a very domineering force in governance.

N.M. Mohammed Ali,


Thiruvananthapuram

It takes several years to build one’s reputation and credibility, especially when one is in public life, which can be erased in a stroke with one wrong move. Mr. Modi appears to be facing such a situation now. Electoral laws make it clear what does or does not amount to a poll violation. Even the most committed admirer of Mr. Modi will now find it difficult to defend him in this case.

N.S. Venkataraman,


Chennai

The media and those who are incensed by Mr. Modi’s act are overreacting. Let me pose this question. If the Congress president waves her hand before, during voting or after she exercises her franchise, will she be disqualified? It is high time the archaic election rules are reviewed and updated in this modern electronic era.

YSRC has become hub of criminals: Naidu
","Telugu Desam Party (TDP) president N. Chandrababu Naidu said that YSR Congress president Y.S. Jaganmohan Reddy would go to jail in six months and not return before 20 years.
Addressing an impressive public meeting at the RTC bus stand in Piler town on Sunday, Mr. Naidu said that Mr. Jaganmohan Reddy was shuddering at the thought of the BJP-TDP alliance and Pawan Kalyan supporting it. “In order to protect himself, Mr. Jaganmohan Reddy is hoodwinking Muslims with all kinds of stories. He wants power to save himself from criminal cases and loot the State further. It was me who protected religious harmony in Hyderabad. I shall be the armour for the Muslim brothers,” he said. He defended the TDP alliance with BJP, saying that it was for the sake of developing the State.
The TDP chief said that the YSRC has become a hub of criminals and a ‘family party,’ with several of the family members contesting the elections, including Y.S. Jaganmohan Reddy, Vijayamma (Vizag MP candidate), Avinash Reddy (Kadapa), Y.V. Subba Reddy (Ongole) and Ravindranath Reddy (Kamalapuram Assembly seat).
Training his guns on JSP president N. Kiran Kumar Reddy and his brother Kishore Kumar Reddy (Piler candidate for JSP), Mr. Naidu alleged that Mr. Kishore Kumar Reddy had looted the forest wealth with large-scale smuggling of red sanders. He urged the people to vote for TDP candidate Iqbal Ahmed, ‘who has no money, but integrity’.
Mr. Naidu said that he had learnt politics from N.T. Rama Rao. Appealing to farmers, he said: “I am the son of a farmer. I will stand by you at all times.”
He listed the various poll promises, including the infrastructural development of Seemandhra on a par with Singapore.
Mr Naidu’s schedule in his home district was delayed by over four hours and his itinerary included Punganur, Kuppam, Palamaner and Chittoor, followed by a night halt at Tirupati.
Earlier, crowds surged at Piler, expecting the arrival of Pawan Kalyan along with Mr. Chandrababu Naidu, but were disappointed with just the presence of Mr. Chandrababu Naidu.

Views sought to make helmets must for women
","The Delhi Government’s Transport Department issued a notification on Friday seeking objections from people over its decision to amend the Motor Vehicle Rules,1993, for making helmets mandatory for woman driving or riding pillion on two-wheelers.
The move comes after the Election Commission gave its nod to issue a gazette notification to invite public suggestions and objections in the matter. The amendment would delete sub-rule (2) of rule 115 of the Motor Vehicle Rules making it mandatory for all women to wear headgear while on a two-wheeler.
“People can send their objections and suggestions to the Transport Commissioner. All the drafts received over the next 30 days will be considered before the MVR is amended,” a Transport Department official said.
While the city has seen several accidents involving two-wheelers in which women have been killed, members of the Sikh community have been protesting against the move on the grounds that it went against their religion.
Successive elected governments in the Capital have rejected any such move due to pressure from the Sikh community. Lieutenant-Governor Najeeb Jung, however, cleared a Transport Department proposal last month to amend the MVR.
The Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Managing Committee has sought review of the order. A day after the L-G gave his nod, the committee wrote to Mr. Jung requesting him to exempt Sikh women from wearing helmets.

Snoopgate probe: Announcing judge not in violation of poll code, says Shinde
","The government on Friday said that a judge will be appointed to conduct probe into Gujarat ‘snoopgate’ before counting of votes in Lok Sabha polls and rubbished BJP leader Arun Jaitley’s claim that no judge will “lend” himself to the “political and malafide” exercise targeting Narendra Modi.
“The Cabinet had taken the decision to appoint a Commission of Inquiry to probe the incident of snooping on a woman in Gujarat. We will soon appoint the judge... before May 16,” Union Home Minister Sushilkumar Shinde told a press conference in Shimla.
Asked whether the appointment of a judge in the midst of Lok Sabha elections would not amount to violation of the Model Code of Conduct, Mr. Shinde said, “It will not” as the decision had been taken more than four months ago by the Union Cabinet.
“I am worried. The way the Chief Minister of Gujarat had snooped into the life of a woman, I am really worried what will happen to the women of the country if he becomes the Prime Minister,” he said.
In New Delhi, Law Minister Kapil Sibal rubbished >Mr. Jaitley’s claim that no judge will “lend” himself to the “political and malafide” exercise targeting the BJP’s prime ministerial candidate.
“You will get a snoopgate judge before May 16. I don’t know why these people are so worried? Why leaders of BJP are worried and why they are making public statement that no judge should join this commission?” he said.
Mr. Sibal said that Mr. Modi against whom accusations have been made in the controversy will be investigated.
The Congress leader said the BJP is worried as its leaders know the fact that “once the commission is set up there is no saving for Narendra Modi”.
Reacting the government’s move, BJP leader Ravi Shankar Prasad said it was nothing but a reflection of arrogance of the UPA government, which, he claimed, would be voted out of power.
Mr. Prasad said, “The two honourable Ministers... along with the entire Congress party would be defeated conclusively after 10 days and yet the arrogance of having the inquiry.
“I would expect that so many judges have refused in the past and the sanctity and dignity of the judiciary will not be compromised for ulterior motive of the Congress party.”
Mr. Sibal claimed that there was documentary evidence of what Mr. Modi had done and how he had snooped the activities of the young woman.
“...They are worried about the national commission set up by the Centre and I think, they should continue to be worried because the commission will be set up and he will be investigated and he will be brought to book,” he said.
The Centre had on December 26, 2013 decided to set up a Judicial Commission of Inquiry to probe charges of spying on a woman in 2009 allegedly at the behest of the Gujarat Chief Minister.
The government had announced that the commission, to be headed by a retired Supreme Court judge or a retired Chief Justice of a High Court, will also look into charges of snooping on Himachal Pradesh Chief Minister Virbhadra Singh by the previous BJP government when he was in the opposition as well as the leaking of the call data records (CDR) of Mr. Jaitley in Delhi.
The Union Cabinet took the decision under the Commissions of Inquiry Act under which the Modi government had already set up a similar panel.
However, even after four months, the government could not appoint anyone to conduct the probe as no retired judge came forward to take up the assignment.
There were reports that as no retired judge was willing to head the probe commission, the UPA government was mulling the option of changing the terms of reference for the commission by incorporating a provision that will allow the government to appoint a sitting judge of a High Court.

Overthrow ‘government of plunderers’, says Modi
","Taking a swipe at the Gandhi family, >Narendra Modi on Saturday said the mother and son have never gone through the pangs of penury and asked the people of Uttarakhand to overthrow the “government of plunderers who have looted the people and stashed their money abroad.""
He charged that the government of the “mother and son” (Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi) has destroyed the country and the “saddest part” is that they are “not affected or worried by this. They think people will forget everything.”
Mr. Modi also attacked Home Minister Sushilkumar Shinde and said, the “Home Minister” of the “mother and son” says that people forget everything (corruption and inflation) like the “way they forgot the Bofors (scam)”.
“If you want back the country’s looted money stashed abroad, you will have to first remove the government of plunderers in New Delhi,” he told an impressive election meeting held here in support of party candidate from Pauri Lok Sabha constituency and former Chief Minister Bhuvan Chandra Khanduri.
He said the mother-son government at the Centre cannot feel the pain of the poor because they were born with a golden spoon in their mouth and never went through the pangs of penury.
Again describing himself as a “humble chaiwala” who has seen it all moving from one railway compartment to another to offer people tea, >Mr. Modi said this time the poll battle is between the mother-son duo on the one side and a chaiwala on the other.
“
Namdars on the one hand and a kamdar on the other,” he said, targeting Sonia and Rahul Gandhi.
The Gujarat Chief Minister said the country had given 60 years to administrators but now it was time it gave 60 months to a servant and a chowkidar (watchman).
“You gave 60 years to administrators. Give just 60 months to a servant and a chowkidar. I can assure you I am a chowkidar who would never let anyone lay a hand on the country’s coffers,” he said.
Seeking to strike an emotional chord with the people of the State, Mr. Modi said he shared a special bonding with the people of Uttarakhand as he was in charge of the party’s affairs in the State many years ago.
However, he regretted not being allowed to do anything for the people of the State when calamity struck in June last year.
“I got restless when I heard of the tragedy and wanted desperately to do something for the victims. I came running but due to perverted politics I was not allowed to do anything. I shall always regret it,” he said.
Terming the Uttarakhand government as the “worst example of failure in the face of crisis”, he said the “mother-son” government of New Delhi will also have to share the responsibility for this “failure”.
He said the Congress at the Centre had promised to give jobs to 10 crore youths in ten year’s time but gave jobs to just one crore of them, whereas the Vajpayee government gave jobs to 6.5 crore youths in a tenure lasting just six years.
Asking people to turn up in large numbers at the polling booths to cast their vote, Mr. Modi said if they wanted a stable government in New Delhi under his leadership they will have to ensure the victory of all the five BJP nominees from Uttarakhand.
“It is the Himalayas. Weather changes quickly here. But you have to venture out to cast your ballot regardless of whether it is raining or getting cold,” he said.

","Toll collection at Sadahalli Gate on National Highway 7 was disrupted briefly on Tuesday, as activists of BJP and Karnataka Rakshana Vedike staged protests at the toll plaza against the nearly four-fold hike in rates.
However, police ensured two-way traffic flow through two gates on the left. Police were deployed in huge numbers on the third consecutive day of protests.
Former Deputy Chief Minister R. Ashok, who led the BJP activists, alleged that the State government had colluded with the private company authorised to collect toll. He further alleged that the company was scuttling free passage of local villagers and demanded a toll-free service road.
He claimed to have stopped the company from collecting toll when he was in the government on the grounds that the project was yet to be completed.
Narayana Gowda, vedike president, told the State government to roll back the hike in 24 hours. He warned that the vedike would pull down all toll booths, like in neighbouring Maharashtra, if there is no roll back.
About 400 protesters, including R. Ashok, B.N. Bachegowda from the BJP and T.A. Narayana Gowda from the vedike, were arrested and later released.
Less than half an hour after the protesters were cleared, the toll collection resumed, leaving the road users and cab drivers sceptical of the effectiveness of the protests.
Arvind Kumar, a commuter who had been to the airport, said, “The protests are an act for the media. In a few days, people will soon get used to the new rates.”

Himachal Congress leader’s brother joins BJP
","In a major embarrassment to the Congress, senior Himachal Pradesh Congress leader Major Vijay Singh Mankotia’s brother Ajay Singh joined the BJP on Saturday.
He was inducted into the party by BJP leader of Dharamsala, Kishan Kapoor here.
“I am a separate person and he (Major) is a separate one, we are free to choose any ideology. I was a great admirer of BJP and when asked, could not restrain myself from joining the party,” Ajay told reporters.
His brother Major Singh hit the headlines when he released a CD against Chief Minister Vir Bhadra Singh six years ago and left the party to join the BSP.
During the 2012 State Assembly elections, Major Singh left the BSP and re-joined Congress on the request of Vir Bhadra.

Leaders unwind, take time off from electioneering
","As the dust settles down after hectic electioneering, it is time for politicians to relax, catch up with reading and spend some time with family members.
And that’s exactly what senior BJP leader Bandaru Dattatreya is doing.
Mr. Dattatreya, who is contesting from Secunderabad Lok Sabha constituency, was on his toes right from early morning each day to meet electors. Padayatras and door-to-door campaigning were his preferred modes.
With people casting their votes and deciding the fate of contestants on Wednesday, Mr. Dattatreya held a review meeting with important party functionaries of all the seven Assembly segments on Thursday and assessed the situation.
Telugu Desam activists from Khairatabad Assembly constituency too attended the meeting and gave their feedback.
Exuding confidence that he would emerge victorious, he claimed that lot of “cross-voting” took place and supporters of Congress, TRS and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) too favoured the BJP.
With the busy period over, he is now spending time reading Ramayana and other books. He will also resume his daily routine of walking for an hour and doing yoga exercises. He is also planning to campaign in Seemandhra, where polling will be held on May 7.
For Telangana BJP president and candidate from Amberpet Assembly constituency, G. Kishan Reddy, curtains came down on electioneering no doubt. But more than that, he is feeling relieved as he was under “pressure” ever since he took over as BJP chief.
First, the by-elections to Nizamabad Assembly seat were held, followed by by-polls to Mahabubnagar and Parkal, even as the Telangana movement continued.
Then the alliance with Telugu Desam was firmed up and there was talk during the crucial passage of the AP Reorganisation Bill in Parliament that BJP might not support it. All these situations caused tension and pressure, he added. He too plans to visit Seemandhra in the next couple of days to undertake campaigning.
Another BJP leader, N. Ramchander Rao, who contested from Malkajgiri Assembly seat, said the run-up to the elections was quite hectic and he used to hold meetings till midnight with party workers on a daily basis. But he is relaxed now and on a thanksgiving visit to the residences of some of the important BJP and TDP activists.
Mr. Rao, who is a senior advocate, said he would start attending criminal courts from next week, even as he and the other contestants are eagerly awaiting the results.

Army chief appointment issue referred to EC: Antony
","Amid strong opposition by the BJP to the appointment of the next Army chief, the Government on Friday said the matter has been referred to the Election Commission and any decision will be taken only after getting its nod.
“The matter is before the Election Commission. We want to strictly follow all the procedures before taking any final decision on the issue,” Defence Minister AK Antony said when asked about the status of appointing the next Army chief.
The matter was sent to the Election Commission by the Defence Ministry earlier this week though the poll panel has already said that appointments, promotions, tenders and procurements are not covered under the Model Code of Conduct in the ongoing elections as well as any other election in the future.
On why the Ministry has sent the matter to the Election Commission despite its March 27 order, highly-placed Defence Ministry sources said such matters are important and it was felt that nod of all authorities concerned should be taken before proceeding.
The BJP has been opposing the appointment of the next Army chief by the UPA Government, arguing that there was no hurry to do so and the matter should be left to the next government.
Army Vice Chief Lt Gen Dalbir Singh Suhag is the frontrunner for appointment to the top post which will fall vacant on July 31 after the retirement of present Army chief Gen Bikram Singh.
Traditionally, the appointment of chief of services has been made two months before the retirement of the incumbent.
However, in the case of Gen Bikram Singh, the appointment was done three months before the retirement of Gen V K Singh, who was engaged in a long—drawn battle with the government over his age issue.

Fighting erupts in Ukraine
","Russia on Friday marked the 69th anniversary of victory in World War II with an impressive display of military might in Moscow and Crimea that served to underscore President Vladimir Putin’s triumph in bringing the Black Sea peninsula back into the Russian fold.
In stark contrast to the festive atmosphere in Russia, across the border in Ukraine the mood was grim, with V-Day festivities in Kiev cancelled and fighting erupting again in the strife-riven southeast.
The traditional display of war muscle in Moscow was the largest in 20 years. Eleven thousand troops marched across Red Square in bright and warm spring weather, followed by huge Topol-M intercontinental ballistic missiles and scores of tanks, rocket launchers and military hardware. Rounding off the parade, 69 military aircraft zoomed overhead, one for each year since V-Day.
After overseeing the Moscow parade, Mr. Putin travelled to Crimea to preside over a massive military show in Sevastopol, the headquarters of the Russian Black Sea fleet in Crimea.
It was Mr. Putin’s first trip to Crimea after it split from Ukraine and rejoined Russia two months ago, and the Russian leader made the most of the occasion to emphasise his role in the historic reunification.
In a telling departure from protocol, Mr. Putin personally took the salute from the Russian Black Sea fleet, sailing in a command boat past a line of warships anchored in Sevastopol’s bay before watching a flypast by dozens of aircraft.
Addressing the military in Sevastopol, Mr. Putin hailed Crimea’s reunion with Russia. “I am sure that 2014 will go into the annals of our history as the year when the people living here firmly decided to be together with Russia. Thereby they reaffirmed fidelity to the historical truth and the memory of our ancestors,” Mr. Putin said.
Attending an open-air festive concert in Sevastopol, Mr. Putin was greeted as a hero, with thousands of spectators chanting “Putin,” “Russia” and “Spasibo” (Thank you).
As Russia celebrated, fighting was raging in Mariupol, a city of half-a-million in Ukraine’s Donetsk region, as government forces battled pro-Russia activists and their loyalists among local police for control of the police headquarters. Footage from Mariupol showed tanks rumbling down the city centre towards the blazing police building, crowds trying to block their way and a man lying on the blood-splattered pavement either wounded or killed.
Ukrainian Interior Minister Arsen Avakov said 21 protesters and one Ukrainian security officer had been killed in the fighting in Mariupol.
Russia Today TV channel said its cameraman was wounded in Mariupol.
Protesters claimed to have captured from the military an armoured vehicle in Mariupol and two Grad multiple launchers in Donetsk.
Two rebellious eastern regions, Donetsk and Luhansk, are set to hold local referendums on “state sovereignty” rejecting Mr. Putin’s appeal to postpone the vote.
In Kiev, authorities cancelled a military parade citing the risk of provocations and V-Day was marked by a low-key wreath laying ceremony.

‘British press focusses on negative reports on India,’ says India’s High Commissioner in London "," The British press focussed too much on negative stories about India, India’s High Commissioner in London Y.K. Sinha said at an event in Parliament this week, urging parliamentarians and others in both countries to become champions of a stronger bilateral relationship. 
Pointing to the The Times, the Guardian and the Financial Times (the last of which he said had been very bullish on India until very recently), he said stories about India focussed on negative angles. “Where is India’s success story? Why is everyone queuing up to assiduously woo India?: there must be a reason. There is something right happening in India and I’m afraid that story is not being well publicised,” he said at an event organised on the contribution of Indian companies in Britain.
Despite India being set to grow at 7.1% this year and 7.8% next year, it was still being criticised for not growing fast enough, said Mr. Sinha. “India is the story of today and it will be the story of tomorrow... Engaging India is extremely important.” The High Commissioner said that while India and Britain’s long history could be seen as an advantage, it also could be a disadvantage. “People here feel they know India well but I’m afraid they don’t,” he said.
His emphasis on the bilateral relationship was echoed by Baron O’ Neill , the economist who coined the phase BRICS. “India could do so much better,” he said, arguing that given demographic trends, the country could be growing at 12.5%. 
“Between 2015 and 2035 just the increase in India’s working age population will be bigger than the combined working population of the four largest EU countries… if that translates into people actually having jobs... in my judgment, India could easily repeat in the next 20 years at least what China has done in the past 30 years and grow by double digits... They need to do more stuff in order to achieve this,” he said. 
PM’S U.K. visit 
The High Commissioner also highlighted Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s forthcoming visit to Britain — which will combine the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in London in April and a bilateral visit. 
The Commonwealth had until recently suffered from “benign neglect”, he said. As Britain prepared to leave the EU it was time for the country and others to look towards the Commonwealth not just as “an old boy’s club to talk about shared legacies of the past…we have to be forward looking,” said the High Commissioner .

India-China ties a ‘cold war-like’ bond in making: US expert ","India and China have a “cold war-like” relationship in the making but New Delhi is unlikely to join something framed as a US-led front to contain Beijing, a former American diplomat has said.
Alyssa Ayres, who served in the South and Central Asia Bureau of the State Department, made the remarks last week in New York during the launch of her latest book Our Time Has Come: How India is Making Its Place in the World.
“It is a cold war-like relationship in the making. India and China have had a strong commercial relationship, but that is increasingly less satisfying for India, for many of the same reasons the United States is dissatisfied with its trade relationship with China,” she said.
To a question on India-China ties, Ms. Ayres, currently a fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, a top American think-tank, said that for a while the commercial relationship between the two countries had relegated their strategic competition to the backseat.
“I think India [is] concerned about the increasingly larger presence that China is establishing across the Indian Ocean, with a base in Djibouti,” the ex-diplomat said.
She added that India may also be concerned over China’s “deep relationship” with Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and the investments it is making in the two countries.
Asked about the impression in the US that New Delhi is a ""good bet"" to contain Beijing, she has said India is unlikely to be part of such an initiative.
“I think India is going to be highly unlikely to be enlisted in something framed as a US-led effort to contain China. That is not what India seeks to do. It seeks to defend its own interests. It seeks to uphold the liberal world order,” Ms. Ayres said.
“India has been a big supporter of global norms, of freedom of navigation. But it also partners with China in many arenas. The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), India is the number two capital contributor,” she noted.
The BRICS organisation went from being just an idea in a research paper to being a real institution, she said, adding India is very active with that and the five-nation grouping has created its own development bank.
“India became a member of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation. It's hedging its own bets as global governance reform lags on in the 20th-century institutions. And so where it has put some of its eggs in the new organisations basket, it has partnered with China on that front,” Ms. Ayres said.
To another question, she said that there would be a measured response from India if there was a repeat of the 2008 Mumbai terrorist attack.
“Based on what we saw with the surgical strikes of the previous year or the year before last, I would not expect a completely passive response. I would expect something measured, but much more active,” she said.

US, Filipino troops begin large military drill
","More than 5,000 U.S. and Filipino troops began two weeks of military exercises on Monday to prepare to jointly deal with any potential crisis in the Philippines, which is prone to natural disasters and has been locked in a dangerous territorial standoff with China.
U.S. and Philippine military officials said at an >opening ceremony that 3,000 Filipino soldiers and 2,500 American military personnel would take part in the annual “Balikatan,” or shoulder to shoulder, exercises the largest of several military drills the allies stage each year.
American and Philippine officials said the manoeuvres would focus on maritime security and disaster response, but avoided linking the war games with their concern over China, which they have criticized for its increasingly assertive behaviour in disputed South China Sea territories.
The Philippines, the oldest of Washington’s five defence treaty allies in Asia, has turned to the U.S. to modernize its ill-equipped military amid the increasingly tense territorial rifts with China.
Dozens of left-wing activists protested outside the main military camp in the Philippine capital, Manila, where the opening ceremony was held. They said the drills and a recently signed agreement that allows a larger U.S. military presence in the country would violate the Philippine Constitution, which prohibits foreign troops except when their presence is covered by a treaty.
Australia deployed 65 army soldiers and air force personnel to participate in live-fire manoeuvres and charity activities. It also deployed a P3 Orion aircraft for a surveillance exercise with U.S. and Philippine military counterparts, Royal Australian Air Force Wing Commander Nicholas Pratt said.
Australia has signed an agreement with the Philippines that allows its forces to hold military exercises with Filipino troops in the country, the only other such pact Manila has signed aside from the United States.
Philippine Foreign Secretary Albert del Rosario said the exercises would strengthen the countries’ capability to deal with increasing tensions “due to excessive and expansive maritime and territorial claims” and “aggressive patterns of behaviour” that threaten regional peace and stability.
The exercises will be held in military camps in the northern and western Philippines, including in Zambales and Palawan provinces on the edge of the South China Sea. The manoeuvres will include maritime surveillance exercises, live-fire drills, training on handling bombs and “mass casualty response,” a Philippine military statement said.
China, the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia, Taiwan and Vietnam have overlapping claims in potentially oil-and gas-rich areas in the busy South China Sea, with Beijing laying claim to virtually the entire body of water.
The territorial spats between Beijing and Manila have worsened after Chinese government ships effectively gained control of the disputed Scarborough Shoal in 2012 then blockaded the Second Thomas Shoal, where Philippine marines have been based on a grounded navy ship since 1999.
Chinese coast guard ships have twice attempted to block Philippine ships bringing in food and fresh batches of marines to Second Thomas Shoal, increasing tensions. A Philippine military plane dropped food supplies and letters from Filipino supporters to the marines marooned at the Second Thomas Shoal over the weekend.

We will move forward with severe sanctions against Russia: Obama
","The United States has indicated the timeline for imposing new sanctions on Russia: end of May, when Ukraine is to hold presidential elections.
“If in fact we see the disruptions and the destabilisation continuing so severely that it impedes elections on May 25, we will not have a choice but to move forward with additional, more severe sanctions,” U.S. President Barack Obama declared after talks in Washington with German Chancellor Angela Merkel last week.
With Moscow strongly opposed to any elections in Ukraine in the backdrop of Kiev's ongoing military crackdown on anti-government protests in the east, further sanctions appear inevitable.
The first two rounds of Western sanctions have targeted Russian officials and businessmen close to President Vladimir Putin. They had little direct effect on the Russian economy, but spurred an outflow of capital that may total $150 billion in 2014 and increased the cost of borrowing for Russian companies.
According to Professor Alexei Portansky of the Higher School of Economics, Russia’s big companies will feel the pinch later this year, when they face refinancing of their foreign loans to the tune of $103 billion.
Mr. Obama said that the third round of sanctions will penalise selected Russian industries, such as energy, defence and finance, including trade credits.
The U.S. has already introduced restrictions on the export to Russia of high-tech dual-use products and technologies, which currently stands at about $1.5 billion a year.
Experts said the ban will mainly affect Russian research institutions and some high-tech companies, but not the defence industry, which is largely self-sufficient.
The Russian energy sector is unlikely to be targeted by Europe, which heavily depends on Russian supplies. Even Mr Obama admitted that it was “unrealistic” to hope that one could “turn off the tap on all Russian oil and natural gas exports.”
On the day the European Union expanded sanctions against Russian officials last week, Austria’s OMG oil and gas company signed agreement with Russia’s Gazprom to extend South Stream, a natural gas pipeline Russia plans to build across the Black Sea, into Austria.
The threat of sanctions has prompted Moscow to seek greater diversification of its energy exports. When President Vladimir Putin visits Beijing later this month, the two countries are expected to sign a deal on Russian gas supplies to China, which already imports over 15 million tons of Russian oil.
Europe’s business is strongly opposed to sanctions. Last week Germany’s business empires, including BASF, Siemens, Volkswagen, Adidas and Deutsche Bank, issued a warning against escalating sanctions against Russia.
The Kremlin hopes the sanctions will make Russia stronger.
“Thanks to Western sanctions, Russia has been given incentive to reduce dependence from outside and its regional economies will instead be more self-sufficient,” Russia’s Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev told the Parliament a week ago.
After Visa and MasterCard cut services to two Russian banks affected by U.S. sanctions, Mr. Putin approved a plan to create a national payment system within the next six months.
Even Kremlin critics admit that Russia’s resilience to sanctions may be greater the West’s capacity to maintain them.
“Russia has resources to withstand sanctions for at least three-five years,” said Mikhail Khodorkovsky, former oil tycoon. “Europe should first ask itself whether it is prepared to keen penalising Russia over such a long time.”

Strong earthquake shakes Mexico's Pacific coast
","A strong earthquake shook the southern Pacific coast of Mexico as well as the capital and several inland states Thursday, sending frightened people into unseasonal torrential rains that were also bearing down on the coast.
The 6.4-magnitude quake in southern Guerrero state was centred about 15 km north of Tecpan de Galeana, according to the U.S. Geological Survey, and was felt about 277 km miles away in Mexico City, where office workers streamed into the streets away from high-rise buildings.
There were no reports of injuries. A 30-meter (yard) section of elevated road collapsed in Tecpan, near the epicenter, closing the federal highway between the resort cities of Acapulco and Zihuatanejo. The road had been damaged in a magnitude-7.2 quake that hit April 18 in roughly the same area and was under repair when it collapsed. The detour road was under water from the rains Thursday.
Tecpan shook ferociously, causing a “wave of panic” and some roofs to cave in, Mayor Crisoforo Otero Heredia said. As the day went on, civil protection workers started hearing of collapsed houses, some in remote areas in the municipality of Tecpan such as the town of La Cienega.
A wall collapsed in Chilpancingo, the capital of Guerrero state, but civil protection crews in Acapulco found no problems except scared citizens who were forced to take refuge in the heavy rain that was hitting the region.
In Mexico City, elegantly dressed businesswoman Carmen Lopez was leaving a downtown office building when the ground began to shake. She dashed across the street to a leafy median as light poles swayed violently above her.
“That was just too scary,” Lopez said as she quickly started dialing her cellphone to alert friends and family.
Behind her, thousands of people poured from neighboring office buildings, following pre-planned evacuation routes to areas considered safe in case of falling glass.
The quake occurred at a depth of 23 km and its epicentre was about 66 km from that of the April 18 quake that shook central and southern Mexico.

The sweeping review of U.S. nuclear policy does not call for any net increase in strategic nuclear weapons.

3 Chinese farmers face jail for forming ‘own government’
","When the villagers of Jitan, a small township in China’s central Henan province, were facing a threat to their lands from a powerful developer, they turned to Beijing for help.
When their petitions fell on deaf ears, the villagers decided to take matters into their own hands: three farmers, out of desperation, quietly set up their own ""government office"", and using copies of official seals, began issuing ""orders"" in the style of government directives, telling local developers to prevent their land acquisitions.
Remarkably, for six months, the citizen-run government office – perhaps the only in one party-controlled China run by ordinary people – saw unsuspecting developers follow their orders, assuming that the directives were from the Communist Party. The office even sent out recruitment notices. Ten aspiring civil servants applied.
For half-a-year, China’s only people-run government office appeared to work as a government should: it helped fight for villagers’ rights, and blocked developers’ attempting to forcibly acquire farmland.
However, last month, local CPC cadres discovered the three person-run office and shut it down. The three farmers – Zhang Haixin, Ma Xianglan and Wang Liangshuang – may now face three years in jail, charged with impersonating a public office and fabricating official documents, the Global Times reported.
Their story has shed light on how far China’s villagers, desperate to hold on to their land, or at least to receive fair compensation, are willing to go in an increasingly futile battle against powerful developers, who often have close ties with local Communist Party cadres and leaders looking to boost their coffers.
The story of Ms. Zhang (46), who led the effort to establish a “people’s government”, began in 2007, when she started petitioning provincial government officials against local leaders, who were visiting her restaurant but refusing to pay, the South China Morning Post (SCMP) reported.
Her blocked petitions led her to organise fellow citizens who were fighting for justice, as she led groups of petitioners to the provincial capital, Zhengzhou, even paying for their travel.
When their efforts failed, she decided to set up her own government office. She studied land policy and the law, closely examined official documents and then started issuing orders using copied official seals.
Her “government” operated out of her one-room apartment that sat down the street from the local government office.
Remarkably, their office functioned for a year, issuing orders that helped protect villagers’ rights – and, some would argue, fulfilling the role that the local Communist Party government had failed to perform.
However, earlier this year, a property developer discovered their office and reported it to higher authorities. The Dengzhou city’s prosecutors said the three have now been charged with using fake seals and issuing fabricated documents.
Ma Xianglan, a farmer from a village near Dengzhou, told the SCMP that Ms. Zhang was seen by many as someone who, for villagers, “could get things done”.
“Soon as I saw her, I was disappointed. She was chubby and tanned, standing at 1.6 meters,"" Ms. Ma said. “But when we began to speak, my doubts began to clear as her speech is well paced and she knew a lot about land policy.”
A lawyer told the Global Times Ms. Zhang could face a jail term of three years. For the villagers of Henan, though, she is anyone but a criminal.

Monica Lewinsky: My boss took advantage of me
","Former White House intern Monica Lewinsky has broken her silence on her 1990s affair with then US President Bill Clinton, saying he took advantage of her even though it was a “consensual relationship”.
“I, myself, deeply regret what happened between me and President Clinton. Let me say it again: I. Myself. Deeply. Regret. What. Happened,” Ms. Lewinsky said in an exclusive article she wrote for Vanity Fair magazine.
In the article, Ms. Lewinsky said it is time to stop “tiptoeing around my past and other people’s futures. I am determined to have a different ending to my story.”
“I’ve decided, finally, to stick my head above the parapet so that I can take back my narrative and give a purpose to my past. What this will cost me, I will soon find out,” she said.
Maintaining that her affair with Mr. Clinton was one between two consenting adults, Ms. Lewinsky wrote that it was the public humiliation she suffered in the wake of the scandal that permanently altered the direction of her life, according to Vanity Fair.
“Sure, my boss took advantage of me, but I will always remain firm on this point: it was a consensual relationship,” she said in the article.
“Any ‘abuse’ came in the aftermath, when I was made a scapegoat in order to protect his powerful position...The Clinton administration, the special prosecutor’s minions, the political operatives on both sides of the aisle, and the media were able to brand me. And that brand stuck, in part because it was imbued with power,” she wrote according to the excerpts.
“The buzz in some circles has been that the Clintons must have paid me off; why else would I have refrained from speaking out? I can assure you that nothing could be further from the truth,” Ms. Lewinsky, said.
Ms. Lewinsky said in the article that when the news of her affair with Mr. Clinton broke in 1998, not only was she arguably the most humiliated person in the world, but “thanks to the Drudge Report, I was also possibly the first person whose global humiliation was driven by the Internet.”
Her current goal, she said, “Is to get involved with efforts on behalf of victims of online humiliation and harassment and to start speaking on this topic in public forums.”

Radical cleric claims he worked secretly for M15
","The trial of the radical Muslim cleric Abu Hamza al-Masri in a New York court on terror charges took a rather unexpected turn on Wednesday, when his lawyers told the court that he secretly worked for M15, Britain’s national intelligence and security agency.
A leading figure on the British Islamist scene, the Egypt-born cleric Abu Hamza, who was known for the hate sermons he would deliver at London’s Finsbury Park mosque, was arrested in 2004 by the U.K. police, convicted of stoking murder and racial hatred, and jailed for seven years in 2006. He was extradited to the United States after a protracted legal battle in 2012.
In the Manhattan federal court where his trial is being held, Abu Hamza said that he had been asked by M15 to “keep the streets of London safe”; in other words his job was to reign in more radical and violent Islamist elements.
Abu Hamza denied all 11 charges against him, which includes the kidnapping of 16 western tourists and the killing of four of them in Yemen in 1998.
Giving his background to the court, he said that he went from running a strip-bar in Soho “on the wrong side of morality” to a convert to Islam. He claimed to have been a member of the Royal Society of Engineers and to have worked at the Royal Military Academy at Sandhurst.
The judge refused to accept as evidence documents from Scotland Yard which his lawyers said would demonstrate how Abu Hamza had cooperated with the police to keep the peace and negotiate for the release of hostages.

Out-of-court settlement in journalist attack cases
","While those who attack journalists in Pakistan often get away with impunity, data gathered by the National Police Bureau recently shows that in most cases the victims settle for a compromise.
Addressing a function to mark World Press Freedom day organised by Unesco on Saturday, Mr. Ihsan Ghani, Director General, National Police Bureau said it was found that a majority of the cases, including murder cases, went into compromise and so there were no convictions.
Mr. Ghani said that every province would soon have a hotline dedicated for journalists Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Islamabad already had one.
In the 42 cases of deaths of journalists in the last decade, there have been only two convictions — in the cases of Daniel Pearl and Wali Khan Babar, said M. Ziauddin, group editor of Express Tribune.

Signs of helplessness
","As Ukraine slides steadily towards civil war, the sanctions announced by the United States and the European Union go further than previous attempts but show no results on the ground. On April 28, Washington announced measures against companies, officials, and wealthy businesspeople with ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s government, and the following day the European Union announced sanctions against 15 Russian and Ukrainian officials including General Valery Gerasimov, Russia’s chief of military staff, and Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Kozak, who is tasked with developing Crimea, the Ukrainian province annexed by Moscow on March 1. Among the Ukrainians named, presumably for asset freezes and travel bans, are the pro-Russian Igor Strelkov, an adviser to Crimean Prime Minister Sergei Aksyonov, and Sergei Tsyplakov, reportedly the head of the People’s Militia in Ukraine’s Donbass region. The U.S. sanctions are wider than the European ones, targeting businesses and individuals; 17 companies are involved, mainly in oil and gas, construction and finance. The most notable target is Igor Sechin, president of the Russian state-owned oil giant Rosneft; the financial services firm Visa will have to suspend credit card services to Bank Rossiya and other banks.
The sanctions, however, are less severe than they look, and could cause problems for western firms, which may be able to keep shares in Russian companies whose senior personnel are under sanctions but may be banned from contact with such executives. This could hit BP, which owns 19.75 per cent of Rosneft and has faced huge costs since its 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster in the Gulf of Mexico; its first-quarter profits are down by 24 per cent. Other firms with Russian interests include Chevron, ExxonMobil, and Shell; in addition, the Russian quasi-state conglomerate Rostec, whose head Sergei Chemezov is under sanctions, manufactures components for Boeing, and a Russian regional airline is set to buy Boeing jets. As for Visa, cardholders will be able to withdraw money. The U.S. and the EU may want to block Mr. Putin’s apparent plan to redraw Ukraine’s eastern border, but Moscow could retaliate with its own sanctions, particularly in oil and gas transactions. Secondly, events in eastern Ukraine are now out of Kiev’s control. On April 28, the pro-Kiev Mayor of Kharkiv, Gennady Kernes, was shot and severely wounded; separatists have occupied regional administration buildings in Luhansk, and the government airbase at Kramatorsk has been repeatedly attacked. The western bloc may so far have avoided stating preferred solutions, but its own impotence over Ukraine is increasingly obvious.

2 Chinese sailors die in Pacific after boat capsizes
","Two Chinese sailors died and six are believed to be missing after their boat sank in the Pacific Ocean, an official at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base said on Sunday.
Maj. Sarah Schwennesen said that a Venezuelan fishing boat reported finding 11 sailors floating in a raft on Friday afternoon.
She said the Venezuelan crew said four sailors were badly burned. Two later died of their injuries.
Airmen from the 563rd Rescue Group parachuted into the water on Saturday afternoon and used inflatable boats to reach the Venezuelan vessel, which is 1,100 nautical miles west of Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, Maj. Schwennesen said. They treated the injured sailors Saturday and into Sunday morning.
The rescuers treated the sailors, who will be hoisted, along with the U.S. airmen, onto three helicopters on Sunday and flown to Cabo San Lucas. The injured pair will then be taken in a different aircraft to a burn unit in San Diego, accompanied by the airmen giving them care.
The distance required to reach the sailors has been the most challenging, Maj. Schwennesen said. Because of an estimated six-hour flight that included flying over miles of ocean, a refuelling aircraft was dispatched from the Arizona Air National Guard in Phoenix.

Pakistan releases American identified as FBI agent
","Pakistan released an FBI agent on bail on Thursday after three days in custody, officials said, a move that is likely to prevent the situation from escalating into a diplomatic spat.
The American man was detained after airport authorities found him carrying ammunition and three knives on Monday as he was about to board a flight for the Pakistani capital, Islamabad.
The arrest threatened to open a new chapter in troubled relations between Pakistan and the U.S., which have been uneasy allies since the September 11 terror attacks. But the relatively fast release, if confirmed, suggested efforts to defuse any tensions.
A law enforcement official in the U.S. has said the man was an FBI agent and said he was in Pakistan as part of a multi-agency, anti-corruption programme. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the diplomatic sensitivities of the case, said the agent appeared to have made a mistake and didn’t mean to carry bullets aboard the plane.
U.S. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki confirmed the detention on Wednesday and said the U.S. was coordinating with Pakistani authorities to resolve the matter. She did not identify the man.
A Pakistani court directed the man to submit a surety bond of Pakistani Rs. 1 million ($9,800) for his bail, police officer Rao Anwaar said. The American arrived in Karachi on May 1 and was detained after officials found him with the ammunition, knives and electronic devices that were being examined.
Other police officials said investigators were under immense pressure from the Interior Ministry and other government officials to release the American so the report was rushed. They found he had no criminal intention in carrying the bullets during domestic air travel, the officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity in exchange for release the details.
Washington needs Pakistan’s help fighting al-Qaeda and stabilising neighbouring Afghanistan, as NATO uses Pakistani roads to supply its troops. However, relations have strained over a series of incidents. CIA contractor Raymond Davis shot and killed two Pakistani men in Lahore in January 2011. The U.S. unilaterally killed Osama bin Laden in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad in May 2011 and American forces accidentally killed 24 Pakistani troops along the Afghan border the same year. U.S. drones strikes in the country also have angered Pakistanis.

Face of money: Ukrainian artists create Trump portrait ","They shot to fame in 2015 with a portrait of Vladimir Putin made of bullet shells from the killing fields of eastern Ukraine. Now, the two Ukrainian artists are back with a portrait of Donald Trump made from coins and poker chips.
Threats forced Daria Marchenko, 35, and Daniel Green, 34, to leave their homeland in November 2016. They now lead an itinerant life, travelling and exhibiting their work in the United States and Latin America. 
The Trump portrait, finished one month ago, is made of nearly 4,000 one cent and five-cent pieces. Poker chips are used for the US president’s shoulders.
The artists are now searching for a place for a public unveiling.
As with their Face of War portrait of the Russian leader, the Trump version, called “Face of Money” plays in the light revealing different expressions. 
They came up with the idea of the enormous portrait — nearly eight foot by five foot — last summer when Mr. Putin ordered the United States to reduce its diplomatic footprint in Russia by 755 employees.
Mr. Trump responded by thanking Mr. Putin, saying it would allow the United States to cut down its payroll and “save a lot of money.” 
“I thought, ‘oh my God, you are so cheap, how can you be American president’?” says Mr. Green. “At that moment, I thought coins is the best way to show his portrait.”
The duo deliberately chose one cent and five-cent pieces, the smallest denominations of U.S. currency, to illustrate their point.
The poker chips are a nod to the casinos the billionaire once ran in Atlantic City, New Jersey.

Search abandoned for landslip survivors
","Rescue teams abandoned the search for survivors on Saturday after a landslip buried a hillside village in northern Afghanistan, killing at least 300 people under a fast-moving tide of rock and mud.
Local people and emergency workers using shovels tried in vain to find victims trapped under the massive landslip that engulfed Aab Bareek village in Badakhshan province.
Officials said that the final death toll could rise as high as 500 after Friday’s disaster, updating earlier information that 2,500 people were feared dead.
“Based on our reports, 300 houses are under the debris,” Badakhshan governor Shah Waliullah Adeeb told reporters at the scene. “We have a list of around 300 people confirmed dead.”
“We cannot continue the search and rescue operation anymore, as the houses are under metres of mud. We will offer prayers for the victims and make the area a mass grave.”
Relief teams arrived at first light on Saturday to be confronted by the enormous scale of destruction and hundreds of homeless families who had spent a night in the open.
“The first figure [of 2,500 feared dead] that we announced was obtained from local people, not from our technical team,” Gul Mohammad Bedar, the deputy governor of Badakhshan, told AFP.
“We think the death toll will not rise beyond 500.”
Many villagers were at Friday prayers in two mosques when they were entombed by the torrent of debris, and a second landslip hit people who had rushed to assist those in need. “I have lost my sister, my house was partially destroyed,” Noor Mohammad (45) told AFP. “We cannot really get anyone out of the debris. We have lost hope of rescuing anyone.”
Gul Bibi (50) cried while she sat in a tent with some female relatives.
“We were at home when the first landslip happened,” she said.
“We left the house, but my husband and son went back inside, then the second one hit. “We have not been able to find them. We are devastated.”
The landslip in the Argo district of Badakhshan left little evidence of the hundreds of homes it swept away at about midday (0730 GMT) after days of heavy rain.
“There is a very thick layer of mud. It is very difficult for people to take dead bodies out,” Sayed Abdullah Homayun Dehqan, provincial director of the Afghan National Disaster Management Authority, said at the site.

Obama intends to withdraw special trade benefits for Russia
","U.S. President Barack Obama intends to withdraw special privileges granted to Russia because the country is too economically advanced to need preferential treatment reserved for less developed countries, the White House has said.
Mr. Obama notified Congress that he intends to remove Russia from the Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) programme as Moscow is “sufficiently advanced” to warrant any preferential treatment.
Once Russia’s eligibility is withdrawn, which would be effected via a presidential proclamation, U.S. imports of GSP-eligible goods from Russia will be subject to normal, non-preferential rates of duty, Mr. Obama in his notification said.
The purpose of the programme, which allowed $19.9 billion in imports to enter the U.S. duty-free in 2012, is to assist developing countries to use trade to boost their economic development, U.S. Trade Representatives (USTR) Mike Froman said.
“Russia has advanced beyond the level of economic development and competitiveness for GSP eligibility. As such, Russia should no longer qualify to receive GSP benefits,” he said in a statement.
“The President’s decision is consistent with the World Bank’s designation of Russia as a ‘high income country’ as well as actions by the European Union and Canada to remove Russia from similar programmes,” Mr. Froman said.
The U.S.-Russia relations have hit an all-time low since the Cold War following the unrest in Ukraine, which Washington says is being fuelled by Moscow.
The announcement comes on a day when Russian President Vladimir Putin said his country has pulled troops back from the Ukraine border. But the White House was sceptical of the claim.

Syrian rebels begin evacuating Homs
","Hundreds of Syrian rebels on Wednesday began evacuating their last bastions in the central city of Homs under a >ceasefire deal struck last week with government forces, opposition activists and the city’s Governor said.
The exit of some 1,200 fighters from rebel strongholds in Homs will mark a de-facto end of the rebellion in the battered city, which was one of the first places to rise up against President Bashar Assad’s rule, earning its nickname as “the capital of the revolution”.
Around mid-morning on Wednesday, dozens of fighters boarded five buses that arrived at the police command on the edge of the rebel-held areas ahead of the evacuation, opposition activists said. Afterward, two of the buses left the city, heading north.
An activist who goes by the name of Abu Yassin al-Homsi said all fighters and any remaining civilians were expected to leave the city during the day, adding that they would be taken a few kilometres north to the rebel held towns of Talbiseh and al-Dar al-Kabira on the northern edge of Homs province a short drive away.
Later, Mr. al-Homsi confirmed later that the first group of fighters that evacuated the city centre “arrived safely” in rebel-held areas north of the province. Each fighter was allowed to carry his rifle and a bag of belongings with him. One rocket propelled grenade launcher and a machinegun were also allowed on each bus, he said.
“We are very sad for what is happening today. We kept urging the international community to lift the siege but there was no response,” Mr. al-Homsi said. “We have lost more than 2,000 martyrs in nearly two years of siege.”
It was a bitter moment for the exhausted rebels, who have been holed up in the historic quarters of Homs where they had pledged to fight till the end. Some fighters had said they would rather die than give up Homs.
Isolated and battered after months of bombardment and blockades that caused widespread hunger, they agreed last Friday to a cease-fire deal that would allow hundreds of fighters to evacuate from 13 neighbourhoods around the city’s historic centre where they had barricaded themselves.
The rebels include hardcore fighters from the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front group and other Islamic factions.
Their exit hands over to Mr. Assad’s forces a strategic but largely destroyed city ahead of presidential elections scheduled to be held on June 3, 2014. Once the evacuation is completed, the government will have control of all but one area of Homs, the rebel-held Waer district just outside the Old City. Some activists said negotiations were underway for a similar deal there.
It quickly came under a series of crushing government offensives, turning into a battleground that left entire blocks and much of its historic quarters in ruins. Thousands of people were killed and almost all its residents fled.
For well over a year, the government forces have been besieging rebels in the string of districts they held in the city centre, around its ancient bazaars. The siege caused severe shortages in food and medicine.
Earlier this year, around 1,400 people, including fighters who surrendered, were evacuated from the city in a U.N.-mediated operation.
Most recently, on April 7, a masked gunman killed a beloved, elderly Dutch priest who lived in a monastery in a Homs rebel-held district after deciding to stay alongside civilians who were unable to leave.
While the agreement represents a demoralising admission of defeat by opposition forces, it can also be seen as a face-saving deal for both sides.
Weakened rebels, for whom Homs’ collapse was only a matter of time, get a safe exit, while the government can save manpower and weapons and claim it was able to retake the last rebel bastions without spilling more blood.
In exchange for their evacuation, activists say opposition fighters will allow aid into two northern pro-government villages, Nubul and Zahra, besieged by the rebels.
Director of the London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, Rami Abdurrahman, said roads to Nubul and Zahra in northern Syrian were opened as the evacuations from Homs started on Wednesday, apparently to allow the flow of aid.
As part of the Homs deal, rebels would also release up to 70 pro-government gunmen and an Iranian woman they hold captive in the northern city of Aleppo, several activists said.
It was not immediately clear whether they had been released.

Pope okays ‘miracle’ for Paul VI in sainthood process
","Pope Francis has approved a miracle credited to the intercession of Paul VI and set the date for the late pontiff’s beatification for Oct. 19, the Vatican said on Saturday.
Pope Francis had authorized the beatification, the last formal step before possible sainthood, a day earlier, the Vatican said.
Last month, Pope Francis formally proclaimed as saints two other predecessors- John XXIII and John Paul II.
Paul VI, who reigned as pontiff from 1963—1978, made landmark progress in improving Catholics’ relationship with other Christians. His papacy is also remembered by his decision, after years of study, to ban contraception for Catholics, in a 1968 encyclical, “Humanae Vitae” (“of human life“).
That teaching was widely disregarded. The issue is among many expected to get scrutiny in a special meeting of bishops called at the Vatican this fall to discuss family life. The beatification ceremony would come at the end of the gathering.
One ‘miracle’ is required for beatification. The Vatican, as is its custom, didn’t give details about the ‘miracle’ which, according to the Holy See’s detailed criteria, must be certified by doctors as having no medical explanation.
Italian media have reported that the ‘miracle’ was that of a baby born healthy in California despite the diagnoses in 2001 of the rupture of the foetal bladder and absence of amniotic liquid. The mother reportedly ignored advice to abort the child and prayed for Paul VI’s intercession at the urging of a nun. The child was born a month prematurely and is now a healthy adolescent, the news reports said.
The 1968 encyclical also reinforced the church’s ban on abortion.
Paul VI disposed of many of the ornate trappings of the papacy, a forerunner of Francis’ disdain for fanciness at the Vatican.
The late pontiff continued John XXIII’s groundbreaking move to modernize the church by shepherding to its conclusion the Second Vatican Council.

Modi may ‘bring India, China closer’, says Chinese scholar
","Narendra Modi’s track record in Gujarat as a “practical businessman” suggested that he would look to improve India’s relations with China if elected, a commentary published on Tuesday in a prominent Chinese newspaper has argued.
“Modi was once a practical businessman. After he got into politics, he established good relations with China. A large number of Chinese enterprises invested in Gujarat, contributing to the economic development of the State. Therefore, ties between China and India may become closer under Modi’s leadership,” said the commentary in the Communist Party–run tabloid Global Times, known for its nationalistic outlook.
The article, authored by Liu Zongyi, a scholar at the Shanghai Institute for International Studies, blamed “Western media and observers” for trying to “foment discord between China and India by hyping up nationalist Modi’s aggressive statements on the border issue between the two countries.”
“In fact,” it countered, “it has been a policy for India to offset the negative effects of China's rise by enhancing strategic cooperation with countries around China. It is unlikely that Modi will change this policy. However, it doesn’t mean he will strengthen the trend.” Chinese scholars have closely followed the on-going elections. Most strategic experts here are of the view that as far as India-China relations were concerned, the outcome might not have a significant impact considering the past record of both UPA and NDA governments in crafting a similar China policy.
Mr. Liu, however, argued that there was “disquiet” in the West about a possible Modi government in New Delhi.
“In its manifesto the BJP promises a multilateral diplomacy and the establishment of “a web of allies” to further India's best national interests, which steers away from a tilt toward the U.S. held by India in diplomacy in the past decades. This has caused worries from the West,” the article said.
“The West has adapted to an India with a weak central government in the past decades,” Mr. Liu said. “It is afraid that a strongman like Russian President Vladimir Putin will make India really strong and build the country into a challenger to the West economically and politically.”

Students fight ban on men using washing machines
","It’s not unusual to hear students at a university residence complain about terrible cafeteria food or slow Wi-Fi. But students at one residence in Madrid have added another, less familiar, complaint to their list: a long-standing rule that bans male students from using the residence’s washing machines.
Despite repeated calls for more than three years for a change in the rules, the code of conduct at the Duque de Ahumada de la Guardia Civil residence continues to specify that “use of the washing machines by male residents will result in expulsion, ranging from 15 days to three months, from the residence”.
Male students at the dorm, which caters for the children and grandchildren of Guardia Civil officers, are instead instructed to quietly pass their clothes to female friends to be washed.
The association that represents Guardia Civil officers is demanding that the rule be changed. “What is being asked of residents is obsolete, unjust, sexist and borderline ridiculous,” Francisco Cecilia, of the Unified Guardia Civil Association told El Mundo. “In today’s world, it makes no sense that male residents would have to secretly pass their clothes to a female or visit a laundromat to do their laundry.” — © Guardian Newspapers Limited, 2014

Protesters reject Putin’s call
","Rebels in eastern Ukraine have refused to postpone a referendum on their regions’ future despite a call from Russia’s President Vladimir Putin.
The coordinating councils of the self-proclaimed People’s Republics of Donetsk and Luhansk unanimously voted on Thursday to go ahead with the vote on Sunday as planned.
“The ongoing military operation by Ukrainian forces and the slaughter of protesters in Odessa have heightened people’s resolve to vote on Sunday,” protesters’ leader Denis Pushilin told reporters in Donetsk.
On Wednesday, Mr. Putin called on anti-government protesters in Ukraine to postpone the referendum in order to facilitate dialogue on autonomy with Kiev. He also urged Ukrainian authorities to call off their “punitive” operation in the east.
Mr. Putin backed a four-point peace plan for Ukraine proposed by Swiss President Didier Burkhalter, who is rotating head of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe. The plan called for ceasefire, de-escalation of tension, the launching of dialogue and elections in Ukraine.
However, Kiev on Thursday vowed to press on with its military crackdown irrespective of whether the referendum is adjourned.
“We must defend the territorial integrity of our country and free the temporary occupied territories [in Crimea],” Acting President Oleksandr Turchynov said, according to his press service.
Kiev’s reaction has hardened the protesters’ stance. “People don’t trust Ukrainian authorities and Kiev’s reaction was inadequate,” said Miroslav Rudenko, a leader of the Donetsk self-defence forces.
The question on the referendum ballot is: “Do you support the act of proclamation of sovereignty for the Donetsk People’s Republic?” In Luhansk, the question is identical.
Organisers said the ambiguous phrasing was intentional to allow them to decide whether to push for independence, greater autonomy within Ukraine or unification with Russia, depending on how things turn out after the vote.
International efforts have done little to reduce tension between Russia and the West over the Ukraine crisis. Mr. Putin on Thursday presided over Russia’s largest yet command and control exercises, which, he said, involved “all branches and services of the armed forces across the entire territory of Russia.”
The drills include two submarine missile launches, cruise missile firing by strategic bombers, and ground-to-air missile tests to repulse a nuclear attack. Russia has staged a series of armed forces drills near the Ukrainian border over the past two months.
NATO on Tuesday launched a record 6,000-strong military exercises in Estonia close to the Russian border, while NATO’s Supreme Allied Commander General Philip Breedlove called for permanent stationing of troops in Eastern Europe in the face of Russia’s “actions and military escalation” in Crimea.
U.S. President Barack Obama on Wednesday announced removing Russia from a list of countries whose exports enjoy preferential treatment. The White House said the move was “particularly appropriate” in the light of Russia’s actions in Ukraine.
At the same time the U.S. government has asked the courts to lift a ban on purchases of Russian missile engines that power U.S. heavy-duty Atlas 5 missiles.

OSCE observers held in Ukraine released
","Pro-Russia insurgents in eastern Ukraine on Saturday released the seven OSCE military observers and five Ukrainian assistants who had been held for more than a week.
The observers were seized on April 25 in Slovyansk, as they travelled with an Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe observer team. The insurgents said they possessed unspecified suspicious material and alleged they were spying for NATO.
An observer from Sweden was also seized as part of the team, but was released earlier.
Shortly before the release, the insurgents’ leader in Slovyansk, Vyacheslav Ponomarev, was quoted by the Interfax news agency as saying he ordered the release because of increasing insecurity in the city.
Two Ukrainian helicopters were reported shot down outside the city on Friday, killing two crew members and the Ukrainian Defence Ministry said two other soldiers were killed in a clash on the outskirts. Mr. Ponomarev said 10 local people were killed in a confrontation with soldiers on Slovyansk’s outskirts, but there was no independent confirmation.
Despite the release, tensions in Ukraine heightened sharply after at least 42 people died in clashes between government supporters and opponents in the Black Sea port of Odessa on Friday. The clash began with street fighting between the two sides, in which as least three people were reported killed by gunfire, then turned into a grisly conflagration when government opponents took refuge in a building that caught fire after protesters threw firebombs inside.
Russian President Vladimir Putin’s spokesman on Saturday decried the Odessa deaths as evidence that the interim government in Kiev encourages nationalist extremists.
“Their arms are up to their elbows in blood,” Russian news agencies quoted Dmitry Peskov as saying.

Britain’s privatisation drive hits a snag
","Carillion, one of Britain’s biggest construction outsourcing companies, was expected to hand over a brand new, gleaming building to Royal Liverpool Hospital in the northern English city in March last year. Carillion had begun the construction in 2014. But due to some complications, including the discovery of cracks in concrete beams, the project completion date was put off to early 2018.
However, the hospital remains a building site, after Carillion’s collapse earlier this year. The company went into compulsory liquidation on January 15, with net debts running to around £900 million and a massive pension deficit, after talks with lenders failed to result in further funding. Carillion, which employed 19,500 people in Britain and further tens of thousands abroad, has held around 450 public sector contracts — from the construction of major projects such as the hospital to the electrification of the Network Rail. With much of its work outsourced to third party contractors — Carillion had around 30 firms working for it on the Liverpool hospital project — the impact of the collapse is yet to fully unfold.
The government faced questions over its decision to continue to award contracts to the company amid concerns about its financial health — there were three profit warnings since July and its share price had collapsed 90%. Further, the company courted criticism for its prioritising of shareholders over sound financials: between 2012 and 2016, the company paid out dividends of £376 million to shareholders, more than twice the amount it had generated in net cash. In the last six months alone, before its collapse, the government awarded £2 billion in contracts to Carillion.
At any time, such a dramatic failure would have provoked a debate on the extent of the government’s use of and private contractors to deliver public services but with a Labour Party, led by Jeremy Corbyn, for whom a nationalisation agenda has become a central plank, it’s all the more so. Overturning the Labour’s long-running commitment to privatisation, the 2017 Labour manifesto pledged to bring key utilities back into public ownership.
“This is not one isolated case of government negligence and corporate failure; it is a broken system,” said Mr. Corbyn during an intense session of Prime Minister’s Questions, pointing to other controversial decisions such as the one late last year to allow two transport providers to forgo payments worth up to £2 billion for the franchise for the East Coast mainline. “We need our public services to be provided by public employees with a public service ethos and a strong public oversight.”
Mr. Corbyn is far from a lone voice. A research paper published by the Legatum Institute (a right-wing, Eurosceptic think tank) found a strong appetite for nationalisation, with over three quarters of those polled favouring the nationalisation of key services from water to rail. The Carillion collapse is likely to further strengthen that sentiment.
However, the collapse of Carillion could have far wider consequences, along with official investigations into what went wrong with the company itself. Britain’s accounting watchdog as well as MPs will look into the role of Carillion’s auditor KPMG. During a parliamentary committee session earlier this week, Labour MP Frank Field grilled the head of the accountancy watchdog on the “oligarchy” existing among accountancy firms, and asked whether the so-called ‘Big Four’ — Deloitte, PwC, EY and KPMG — needed to be broken up.

Afghan President slams Pakistan for harboring Taliban
","The Afghan president slammed Pakistan on Friday, blaming it for a wave of massive deadly attacks that have ravaged his nation recently and accusing Islamabad of harboring the Taliban. 
In a televised speech to the nation, Ashraf Ghani insisted the “center of Taliban terrorism is in Pakistan” and demanded that authorities in the neighboring country “show some concrete action to rid their territory of insurgents.” 
Mr. Ghani, flanked by Afghanistan’s top Islamic clerics, also urged those among the Taliban who wanted to talk peace with the government to separate themselves from those who want only to fight. 
On Wednesday, Afghan officials visited Pakistan with what they describe as evidence of Taliban attacks emanating from militant training centers in Pakistan. Afghanistan’s Intelligence Chief Masoom Stanikzai and Interior Minister Wais Ahmed Barmak presented documentation and confessions from arrested insurgents claiming to have been trained in Islamic seminaries in Pakistan. 
“The Afghan nation is waiting for clear action” from Pakistan, said Mr. Ghani, adding that so far Afghanistan got only promises of cooperation from Islamabad. Pakistan’s Foreign Secretary Tehmina Janjua will travel to Kabul on Saturday with Islamabad’s response, after reviewing the Afghan documents. 
Kabul and Islamabad have repeatedly traded accusations that the other is harboring enemy insurgents. 
The United States has also criticised Pakistan for providing sanctuaries for the Taliban, who are fighting U.S. troops in Afghanistan. President Donald Trump accused Pakistan of “lies and deceit” and demanded Pakistan evict Taliban insurgents, particularly the Haqqani network from Pakistani safe havens. The U.S. has suspended military assistance to Pakistan to back its demands. 
Pakistan has denied providing sanctuaries to militants. On Friday, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it stands with Afghanistan “in fighting the menace of terrorism.” 
The ministry’s statement noted that Pakistan has erected 975 security posts along the porous border with Afghanistan, while Kabul set up only 218. It called for more border security from Kabul, saying insurgents in Afghanistan have carried out 417 attacks in Pakistan in 2017. 
Meanwhile, Mr. Ghani said he has ordered a wide-reaching review of Kabul’s security following massive deadly attacks in recent weeks that have left killed nearly 200 and wounded hundreds more. 
“The Kabul people are demanding that we make a serious review of our security arrangements,” he said.

Spice Girls likely to team up again ","The Spice Girls got back together on Friday for the first time since 2012 and announced plans to explore “incredible new opportunities” in the future.
The British 1990s pop phenomenon — Victoria Beckham, Melanie Brown, Emma Bunton, Melanie Chisholm and Geri Horner — reunited at Horner’s house north of London, along with their former manager Simon Fuller.
The best-selling group also released photographs of the gathering on Instagram.
“We have enjoyed a wonderful afternoon catching up and reminiscing about the amazing times we have spent together,” they said in a statement via their publicist.
“We are always overwhelmed at how much interest there is across the whole world for The Spice Girls. The time now feels right to explore some incredible new opportunities together.”
“We all agree that there are many exciting possibilities that will once again embrace the original essence of The Spice Girls, while reinforcing our message of feminine empowerment for future generations.”
On their social media accounts, Bunton promised the “future is looking spicy”, while Horner said Girl Power was “alive and well”.
The girl group have sold 85 million albums worldwide.
Only two of their 11 singles failed to reach number one on the British charts, while their first three singles all hit the U.S. top five.
The Sun newspaper reported that they were considering television projects in China, a new TV talent show, endorsement deals and a compilation album celebrating their greatest hits.
The band, which formed in 1994, split in 2000 but reunited for a world tour in 2007-2008.
They got together again to perform at the London 2012 Olympics closing ceremony and were last all in the same room later that year for the launch of the Spice Girls musical Viva Forever!
An expected comeback in 2016 with Brown, Bunton and Horner failed to materialise.

Financial networks supporting LTTE active: U.S.
","After three years of acrimony between the U.S. and Sri Lanka at the >Human Rights Council, the two countries appear to have found common ground on one issue.
Earlier this week the U.S. said the >LTTE’s financial network of support continued to operate throughout 2013, echoing Sri Lankan claims that a section of LTTE supporters living abroad were trying to resurrect the organisation.
The United States Department of State, in its recent report on terrorism, said the LTTE uses its international contacts and the large >Tamil diaspora in North America, Europe, and Asia to procure weapons, communications equipment, funding, and other needed supplies. “The group employed charities as fronts to collect and divert funds for their activities,” it observed, apparently resonating with the Sri Lankan government’s position on the possible regrouping of the LTTE.
The Sri Lankan government, concerned over reported attempts to revive the LTTE in the country’s predominantly Tamil-speaking north and east, took various measures over the last couple of months. Sri Lankan police >arrested over 60 persons, primarily those residing in the Northern Province, on charges of harbouring terrorists. Prominent human rights activist >Ruki Fernando and catholic priest Father Praveen were arrested in Kilinochchi, under the Prevention of Terrorism Act, even as the >Geneva session was on. On April 11, Sri Lankan armed forces shot dead three men who allegedly tried to revive the rebel Tiger movement in the country’s >Northern Province.
On the apparent concurrence of the U.S. — prime mover of three resolutions against Sri Lanka in Geneva — and the Sri Lankan government on the issue of the LTTE’s possible revival has intrigued some in Colombo, activist Paikiasothy Saravanamuttu said collaboration between various international intelligence agencies on the issue of international terrorism did not throw a surprise.
“If there is any hard evidence of a sustained LTTE exercise abroad, I suppose the report is relevant, for the political objectives of those groups [among Tamil diaspora] are well within Sri Lanka,” said Mr. Saravanamuttu, executive director of the Centre for Policy Alternatives, a think tank based in Colombo.
Asked if the U.S. too believed there was a possibility of the LTTE regrouping, the U.S. Embassy spokesperson in Colombo told The Hindu that the report covers the 2013 situation, so the latest information was not included. “The U.S. was the first country to proscribe the LTTE as a foreign terror organisation and continues to list it as a terror organisation. The LTTE was designated a Foreign Terrorist Organisation on October 8, 1997, and was named a Specially Designated Global Terrorist organisation in 2001,” the spokesperson said.

South Africa to vote this week
","South African President Jacob Zuma said on Monday that he anticipates an election victory this week for the ruling African National Congress, and that his government, if re-elected, will speed the provision of basic services following protests in many poor communities that complain they are sidelined.
Nearly 2,000 military personnel will assist police to ensure security during the elections on Wednesday. Officials are helping some South Africans, including the sick and the elderly, to vote early.
Mr. Zuma also said he had been unfairly labelled as corrupt because of a scandal surrounding more than $20 million in state spending on his private home. South Africa’s state watchdog agency had released a report concluding that Mr. Zuma inappropriately benefited from state funding and should pay back some money for alleged security upgrades at the president’s rural Nkandla residence.
The report, Mr. Zuma insisted to journalists in Johannesburg, did not conclude that he had abused government funds, despite growing public dissatisfaction over a series of scandals linked to the president. That feeling was most evident when Mr. Zuma was booed by some in the crowd at a stadium memorial in December for Nelson Mandela, South Africa’s first black president.
“I don’t think it is fair treatment to a citizen,” the South African Press Associated quoted Mr. Zuma as saying of reports that have criticized his conduct.
While unease with Mr. Zuma has grown, it is not expected to shake core support for the ANC, which led the movement against white minority rule and has >dominated politics since Mandela became president in South Africa’s first all-race vote in 1994. The party has touted its record of promoting democratic freedoms and providing housing, water and electricity to millions of people, but the country struggles with high unemployment and a gulf between the poor and the wealthy.
Protests in poor communities periodically erupt. On Monday, at least 5,000 >people demonstrated for better government services in the Nsuze area in KwaZulu-Natal province, blocking a road with burning tires and stones, police said. There were no reports of injuries, the South African Press Association reported.

U.S. officials crack down on ‘sanctuary State’ California
","U.S. immigration officials said on Friday that they raided 77 California businesses this week as operations intensify in the State, whose own authorities are defying President Donald Trump’s hard line on immigration by not cooperating with federal enforcement agents. 
The raids took place in cities including San Francisco, Sacramento and San Jose in the north of California — a “sanctuary State” where, since January 1, law enforcement has been mostly prohibited from working with federal officials seeking to arrest undocumented immigrants. “The actions taken this week reflect... stepped-up efforts to enforce the laws that prohibit businesses from hiring illegal workers”, with a focus on “protecting jobs for U.S. citizens and others who are lawfully employed”, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) said in a statement.
In 2017, the government carried out 1,360 similar raids and arrested more than 300 people — with businesses paying out over $100 million in restitution and fines, ICE said. 
U.S. immigration authorities also recently adopted a policy that allows officials to enter courtrooms to arrest undocumented immigrants. Previously, courtrooms were considered “sanctuaries” so as to not discourage witnesses from testifying during trials. Meanwhile last month, ICE agents carried out visible raids on around 100 7-Eleven convenience stores across the country to discourage managers from hiring undocumented workers.

Road less travelled "," The intense, week-long new ventures leadership programme — the MIT Innovation and Entrepreneurship Bootcamp, held in Brisbane, Australia, this year, was a platform where entrepreneurs and students from around the globe could showcase their leadership skills.
“It challenged participants to develop a sustainable new venture within a week. Students learnt to practise critical skills required to become leaders, along with a core entrepreneurship curriculum taught at MIT,” said Amit Singh, runner-up of MIT Bootcamp 2018, Growth Engineer at Ixigo.
“Through this programme, I learnt about the strategies and roadmaps to validate any idea to its execution. This will further help in making a sustainable business model,” added team member Amit who is also Co-founder/CEO outsiteVR.
Kunwar Raj, a business development specialist, said,“After rigorous brainstorming, we came up with the idea of a smart bedsheet infused with sensors for infants to protect them against Sudden Infant Death Syndrome. This product will track their sleeping pattern, postures and will alert mothers on their phones in case the baby is in danger.”
“After returning to India, most of my work has been in a structured format and I have made considerable progress. The client base has grown by 25% in the three months following the Bootcamp. Apart from that, it gives confidence to work on multiple ideas and not be tethered to one’s comfort zone,” said Mr. Raj. “I recommend that entrepreneurs focus on their products and start reaching out to the mentors who have significantly good experience in that particular domain,” he added.

Stay ahead of the game
","While there is no single playbook about what makes a startup succeed, over the years, I have started believing in a few things that I could consider almost universal.
1. The most important thing I tell founders is, always recruit to plug your weaknesses. You may be great at vision but poor at execution. You may be great at technical skills but may have poor business acumen. You may be an introvert, but after a point you and your team needs someone to sell the idea to the world, so you may need a charismatic salesperson in your core team. Taking a honest stock of what your own pros and cons and acting accordingly to build your core founding team goes a long way.
2. Build for yourself or in your circle of competence. When I see entrepreneurs building a product for a customer they don't know well, I get worried. If you haven’t worked in an industry or faced a pain point you are thinking of solving, most of the time it is never a good idea to pursue it. To add to that, some startups tend to build a product first and then go to customers to take feedback. Again, bad idea. Getting feedback before you start building anything can save you tonnes of time and money. So, do not assume you can see a pain point without diving deep into conversations with your potential customers.
3. A good team at an early stage should have implemented restricted stock with vesting even before investors ask for it. For the uninitiated, vesting means the process through which the company can buy back a co-founders equity in case he or she decides to move out of the company earlier than a pre-agreed tenure. The tenure generally is four years, but that really depends on how the founders agree between themselves. The thumb rule is that the longer the vesting period, the better it is. Founder vesting is an insurance policy for all team members involved.
4. Never worry about the press. Startups are over celebrated by the press most of the times. In a startup’s journey, there will be times when everybody keeps talking about your competitors and how they are absolutely crushing it, raising a ton of money, hiring executives from the best B-Schools and so on. 
Always ignore the noise. It is not like your competitors aren’t worried about the same issues as you are. The startups that keep their head down and keep at it are the ones that win, eventually. 
5. Know when to let go. Many a times, founders are so in love with what they have created or trying to create, they fail to have the right perspective on whether they are really building a solution to a problem or building a solution that needs to find a problem to solve. Stepping back, once in a while, and re-examining the startup’s mission is always a good thing. 
6. Ideas are dime a dozen. Execution is all that matters. Ideas are 1%, execution is 99%. A great outcome comes from real hard work not just a random eureka moment.

Stop, think & go
"," Most of us, if not all, can relate to the pressures a student faces in his/her academic years, especially towards his/her final year of study. Amidst having to work hard for one’s final exams, there is also the struggle of figuring out which field of work one ought to venture into. “In our mainstream education system, students are taught five to 10 subjects chosen by the school or parents from limited resources confined inside a classroom for 12-14 years,” says Aneeta Pathak, founder-director of Anveshan — an educational unit of Auroville, Puducherry. “There is no scope for students to understand themselves, learn what their values are, or learn things that they are really interested in. After 12 years of this, students are expected to choose a field that they will ideally work in, for the rest of their lives.” 
There are those who, for the longest time, will know exactly what they would like to do with their future, but there are also many who find it difficult to find their way.
Handling stress
We often hear stories of youngsters who harm themselves because of the stress they face, especially in academics. Therefore, it is important that students learn to understand themselves. This need cannot be met by the existing systems of schooling, university or healthcare alone. One way to help overcome this difficulty is by taking a gap year between studies to try and figure out a career path. 
A gap year is a period, typically during an academic year, taken by a student as a break between school and college education.
This is where Anveshan comes in. It is an experiential learning and unlearning centre which works with the objective of designing and implementing design sustainable experiential learning courses for self-development and leadership development among the children, youth and adults of the world based on their inner wisdom. One of their new programmes is Anubhava — a pan-India gap-year programme for young aspirants between the ages of 16 and 25. 
Goals
The aim is to help young adults identify their core interests and guide them onto a self-designed learning path. It enables participants to find their innate interests before seriously pursuing one that will define their happiness quotient. There are no prior educational degree or diploma requirements to join the programme — learners can design their own year, unlearn, learn and experience with organisations and mentors on board.
The effects of a gap year can vary from person to person depending on the experiences during their time off. “I took a gap year after graduating from college to get a better sense of which career suited me best and then choose a postgraduate course accordingly. I did several internships at media and publishing houses,” says Bhawna Singh an M.A. English student at Delhi University. “Doing so during the gap year helped me gain practical experience in the fields that interested me I was able to make a more informed decision regarding my future pursuits.”
Whereas, for Lakshmi Gunashekhar from Chennai, the events after her gap year turned out differently. “I took a gap year after my class XII, six years ago. I worked at interesting places and eventually started my own organisation.”
Benefits of the programme include:
“Though there is no time frame to take a gap year, we encourage students to take one when they are at a crossroad, especially after high school or graduation,” says Aneeta. She goes on to add, “Anubhava is a unique year-long programme. The first month is orientation, where participants will discover their passion and will be given tools for self-design learning programme and will develop their own gap year. We have 35 organisations and mentors from diverse fields who are part of this and participants can choose the organisations and mentors according to their passion.”
The world becomes their classroom. There is also a lot of scope for transdisciplinary studies. Some of the expected outcomes are that the students should have a better clarity on what interests him/her and have started learning or working in his/her interest area, have networked with other people in their field of interest, developed life skills, and so on.
The programme is set to launch in October 2018 and the admission for the year 2018-2019 is now open. Visit gapyearindia.auroville.org for more information.

Time to choose
"," Much water has flown under the bridge, over the years, in the education sphere. The introduction of NEET for medical entrance, two years back, was one of the major developments that has now come to stay. The government’s initiative to upgrade the Stateboard syllabus in is on in full swing, with technology being used (QR codes) for classes I, VI, and IX text books which encourages teachers and students to enjoy the video sessions of the concept they are learning. There is a positive movement palpable in this regard.
Informed decision
Students are also exposed to various technological improvements. With over-the-top (OTT) media like YouTube, and other social media, the level of engagement with students has changed. Smart classrooms with technology support have changed the way learning happens in schools. AR/VR is being used to explain concepts in math and science so that students are able to understand concepts better. While on one end of the spectrum technology is taking the lead, the teacher-student relationship is also evolving. Thus, it is only relevant to ask a question which will be useful for students and parents — when can a student decide his/her choice of career, after class XII, and which is the ideal age for students to take an informed decision with the help of parents and teachers?
According to Dr. Rajmohan, MD, Bodhi, a professional assessment organisation administering psychometric tests for various levels, ideally, a student should complete his/her psychometric test when he or she is in classes IX or X for, that is when he or she has a little maturity to visualise the outcome of his or her decision. Psychometric tests, with their analysis and counselling, provide insights into candidates’ personality and helps them identify their courses for class XI. 
Another question to be asked is, who is responsible for students’ future — parents or teachers? According to Sivakumar Palaniappan, a professional speaker, in the earlier days of Gurukul system, the guru or teacher, was responsible for the shisya or students’ holistic development. Today’s modern day demands, however, have necessitated a dichotomy where teachers support and ensure that students understand the subject well, do well in the exams, and apply themselves better, while in terms of life skills, values and ethics, parents have a moral responsibility.
School education should build up the confidence of students with deep subject knowledge and also life skills, and it is the combined role of the family and school to ensure that students are on the right track. It is important to inculcate values and ethics in the students. Courses on civics and moral science still hold value as they form the basis of character building in students, the foundation on which is built their career and personal life.
Besides academics, students who have other extracurricular interests should be motivated to pursue them. Sports, music, artistic abilities, and more, should be promoted and encouraged by schools for, it is through such activities that team dynamics and interpersonal skills of students are developed.

Highly-rated option
","It is placement season once again and newspapers talk about the usual suspects hiring in large numbers from colleges. 
However, quite a few of you are tired of the generic careers that get foisted on the unsuspecting among us. In today’s column, let us explore an interesting and impactful career for those of you wanting to blaze a trail. Let us talk about the career options open to you as a credit analyst. 
I can see the questions coming from you thick and fast — Who is a credit analyst and what does he/she do? Why is that an impactful role?
Credit influencer 
A couple of months back, we learnt about the IL&FS fiasco. IL&FS had cooked their books and defaulted on the interest and principal repayments on some of their borrowings. 
But how were they lent such large sums of money in the first place? You see, without a process in place, lending and investment decisions cannot be successfully carried out in a financial services company.
Say, you are an institutional lender such as SBI or an investor like ICICI Prudential mutual fund. Such institutions have systems and processes in place to make sure that mistakes do not happen. Even so, every now and then we have rogue cases like the IL& FS. For now, let us just focus on the process. 
There are organisations called credit rating agencies, which as their name suggests “rate” the credit worthiness of the corporate borrowers. 
So, if you are a corporate borrower, it is in your interest to get yourself rated (more specifically, the debt securities that you issue). 
This is like a third party expressing an opinion on the credit worthiness of a borrower. In theory, the rating process is supposed to be methodical and transparent. In such a scenario, it makes life a lot easier for the borrowers and the lenders. 
The rating opinion by the rating agencies heavily influence the rate of interest that is charged for a borrower and more importantly whether he gets to borrow at all in the first place.
The rating agencies employ “credit analysts” whose job it is to analyse the industry developments of the borrower, study the financial statements of the borrower and ultimately give out a rating opinion to the rating committee which approves or rejects the rating opinion. 
Such work is highly analytical in nature and is ideal for folks who are interested in how businesses work along with a flair for financial accounting and general numeracy. This is a solid intellectual career for engineers with MBA or chartered accountants. It is a highly responsible job with numerous career paths if you are really good.
Some of the top rating agencies in India are CRISIL, ICRA and CARE.
So, if you are someone comfortable with numbers and are looking for a meaningful career then this is an interesting choice to explore.

Time on the Stellarium "," An internship at IITB in 2015 left a lasting impact on my mind. Naturally, another internship there, this summer, was like a dream come true.
This time, my partners — Saloni (DA-IICT, Gandhinagar), Ram Mohan (IIT-BHU), and Jai Deep (NIT, Durgapur) — and I were assigned to work on an MHRD sponsored project titled Development of an affordable Open Sky Planetarium. This involved an integration of hardware and software like controlling stepper motors using some keys on a GUI running on a computer. As this project involved a sound understanding of celestial coordinates, we had to spend a significant amount of time looking at the stars. Thanks to Stellarium (a planetarium software that shows exactly what you see when you look up at the stars), we could see the stars even in the day. Initially, jargon such as right ascension, declination, and so on, were difficult to digest, but IITB’s competitive environment kept our enthusiasm high and helped us learn faster.
Team work works
This project required mastering new tools such as Qt, KiCad, Linux, and so on. All the members contributed to the project; Saloni solved software bugs, Ram Mohan had a bucket full of solutions for current/voltage related issues, and Jai Deep designed a complete PCB using KiCad. Occasionally, I too was of some help, integrating Arduino board with the peripherals. This time too, I fell in love with my lab, which was inevitable, given the ambiance.
Time flew by and finally, the day came when we were supposed to present the project before a jury of eminent academicians. We prepared ourselves with multiple rehearsals, articulating our thoughts and Googling possible questions. During the presentation, we showcased an affordable system that was capable of locating celestial bodies, and a script that could locate a particular star. As we built and ran the script, it drew everyone’s attention.
The last day was memorable as I attended the valedictory speech of Prof. D.B. Phatak. The internship for this cohort concluded with certificate distribution, and I got one for mentoring my fellow interns. It was then that I realised that my participation had been accounted as a mentor in Ekalavya Summer Internship 2017. The transition from an intern to a mentor had undeniably been enthralling and challenging.

Q6. A legendary filmmaker and writer wanted to open the first of his franchise of films in a special way to exposit some backstory to the audience, instead of opening with credits like the Directors Guild of America wanted. After release, the Guild wanted to fine him, withdraw the film from theatres, modify it to include the opening credits, and re-release it. Not wanting to involve the director in the legal battle, the producer paid the fine and resigned from the Guild. After that, the rest of the films all opened with the iconic opening sequence as he intended. 
Who was this filmmaker, and what is the special opening?

Time to act now
","I am a final-year B.tech student and have got a placement offer. However, I am not interested in it. I have always been interested in painting and shading. But I am unsure about a future in it. What opportunities do I have and are there reputed institutes where I can enhance my skills? - Vishnu Lasya Marthala.
Dear Vishnu,
I understand that you have a placement offer today post your B.Tech. Do you agree that many in your own batch are perhaps not lucky to have landed one? What have you done with painting and shading, so far? Is it a mere hobby, or have you witnessed success with art to a level that you can make it a profession? Certainly enrol into an art class and work on enhancing your skill set. Keeping it an active interest, however, by being merely romantic about it, is not the best decision, at this juncture. Thirty one million educated Indians are unemployed, according to the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy’s March 2018 report. You certainly don’t want to add a number and become a statistical entry.
It was my childhood dream to become a pilot. I am a science graduate, willing to pursue a career in aviation. I was hopeful of becoming a proud woman pilot until I heard from many people that it is an expensive course. I am holding myself back despite my love for planes. Is there any other course that that I can pursue, to join the civil aviation department, that also provides scholarship? — Aysha Ibrahim
Dear Aysha,
Becoming a pilot undoubtedly is an expensive dream, but certainly attainable. Please read the (recent) inspiring story of Captain Ankita from Mumbai, who faced several financial difficulties, multiple failures and opposition from her family, but never gave up on her dream of becoming a pilot, after seven long years. A PPL or a CPL certification in India could cost up to ₹18-20 lakhs. The Government of India provides scholarship under the OBC category for this course. You have to clear the Director General of Civil Aviation exams with a 70%, in addition to your course work. IDo write to the DCGA (http://www.dgca.nic.in) and get more information on the payment schemes and scholarships available. Other aviation careers available are across Ground Staff, Air ticketing and Cabin Crew.Good luck.
I am a B.Sc computer science graduate currently preparing for competitive exams — banking and SSC. There is extreme competition and I am worried about my future. Should I continue with this or pursue more courses that will equip me for better future? — Karmjeet Singh
Dear Karmjeet,
Don’t let anxiety and negative thoughts stop you from trying. Confront your fears and put your best foot forward. Prepare well, attempt the exams and the results will decide what the future holds. Of course there is crazy, unreal competition, but that doesn’t mean you won’t get a job. Do your best and forget the rest. B.Sc computer science is a good course that is in demand today. Artificial intelligence, machine learning, call centre jobs, computer-aided designing, computer science engineering, software design, development, hardware engineering, web designing or development, MSc in computer science, MCA, MBA have all good prospects and can help you get a good package in the IT sector.
I am an undergraduate doctor preparing for Pre-PG exam. I am excited and interested in working hard and giving it all I can, but I am unable to study alone and constantly require a library-like environment which is not available in my current city. Every time I sit alone, I keep postponing and neglecting my work. Please guide me. — Tanmay Bajpai
Dear Tanmay,
You say that you are excited about taking these exams, but are unable to follow your schedule due to studying alone, not having a conducive study environment and procrastination. How then, do you intend to take these exams? I realise that you may not have anyone in your city to study with, as you mentioned that you need company. But it is time to know that from now on, it is going to be ‘to each his own’. You are on your own. Take up the responsibility and start working on it. Step up, make your own plan, schedule your work, syllabus, maintain timelines and try and stick to them. Do your best to follow a schedule and stay consistent. Time is ticking, and these excuses will not result in adequate preparation for your exams. Make things happen.

Where do you belong?
",": With the academic year coming to a close, students living in hostels are heading home for the holidays. For most youngsters, home equals heaven, coming close on the heels of a hectic round of attendance, assignments, internships, project submissions and, most often, bad food. Life in a hostel can be tricky, beginning with a sense of dread and displacement, leaving one vulnerable and homesick. It can also be a dream come true offering youngsters independence, friends and fun, so as they settle into a groove, they find themselves enjoying their life away from home. But when home beckons, can anyone resist?
The reasons may be many, but food and pampering are terms synonymous with ‘home’. “The fact that I can relax, eat home cooked meals, and not worry about expenses is what I love most about being home. It is just the comforting feeling of being someplace safe and happy,’ gushes Surendra Dat, who studies at Christ University, Bengaluru.
Abhimanyu Mukherjee, a student of BITS Pilani Hyderabadtoo echoes the sentiment, but adds,“I get to spend time with my parents; I truly didn’t realise their worth until I actually went to college. Home is home and hostel can never replace it.” .
The summer vacation is the most awaited event of a student’s life, at home they need not worry about anything for the next two months. However, a couple of weeks into the vacation, teenagers are craving to go back to college. “I love home, don’t get me wrong, but I hate the loss of independence that comes with being home. When I’m at college I get to make my own decisions. It’s slightly smothering being under parental watch 24/7,” admits Nirmal Gopakumar, a Keralite studying in Bengaluru.
Another negative side to being home is the lethargy that sets in. “Unless I have something planned, my vacations are usually just a bunch of lazy days, where I sit at home and do absolutely nothing till the point where I’m counting down the days for college,” says Yash Agarwala, a student at Manipal Institute of technology.
Still, there’s no place like home, students admit. From suffering from the ‘I-want-home’ syndrome to ‘How-long-till-college’ syndrome, most students come full circle numerous times in their college life. Even after going back to college, the itch to be home never dies, so it’s safe to say that home is truly where the heart is.

All the world’s a school
","Leaving home at 8 am with a half-eaten or skipped breakfast; competing for the top rank; copying notes mindlessly; rote learning, with little time for free play, sport, art or music. Many parents are opting out of the formal-school education system. Here’s what they do instead. 
“The best lessons are those we learn from people,” says Durgesh Nandhini, 32, mother of two daughters, Tamaraa and Thanvi Shankar, 1 and 5. The roads are the classrooms for Durgesh’s daughters.
Travel schooling simply means education through extensive travel. The traffic policeman, the lady who sweeps the streets, billboards by the roads, the beach… the full-time mom, who is a zero-waste practitioner and minimalist, says that everyday people and places have taught her girls much more than a regular classroom could. Her home is devoid of books, toys, and TV. She doesn’t sit with them asking them to study. No numbers, no alphabet. 




“Children learn by wondering,” she says. Durgesh remembers how her five-year-old asked her why most billboards featuring air conditioners were in blue. “She recognised a pattern in which blue is used by advertisers to create a cooling effect,” says Durgesh and adds that since Thanvi couldn’t read what the hoardings said, her mind was open to taking in other details.
From villages and sustainable spaces, to alternative schools and forests within India, Durgesh and her girls have experienced a range of environments. “This has made them adaptable,” she says. “They enjoy a village as much as they would a posh hotel.” She adds that they are able to treat all kinds of people equally. On the downside, there are bugs, literally. “Thanvi is quite irritated by mosquito bites. So I ensure that I carry a repellent,” says Durgesh. Her one-year-old, however, has grown used to them. “She’s been travelling since she was three-months-old. So she doesn’t complain.”
Five-year-old SP Sangamithra makes friends with people wherever she goes. She’s is chatty and full of questions, making her a people-magnet. “If she were in school, she would’ve only been friends with kids her age. But now, she has friends of all ages, including adults we meet at the vegetable shop,” says Sangamithra’s mother Senbaga Poonguzhali, 31, who home-schools her child, in Coimbatore.
Poonguzhali has formulated an informal syllabus for her daughter’s age group based on her research. “I write out numbers and letters for her and keep the notebook at home. She picks it up whenever she feels like writing,” says Poonguzhali. Sangamithra spends a major part of her day playing — a luxury for school-going kids. “She’s up by 7 am and plays, while my husband and I go about our work. Sometimes, she walks up to me saying she wants to write Tamil today or feels like studying numbers,” says Poonguzhali. “It’s entirely up to her. We don’t have a rigid pattern.”




Sangamithra spends almost four hours in the evening playing in the park at her apartment in Coimbatore. “There are a lot of kids there and she plays, cycles, and runs around.” Poonguzhali says that there are times when her daughter reminds her of a word she promised to teach her. “We go by her pace and interests. She loves to draw, and so she keeps at it through the day,” she adds. While she agrees that she has a slight fear over the mammoth responsibility that rests on her shoulders, Poonguzhali says that she’s growing confident seeing her daughter’s development — more importantly, seeing how happy she is. 
Kokilashree Vickneshwaran’s boys sow seeds, remove weeds, and water plants at their farm in Attappadi in Kerala. And oh, they also study there. Shivesh and Vishwesh, 10 and 7, spend most part of their day playing at their farm, among fruit trees, vegetable plants, and spices. “They do have books to study,” says 37-year-old Kokila, but she says nature is a dynamic place for children to grow and her boys have a natural affinity to the wild.
“We were in Chennai for Deepavali and they are able to talk about the difference in air quality in both the places,” she says. “They understand the essence of the goings-on at the farm by themselves. For instance, we recently planted 60 to 70 endangered species of trees and they got a complete picture of why this was necessary.” Kokila says that she and her husband believe in free play and free learning. “We wanted our children to have a stress-free early childhood,” she adds. “If they want to go to school once they’re older, we will be happy to enrol them in one.”




This transition, agrees Kokila, could be difficult for her children. “But the way they are schooled has made them flexible; they will be able to manage,” she feels. It’s not all wonder and excitement though. She also speaks of the challenges. “It is challenging to constantly be available to help them with their studies and interests,” she says. “Finding the right mentors is difficult too, so is balancing my work with the children’s. But these challenges help us grow stronger as individuals and as a family.”
Shivesh loves birds and animals. “He’s taken a liking to wildlife photography and walks around the farm with a camera, Vishwesh following him around,” says Kokila. The younger one, she adds, follows him around with a smaller camera.
We asked Dr Shraddha Kapoor, Associate Professor, Human Development and Childhood Studies, Lady Irwin College, Delhi, our deepest fears and doubts...
Are alternative methods of schooling, a social experiment?
Yes. There is a value to a normative child. It’s unfair to give a child choices that are far from the norm, without knowing what the end will be. Some children thrive in the environment of a school. School is not just studies and exams; school is friends; it is not having everything you wish for; school is not opening your lunch-box in the middle of a Science class. School is not so powerful that it will take away the values that you believe in. Also, it is open around 220 days or so a year, and parents have enough time to practise their beliefs. Tread a middle path — pick a school that’s closest to your philosophy.
What are the challenges involved in such methods? 
Parenting should prepare children to handle life without the parents. They should create opportunities for children to develop emotionally, socially, and physically. By choosing such [alternative] methods of parenting, you are narrowing down opportunities for children to develop.
When do warning bells go off? 
When the child is not developing and enjoying it. When they are not curious and active, something is not right.




Homeschooling parents, if you wish to enrol your children for board exams, here’s what you can do.
National Institute of Open Schooling: Also an examining and certifying authority, it has no upper age limit for admission. A candidate has to choose five subjects and has five years to complete them from the date of registration.
Homeschoolers can also give the Cambridge O Levels, AS and A-level exams as private candidates registered with a school or through the British Council in some metros.
The Tamil Nadu State Board lets private candidates appear directly for the SSLC exam, if they have passed Class VIII with English. Private candidates can appear directly for the Class XII exam, after passing SSLC or its equivalent. (Source: http://homeschoolers.in)

Mastering finance in Chicago
","I always wanted to be a Quant when I was in school and in my undergraduate college. This dream came true after I left my job and decided to be a full-time student and entered IIT Stuart School of Business’s highly reputed programme: Master of Science in Finance.
The city of Chicago is known as the Windy City because of its politicians, in fact in real life you can experience high wind gushes. Yes, it is windy, it is cold but far better than New York and most other business cities, because it is easy to commute here. Public transportation is available all across the city — buses, the subway and trains. Although I have stayed in cities like Mumbai and Pune, I like Chicago more because one can see bright blue lakes just like a coastline and lush green parks and experience less traffic nuisance; it is a peaceful city in its own terms.
The Stuart School of Business, ranked third in the U.S. and 26th globally for its Master of Science in Finance programme, by The Financial Times, is usually an initiator and innovator with development of new programmes.
It recently started a new programme, Master’s in Marketing Analytics and Communication, one of its kind. The professors here have great knowledge and understanding and sometimes provide personal or individual advice on what one should concentrate upon.
IIT Stuart School of Business is really blessed to have a good full-time staff; I got a chance to interact with most of the staff as part of my on-campus job at the Dean’s Office.
Apart from the full-time faculty, the school has many industry professors who have great wisdom and niche-knowledge in the subjects that they teach which I find more appealing. The school also provides some great opportunities to students in the form of organising various networking events and bringing in professionals from the industry to interact with students and build a relationship with them.
The school has programmes like Advancing Career and Education (ACE), where the students are taught how to work on their resumes, networking skills and are motivated to bring a taste of American culture in their own lives. This would give a perfect start to the career from an international student’s point of view.
The school also has affiliation with basics of the industry like CFA for the Finance student, IBM for students in MBA and Analytics where professors are dedicated to motivate and help train the students for such competitive assessments. The course structure of the school really provided a base for my preparation of CFA exam. It has societies like Stuart Investments, and Net Impact, which are solely run by the business students. It also has a Career Management Center exclusively for Stuart students.
At Stuart School of Business, one needs to take initiatives to grab the opportunities which can turn your career into a great life.

Thriving in a state of flux "," Two opposing forces are pushing institutions of higher technical education into a tight corner. The first force is the rising industry demand for new competencies like IoT, engineering systems thinking, design thinking and entrepreneurship. Second, there are increasing concerns about student disengagement. The academic community is responding to these challenges by introducing changes in the curriculum. 
The 2018 AICTE curriculum is a case in point. It has proposed a reduction in the number of credits and an increase in industry-oriented courses so that undergraduate students are given space to pursue research and innovation. While the intent is good, a mere change in curriculum is not likely to address the problem. But implementation of the new curriculum without changes in pedagogy and practice may further disengage the students. It is important for engineering students to play a proactive role in this transition. Otherwise, they will be left with a degree, but no real competence. Let us see why.
A combination
In a recent industry conference, many leaders spoke about the imperatives for Industry 4.0. One of the key challenges pointed out, is the ability to translate emerging technologies like IoT into business value. Similarly, in the recent national conferences organised by ISRO, leaders were advocating the need for strong systems engineering competencies among young engineers, because, today, even sub-systems are complex and multi-disciplinary in nature. When the industry leaders refer to competency, they mean a combination of knowledge, skills and behaviours that emerges from practice in a certain real-world environment. They need engineers who can quickly acquire these and get into the practice. 
However, the academic model is not tuned to address the above need due to the following reasons. First, is the process of interpreting the need. The industry need is interpreted as packets of knowledge or courses to be added, modified or deleted. The skill and behavioural elements take a back seat. And course certification, in most cases, is about testing memory of facts and rules, not application of knowledge to real-world problems. 
Second, the pedagogy in engineering education has hardly changed over the years. Technology-enabled learning and access to a variety of digital knowledge bases has not fundamentally changed the process of classroom engagement. 
Third, is the inadequate appreciation of practice and learning by doing. Practice in an academic context is largely viewed as application of theory and accorded a lower status. Practice is not seen as a new form of knowledge.
Fourth, is the inadequate attention to project work by the students and the faculty. Final-year undergraduate students are more concerned about their future and use the project time to prepare for competitive exams, and the faculty also do not see potential for publications or patents in the projects. As a result, the little space provided for gaining competency is also not utilised.
Even if academic institutions make a sincere effort to adapt to the above challenges, the process of change is bound to create confusion in the minds of students. This is likely to happen both in existing and new institutions, public and private. New institutions may seem even more chaotic as they seek to develop their brands and institutional relations. Unfortunately, NIRF ranking may not reveal these micro-level instabilities. If students are not prepared for this transition, they can easily lose confidence in the system and the profession. On the other hand, if students play a proactive role in this process they can gain an extremely valuable competency — dealing with complexity, which commands a premium in the job market.

For that edge in the workplace
"," In today’s competitive job market, having a degree may not get you your dream job, unless you have relevant work experience, which has become a mandatory part of the curriculum in today’s education system. Getting a degree can be a tremendous asset for gaining knowledge; however, it is not the only way to stand out, for potential employment. Today, work experience plays an important role in becoming ‘workplace-ready’.
In order to kickstart your career, having relevant work experience could set you apart from other freshers appearing for a job interview. It can prove to be an asset while appearing in the placement process. Often, students get confused about how they can attain work experience without working full-time in an organisation. However, there are a number of opportunities such as internships, freelancing, part-time jobs, and so on, which can be pursued alongside one’s studies. Here are some factors which demonstrate the importance of work experience:
Advanced knowledge: While academics ensure you gain subjective knowledge, working in the industry can bring an understanding of a workplace, which is important. Students become aware of the job, as well as work environment
Gateway to the dream job: Considering today’s job scenario, work experience can prove to be an added advantage to students’ resumes. Employers prefer candidates who have some knowledge of the industry. It becomes an important part of becoming workplace-ready. 
Skill development: Work experience is a great way to develop fundamental employability skills such as communication, problem-solving, creativity, teamwork, and so on, which ensures personality development.
Extensive career options: With work experience, your career options are not limited to the fresher profiles. An experienced student can apply for different profiles which ask for relevant work experience. There are a number of ways a students can obtain attain work experience while studying. These include summer, winter, and virtual internships, national and international volunteering, and active participation in college corporate events
Working in an organisation while pursuing a degree enables a student to implement essential concepts acquired from learning into the real working situations. Experience has become the need of the hour in order to become work-place ready.
Recruiters prefer candidates who are experienced in relevant fields. Though one can’t claim that academics is less valued than work experience, the practical implementation of learned concepts in training makes it more valid in the eyes of recruiters.

When legacy meets innovation
","“The opportunities here are really exciting,” says Manya Modi, while on a brisk campus tour. Early on a Monday morning, Ecole hôtelière de Lausanne (EHL) is abuzz with activity. Manya is one among the many students clad in formal wear, heading to classes purposefully, gearing up for yet another busy day at school. There’s lots to do, lots to learn. In a way, the energetic atmosphere effuses EHL’s constant focus on shaping the future of hospitality through innovation. As it turns 125 years old, the spotlight is as much on the legacy of its past as it is on its ambitious plans for the future.
Located in the vibrant city of Lausanne in Switzerland, EHL is driven by a purpose — to be a pioneer in hospitality education. With its state-of-the-art campus in the world’s Olympic capital, the university consistently strives to be an ambassador for traditional Swiss hospitality. What started off in 1893 as a hotel school in a room of the Hôtel d’Angleterre in Lausanne has now grown to one of the top hotel management schools in the world. 
With more than 3,000 students from 119 countries, two campuses in Switzerland and a third one underway in Singapore, a range of undergraduate, graduate and certificate programmes and a strong network of alumni, EHL is going strong. 
“When it started, EHL was a vocational school. Today, we are a university of applied sciences in hospitality management, with the same spirit we had 125 years ago,” says Michel Rochat, Chief Executive Officer, EHL Group. “The Group is supported by a worldwide alumni network, produces research projects and partnerships which, in turn, generate an important innovation pipeline, and all of this while integrating cutting-edge digital evolutions and partnerships in its roadmap,” he observes. 
Looking ahead
The 125th birthday marks the start of an important period of growth for EHL. On the cards is an innovation village near the campus — with the aim of creating a unique hospitality ecosystem bringing together entrepreneurs, researchers, experts, investors, students, artists, alumni and so on. 
“We would like to inspire and disrupt the hospitality industry,” says Rémi Walbaum, Chief Innovation and Valorisation Officer. “For us, the combination of powerful local academic players, a dynamic VC scene, and the regional presence of large corporations is an asset,” he explains. Being a part of the ecosystem of Switzerland, which has been ranked first in the global innovation index for the seventh year in a row, surely adds firepower. 
EHL is also working on taking the rapid digital revolution in its stride. “Our students are going to walk out into the world tomorrow, and they have to make a difference,” believes Julia Aymonier, Chief Information Officer. To give students an edge in the market and better employability, the university has decided to focus on virtual reality and AI conversational interfaces. 
While the former will allow first-year students to experience working on real life problems, the latter will enhance the student experience by creating a virtual personal assistant. 
EHL also envisions a campus where robotic concierges answer questions about the campus and give information to students. One such robot is dubbed EHLie by the students. When coupled with Amelia, an artificial intelligence software, it could lend itself to useful applications. “Soon I will have a family of brothers and sisters to help me. We will be creating a digital EHL family,” quips EHLie, in a demo. Amelia agrees. 
Another milestone will be the inauguration of a new campus in Lausanne in 2021, with a host of facilities for students. According to Rochat, this is the last piece of the puzzle in EHL’s strategy for the future. 
The Indian angle
 There are 51 Indian students currently studying at the university. India has potential for EHL, though the concept of studying hospitality might be misunderstood. “Hospitality is not just in hotels and restaurants — it’s in banks, hospitals, luxury brands, even in technology. This is something we are trying to reinforce in the new markets, that we are entering. It has been working well, but we still have a lot of work to be done,” explains Sherif Mamdouh, external communications manager. 
For Delhi-based Manya Modi who is now in her second year, the academic experience is transforming her view of hospitality. “It’s a challenging course, but our teachers are always there to help us,” she signs off.

Dream bigger, work harder
","I grew up in Kolkata and moved to the U.K. in 2015 to pursue higher studies. The University of Sheffield was my first choice because of its highly ranked engineering departments. It was the only U.K. university to offer a significant scholarship for Indian undergraduates which also influenced my decision. I was awarded their India Undergraduate Merit Scholarship for my academic achievements and all round performance at school. This motivated me to work harder, dream bigger, and set higher goals. 
Theory and practice
I am currently pursuing an M.Eng with a year in Industry in electronic and electrical engineering. This degree covers a wide range of topics such as analog electronics, digital electronics, software design, and photonics. The course is delivered through traditional lectures, problem-solving classes where we consolidate the concepts learnt in lectures, and lab sessions. We get hands-on experience using state-of-the-art hardware and software. Lecturers in the department are always available to support challenges that students face, be it technical or pastoral. 
The university has an elaborate range of resources available to assist students’ learning. I have had the chance to participate in activities such as sports, volunteering, and organising events. All students on my programme are required to complete the Sheffield Industrial Project Scheme, where we worked in a team and collaborated with a company to solve a problem for them. My team worked with the Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre to provide solutions for one of their manufacturing issues. It not only enhanced my technical skills but also gave me invaluable experience, working on a real-life industrial project. The degree has been designed to ensure that we work on many projects throughout our course to fully understand how to apply the knowledge that we gain in lectures. 
The international student community is strong and well-integrated, and the university works hard to keep international students happy by promoting various societies and their cultural events. 
I am currently on a year-long placement at Rolls-Royce Control Systems, working in electronic test engineering. I was assisted by the Engineering Placement Team who helped me through every step of an intensive recruitment process. From placement fairs to mock interviews, there was help whenever I required it, from them and from the University Careers Service. 
The city of Sheffield turned out to be welcoming and the people’s warmth made it easier for me to settle in. The city is surrounded by the countryside, and the Peak District is particularly popular among students for picnics and trips. There is a plethora of quaint cafes, restaurants, and food joints around the city too.

‘We are not getting disruptive ideas’
","Innovate or perish — the corporate world now swears by this imperative. It is, however, no longer restricted to the corporates. Educational institutions, primarily those providing higher education, are under pressure to foster a culture of innovation.
By creating the Innovation Cell and the Atal Ranking of Institutions on Innovation Achievements, the Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD), Government of India, is sending out a message to these institutions that they have to go beyond the obvious.
In an email interview, Abhay Jere, Chief Innovation Officer, Ministry of HRD, Government of India, explains the dynamics of this new initiative. Prior to taking up this role, Jere was head of Persistent Labs and had a big hand in shaping and running Smart India Hackathons. 
What has been your understanding of the role of innovation or entrepreneurship clubs in colleges?
Although some colleges are trying to promote innovation, their numbers are small. I would say less than 5%. Innovation is still not the primary focus of a majority of the institutions. For educational institutions to reorient their focus, a comprehensive and systematic intervention and hand-holding is required from the highest level. A robust local innovation ecosystem also needs to be cultivated.
Currently, MHRD’s Innovation Cell (MIC) team is working on developing a comprehensive approach to hand-holding institutions to systematically promote innovation and entrepreneurship within their campuses. We have designed many initiatives, courses and also planning some policy interventions to address every component of the innovation ecosystem. It ranges from awareness and sensitisation, ideas generation, proof of concept development, pre-incubation to finally pushing the deserving products into already constructed incubators. 
All India Council for Technical Education recently asked all its affiliate colleges to start innovation clubs. What has been the response? 
To start with, we have decided to establish Institution Innovation Councils (IICs) across 1,000 institutions in India and handhold them using “hub and spoke” model. The initial response to our programme has been extremely good. The registration process is open and we are planning to launch these 1,000 IICs in the second week of November.
Any lessons from the corporate world that you want to bring to MIC?
My experience at Persistent Systems is helping me enormously. Industry always focuses on ‘outcome’ rather than ‘output’. At MIC, our primary focus is on ‘outcome’, hence we are very proactive and work in a time-bound fashion. 
Is funding a major issue students face to scale up ideas? 
Funding is not a problem for a real good idea. My major problem is that we are not getting or generating really disruptive or out-of-the-box ideas. We want ideas that will have global impact. 
How can MIC help fund projects? 
As MHRD works closely with the Department of Science and Technology, Department of Biotechnology and all other major government agencies mandated to fund innovative projects, MIC will guide innovators and act as a bridge between these funding agencies and innovators.
Can the Atal Ranking of Institutions on Innovation Achievements (ARIIA), an initiative to rank educational institutions on innovation output, help identify more budding entrepreneurs? 
Currently, a majority of the educational institutions do not primarily focus on innovation. ARIIA ranking will help us in reorienting their focus towards innovation as these institutions will get judged on innovation-related parameters. One of the key parameter is ‘number and quality of startups incubated’ by the institutions. This will push institutions to support good ideas from students and faculties and help convert their ideas into ventures.
Hackathons are a great way to encourage digital innovations. Were there any new additions based on feedback from the previous editions for the Smart India Hackathon 2019?
Yes. Till last year, we were engaging only with Government ministries and departments for getting ‘Problem Statements’ that we used for challenging students. For the first time, for SIH2019, we are approaching a large number of industries for problem statements. We have received a phenomenal response from major industries. Problems from industries will be far more cutting-edge and challenging and will excite best student brains. This year, we are trying to increase the value of prizes, and we will also have ‘5 days Hardware Development Hackathon’. 
What are the other ways schools and colleges can drive innovation? 
The most simple and cost-effective way for schools and colleges to drive innovation is to conduct ‘Idea competitions’. Institutions should ask students and faculty to suggest ‘wild ideas’ (without violating the fundamental laws of science). Some of the good ideas can be felicitated and a selected few could be highlighted on their internal or external web portal. Also, schools and colleges can ask students and faculty to give ideas for improving their institution’s governance, and plug inefficiencies and revenue leakages.

Is that people-pleaser, you?
","Remona was always late in joining her friends at any function because it was she who undertook all the boring chores like checking on the delivery of food and number of waiters or whether the flowers and decorations were in order. It was not that she was asked to take the responsibility. She just volunteered in order to be helpful. It made her feel needed and vaguely important. She also hoped that everybody would be pleased with her. Indeed pleasing people was her chief strategy at home, at work, and in society as a whole. 
Does she remind you of anyone you know? She might. She is one of a large section of humankind who feel a disproportionate anxiety when they either disappoint or anger someone. She is what we might call a people-pleaser. What about a return for Remona? Who do you think goes out of his or her way to please her ? 
This article is not about the ethics of how you treat others but about how you treat yourself. 
Aim to please 
From early childhood, we are told that if mother / father is pleased with your behaviour, that’s good for you. And indeed it might be. But some of us gradually and subconsciously adopt this as a personal outlook towards everyone in our lives which also radiates into a social plan. To check whether we have this mild disease of pleasing others — even if we don’t really want to — we have to examine a few pointers. 
Is it difficult for you to get through the day if you’ve had even a minor argument with someone, especially someone you are fond of? “My blood pressure must be up…”; “ I wish I hadn’t said that”; “Now what will she think of me?” — These are the thoughts that haunt you during daylight hours. Night time is spent lying awake worrying tiredly about these same things and perhaps how you might retrieve the situation even if you know you were within your rights to have said or done something. 
Another kind of person wonders constantly how she might manipulate others into liking her or being pleased with her. Perhaps, even encourage others to see her as a victim. Anything to get attention, sympathy, and some affection. The actions of such persons are fuelled by how everything they say or do will cause others to view them.
An article in Psychology Today by Alex Lickerman described this condition as the Good Guy Contract — a contract you write with yourself. Maintaining this contract takes up a great deal of your time because you suffer when others don’t like you. 
How about tearing up this contract and saving time and stepping out of the great need to influence others to like you? Think how much more effective a leader you would be if you made decisions for the right reasons and not because your chief goal in life is to please everyone. 
Once you hit the road to recovery, you will form more genuine friendships based on mutual regard. So far, you have been telling yourself that you need the goodwill of others to pad up your self-esteem. Freed of the need to be liked, you will become more genuinely sensitive and also avoid dramatic fights based on imagined slights and minor rejections.
Remember, that being unable to say “no” usually leads to a mountain of resentment which can easily explode and crush you and your acquaintances. Think of the damage you can avoid and how much happier you can be. Think of the damage to yourself you can reverse.
Cancel that contract you signed with yourself!

Who says Facebook is a waste of time
","What if someone told you can make a living out of Facebook? Or that the more time you spend on various social networking sites, the richer you can get. Take for instance, the cases of Inderjit Vasudevan Moorthy, Karthi Sekar and Sorav Jain — a former TV producer, a gym owner and the third, an alumnus of Leeds University. They understood the influence of social media marketing and are now experts at it.
From multi-million dollar corporate companies to the store next door, it’s a tool everyone is investing in. Even celebrities and politicians hire professionals to make sure that their Twitter and Facebook pages are always abuzz. The job of the social media manager is not only to draw attention to their client’s social media profiles, but also keep visitors engaged with them. More importantly, ensure that the visitors return regularly.  These three men were like any other users of social media till they stumbled upon the business aspect of it. And now it gets them their bread and butter.

Sorav Jain, 27

Many of us may have forgotten Orkut, but Sorav owes his career to the site. “I started at 17 when I was a student at Loyola College. I used to work as a content writer and was learning about Search Engine Optimisation in an internet marketing agency. This area caught my fancy. Orkut was the first social networking site that I started with and I was an Orkut addict,” says Sorav, who joined a start-up after he returned from the U.K., where he studied international marketing management. “That was when I started blogging. The directors of a Spanish personal branding company approached me after reading my blog and asked me to join them on their board of directors.  I was too young to handle that and I gave them the option of outsourcing their needs to me. This inspired me to quit my first job and take the big leap,” says Sorav, who started Echovme, a digital marketing training and services firm. “I now employ 15 people and we have clients like Cashkaro.com, Apollo White Dental Care, Dr. Paul Multispecialty Hospital, Bosch India, Kay: The Fashion Bay and more. We also work for politicians and celebrities,” he says. He has also published a book titled Social Media for Business: Stories of Indian Brands that takes you through the social media journey from a business perspective.

Karthi Sekar, 40

Karthi was looking at opportunities to promote his gym and yoga studio when he discovered the potential of the social-media business. “My friends noticed the presence of my enterprises online and started asking me for tips. Soon I was helping them out,” says Karthi, who started Brand Width in 2011. He works out of Alwarpet and handles clients like Udhaiyam, KGS Developers and Kaizen.
According to him, the scope of online marketing is vast and each site reaches a specific group. He explains, “I was working for this NGO that required volunteers to work in rural areas. That entailed taking a break from their job to dedicate quality time in the villages. Most of the volunteers were foreigners, with very few Indians applying. I then decided to tap LinkedIn to get more volunteers. The strategy worked and we soon had the desired output,” says Karthi, who asserts that one has to always be on the lookout for opportunities and update knowledge to make social media a successful business proposition.

Inderjit Vasudevan Moorthy, 31

A high-school dropout, this entrepreneur never let that tag affect him. He worked as a producer with a TV production company. A regular on Facebook, he saw many people use the site as a medium to vent their ire about Chennai. He loves the city and decided to start a fan page. He started ‘I Love Chennai’. “I remember inviting two of my cousins, the next thing I knew I had more than 100 followers. I took the medium seriously. I started updating pictures, uploading articles celebrating the spirit of the city and uploading multimedia content. In no time, I had over 1,000 likes for the page. I started the page last May and by August I got my first sponsor. Our display picture had their logo,” says Inderjit.
That page is now called ‘My Chennai’ and now has 477,489 fans. He realised its impact and began exploring the social medium further. He came across the Chennai Traffic Police page on Facebook and noticed scope for improvement. “I met the (then) Additional Commissioner of Police (Traffic), Sanjay Arora, and told him about my plan to make the page more interactive. He was more than happy to help. Soon, a team was formed and we started reworking on the page,” he says. 
The page is one of the best maintained pages where people talk about their traffic woes, following which action is taken immediately. Now the page is completely managed by him. His company, Ikebana Consulting, now has a row of clients including the Sports Development Authority of Tamil Nadu and Chennai Metro Rail. He has a team of 11 that works for him. “I call this an industry still in its infancy. A lot more can be achieved because it connects people directly with their clients,” he says.

Empowering the differently-abled
","



 Uniforms and text books are different from what our focus should be on. The priority should be to motivate students to attend schools and provide amenities such as washrooms and lifts. These reimbursements become meaningless without such facilities. One ought to check the number of schools which are friendly toward differently-abled kids and work accordingly. 




Education is the real need of the specially-abled, and not compassion or pity. This is a welcome move by the government. For the country’s holistic development it is important that every section of the society is empowered, and education is the best means to provide empowerment. Easy access to education will certainly help improve the condition of people with special abilities.




The government should ensure that the rights of the specially-challenged are assured. A sheer one percent of all disabled children are able to attend school. The reimbursement of books, uniform and transport will be a step towards progress. This will boost the admission of children with disabilities from this academic session, which will improve the current scenario.




While this seems to be a good move on the part of the government, it should take into consideration the other important aspects of the difficulties of differently-abled students. The government must make a holistic plan which must include proper infrastructure and special teaching amenities. This step will work as a stepping stone towards the welfare of the specially-abled.

CEG @225: Illustrious engineering
"," Walking across the vast campus, opposite Gandhi Mandapam on Chennai’s Sardar Patel Road, is an illuminating experience. The winding tar road that leads you inside the campus, is flanked by monuments and shrouded in verdant stretches of land. On one side, is a temple-like structure, while on the other, is a gaggle of youngsters lazing around on stone benches, catching up on gossip, exchanging notes, or just grabbing some “me” time. But the pièce de résistance is the majestic Red Stone building that looms before you, filling you with an inexplicable sense of purpose. This year, the College of Engineering, Guindy (CEG) has entered its 225th year.
India’s first engineering college, CEG was started in 1794 as School of Survey, and established as a college in 1859. At present, it has 23 departments and 590 colleges affiliated to it. Over the years, the college has witnessed a sea-change in the manner in which engineering has evolved. Anna University’s Vice Chancellor, M.K. Surappa, traces the evolution of engineering over the years, his pride palpable. “A gradual paradigm shift, in our country’s engineering education, has been visible in the last 200 years. Today, technology which we had never imagined could exist, has moulded our lives in unthinkable ways,” he believes.
“During the pre-independence years, engineers were taught about surveying, building bridges, and canals. Soon after independence, however, we had innumerable challenges — we were below the poverty line, people were starving, and we lacked infrastructure other than the railways and the British canal systems. Gradually, engineers built steel plants. Public sector undertakings such as HAL, ITI, and others, emerged. Thus, our main focus was to ensure that we had engineering graduates who were adept in the fields of mechanical, civil, electrical, and aerospace engineering. Naturally, the intake in the field increased. Today, it has been further revolutionised with the advent of the Internet, paving way for the digital era,” the VC continues. “Today, engineering is no more a subject that flies solo; over the years, it has taken on an interdisciplinary aspect. It is not enough, for instance, for engineers to merely build machines. Now, they have to also study related subjects such as psychology, biology, and more, to understand the needs of people, and build technology that will also lend itself to solving society’s problems or bridging gaps that people didn’t know existed. And that is what CEG is preparing its students for — to not only be successful theoretically, but to be able to think critically, and meet the demands of the future.”
Then and now
The field, which was once deemed a male bastion, has over the years witnessed many women making a mark and carving a niche for themselves, an observation made by Dean, T.V. Geetha, who is also CEG’s first woman dean. “I joined the college as a student in 1977, and pursued electronics and communication. After graduation, I joined the college in a temporary capacity. I was one among the first women who had reached this stage, back then,” she reminisces. “The first class I handled was for the department’s technical staff. They were surprised to see me eloquently explain technical terms and concepts. Now, however, the faculty comprises a majority of women,” she exclaims.
Vish A. Viswanathan, CEO, UBICS, who passed out of the college in 1985, points out one other change in the field.“Engineering has now become competitive. From being a profession for only a few, it has now become quite popular with various sections of the society. Professionals have increased opportunities from both public and private sectors. In fact, the percentage of engineers in the private sector has grown disproportionately due to the increasing demand for such skills in private sector growth,” he avers.
Innovations galore
What many of CEG’s illustrious alumni are proud of is how the college took science and technology outside classrooms, providing young, untethered minds a chance to explore, innovate, and create. Viswanathan says, “As far back as 1900, our engineers were involved in nation-building activities such as survey, construction of monuments, agriculture and irrigation engineering, telecommunications (BSNL, AIR, for instance), and more. From 1920 to 1970, CEG was a breeding ground for outstanding graduates who were absorbed by government organisations to apply their conceptual learning and address real-world problems.”
An example of the most innovative work is that of an alumnus, Dr. Varghese Kurien, the father of the White Revolution, who created what is now Amul, says Vishwanathan. “He used the power of his engineering knowledge to revolutionise how the country’s dairy industry worked, transforming us from a milk-starved country to a milk excess country, in a matter of a few years. Yet another alumnus, Dr K.L. Rao, was instrumental in building various famous dams in the country including Nagarjunasagar dam, Hirakud dam, among others.”
Saravan Krishna, a graduate from the 2015 batch, concurs. “CEG has a glorious history of producing stalwarts in various fields. Students are constantly encouraged to involve themselves in activities and projects that transcend the realm of classrooms — we have over 20 student clubs focusing on techno-management, entrepreneurship, robotics, and so on. These clubs and their events give us tremendous opportunity to innovate and lead. This ensures that students tune themselves to the real world rather than merely being theoretically sound,” he insists.
Saravan believes engineers are the main players in the digital revolution, and to ensure India moves forward, technology, infrastructure and renewable energy are essential. “In terms of academia, it is time to improve quality and reduce quantity — there is an excess of engineering colleges which is not required. The quality of syllabus has to match the needs of the industry, and most importantly, teachers have to be trained to impart new syllabus. Today, many bright students go abroad to pursue research. Our government must ensure we stop this brain drain and create a conducive atmosphere for research in India with good grants and infrastructure. A public-private partnership will be the key to the growth of Indian engineering education,” he signs off.

At seven, words are sacred to him
","L. Sanjan’s world revolves around words. Nouns, verbs and prepositions fascinate him.
Perhaps, that’s why this seven-year-old breezed through four oral and seven written rounds to win the National Championship in Category I, and the ‘Star Speller’ and ‘Best Performer’ awards at the MaRRS International Spelling Bee held at Faridabad in April.
Sanjan, with terrific enthusiasm, recounts his experience at the event. “You know, it is the ‘Spell It’ round I quite enjoyed. I spelt 47 out of 50 words right. It was the ‘chateau’ word that knocked me out. I knew it was different from the word ‘shadow’, but I didn’t know its spelling or meaning. Nevertheless, it was fun,” says the student of Bhavans Rajaji Vidyashram.
Asked if he was ever nervous during the competition, he says, “I was neither tense nor tired. I was just waiting for the prize!”
He admits that he is completely enchanted by the language. “You know what I like the most about going to school? It is English lab sessions. We have something exciting to do during all sessions. And since I’m regular to school, I have also got the award for holding the maximum attendance,” he says with pride.
Like his father, C. Lenin, Sanjan wants to become a doctor, an orthopaedician to be specific.
“It is quite interesting to see what my dad does. Hence, the decision to pursue medicine,” he says.
He is also a voracious reader and is interested in art. “He has also got awards in drawing competitions and won an interschool competition in Bhagawad Gita. He is very articulate and speaks his mind always,” says his mother, N. Anuja, a professor at Savitha Dental College.
Now, he is all set to compete in the International Championship scheduled to take place in two months. “I just take it easy and prepare at my own pace. I think it will be fun,” he says with a smile.

Unleash the power of your brain
"," Dr Jose’ Foglia from Uruguay is a medical doctor with a double degree in Medicine, specialised in General Surgery, Haemotherapy and in Psycho-Neuro Endocrine Immunology; he was in Chennai this January, conducting a course on ‘The Meditative Brain, a Challenge to the Digital Revolution’. Excerpts from an interview. 
Could you please explain the complex functions of the brain briefly, in simple terms for a lay person? 
The brain is composed of millions of neurons processing information from external and internal (our body) environment to create its reality; by reality I mean what is present around oneself at that moment; at the same time it can also communicate itself to others through intellectual and manual capabilities.
What do you mean by the term, ‘self aware brain’?
The brain consists of two hemispheres, the left and the right, connected by the Corpus Callosum (a bridge composed of millions of nerve fibres connecting one hemisphere to the other); both hemispheres are sharing their information all the time, working together.
The left hemisphere of the brain is aware of ‘itself’ (self-awareness) and this is possible because it has developed the capacity to integrate information in special areas called “memories”, so it’s possible for the brain to say: “I am”.
With these definitions what is your brief advice to youngsters against addictive habits?
The ‘self aware brain’ is interpreting all the time the reality and constantly conditioning it.
Many activities of the brain are just reactions, conditioned by mere habits. One must be aware of any kind of habit formation and the influence of the same.
The abuse of digital technology is addictive for the brain, causing deficit of attention, deficit of memory, depression, etc., and this addictive process should be avoided.
How can the brain create different realities?
All the bits of information coming into the brain from the external and internal environment are processed in the brain, but only on a part of this information are we consciously focusing our attention and this is the process by which we create different realities. The reality created by the brain is conditioned by numerous factors.
Could you explain the ‘Dopamine Reward’ term in connection to addictions and creating different realities?
The dopamine reward is a mechanism that creates the impulse for the brain to satisfy its addictions, habits, and all the needs of the body. For example, the craving for eating sweets – when we keep away from sweets, the body experiences a sense of ‘longing’ to eat sweets. Once we eat sweets again, some areas of the brain releases dopamine and the craving is satisfied. This process can lead to addictions.
Please explain neuroplasticity and tell us specifically how to use it to avoid addictions of alcohol, tobacco and so on?
Neuroplasticity is the capability of our brain to change the quality of the connections between the neurons; to make it work faster or stronger or to make new connections or to destroy it. The same also, either increases the number of neurons (Neurogenesis) or decreases the number of neurons (Apoptosis). Because the neuroplasticity of the brain is creating ‘new pathways’, new connections every time one repeats these actions, it makes these connections stronger, eventually asking for more and more of the addictive material, whether it is alcohol or tobacco or any other habit forming material or process.
Could you explain the term ‘Mind’?
‘Mind’ is a term I don’t like to use as I don’t know the real meaning of it.
I would rather use the term, ‘psyche’ – the consequences of the brain activity.
Your advice to youngsters?
To use to ‘full’ all the potential of their brain to the maximum of the possibilities, because the brain is like a muscle and one must use and improve its functions. For example, meditation techniques can increase neurogenesis and the connections between the neurons in the most important areas that makes us ‘human beings’, increasing attention, memory, empathy, etc.
 Why do you say that all young people should be aware of the abuse of digital technology?
The abuse of digital technology will damage the brain - its short-term memory as well as the long-term memory. So one should be consciously aware of this and keep the digital technological devices to the required areas of use.
How early this awareness should start?
Up to two years of a child’s life there should not be digital influence; parents should be aware of this and should not introduce gadgets to young children as it will inhibit the growth of the neuron connections. Inputs should be in the form of natural interactions with the external world from the beginning.

Blending biotech and writing
","Hoping to land a job, I began looking for an internship that would help me refine my profile as a bioengineer. Days of sifting through numerous job posts online led me to a post by Medgenera Tech, which was inviting applicants to write reports on the latest events in biotechnology and pharmaceuticals. This internship was a merger of both my passions — science and writing. Applicants were required to possess a basic knowledge of science and an ability to write.
A few days after I submitted my application, I was shortlisted and received a call for a telephonic interview. After an interview with CEO Pankaj Mishra, we discussed the work hours and I was hired as a biotech and pharma journalist intern.
Science writing
I was assigned a news item every day and was asked to write an article based on it by the end of the day. The news items included recent advances in the pharmaceutical industry, details of drugs approved or disapproved by the FDA, drugs clearing clinical trials, and so on. Writing these articles required me to research into the history of the respective organisations, different versions of a drug, and its current status of development including its marketing and market reception. Some articles required me to explain the mechanism of drug action and implications of introducing a drug into the market in layman’s terms. My mentor would edit these articles and publish them on the company’s website. We had regular conversations wherein she would share feedback and help me improve my writing style and content quality.
The internship provided me an opportunity to keep abreast with the latest happenings in my field of interest as well as hone my writing skills. I learnt to communicate with a diverse audience, keeping the gist of the subject intact. A lot of reading and researching being involved in the job, I enhanced my conceptual knowledge. Regular discussions with my mentor regarding my progress accelerated suggestions and constructive criticism.
The stint improved my research writing skill which has emerged as a crucial aspect for those working in the science field. The stipend I received was the icing on the cake. In view of my work, I was offered a full-time job in the organisation; I couldn’t accept it as I wanted to continue my higher education. Over the years, I have interned at various laboratories and research institutes, but this internship will always be one of my most rewarding experiences.

CET off to a smooth start
","The Common Entrance Test (CET) for admissions to seats in government colleges and government-quota seats in private colleges began on Thursday.
The Karnataka Examinations Authority (KEA), which conducts the test, said in a press release that there was 96.7 per cent attendance for the maths exam, with 1.35 lakh students writing it. The biology exam recorded 73.1 per cent attendance, with 1.02 lakh candidates writing it.
Rakshitha M. from Mount Carmel College and Harshitha N. from Nayarana PU College, both medical seat aspirants hoping to get into Bangalore Medical College and Research Institute, found both the papers easy. “The additional option this time of pursuing pharmacy if not medical will benefit us as we will have a backup plan,” Rakshitha said.
Engineering seat aspirant Taniya Agarwal, from Delhi Public School, said the maths paper matched her expectations. “I am actually planning to pursue an engineering course in Singapore. But, if I score well in the CET and get into a good college like M.S. Ramaiah Institute of Technology, I will stay back. When I was preparing for the entrances, my parents suggested that I prepare fully and well for either the CET or the Joint Entrance Examination (IIT-JEE) as they involve different kinds of preparation. I stuck to the CET as the portions are similar to the Class 12 CBSE Board,” she said.
There were also students like Parameshwar Nayak of St. Joseph’s PU College, who was attempting the CET to test the waters. “I want to study BBM, but I wouldn’t mind studying civil engineering if I get a good seat and a rank. My preparations for the CET have not been great but the paper was not tough,” he said, after writing the maths exam.
Expert views on the papers were largely similar. Hanumanthacharya, head of the Department of Biology at BASE, said there was no ambiguity in any question. But he said several topics pertaining to animal and human life had not been “properly represented” in the paper. “The standard of the question paper was fairly high, and a well-informed student can score between 40 and 50 marks,” he said. As for the maths paper, H.S. Mahadevaiah, head of the Department of Mathematics at BASE, said it was a “well-balanced paper” of moderate difficulty.
Milind, vice-president, Knowledge Management, Ace Creative Learning, also said good scores could be expected this year in biology though the paper resembled a medical entrance test paper, while the maths paper, though it had an erroneous question, was of an “increased standard.”
The physics and chemistry exams will be held on Friday.

Writing for recognition
"," I look at the pile of answer booklets with some sense of anticipation — and a little trepidation. There’s always a tinge of hopeful excitement at the beginning of a new academic session, when we are on the verge of welcoming a new group of students and research scholars into the department. One group is screened on the basis of machine-read optical-character-recognition sheets, unmediated by humans. Another is evaluated in the old way, by people reading answers written out in longhand.
Apart from the usual difficulties that teachers face in evaluating subjective essays, there is an additional problem that we often face, and that has nothing to do with the substance of an answer, but its appearance. Some of the submissions are written in a script that is near impossible to read, the writing is an impenetrable scrawl, or the letters are so tiny that I wish I had a magnifier to make them visible.Often, dense writing covers page after page, with no paragraph breaks or markers to tell me that the writer is moving from one point or idea to the next.
Balancing act
I do get that students are tense and anxious, wanting to put down everything they know (or disguising what they don’t know) in the limited time available in an examination. By and large, evaluators are a tolerant lot; they understand the pressures examinees are under, and take a charitable attitude towards answer scripts — but at minimum, they must be able to figure out what’s in them.
Writing an examination is a delicate balancing act; you have to understand the question, pull out of your mind the specific bits of information that the answer requires, figure out the level of detail needed, and then fit it all into the time given. But writing an exam is only half the process. The person at the other end — the reader — completes the other part. They need to know that you have understood the question and its scope and have provided an appropriate and adequate response. If the writing and organisation of the answer does not allow for easy reading, it would be difficult for even the kindest and most charitable evaluator to rate it — let alone rate it high.
In recent years, the quality of handwriting (what used to be called “penmanship”) has received less attention, partly because of the entry of the computer. But all through school, and most of college, we are still required to write by hand. We don’t need to be calligraphists, but it would help to develop a clear, strong hand, one that can be read without too much effort. Keep in mind that the person who is reading the script is most likely faced with a big pile of similar answer books, and must have the ability to decipher several different styles of handwriting, while also looking for whether the key points and arguments have been made. The higher the level of the examination, the more crucial it is that the writing is clear in style, content, and appearance.
So, as you prepare to write that exam, make sure you work on achieving a reasonable level of clarity — in what you write, and how you write it. Remember, there’s a person at the other end who needs to understand it!

Laws need to be reframed
","Rashika Sharma, M.A. English, Delhi University




The fact that Indian women — particularly from the film and journalism industries — are utilising this international campaign, is ample impetus to highlight sexual harassment at workplace. Though we have laws and government portals such as SHE BOX to register complaints, their inadequacy is revealed when more popular platforms are used to voice these issues. This is because of lack of awareness of government schemes and initiatives. Fortunately, the Minister of Women and Child Development has formed a committee of retired judges to take up the cases. The proceedings should begin soon as the victims have already suffered silently all these years. Second, it empowers more women to come forward knowing that they have a medium now along with other victims and supporters. Third, this revolution has the capacity to instill fear among patriarchs to remain within their limits, barring which their long-established image will be tarnished with a single tweet or an online post. This medium is apt for the urban middle class who have access to the Internet, but what about those who do not have such means? For this, women’s helpline can be made more efficient. Also, sexual harassment committees should be strengthened, and national and state women’s commissions must become more active. In the words of Vinta Nanda, “It is not women versus men, or victim versus accused; it is society versus patriarchy.”
Tarun Kadian, III, B.A(Honours ) Political Science, Shaheed Bhagat Singh, Delhi University, Gurugram




Sexual harassment at the workplace has existed for years and has been accepted as a norm, with the top management silencing victims. But now, in the virtual world with the support of netizens, women have gathered the courage to speak out against the perpetrators. The goal is to create conducive conditions for everyone at work, and this can be achieved through the strengthening and implementation of existing laws such as the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplaces (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressel) Act, 2013 which mandates the constitution of ICCs and ensuring that a fair probe is carried without any further harassment of the victims. We, as a society, should create a supportive environment to empower women to speak up. The stigma attached with the culture of raising voices in this patriarchal world should be shed to empower women.
D.Tejaswi, I, M.A.English, IGNOU, Hyderabad




While #MeToo is gaining momentum, it becomes important to check the authenticity of those being accused. One drawback of the online media is that anyone can post anything anonymously, to avoid coming under the scanner. Several individuals could take advantage of this and defame people they may not like. Nevertheless, it takes a lot of guts for women who are speaking up for themselves and for this, they deserve appreciation. 
Manish Kumar Pujari, I, Ph.D, JNU, New Delhi




#MeToo is a good platform for the oppressed, suppressed, and depressed voices to make themselves heard. However, this movement, much like other social media movements, has its limitations — it is a tool only for those who have Internet access and an account on social media. For supressed voices in remote villages, there is still a long way to go before their voices can be heard through such platforms.
Abhishek Mohan, Alumnus, Master of Communication Design, Royal Melbourne Institute of Design, Australia




It is the basic need of every individual to be able to pursue his/her aspirations in a safe and secure society. Unfortunately, the safety of our institutions is being questioned today due to the high prevalence of such malicious conduct. First, this situation can only be controlled by altering the behaviour of predators. Stringent laws on transparency of institutions and clearly-stated boundaries need to be legally enforced so that authorities in power cannot use their positions to bully or abuse victims. Second, such violations can scar anyone at a professional and emotional level. Hence, victims must be given the support system in the form of counselling services to be able to speak up. Such support systems must be able to provide a mechanism for victims to be able to hold their aggressors responsible without fear of punishment or negative consequences. This will help more victims to speak up.
Harikrishnan K.S, B.Tech, Civil Engineering, College of Engineering Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala




The movement indicates the absence of a competent authority to address such issues. With technology shrinking the world, the voices of the victims can be heard by a lot more people. This can be considered an improvement, as well as a matter of concern, as sometimes the platform is prone to misuse. To provide the justice deserved, the government needs to step up. An ad-hoc authority or tribunal, as in the case of Justice Varma Committee recommendations, which would provide satisfactory and quick redressal mechanism, is an option worth considering. Such an action, if successful in winning people’s confidence, will encourage victims to seek a more convenient path, rather than using informal sources in their quest for justice.
Deepak Kumar Beuria, Graduate, Bhubaneswar 
 


The #MeToo movement should reach the lower section of our society, where sexual abuse and harassment is more common. The movement should also be made a part of educational institutions across India to reveal instances of abuse by so-called teachers, lecturers, professors, and so on. This movement should be led in such a way as to reduce the incidence of rape, abuse and harassment. It should be accessible to everyone — men, women and the transgender community. The process needs strict and transparent laws for it to be effective.
Danish Firdaus, UPSC aspirant, Delhi




Online revolutions can impart great change and speeden law enforcement. #MeToo has empowered so many women to come and speak about the pain they have felt. This will help reduce the percentage of defaulters. While many famous people have been named and shamed as harassers, there are perpetrators have gone scot-free. Though recent laws can help, the legal process is too slow, and gives ample time to perpetrators to silence their victims. Since every law can be used and misused, it is better to each accusation thoroughly. 
H. Haripriyaa, II, B.Com(C.S), Bhaktavatsalam Memorial College for Women, Chennai




Over the past couple of years, social media has transcended from merely connecting people to becoming a tool to addresses issues and injustice meted out by society. This has become more common with the #MeToo movement. Women from different fields have shared stories of their abuses and are seeking justice. Eventually, it has gained momentum as the Ministry of Women and Child Development has come up with a committee to look into these issues. I hope through these means, women can call out their perpetrators as opposed to remaining silent victims. The right way forward is to take this up with the Supreme Court and bring out a rational verdict. Women can no longer be subjugated to obnoxious threats. We need to create a conducive and abuse-free environment for women.

Givers and takers
"," A friend was only half joking when she said, “I am in a give-and-take friendship with X. She does all the taking and I do all the giving.” Does this sound familiar? 
Those who study human behaviour divide people into two broad categories: the givers and the takers. Most of us fall into the midway bracket of both giving and taking, keeping a close eye on what goes out while forgiving ourselves and making excuses for taking; but the givers of the world give without counting the costs. Most often they act without thinking, like the man who threw himself on top of a young girl whom he spotted just in time as she crouched on the rails waiting for a speeding train. At the other end are people who are the very opposite: skilled at getting others to do their work and feeling no qualms about taking the credit, be it in an office or in a household where everyone is expected to pitch in. These are the takers of the world. They are also very good at making everyone else feel obliged to them and protecting their interests or making excuses for their inability to contribute what they should by rights have ‘given’. (“My husband was ill.” “ I was travelling.” “My daughter’s examinations…” )
How would you slot yourself? And more crucially, as far as happiness and lightness of mind are concerned, which feels better?
Happiness
Eric Barker whose insights have been widely appreciated (and even tested in small groups) is sure that in the matter of happiness, the data he has gathered over many years show that the crafty climbers who get promoted or rewarded financially are not necessarily happier than those who get left behind despite hard work and commitment to whatever field they might be performing in. By not trusting others, by looking the other way when others need help, the takers actually cut themselves short on what makes people happy. They are the ones who feel low for no reason at all. Who feel uneasy and keep looking over their shoulders. Double-dealing becomes a habit and gradually colours their whole existence. 
Those who donate regularly to good work, who spend time as volunteers, who offer to help before they are asked — studies have shown that these are the people who do not fall into depression or give into anger. They are optimistic about human nature and healthier because their self-esteem and levels of emotional satisfaction keep them happy. They might experience weariness, but rarely unfocussed rage which is an increasingly dangerous public expression of feelings in our fast-paced urban lives. 
Our best work
In a collection of articles produced in honour of a scholar of English Literature, Himansu Mohapatra, titled The Unbilled Hour I came across the perfect model of an academic giver. The long spells of reading, teaching, and writing outside professional requirements goes unnoticed academically but is received and remembered with gratitude by the many students, colleagues and friends who benefited from the generous nature of the scholar. Our best work, as the preface to the book says, is done in the unbilled hour. 
This month, which marks World Environment Day, is a good time to remember the endless giver of life we all depend on: bhoomimata. She gave us ourselves and waits patiently for us to return her dues. If we pay no other bill, that outstanding is something we will surely settle one day.

Staying in the lane: How engineering graduates can pursue a career in their line of study
"," Changes in society are driving up demand for experts in STEM industries, and unless we meet this demand, we are at risk of costing the local economy billions of dollars in the lost potential for additional GDP. The obvious solution is to depend on our higher education institutions. However, there is a trend where, on graduating, engineering students enter non-professional engineering occupations. So, what is putting them off? And what teaching methods can universities use to encourage more students to move into the engineering sector?
 One factor that might put these students off an engineering job is that other industries are offering more desirable graduate packages, including bigger pay-packets, particularly now that graduates are being left with burgeoning student loans to repay. With a variety of industries currently experiencing digital transformation, the skills developed during an engineering degree mathematical, analytical, technological translate into a number of jobs, not just engineering. Therefore, we must inspire these students by using more innovative teaching techniques and increasing employer engagement methods in higher education.
Approach for change
More ambitious and challenging project-based learning is the key. This teaching technique allows educators to bring their course material closer to real life and enables young people to get a hands-on experience so they can see that computing, maths and physics are very creative as well as technical. Capturing their imagination whilst at university can help ensure that students maintain their interest in engineering science into a profession after graduation. Project-based learning allows students to see, hear and touch what would otherwise be completely abstract and gives them a better idea of what a career in STEM might entail on a day-to-day basis.
Industry-standard software and hardware can also be used in education, giving students an experience with engineering tools and practices they will use in employment. For example, by incorporating industry-standard software such as MATLAB and Simulink, instructors not only keep students motivated but also prepare them for the working world.
We have also witnessed the success of global competitions such as the ROBOCON competition, where engineering students are acquiring skills that are directly transferable to real-world design. These competitions support teams who start with nothing and then must conceptualise, design, build, test and race their own solution, and then show their work to a panel of judges who determine how well each team explains the logic behind the design process.
Ultimately, we do not have time to wait for universities to change their stance on this issue. The engineering industry must take more responsibility and help support education bodies to incorporate these initiatives so that we have a steady stream of engineering talent entering the engineering workforce.

How effective is this?
","Spriha Shukla, M.Phil in English Literature, Tata Institute of Social Sciences, Mumbai




The objective exam pattern is an unfair means to judge someone’s knowledge. An individual’s understanding of a particular topic can vary, based on his/her socialisation which cannot be summed up in one word answers. Also, the pattern is highly problematic for the social science courses where there are no black and white answers. The answers are supposed to be backed by detailed explanation, which can vary from person to person, based on their experiences.
Supreet Aneja, IV, Journalism, Apeejay Stya University, Gurugram




This step seems to stand in contrast to the ethos of JNU, especially for departments of social sciences. The analytical and comprehensive ability to defend one's view has been taken away. The move also leads to the habit of cramming, where candidates fail to understand the concepts in detail. For the problem of evaluating lengthy answer sheets, a middle ground can be thought of.
Aishwarya M.R., III, B.E. (ECE), Sri Krishna College of Technology, Coimbatore




JNU’s decision principally in the field of arts will be inefficient in testing relevant skills of prospective students. Moreover, selecting students through objective entrance exams might not reap good results in the long run due to low complexity of evaluation. The pattern of the paper needs to be set in accordance with the skills required at the entrance level.
Sadia Anjum, Final Year, PGDM, Jaipura School Of Business, Ghaziabad




Online entrance tests are certainly a step forward towards fair selection. But the University will have to make sure that the holistic requirements, like knowledge and skills are tested despite this change in the exam pattern. Students, especially at the postgraduate level, must be gauged properly. It seems a little difficult to assess subjective knowledge through MCQs and therefore the effectiveness of this system can be challenged.

Key it in right
","“How do we give this candidate a job when he can’t key in his application without error?” asked the HR executive. He had a point. The e-mailed application for a programmer’s job was a mess. It was not just the odd spelling error that the HR executive might have overlooked.
The message was a keying disaster. The first-person “I” was not capitalised; the full-stops appeared two spaces away from the last letter of the sentence, inviting blue squiggly lines beneath; lack of space between the full-stop and the next sentence meant red wavy lines underneath; arbitrarily-placed upper-case letters had sprung at odd places. Ah, the words themselves were fine — they spoke of the candidate’s talents, his willingness to learn, his varied interests — but these were lost in the thorny, wavy jungle of poor typing.

Teach typing

A class of 70 high-schoolers told me “keying skills” were not part of their computer science curriculum. They were simply expected to know how to type. “As soon as we were allowed to use the computer, we worked our way around with the keyboard,” they said. A couple of them said they had taken lessons from the typing tutor, but that was for speed, not accuracy.
Schools don’t invest in teaching keying skills because they figure students are already proficient in using the keyboard. A school official said they were using “know-your-computer” time on more “important” matters since “kids already know how to type.” That is the point. Students know “how-to,” not “how-well-to.” Most students start typing on cell phones and tablets, using hunt-and-punch methods and never learn to touch-type (type without looking at the keyboard).
Since students come to school familiar with computer keyboards and cell phone keypads, educators accept the ad hoc habits of six-year-old computer gamers. Ironically, the same teachers spend hours teaching kids how to hold a pencil, how to curve the “G” stylishly — skills kids are likely to use less and less with schools accepting typed assignments. How much is perfect handwriting important in their adult lives?

Error-free typing

It matters how we type. Once I found an error in my medical report. The technician not only took a long time to type, but got a few words wrongly placed and misspelt my name. Automatic typing would have helped him concentrate on the screen and made his work error-free, but then, did he really know what ""error-free"" was ?
If you are preparing for a job that requires typing, isn’t it mandatory you learn it well? Isn’t it part of the job-skill requirement?
Then why isn’t it taught in schools and colleges? How come typing skills do not feature in even highly resourced, well-administrated training plans, personal development programmes or professional qualifications? Isn’t error-free typing the dominant form of creating words for most of the jobs?
Here is a sample of jobs that particularly demand accuracy in typing.

Marketing research manager: Has to design questions, prepare databases, use statistical models, write reports and develop presentation pieces; create the annual research budget, write research plans and proposals; use word-processing software for reports, spreadsheets for budgets, presentation software to showcase research findings — all of it requires error-free work.

Data-entry/processing: Have to enter data from the hard copy; type 60-70 words per minute to catch up with workload.

Medical assistants: Have to record patient-information, billing information, payment transactions.

Computer engineers: have to work with CAD (computer-assisted design) and CAM (computer-assisted mechanics) software programmes for building product models; need to use codes.

Teacher: has to maintain student records, write reports, prepare question papers, worksheets; manage software programmes to track attendance; make seating charts, construct lesson plans, create test banks and answer keys; plot graphs to explain student progress and soon.
Salesmen, human resource managers, web designers — who doesn’t need typing skills? Salespeople have to enter sales calls, orders. Human resource managers maintain records of employees on salaries, attendance, work history.
A web designer is using a keyboard all the time, designing, spacing, re-writing! And won’t we all be happier to see a doctor’s prescription typed out neatly and not written by hand?

Some tips

- Learn touch-typing so you can strike the right letter/number with the right finger without looking at the keypad.
- Slow down if you are making too many mistakes. Accuracy must be your goal. Speed comes with constant practice.
- Build up speed and accuracy by practising telephone numbers.
- Try online tutorials to improve 10-key skills. Many offer free trials.
- Explore the possibility of a typing skills programme in your college.

Fold it like Gallaghar
","For somebody who started out as a sports reporter and presenter on BBC Radio Kent, Phil Gallaghar has a rather unusual title. He is known as Mister Maker, a tribute to his ability to skilfully fold, paste and create artefacts.
Gallagher does not regret the switch from sports presenter to maker of quirky artefacts. He thinks he has the best job on earth.
“I love making things. Mister Maker, the show, started in 2007. And even after all these years it feels like it just started yesterday. It's amazing how much the show has grown...I love my job,” he announces delighted. But seven years on, it must be a challenge to come up with new techniques and new projects for every episode.
“It is an incredible challenge but we have a wonderful team. We sit together and come up with various ideas. I write the script before the show.”
It’s a fast-paced, colourful and creative television show that aims to encourage youngsters; Phil hopes the kids continue with it, as he believes it goes a long way in increasing their creativity.
Phil has been travelling around the world for his show Mister Maker Around The World, where he puts together art pieces made of clay, cardboards, coloured papers and even some waste materials.
After a tour of the United Kingdom, he is heading to other places, including Cape Town, Rio and Sydney. He is excited about the prospect of meeting different people.
Of course, you must feel awesome, when you are a hit with the kids and they attribute every little creation of theirs to you.
Phil laughs, “When the programme took off, it was targeted at children aged six. Soon, we realised it appealed to children of all ages, parents and grandparents as well.”
The show has a following across continents and the master craftsman believes it is because the love of creativity is universal and transcends age groups.
He gives me the same advice he has given millions of his viewers, “Just have a go. Be creative and be proud of what you create.”

Mister Maker Around The World airs Monday to Friday at 5 p.m. on Discovery Kids.

Time for a reality check
","After my graduation in 2015, I have been preparing for the Civil Services Examination. Currently, I am working. However, my job is not demanding and I can take out the time required for studies. I am also sure that I want to be a civil servant as my current job is also similar (but not permanent — just two years). However, I am not able to concentrate on my studies. I spend time watching interesting videos and do not study at all. I am concerned and want to get back to studies. Please guide me.
— Narendra
Dear Narendra,
If you are too lazy to plough, don’t expect a harvest. I don’t have sufficient information on what you do right now but you are very young. Focus on what you want. Your time is now! You have only shared the fact that you are not able to concentrate on your studies to take the Civil Services Exam, since you seem to get distracted by watching videos online. You need to make a choice and identify how badly you want to be a civil servant. What does it mean to you? Just being merely concerned is not going to help you get out of your complacency.
Why don’t you join a coaching centre of repute for the IAS exam? This will ensure that you become disciplined and regular, work on the assignments and also get a real sense of what the competition is all about. Hope you start working seriously towards your goal.
I am 26. I have completed an advanced diploma in tool and die making (4 years) and a bachelor’s degree in mechanical engineering, but instead of looking for a job in core companies, I am preparing for the Staff Selection Commission: Combined Graduate Level Examination. Please tell me if this is the right decision. — Yashudas
Dear Yashudas,
I really wouldn’t know if taking the SSC CGL is right or wrong as I have no idea of what you would like to do and what is it that you are passionate about. However, I look at the exams as a great opportunity for you, as you will have a few more options open up post the exams — various interesting postings across ministries, departments, and offices of the government.
In the meantime, I would greatly recommended that you take some time and introspect on what your core interest is — mechanical engineering/tool and die making or a government job. Happy soul searching!
I am 26 and preparing to get a suitable government job, but I am not interested in this. I am doing it only because of what my father wants for me. I am good at singing and passionate about it. But nobody in my family is supporting me; they only have demotivating things to say about a singing career. Please suggest what I could do. — Manish
Dear Manish,
I understand that you are completely disinterested in taking up a government job. You also feel that your family is pushing you to take it on and not motivating you to pursue your dream of becoming a singer. 
What is the evidence of you being a good singer? Do you understand how difficult it is to get a break in the music industry? Are you a trained musician? Please equip yourself so that you have the credentials to grow —secure a decent job first that would provide you with the flexibility to further your passion. Enrol in music classes, get a good music teacher, start auditioning and get a reality check of where you stand among the zillion other talented struggling singers. This process can take forever, or, you can get lucky if you are at the right place at the right time. It will certainly help being stable and secure (both financially and socially) till you realise your dream!

Getting by with a little help
","Next week seems daunting. Besides completing and submitting practical records for three subjects, you have to prepare quiz questions for an intercollegiate fest that your college is hosting. And, yes, you also need to turn in your article for the college magazine. In case this isn’t quite enough, your parents are insisting that you attend your cousin’s engagement on Wednesday evening — bang in the middle of the week! 
If you are feeling overwhelmed by the barrage of demands being imposed on you, take a moment to evaluate your options. You have to finish the record work. No choices there. Can you ask a friend on the quiz club to help with the questions? Can you ask the editor of the college magazine for an extension? And, yes, you are attending your cousin’s function. When we are overwrought, we needn’t push ourselves to the limit. Instead, asking for help can help us tide through crunch times without falling apart. Recognising that we need assistance and learning to ask for it is a skill that can be developed by all of us, including those who vehemently believe in being self-reliant. For the truth is, we all depend on the support and cooperation of others in more ways than one. 
Political scientist, professor and writer, Anne-Marie Slaughter says, “It often takes much more strength on our part to acknowledge weakness than to pretend infinite competence.” Asking for assistance is often a sign of healthy coping as it involves an awareness of how much we can actually take on. We need to know our limits and how far we can stretch. And, we should be careful of extending ourselves too far lest we break.
Seek assistance 
So, when the going seems tough, it is okay to receive assistance. But we should realise that we may have to ask for it, and ask for it in the right way. In The New York Times, Tim Herrara cites the work of social psychologist Heidi Grant, who provides a few steps that can help us get help.
First, you have to ensure that the person you are seeking assistance from recognises your need for help. Don’t assume that they know the context of your current difficulties. While you may understand your plight, it may not be obvious to the other person why you would need their help. So, if you ask a friend to help you set the quiz questions, explain why are you making the request so that he doesn’t think you are shirking your responsibilities. 
Next, you need to specify the kind of help you need. Provide as much clarity as possible by giving details about the nature of assistance you are seeking. Also, the other person is more likely to help if you make it clear that you are not asking for help indefinitely but for a particular task only. This way, the person aiding you also knows how much time and effort is required of her. Last, be selective in asking for help. If you ask a friend who isn’t interested in quizzing, then it is unlikely to result in your need being fulfilled.
While it is perfectly fine to ask for help when you are in a tight spot, you have to be mindful that you don’t ask for help all the time. People are more likely to acquiesce when your need for assistance is genuine and well-deserved. If you habitually postpone your assignments and are always in a fix closer to deadlines, then people are less likely to pitch in. Asking for help should not be your default option. Rather, if you use it judiciously, more people than you realise will be happy to lend a hand.

Break down those walls "," Writing this in the month that marks yet another year of our Independence reminds us of physical orders that were marked off in different parts of Asia and Africa in the last century. It gives us a chance to think about walls of different kinds in our physical world while the www of internet operates in ether. Natural borders like the Himalayas have caused different kinds of linked societies to develop over the millennia but have man-made walls done well? The Great Wall of China did not. Nor did the Berlin Wall.
Ever since the Stone Age, people have lived in “trust” groups of 15 or 20 with whom they hunted or traded; or with whom they had children. Even a casual look at patterns of life in villages and small towns shows us that this has not changed very much. Why? Because people are by nature clannish and tribal. The reason large groups of strangers (or any stranger at all) is viewed with suspicion is because we immediately feel threatened with disruption or wonder which way things might go. Since it is better policy to be safe than sorry we “wall” off the stranger or strangers.
Paul Salopek, who undertook to follow the “Road out of Eden” travelling from Africa on foot, outward into different parts of the world, was recently in India where he found the borders between India and Pakistan utterly artificial. True there were Hindus amongst Muslims on one side and Muslims among Hindus on the other, but “People on both sides are Punjabis. They grow the same crops, like the same music, eat the same foods and dress similarly.” Salopek also dwelt at some length on the sociology of walls and borders saying that if you travelled at great speed over geographic terrain in a car or train or plane you never really come into contact with people except in artificial environments like airports.
As Salopek travels from country to country, culture to culture, he finds people to be pretty much the same. “I don’t see colour or language any more. Whether it is a Bedouin nomad in Saudi Arabia, a photojournalist from Turkey or a brilliant scientist in Georgia, they all talk about the same things — family, jobs, governments, climate change, about what they have or do not have. Worries are the same; so are their hopes.” 
Erasing borders
 Geographical borders are fluid; they might change with war, policies or famines but the border that divides our inner and outer selves is the ultimate border that should really concern us. They are walls of prejudice, of ignorance, of fear and worst of all — pride in being all of these things. They give us a false sense of security and safety.
Possibly because the world seems to be shrinking with electronic communication creating a borderless world, the walls in the mind are gaining strength. Do we still surround ourselves with fences and walls? Of course we do and the invisible ones are the hardest to break down. Most people feel safe in communities that subscribe to the same beliefs and norms and right or wrong cling to the same patterns of social behaviour. Surely therefore the ultimate border is the human skin: the wall between the inner and the outer self which is the border we can’t seem to get rid of. All spiritual quests have been journeys of the mind to get through this final emotional frontier, the fence of the self. Surely ‘independence’ is to control strong personal prejudices and communicate meaningfully with the other.

Markets end in red on profit-booking; Sensex down 284 points
","A slew of macroeconomic factors and profit-booking pulled down the benchmark S&P BSE Sensex by 284 points to end at 22,403.89 this week.
Flat manufacturing growth, drop in core sector industries data, lower monsoon forecast and tensions mounting over Ukraine affected the sentiment.
The HSBC survey for April showed manufacturing sector remained ‘steady’ even as domestic demand made up for fall in exports.
Growth in eight core sector industries decelerated to 2.6 per cent in 2013—14, the lowest in almost a decade, said government data.
Investor worries over developments in Ukraine lingered on as the US has already announced some sanctions and has threatened to impose more economic sanctions on key sectors of Russia’s economy.
The Sensex resumed higher at 22,717.59 and moved in a range of 22,721.36 and 22,284.96 before ending the week at 22,403.89, disclosing a loss of 284.18 points, or 1.25 per cent.
The NSE 50-share Nifty also dropped by 87.95 points, or 1.30 per cent, to end at 6,694.80.
Shares of metal, capital goods, realty, power and auto sectors were the major losers during the week.
However, FIIs continued their buying spree by investing net Rs 1,869.45 crore, as per the data issued by SEBI, including the provisional figure of May 2.
Jignesh Chaudhary, Head of Research, Veracity Broking Services said, “The equity markets observed some correction in the week. The markets will also eye the earnings of some major bluechips.
“So this means that we might see some correction in the coming trading sessions. There was huge profit-booking observed in the entire trading week as investors took advantage of some outperformed stocks. The technical indicators are suggesting that the markets would be bullish in the coming week. Sensex is expected to trade in the range of 21,870 to 22,550 and CNX Nifty in the range of 6,520 to 6,750,” he added.
Major losers from the Sensex pack were Tata Steel (8.33 per cent), Hindalco Ind. (7.81 per cent), SSLT (6.57 per cent), Larsen (6.49 per cent), BHEL (5.45 per cent), Bajaj Auto (4.62 per cent), Bharti Airtel (4.50 per cent), Maruti Suzuki (3.61 per cent), NTPC (3.58 per cent), HUL (3.16 per cent), Gail India (2.45 per cent), Tata Motors (2.15 per cent), RIL (2.02 per cent), SBI (1.79 per cent), Coal India (1.52 per cent), HDFC Bank (1.29 per cent), M&M (1.28 per cent), ICICI Bank (1.38 per cent) and ITC (1.00 per cent).
However, Dr. Reddy’s Lab rose by 4.25 per cent, ONGC (2.41 per cent), Cipla (1.84 per cent), HDFC (1.76 per cent), Wipro (1.51 per cent), Infosys (1.43 per cent) and Sun Pharma (1.15 per cent).
Among the S&P BSE sectoral indices, Metal dropped by 5.68 per cent, followed by CG at 5.46 per cent, Realty (4.89 per cent), Power (3.44 per cent), Auto (2.30 per cent), Bankex (1.47 per cent) and FMCG (1.18 per cent).
However, Healthcare rose by 2.24 per cent.
Small-cap and Midcap indices also moved down by 0.85—0.22 per cent due to selling from retail investors.
The total market turnover at the BSE and NSE was Rs. 11,063.01 crore and Rs. 55,832.91 crore, respectively as against the last weekend’s level of Rs. 10,797.16 crore and Rs. 59,392.71 crore.

Maersk’s Mumbai records ‘highest load’ ","Maersk Line said one of its container vessels named after Mumbai set a ‘world record’ by achieving a load of 19,038 TEU, the highest-ever load so far, surpassing the 19,000-mark for the very first time — not only for a Maersk vessel, but also any vessel in the world.
Named after Mumbai
Mumbai Maersk, the second generation Triple-E vessel, left the dock of Tanjung Pelepas Port, Malaysia, over the past weekend and will now sail to Europe. The first stop is expected at Rotterdam on September 5. 
 The vessel, with a nominal capacity of 20,568 TEU, is the newest to enter the Triple-E fleet, in May 2018, and is deployed on the Asia-to-Europe service (AE5). 
“The world record load of 19,038 TEU has raised a new bar for Maersk by surpassing Madison Maersk, a first generation Triple-E class vessel, which reached 18,215 TEU in 2015,” Maersk Line said in a statement.
“At the same time, Mumbai Maersk overtakes all other reported record loadings from other carriers,” the company added in the statement. “The record-breaking load also marks a sign of progress on one of Maersk’s Core Priorities for this year: to make APM Terminals perform again,” Maersk Line said. “Tanjung Pelepas is one of the hub terminals where productivity is currently high, also benefiting Maersk Line in line with the integrator strategy,” it added.

Further rate increases best way to protect U.S. recovery: Fed’s Powell
","The Federal Reserve’s steady interest rate increases are the best way to protect the U.S. economic recovery and keep job growth as strong as possible and inflation under control, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said on Friday in a high-profile endorsement of the central bank’s current approach to policy.
Speaking just days after President Donald Trump criticised the U.S. central bank’s rate hikes, Mr. Powell used a research symposium here to “explain today why my colleagues and I believe that this gradual process...remains appropriate.”
“The economy is strong. Inflation is near our 2% objective, and most people who want a job are finding one... If the strong growth in income and jobs continues, further gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate will likely be appropriate.”
Mr. Powell’s comments were not a direct response to Mr. Trump’s criticism that he is “not thrilled” with the Fed raising rates as he is trying to stimulate economic growth. However, the Kansas City Fed’s annual conference is among the central bank’s higher profile annual events, drawing international media attention and an audience including representatives of other nations’ central banks.
The theme this year involves changes in market structure and Mr. Powell used that topic to elaborate on why shifts in concepts like the level of “full employment” and the neutral rate of interest justify gradual rate increases. He said Fed mistakes of the past, such as a misestimation of full employment that allowed inflation to take off in the 1970s, mean the central bank today should not assume its current estimates of those economic variables are precise.
The Fed “has been navigating between the shoals of overheating and premature tightening with only a hazy view of what seem to be shifting navigational guides,” Mr. Powell said. With unemployment so low, “why isn’t the (Federal Open Market Committee) tightening monetary policy more sharply to head off overheating and inflation? With no clear sign of an inflation problem, why is the FOMC tightening policy at all, at the risk of choking off job growth and continued expansion?”
The resolution, he said, is to move carefully.
“I see the current path of gradually raising interest rates as the FOMC’s approach to taking seriously both of these risks.”
The Fed is expected to raise rates in September, perhaps again in December, and continue what it terms “normalisation” into 2019.

Rangarajan says CAD to be around 2% of GDP
","India’s Current Account Deficit (CAD) is likely to be around 2 per cent of GDP in the coming few years due to slackening of gold imports, among other factors, Prime Minister’s Economic Advisory Council Chairman C Rangarajan said on Monday.
“With inflation showing signs of decline and gold prices also not rising, the attraction of gold as an asset is coming down. And as we go ahead we should find the demand for gold falling. There are also other factors contributing to improvement in exports. Therefore, I expect the current account deficit to remain around two per cent of the GDP over the years,” Dr. Rangarajan told reporters here on the sidelines of a programme organised by Centre for Economic and Social Studies.
Finance Minister P Chidambaram recently said the >CAD was brought down significantly to $ 32 billion in 2013-14 as against $ 88 billion during 2012-13 and fiscal deficit contained within the target in the last fiscal.
The CAD in 2012-13 was 4.7 per cent of GDP and in 2013-14 it will be only 1.7 per cent, the Finance Minister had said.
Replying to a query, he said administrative restrictions that were imposed on gold import may be relaxed as the prices of the yellow metal are stabilised.
“I think the restrictions that have been imposed administratively will be relaxed. I think the import of gold will come down because of the natural factors like inflation coming down, and gold prices not rising and the attraction of gold as an asset will come down. That’s what reflects in the reduction of gold import,” he said.
Gold and silver imports contracted by 40 per cent to $33.46 billion in 2013-14, or just seven per cent of the total import bill, against 11 per cent in the earlier fiscal, after the government put in place steps to check runaway gold imports.
On the reported likely El Nino effect on the country’s GDP, Dr. Rangarajan said “We do not know what the ultimate impact will be. Sometimes these forecasts also will go wrong. So we will have to wait and see“.
Recent reports predicted inflation in India may remain sticky in the current financial year as a >possible El Nino effect on the monsoon is likely to push up food prices and geopolitical uncertainties are likely to pump up global commodity rates.

Bajaj Allianz Life to add focus on big cities, unveil two ULIPs
","Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance Company Ltd. plans to increase its focus on large cities, changing a hitherto pursued strategy of selling insurance to a mass-based population mainly in the non-metro cities.
MD & CEO Tarun Chugh said in an interaction that the company was unveiling two Unit Linked Insurance Plans (ULIPs) with features like “return of mortality charges”, which would enable a policyholder to get back this charge, which is the cost paid by the insured towards the life cover. 
In ULIP, such ‘cost of life’ cover is called mortality charge and is deducted for all customers through the policy term, according to the company. Indicating that such ‘returns’ were unique in the industry, Mr. Chugh said: “We are making our ULIPs more attractive with very strong value proposition for our customers.” Mortality charge is typically linked with a policyholder’s age, gender and sum-at-risk. 
Similar to bonus
The firm will add these amounts (like bonuses) to the customer’s maturity amount, encouraging them to stay invested. 
Mr. Chugh also announced a goal-based savings policy — a ULIP for customers with an appetite for the equities market. With these products targeted at city-based equity-savvy people, the insurer aims to increase its presence in cities. “While earlier we were present in rented and owned properties in 632 branches, we have now begun buying properties in metros,” he said adding that the company already held properties in Kolkata, Mumbai and Delhi among other cities. 
The company is a JV of Bajaj Finserve Ltd. and Allianze SE. It started operations in 2001 and has 3.4% share of the market.

Mechanisation in cotton harvest to boost cost saving
","Karuppusamy has sown cotton on three acres of his farmnear Udumalpet in Tamil Nadu. The farmer expects to start picking cotton in December. Two years ago, Karuppusamy would employ more than 40 workers an acre during harvest season, paying almost ₹250 per worker. 
Last year, he purchased a “kapas plucking machine.” It cost him ₹4,250 with an equal sum coming in as subsidy.
The machine does the job of three workers, the cotton comes without trash (dry leaves, etc.), and only fully bloomed cotton flowers are picked, he said about the advantages of using the mechanical plucker.
Subsidy support
 The Southern India Mills’ Association Cotton Development and Research Association (SIMA-CDRA) joined hands with Point Industries to develop the machine and unveiled it in June 2015. In 2016, the Tamil Nadu Government gave 50% subsidy for 150 machines. Last year, the Cotton Corporation of India gave 100% subsidy for 300 machines. It was distributed to farmers in Warangal, Ahmedabad, and Akola. The corporation plans to support the sale of 10,000 machines under the proposed Technology Mission on Cotton.
This year, the Tamil Nadu Government recently said it would provide 50% subsidy under the National Agriculture Development Programme of the Union government for the sale of 7,000 machines. It is expected to provide 50% subsidy for another 7,000 machines under its own schemes.
Cotton is grown on 124.44 lakh hectares in the country by almost 23 million farmers. Most of the farmers have one to five acres. However, mechanical plucking of cotton is done by less than 1% of them. This is just making a beginning, says K. Selvaraju, secretary general, SMA-CDRA.
A few Chinese machines were imported and used by farmers in the Gujarat belt. Plucking machines were made by a few private manufacturers too. However, their usage did not pick up mainly because of lack of user-friendly technology, he added.The government should support development and sale of these machines by providing GST exemption and subsidies for purchase of the implement. The state governments should also extend financial support, he said.

CPI inflation quickens to 4-month high
","Retail inflation accelerated to a four-month high in May as quickening food and fuel costs lifted the Consumer Price Index (CPI) based reading to 4.87%, official data released on Tuesday showed.
The acceleration in price gains in May, a second straight month when the headline reading has risen, followed April’s 4.58% pace. 
The food and beverages segment saw inflation accelerating to 3.37% in May, from 3% in April, while inflation in the fuel and light segment at 5.8%, compared with 5.16% in the previous month.
“Retail inflation took another leap on anticipated lines and realised RBI fears of a further upswing, basis which the key policy rate was hiked by 25 basis points in the latest monetary policy meet,” Anis Chakravarty, Lead Economist and Partner at Deloitte India, wrote in a note.
 “Pass through of fuel prices largely led to surge in inflation while core inflation added to pricing pressures with broad based movement recorded across miscellaneous category, especially across travel expenses, education, and health.”
The overall miscellaneous segment in the CPI saw inflation quickening to 5.35% in May, from 4.96% in April.
Monsoon rains crucial
“Food prices also showed some increase... especially fruits and vegetables,” Mr. Chakravarty wrote. “However, they can be expected to stabilise on monsoon cues while core inflation can be expected to see further expansion if input costs remain on elevated levels.”
Oil prices are also expected to remain elevated for some time, which will continue exerting upward pressure on inflation, he added.
“In the immediate future, oil prices are expected to move between $80-85 a barrel,” D.K. Srivastava, Chief Policy Advisor at EY India, said. “So, they will be under pressure for at least one quarter, and this will have an effect. Food inflation is seasonality bound. Once the rains start, vegetable prices will come down and I would expect this inflation to moderate from mid-July onwards.”
Inflation in the pan, tobacco and intoxicants category quickened marginally to 8% in May, from 7.91% in April. 
The clothing and footwear segment saw inflation accelerating to 5.47%, from 5.11% in the preceding month.
Housing was the sole category where inflation reflected a deceleration, albeit marginally, from April’s 8.5% pace to 8.4% in May.

An index to determine the value of coal blocks
","Major changes in the coal block auction system have been suggested by the high-powered committee set up last year to review the current process.
The recommendations, submitted this month, rest on four tenets — ensuring transparency and fairness, equity, early development of coal blocks and simplicity of implementation of the recommendations. These suggestions coincide with the opening up of the coal sector for commercial mining.
The proposed changes aim at introducing flexibility in the number of bidders, penalties for defaulting on milestones (and revoking bank guarantees), project execution, and relaxation to captive miners to sell some of the coal in the market. The panel has recommended developing a Coal Index for determining the value of blocks and a revenue-sharing model with the States. Currently, the valuation is on the basis of the notified price of Coal India Ltd. 
The committee has suggested scrapping the current practice of cancelling an auction if the number of bidders drop below three, saying that a single-bid should be accepted if biddings failed to find eligible bidders, provided the offered price was benchmarked to the reserve price. In the previous auctions, majority of the blocks could not be allocated as the number of eligible bidders was less than three.
The number of milestones are now eight versus 20 earlier, with the panel suggesting that only a default in achieving critical milestones should attract penalty against the earlier penalty for each default.
Shift from current system
If accepted, the changes would mark a major shift in the current system which was put in place after the cancellation of 204 coal-block allocations and introducing a system of auctioning the mineral blocks. Triggering euphoria and intense competition since their introduction, the e-auctions failed to sustain interest after several blocks were taken at high prices. Even companies which bought the blocks found it cheaper to import coal to meet their requirements rather than developing the mines.
There were no takers for subsequent blocks, forcing the Centre to do a rethink. The Expert Committee to ‘report on the challenges faced by the current auction system and recommend changes’ was headed by Pratyush Sinha with bureaucrats, ex-bureaucrats and one ex-chairperson each from the SBI and the Union Bank. Jayanta Roy, senior VP and group head — corporate sector ratings, ICRA, said production from the captive mines which were auctioned had remained lower than their pre-auction output. “Aggressive bids by some of the bidders during auctions, subsequent decline in coal prices in international markets as well as in e-auctions, and weak financial health of some of the coal-block winning companies are other reasons for slower ramp-up of production from these mines,” he said.
Absence of end-use condition in the guidelines is a significant positive for commercial miners, who were not eligible to participate in the coal-mine auctions conducted in 2015, he said. However, given the issues related to land acquisition and regulatory clearances, production levels from private commercial miners are not expected to rise significantly in the short- to medium term, he said.

","The rupee weakened further on Thursday, closing past the 69-mark against the dollar for the first time ever as foreign funds continued to stream out of emerging markets on expectations of higher U.S. interest rates. 
The rupee slid 43 paise to close at 69.05 on a day when most Asian currencies weakened against the dollar. The rupee’s biggest single-day fall since May 29, with the currency touching an intraday low of 69.07, was marked by the absence of central bank intervention, dealers said. The RBI sold $12 billion in May in the spot and forward markets to slow the pace of the rupee’s fall. The Indian currency is the worst performer in Asia this year, having lost over 8%.
The previous all-time closing low was on July 5, when it ended at 68.95. The rupee had hit 69.09 intraday on June 28, its lowest ever, before recovering on suspected RBI intervention.
Buoyant greenback
The dollar rose to a one-year high against a basket of currencies as investors raised bets on the currency in the wake of upbeat comments on the U.S. economy by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell.
A no-trust motion moved by opposition parties against the NDA government also weighed on the rupee and stocks. 
 The 30-share Sensex closed at 36,351.23, down 22.21 points. On the BSE, more than 1,800 stocks ended in the red as against less than 800 gainers. The broader indices like the BSE Midcap and the BSE Smallcap fell more than the benchmarks as investors remained wary about the side counters. Foreign investors have continued their selling spree in July with net sales of ₹616 crore after pulling out almost ₹4,900 crore in the previous month.

Munoth Industries to set up lithium-ion cell plant in A.P.
","Chennai-based Munoth Industries on Wednesday announced setting up of a Lithium-ion cell manufacturing plant, said to be the first in India, at an investment of ₹799 crore. The plant, which would target the mobile phone industry in the first phase, would come up in Tirupati, Andhra Pradesh. 
The first phase of the project will be operational by March 2019 and the second and third phases by 2022. 
Munoth Industries was earlier involved in distribution of mobile phones, but is now focusing efforts on manufacturing Lithium-ion cell, said MD Vikas Munoth. 
He added that in the first phase the company had invested ₹165 crore, in which it would get a subsidy of about ₹25 crore each from the Centre and the State under different schemes. 
The plant is expected to generate employment for about 1,700 people. The MD said in the first phase the company was targeting a capacity of 2 lakh Ah, which would be increased to 5 lakh Ah in the second phase and then to 10 lakh Ah. 
Consumption levels
“The current consumption of batteries is about 400-450 million per annum for mobile phones, including replacement, and about 100 million/annum for power banks,” said Pankaj Mahindroo, national president, Indian Cellular Association. 
Munoth Industries chairman Jaswant Munoth said the company was targeting a market share of about 6% of the total number of batteries consumed in the mobile phone industry in the first phase of production. 
The company has partnered Better Power Company, a China-based firm, for the technology to manufacture lithium-ion cells in India, said Mr. Vikas Munoth.

‘Security budgets of Indian companies have tripled’ ","Indian companies are investing more on securing their data rather than pumping more money into technology as they try to build comprehensive solutions to prevent hackers from attacking their network, said Sanjai Gangadharan, regional director SAARC of A10 Networks.
“IT budgets are shrinking and security budgets are going up,” Mr. Gangadharan said in an interview. “Security investments or budgets in India have doubled or even tripled. There are now security departments under a chief information officer, chief security officer or a risk officer, which are being allocated a lot of budgets. IT budgets are shrinking because it is mostly pay-as-you-go model now, and there is less capital expenditure required. “Also, overall costs are coming down. Here, the device cost may come down, but the need for building an overall solution which has more components, and upgrading it with more features and functionalities, that is on the rise.”
Global spending on information security products and services will reach more than $114 billion in 2018, an increase of 12.4% from last year, according to an August 16 report from Gartner, Inc.
In 2019, the market is forecast to grow 8.7% to $124 billion. Privacy concerns, persisting skills shortages and regulatory changes such as EU’s Global Data Protection Regulation are the main drivers, said Siddharth Deshpande, research director at Gartner.
A recent attack on Singapore Health Services (SingHealth) network compromised personal health records of 1.5 million patients in the island and reinforced the need to view sensitive data and IT systems as critical infrastructure, he said. A10 Networks, a New York Stock Exchange-listed cybersecurity firm, providing networking and security solutions, is headquartered in San Jose. “Today everybody has realised that PCs, servers, networks, applications have all become commoditised. One can go and pick any of it up, very easily. Now what all this generates is a huge amount of data. This data belongs to the enterprise. “And the security of this data, in terms of who should access this data, where should it be accessed from, where should it be stored, all of this will always be the decision of the enterprise. So what will remain with the enterprise is two things — one is the storage of data, how to store the data, where to store it and in what form, and the second is how to keep this information secure.
“This data becomes information once it is processed, so how to secure this information in terms of security at rest and security while the data is in motion. So for both storage and security of data, the decision will be that of the enterprise and will always remain so. This will not go out of the enterprise. So, investments in these two areas will happen consistently,” Mr. Gangadharan said. He cited an example of an Australian bag manufacturer who made expensive handbags for women. A customer could buy the bags only by invitation. “But, the problem they faced is that the day a product releases on the market, China makes a copy of the same and sells. They wanted to know the leak point. For this, when they dug deep to find out how this was happening, they realised that it was happening from inside the organisation itself.
Someone in the company was leaking the information via email. They ended up plugging the issue.” “This is a threat, and these kinds of issues could happen to anyone. In this case, their exclusivity of having an invitation-based purchase was lost when copies started mushrooming in the market. These are ways in which organisations could lose their reputation.”

FASTags aim to quicken pace of journey through toll booths
","Less than two years after the government introduced the radio frequency identification device (RFID)-based FASTag system for vehicles crossing toll gates on the country’s highway network, 26 lakh cars and trucks now use the windscreen-mounted tags to shorten their journey time.
According to the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways officials, FASTag users can experience ‘near’ non-stop movement at 405 of the 479 toll plazas on various national highways.
This is how the device works – the tag with a quick response (QR) code and an identification number is affixed to the windscreen of a vehicle. The tag is linked to a user’s FASTag account with the bank of his or her choice. 
When a vehicle approaches a toll plaza on a national highway, it can use dedicated FASTag lanes to avoid stopping to pay a toll tax. However, the technology being currently used in India still requires one to slow down to a speed of 10 km per hour as the toll plaza antennae has a range of only six metres.
Once the vehicle passes through a toll booth, the user receives an SMS alert regarding the charge debited to his or her account. To encourage the use of FASTags, the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) refunds 5% of the total monthly transactions.
Lack of RFID lanes
 But some users say that the promise of seamless travel is only in theory and the ground reality is very different. 
“Many plazas don’t have a dedicated lane for RFID tags, which means that one still has to wait in a queue along with other vehicles which need to stop to make cash transaction,” said Naveen Kumar Gupta, secretary general, All India Motor Transport Congress.
“What we need is free flow of vehicles which will take our average of 300 kms per 12 hours to about 800 kms, resulting in an increase in return on investment for transporters as well as bringing down logistics cost. Also, at many places RFID readers don’t work because concessionaires are not keen to switch to the new technology. We need a system that will allow movement which is free of human interventions, lanes as well as boom barriers,” he said.
Biggest users
 Trucks and taxis account for the biggest users of FASTags unlike personal car owners whose movement is most likely to be restricted to city limits.
Ministry sources acknowledge the challenges faced by the users and say that with advancement of technology they are hopeful that in coming years the country’s highways could see free flow multi-lane plazas allowing a vehicle to zip through at higher speeds similar to some foreign countries.
Officials are also enthused by the data on the use of FASTags. They say that the RFID card has seen an average uptake of two lakh vehicles per month and their use currently accounts for 12.5% or five lakh transactions of the total 40 lakh transactions recorded per day at all toll booths across the country.
The value of these transactions is higher, at 25% of the total toll collected — ₹15 crore out of ₹60 crore garnered per day —which points to a larger number of heavy vehicles availing the service as the toll paid by them amounts to seven to eight times that of cars.
While the device was rolled out in April 2016, the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways made it mandatory from December 1, 2017 for all new cars and trucks to be fitted with a FASTag before they were sold. But, the use of these smart cards is not mandatory yet. 
The Ministry has also proposed to make FASTag compulsory for all commercial vehicles seeking a national permit.

Gold declines on subdued demand, silver ends steady
","Gold prices declined by Rs 30 to Rs 30,680 per 10 grams in the national capital on Monday on slackened demand at prevailing higher levels even as the yellow metal extended gains in the overseas markets.
On the other hand, silver held steady at Rs 42,700 per kg on scattered buying support from industrial units and coin makers.
Traders said fall in demand from retailers at current levels led to decline in gold prices but a firming trend overseas — escalating tension in Ukraine boosted demand for a safe haven — limited the downside.
Globally, gold rose as much as 0.7 per cent to $1,308.91 an ounce, the highest level since April 15 in Singapore.
In Delhi, gold of 99.9 and 99.5 per cent purity declined by Rs 30 each to Rs 30,680 and Rs 30,480 per 10 grams, respectively. It had surged by Rs 320 in the last trade.
Sovereign, however, found some local buying and traded higher by Rs 50 to Rs 25,150 per piece of eight grams.

Growers happy as arecanut prices more than double in a year
","Arecanut prices have more than doubled in a year bringing cheer to growers. Factors such as gutka ban and the rumours on a possible ban on arecanut itself have not affected the optimistic mood prevailing in the market.
D.B. Shankarappa, director, Shimoga Arecanut Merchants’ Association, told The Hindu that the decision taken by the Centre to hike the minimum import price of arecanut and the decline in production owing to climatic changes were the reasons for the sharp increase in the prices.
The price of rashi, idi, api and chali varieties of arecanut, which was around Rs. 130 a kg during the same period last year, is now Rs. 320 a kg. The price of saraku variety that was around Rs. 180 a kg last year is being traded at Rs. 370 now.
The Central government decided on May 13 last year to hike the minimum import price of arecanut from Rs. 75 to Rs. 110 a kg. This decision triggered an upward movement in the prices of locally grown arecanut. The prices of rashi, idi, api and chali varieties that was at Rs. 130 a kg in the first week of May last year reached Rs. 180 a kg by the end of the month.
The growers were under the apprehension that the prices might crash following the decision taken by the State government on May 31, 2013, to ban gutka. However, after the ban, gutka entered the market in a new avatar.
As mixing of arecanut with tobacco was banned, firms engaged in the production of gutka began selling arecanut and tobacco in separate pouches. Even after the ban, the prices continued to rise. The prices of rashi, idi, api and chali varieties reached Rs. 210 a kg by the first week of August and remained stable for six months after.
In September 2013, Union Ministry for Health and Family Welfare wrote to the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India to examine the scientific evidences on the harmful effects of arecanut on human health, with a view to classify it as an injurious substance and prohibit its use as an ingredient in food products.
A section of growers saw this as a first step to ban arecanut. The protests and debates that happened in January this year over the issue again led to the concern that the prices may fall. Interestingly, the prices remained insulated from these developments. The prices of arecanut began to move northwards again from the first week of February this year.
Owing to heavy rain that lashed the Malnad region and coastal Karnataka in the 2013 monsoon, more than 50 per cent of arecanut plantations were infected with kole roga, also known as fruit rot disease. The yield declined by more than 30 per cent resulting in a mismatch between the demand and supply for arecanut, owing to which the prices increased since February. Arecanut merchants here anticipate a further increase of 10 per cent in the prices by the end of this month.

Bescom to outsource ‘preventive’ maintenance of equipment
","Though Bangalore Electricity Supply Company (Bescom) has been plagued by reports of its equipment posing danger to its consumers, only emergency maintenance was being undertaken. In fact, Bescom officials have earlier admitted that less than one per cent of its budget is spent on equipment maintenance. And, ‘maintenance work’ generally meant pruning of tree branches and such other work.
Now, the power utility is looking at getting assistance from a third party. Bescom has called for tenders for undertaking ‘preventive maintenance’.
Bescom Managing Director Pankaj Kumar Pandey told The Hindu that the preventive maintenance work, once entrusted to an agency, will be implemented in areas coming under Bruhat Bangalore Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) and surrounding urban areas.
The tender would be granted to an agency by May-end, and the contract will be on the incentive-penalty basis, Mr. Pandey said.
“The third party will be entrusted with the task of ensuring that all equipment is in good shape in the first six months of the contract. All repairs and maintenance of oil level in electricity transformers will be done by them. After this, we will see if we can entrust the task of regular maintenance of all Bescom equipment to them,” Mr. Pandey said.
Soon after the maintenance work is undertaken, a board will be put up on the transformer with information such as the date on which it was done and the date on which the next maintenance work is due.
Apart from this, the agency will also undertake maintenance of high-tension lines and ring main units as well.
Mr. Pankaj Kumar Pandey said that soon the power utility’s new helpline number 1912 will become functional. He said they had requested the government to approve an easy-to-remember helpline number instead of 22873333, so the four-digit number has been given.

Rupee gains 44 paise against dollar
","The rupee snapped a four-week losing streak and recovered by 44 paise to close at three-week high of 60.16 against the US dollar following fresh selling of the American currency by exporters and some banks amid sustained capital inflows despite weak local stocks.
The forex market was closed on Thursday on account of “Maharashtra Day”.
At the Interbank Foreign Exchange (Forex) market, the domestic unit commenced slightly lower at 60.62 per dollar from last weekend’s close of 60.60 and dropped further to 60.76 on month-end dollar demand from importers amid a weak local equity market.
But, later it bounced back to 60.09 before ending the week at 60.16, showing a rise of 44 paise, or 0.73 per cent.
In the last four-weeks, it had lost 69 paise, or 1.15 per cent.
The benchmark S&P BSE Sensex closed the week down by 284.18 points, or 1.25 per cent, while FIIs infused $245.24 million on the first three days of the week, as per SEBI data.
Pramit Brahmbhatt, Veracity Group CEO, said,” The rupee appreciated during the week. Corporate inflows and exporters selling dollars helped it to trade strong against the dollar.
Now the next psychological support for the dollar-rupee pair is at 59.80 levels. The trading range for the spot dollar-rupee pair is expected to be within 59.60 to 60.80.”
The benchmark six-month forward dollar premium payable in October closed the week at 225—1/2—227—1/2 paise. Far-forward contracts maturing in April, 2015 ended at 456—458 paise.
The RBI fixed the reference rate for the dollar at 60.2250 and for the euro at 83.4590 from 61.1163 and 84.5220, respectively.
The rupee recovered against the pound sterling to end at 101.49 from last weekend’s close of 101.88 and also firmed up against euro to finish at 83.38 from 83.85.
However, it bounced back against the Japanese currency to close at 58.72 per 100 yen from preceding weekend’s close of 59.38.

WhatsApp updates privacy policy, terms of use ahead of payments service launch "," WhatsApp, which is testing its payments services in India, on Saturday said it is updating its terms of service and privacy policy to “reflect the addition of payment interoperability features” ahead of the full-fledged launch of the service.
 Almost one million people are “testing” WhatsApp’s payments service in India, which is the largest base for the Facebook-owned company that has over 1.5 billion users globally. WhatsApp has over 200 million users in India.
“We’ll be updating our WhatsApp payments Terms of Service and Privacy Policy to provide simpler language on how the payments feature operates. It also reflects the addition of payment interoperability features we’ve added since the beta started,” a WhatsApp spokesperson told PTI.
 The spokesperson added that the company has worked closely with National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), bank partners, and the Indian government on these details of how its service works.
 WhatsApp had received permission from NPCI to tie up with banks to facilitate financial transactions via Unified Payments Interface (UPI).
“We still do not have a launch date but this terms and policy update bring us one step closer to full launch,” the spokesperson said but declined to comment on the launch date of the service.
 WhatsApp payment service, which rivals the likes of Paytm, has been in beta testing over the last few months. Industry watchers expect the full-fledged launch in the next few weeks.
 As part of the updated terms, WhatsApp said it may collect additional information when payments service is used.
“We’ve added new features like interoperability that request additional information (related to) WhatsApp payments user and user of any BHIM UPI-enabled app,” the spokesperson said.
 The terms state that WhatsApp collects information “when you send, receive, or request a payment, including the date and time and reference transaction number”. Also, when someone makes a payment to a WhatsApp contact, the company collects the sender and receiver’s names and BHIM UPI IDs.
 The company added that it uses “all the information we have to operate, provide, improve, understand, customise, support, and market our services.”
“This includes using the information to provide payments and customer support, to protect you and others using our services from fraud, abuse, or other misconduct, and to review your account activity to determine whether you continue to meet our Terms and Payments Terms,” it added.
 It also outlined that the company works with “the other Facebook companies to provide payments, including to send payment instructions to PSPs (payment service providers)“.
Paytm founder Vijay Shekhar Sharma had earlier this year alleged that WhatsApp’s UPI payment platform has security risks for consumers and is not in compliance with the guidelines.
 The Reserve Bank of India has mandated all payment system operators to ensure that data related to payments is stored only in India giving firms six months to comply with it.
 According to sources, the ministry of electronics and IT has asked NPCI to check if WhatsApp’s payments service conforms with the RBI rules and data security of customers.
 They added that NPCI has been asked to check that all compliances are in place before the US-based messaging app is allowed to scale up its services.
 WhatsApp had stated that sensitive user data such as the last 6 digits of a debit card and UPI PIN are not stored at all.
 While it admitted to using the infrastructure of Facebook for the service, it asserted that the parent firm does not use payment information for commercial purpose.
“Facebook processes UPI transaction data as a service provider for WhatsApp, and does not use WhatsApp payments transaction data for commercial purposes,” the spokesperson had clarified.
 Concerns have been growing around security of consumer data on various online social media platforms, especially after the data breach incident at Facebook where data of about 87 million users globally (rpt) globally were harvested illegally by data analytics and political consultancy firm Cambridge Analytica.

Sowing traditional seeds for future harvest ","For S. Sultan Ahamed Kabir of Tirumalairayar Pattinam in Karaikal of the Union Territory of Puducherry, this is the third generation’s tryst with farming. But he has transformed agriculture from a vocation to feed people into a mission to conserve seeds of traditional paddy varieties for posterity. In the last 12 years, he has grown about 80 varieties of traditional paddy.
Inspired by the words of green crusader G. Nammalvar who said that the seed was a mighty weapon in the hands of the farmer, Mr. Kabir’s quest for traditional varieties began in 2006. 
To sow 108 varieties
 Wide travel, intense interaction with farmers and valuable inputs from farm scientists resulted in more than 10 varieties reaching him. He started raising them in his own farm at Tirumalairayar Pattinam and two other farms at Kulithalai and Chengalpattu. Today, the number has crossed 80. He plans to begin the ensuing sowing season in August with 108 varieties.
“I do not sell paddy. I convert only a portion of the harvest into rice for my livelihood. My focus is on the major portion which will supply seeds,” says Kabir, sitting in his hut on the banks of the Tirumalairayar river. His farm practices include non-use of fertilisers and pesticides, hand sowing and harvesting. He adopts green practices of Mr. Nammalvar to allow the soil to rejuvenate on its own and the crop to retain its quality. When it rains heavily, he also resorts to methods followed in boro rice cultivation in the north east and Bangladesh.
 He takes care not to mix varieties when more than one is ready for harvest. “I want to ensure that purity of a particular variety is not compromised,” he says, He has two small storage facilities for ‘feed’ and ‘seed.’
The varieties raised by him include karuppu kavuni, karunkuruvai, vellai ponni, seeraga samba, mappillai samba, kaala namak, iluppaipoo samba, thooya malli and Attur kichadi sambapoonkar arupatham kuruvai. He claims that he had succeeded so far by adopting scientific farming methods in tune with the local climate. “Though these traditional varieties can be raised any time, the local climate determines the yield. The deciding factors for a good harvest are climate, soil health and water availability,” Another progressive farmer, G. Sither of Thanjavur, points out that only traditional paddy varieties display a characteristic to adapt to the micro climate.
Mr. Kabir says that there is a growing demand for traditional varieties, primarily for their medicinal properties. He usually barters seeds with fellow farmers from all over Tamil Nadu and Puducherry. Another way of popularising native varieties among farmers is through festivals and community gatherings. Each farmer is given two kg of seeds free on these occasions. Mr. Kabir also participates as resource person in lectures and workshops to popularise traditional varieties under the Agricultural Technology Management Agency of the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University.

GDPR: travel industry can be the beacon
"," The European Union’s (EU) General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has been active since May, and while many large multinationals are already GDPR-compliant, some smaller players, including many small and mid-sized Indian companies, are not. 
A legitimate reason is that GDPR’s regulations are only applicable if the company has a presence, offers goods or services, or monitors individuals’ behaviours in the European Union. A number of Indian firms are experiencing high growth, and are beginning to explore opportunities globally. It’s critical they prepare for the obligations of a multinational organisation, and for those that do intend to conduct business within Europe, that they have prepared themselves to be GDPR-compliant.
Their existing privacy policies must be enhanced to meet stricter regulatory obligations of the global marketplace such as GDPR. For companies conducting business in Europe that fail to meet these standards, they risk fines of up to €20 million, or 4% of annual revenue for the fiscal, whichever is higher.
For the new kids on the block — India’s future global corporations — regulatory requirements may prove to be an early stumbling block if they’re not sufficiently prepared.
‘Business as usual’
For many of our clients, particularly local Indian firms looking to expand globally, GDPR is a hot topic. For us, as a global travel management company, GDPR, and other such data security regulations are typically considered ‘business as usual’. For, there have always been high expectations regarding data protection for travel companies, based on the highly sensitive information that we manage. Additionally, our roots as a bank holding company, and as the only travel management company which adheres to the Binding Corporate Rules, put us in a strong position to meet the GDPR requirements from the outset.
India’s growth sectors such as retail, banking, insurance and telecom are key areas where global expansion will likely require GDPR compliance. The travel industry’s experience in data security can provide tremendous benefit to those who are still finding their way. A few tips here:
Companies should create a robust data inventory to ensure that they are effectively and transparently communicating their data processing activities. They should put in place a regular internal audits process.
Second, companies should educate employees and provide training around privacy and security awareness. 
Finally, any business with European partners must understand its data protection obligations, especially any contractual obligations which relate to the way personal data is handled. European businesses will require their Indian partners to put in place new mechanisms to ensure any personal data transferred between them meets the GDPR’s requirements.

Gold council to aid exports on the anvil
"," The Centre has decided to set up a Domestic Council for Gold to aid exports of jewellery and to create an ecosystem to harness the true potential for jewellery-making in the country.
Commerce Minister Suresh Prabhu said the council would work towards industry development, job creation, building of regional clusters and strengthening of value chains. He was speaking at the 44th India Gem & Jewellery Awards 2017 organised by the Gem and Jewellery Export Promotion Council (GJEPC), in Mumbai on Saturday.
“This council will represent all the jewellers of India who will be the electoral college. They will form different interest groups and elect those who will sit in the council,” he said, adding the council would provide domestic support for exports. 
“Every village has a jeweller who makes handmade and custom-made jewellery. These artisans will be helped by jewellery designers to come out with products with better value, which will be ultimately exported by big companies,” he said. “We want to develop such a model,” he added. The Minister said that GJEPC and the Centre were working together to formulate a strategy to achieve the desired objective.
‘To address concerns’
A Coordination Committee will be set up comprising senior officials of the Ministry and the gem and jewellery industry, who will meet monthly to ensure that industry concerns are addressed on priority. The first meeting of the committee will be held on August 1.
Even as the gem and jewellery sector is rocked by the Nirav Modi scam, the Minister said that the genuine credit needs of the industry must be met by the banking sector. “Exports is a strategic issue. It is a priority for India but not [marked for] priority sector lending for the banking sector. This is a complete paradox. I have asked RBI Governor to treat exports as priority sector [for] lending.”
He added that India’s exports in 2017-18 were the highest in six years, and exports had been growing at a higher rate the last few months. He said that if this trend continued, India may be able to register record exports growth in 2018-19.

‘SBI on course to becoming profitable’
","State Bank of India (SBI) chairman Rajnish Kumar on Friday said the bank has put its house in order and will like to pursue 10% growth in advances this fiscal, including through some good corporate lending opportunities.
“The field is wide open for State Bank, we have the capability to give small loans and large ticket size loans,” the head of the country’s largest lender told reporters after participating in SBI Hyderabad circle’s CSR programmes.
Corporate lending
 Post the process improvement undertaken in the last quarter, particularly around stressed asset management, the bank, he said, was now in a position to revive corporate lending. “In doing so, we do not want to compromise on asset quality... mindful [of] having suffered so much in the past,” he said.
SBI, which had in the June quarter reported a net loss of ₹4,876 crore on the back of higher provisioning, was on course to definitely turning profitable this fiscal, he said. “Hopefully from September itself the bank should [return] to profitability,” Mr. Kumar said.
This, he explained, was on account of the bank doing a lot of provisioning for bad loans, upfront in March quarter as well as in June. “The intent is take the blows upfront and from September onwards, start returning to normal.” SBI had made a provisioning of ₹70,000 crore in 2017-18 and ₹55,000 crore in the preceding year. 
Consumer loans
Stating that a 10% growth this fiscal, given SBI’s portfolio of ₹20 lakh crore, would translate into ₹2 lakh crore, Mr. Kumar said the lending pattern at present was driven by consumer loans while a good pickup was visible in SME loans. Cement, road, steel, automobile and auto components, oil and gas, renewable energy are some sectors expected to revive corporate lending, he said in response to a query. 
Resolution of cases, either those before the NCLT or the stressed power assets, was bound to reflect on profit. On stressed power assets, he said work with the other lenders to complete the process of resolution for seven of the accounts, worth ₹17,000 crore for SBI, was likely to be completed next week.
“The intent of the lenders is very clear. The process is almost complete... it means there are buyers for these assets. Price discovery has happened... technical evaluation is complete and what remains is the documentation part of the lenders.”
In most cases, there is a buyer and these assets will be sold. The benchmark that has emerged is ₹3 crore per mega watt, he said.

India, emerging markets need to increase investments
","The global economy has shown signs of strengthening over the past few months and the emerging markets like India need to increase investments, especially in infrastructure, to revive growth, >Finance Minister P Chidambaram said on Sunday.
Speaking at the first business session of the 47th Annual Meeting of ADB Board of Governors in Astana (Kazakhstan), Mr. Chidambaram also stressed upon the need to increase resources of the Asian Development Bank for lending, an official statement said.
“Policies to revive growth in most emerging markets, including India, will have to be rooted in increasing investments, particularly in infrastructure. As most emerging markets are resource constrained, it would be necessary to have recourse to foreign savings for investment,” he said.
There is, however a need to ensure that the flows to emerging markets are broadly stable, he said, adding that the best option would be investment flows with a preference for FDI, followed by a hierarchy of other sources weighed against the cost of such dependence.
“The world economy is a little better placed now than a year ago. Global recovery appears to have strengthened in the recent months. However, we are yet to reach a stage where we can make a medium term forecast of a moderate growth,” Mr. Chidambaram said.
According to him, in the emerging markets that have large net exports, the slowing of growth is due to weakness in advanced economies and there is a need in these markets to rebalance to domestic sources of growth.
In economies not so dependent on exports, there are various other factors, some local, other global, which require more deft handling and international cooperation, he added.
On increasing lending resources of ADB, >Mr. Chidambaram said: “We firmly believe that the fundamental solution for enhancing sustainable level of lending (SLL) to a more meaningful level lies in increasing the capital stock of the bank.
“We appreciate that in a multilateral institution consensus building for major initiatives are necessary. I urge the management to make serious and sincere efforts to augment capital of the bank.”
Of late, ADB has been confronting challenges of portfolio performance and declining disbursements, and 2013 witnessed decline in disbursements under OCR, particularly under sovereign operations, he added.
“Net resource transfer, which is our net financial support to members declined to its lowest level in at least last five years to just over $ 100 million,” >the Finance Minister said.
On the issue of revival of growth, Mr. Chidambaram said ADB being the bank of the region must “respond to these growing expectations”.
“It is only natural that we feel closest to ADB and are most comfortable partnering with them. Our vision and aims converge. A healthy and growing ADB is in the best interest of the region and its people,” he added.
He said the banks’ midterm review of Strategy 2020 is trying to “rightly” shift the focus on implementation and disbursements. Average delay in completion of successful projects is 2.3 years with one-sixth of projects getting delayed by over 4 years.
“This underscores the need for internal reforms, re-engineering of business processes and delegation and decentralisation,” Mr. Chidambaram added.
Procurement reforms are the most needed, he said, adding that there must be focus on deploying staff resources with authority to regional departments and Resident Missions, increased delegation of authority to country offices, progressively higher use of e-procurement, post review of small contracts, robust oversight and well defined timelines for end-to-end processed.
On ABD’s role in India, he said: “While contribution of ADB to India remains small, it nevertheless is quite important.”
Mr. Chidambaram further said: “I am happy to note that as agreed in the South Asia Sub-regional Economic Cooperation (SASEC) platform we negotiated $500 million assistance from ADB for building roads in North-eastern states for regional connectivity.”
ADB is also assisting India in developing the East Coast Corridor from Chennai to Kolkata, he added.
The Minister said India has decided to become a contributor to the Asian Development Fund (ADF) and will contribute $30 million towards ADF-11 in agreed instalments beginning October 2014.

‘Share your ride, go electric, breathe easy’ "," Smart applications and new forms of mobility may make urban commutes easier in the near future, which is going to be dominated by electric scooters, motorcycles, buses and bicycles, industry officials and analysts said.
Urbanisation has wrecked the infrastructure of Indian cities and mobility has taken a hit, Amit Gupta, CEO and co-founder, Yulu, an IoT-based bicycle share provider. “Traffic congestion has affected the productivity of people and has also had a major impact on their physical health and emotional well-being.”
Bengaluru, India’s technology hub, has the lowest pace of traffic, slower than New Delhi (25 km/hr) and Mumbai (20.7 km/hr), a study by ride-hailing firm Ola, found. The city’s traffic pace had dropped close to 3km/ hr in one year in 2017.
Yulu is trying to solve the last-mile connectivity problem, Mr. Gupta said. The firm has installed bicycle stations in the city and plans to connect buses, bikes and e-scooters through an app. “The aim is that different transportation points can talk to each other.” 
“Where is urban mobility headed? Somebody has to fix the first and the last-mile problem.” 
Tarun Rambha, assistant professor at the Civil Engineering Department of the Indian Institute of Science said the “future is shared.” 
“Vehicles that transport you are parked 95% of the time... Sharing a car will lead to lower congestion, cheaper travel and a better environment,” said Mr. Rambha, who researches in real-time traffic of traffic networks. “Ride-sharing can help reduce the oversupply (of cars) we [now] have.”
Four technology-driven trends — electrification, shared mobility, connectivity and autonomous driving — are leading the disruption in the auto industry, according to a McKinsey & Company report.
These trends will shift markets and revenue pools, change mobility behaviour and build new avenues for competition and cooperation. The real growth lies in services, which are poised to grow by an average of up to 40% a year, globally.
Sirish Batchu, head of advanced technology division at Mahindra Electric Mobility, said, “Electric technology is at a tipping point.” About 3 million EVs will be on Indian roads by 2030, he said.
By defining regulations on emissions and fuel efficiency, exploring incentives and subsidies, the Centre can support EV adoption and develop a supportive ecosystem, according to McKinsey. 
Power, fuel and charging infrastructure firms can innovate on business models such as leasing of batteries, swapping infrastructure and deploying fast chargers, to drive EV adoption, according to the report.
Savings galore
India can save 64% of anticipated passenger road-based mobility-related energy demand and 37% of carbon emissions by 2030 by pursuing shared, electric and connected mobility, government think-tank NITI Aayog said in a report.
This would help reduce 156 Mtoe in fuel consumption by that year and implies savings of about ₹3.9 lakh crore by 2030.
R.K. Shenoy, senior VP, Embedded Solutions and Product Engineering at Robert Bosch Engineering and Business Solutions, said automated mobility had resulted in a series of new inventions such as intelligent lights, auto wipers, collision warning, auto pilot and highway assist.
“It is something like eyes off, brains off and driver off. The economics of such vehicles has a long way to go.”

Trump tariffs a rounding error for U.S. economy so far, that may change
","U.S. President Donald Trump’s new trade tariffs will lop at most a couple of tenths of a percentage point off U.S. growth and add a similar amount to inflation, small fry for a $19 trillion economy that is experiencing its second longest economic expansion on record.
On Friday, Mr. Trump imposed tariffs on $50 billion of imports from China, a move that came on top of hefty duties on steel and aluminum imports implemented at the start of June. American consumers and businesses have taken the tariffs in their stride and the growing economy has brought in more workers, pushing unemployment down to levels not seen since the 1960s.
The costs have been manageable so far, with Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross saying the metals tariff, for example, will add a few hundred dollars to the cost of a car.
Trade retaliation from China has so far been mainly confined to the farm sector, a small part of the U.S. economy. That could change if Mr. Trump pushes ahead with more protectionist measures, possibly triggering a stock market sell-off that would damage business and consumer confidence, argues Michael Gapen, Barclays chief U.S. economist. The Dow industrials fell almost 1% on Friday.
The risks come at a time when the Federal Reserve has pushed interest rates into positive territory adjusted for inflation for the first time in over a decade, a move that will raise borrowing costs for consumers.
The President has already threatened to annul the North American Free Trade Agreement after a year of inconclusive talks with Canada and Mexico, and ordered an investigation into whether the U.S. should impose tariffs on auto imports because he says they threaten American economic security.
“Anti-trade policies, particularly tariffs, act like a tax on consumers and businesses by raising the cost of trade. By creating uncertainty, they also weigh on asset valuations, which could weaken households’ ability to sustain spending and reduce the incentive for businesses to invest,” said Mr. Gapen. 
Mr. Trump’s expansion of unilateral trade action goes well beyond recent actions from the U.S. Before Mr. Trump acted, the biggest measure was imposed in the 1980s when Washington forced Japan to limit exports of cars. Mr. Trump’s top trade negotiator, Robert Lighthizer, was instrumental in that deal, which helped shield Detroit automakers from Japanese competition, but at a cost.
‘A war of each against all’
According to an estimate from economic think tank PERC, the additional sticker price cost to U.S. consumers from those measures was $1,200 per car. Overall consumer losses from the restrictions amounted to $13 billion, PERC said in 1999.
China, Europe, Canada and Mexico have not folded in the same way that Japan did in the 1980s, and have set their own tariffs in response to Mr. Trump’s moves.
U.S. allies have been exasperated by Washington’s refusal to negotiate exemptions for steel and aluminum tariffs and the issue boiled over at a G7 meeting where Mr. Trump was left isolated.
“With regards to our allies in Europe, Japan, Canada, and elsewhere, there are real dangers in engaging in a ‘war of each against all,’ which could reduce the welfare of the entire world, including the U.S.,” Jeffry Frieden and Joel Trachtman of Harvard University and the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University wrote in a report.

Trade deficit widens to $14.62 billion
"," India’s merchandise trade deficit widened to $14.62 billion in May 2018, official data released on Friday showed. The shortfall was $13.72 billion in April 2018 and $13.84 billion in May 2017.
“Exports during May 2018 were valued at $28.86 billion as compared to $24.01 billion during May 2017 exhibiting a positive growth of 20.18%,” the government said in a release. “Imports during May 2018 were valued at $43.48 billion which was 14.85% higher in dollar terms.”
Smart uptick
In contrast, merchandise exports in April had grown by only 5.17%, while imports grew 4.6%. The export growth in May 2018 was better than that seen in May last year, while the import growth was slower. Exports grew 8.32% in May 2017, while imports grew 33.1%.
The major export groups that witnessed strong growth in May 2018 included engineering goods (14.8%), petroleum products (104.5%), organic and inorganic chemicals (34.2%), drugs and pharmaceuticals (25.7%), and cotton yarn/fabrics/made-ups and handloom products (24.7%).
“Exports growing by 20% is certainly good news but the challenge is to keep the momentum,” said Ravi Sehgal, chairman, Engineering Export Promotion Council of India. “While a growing U.S. economy would help, the U.S.-China trade war must be watched. Back home, rising raw material costs will be a challenge.”
‘Vigil needed’
“Escalating trade war between the U.S. and China would vitiate the global trading environment, making it imperative for India as well to keep a vigil on the fast-moving developments,” Mr. Sehgal added. “With the U.S. confirming 25% tariffs on $50 billion Chinese imports and the Chinese stating they would retaliate, it is time for India to keep engaged with both the U.S. and China to safeguard our own interest.”
The government said, “Cumulative value of exports for the period April-May 2018-19 was $54.77 billion as against $48.65 billion registering a positive growth of 12.58% in dollar terms and 16.37% in rupee terms over the same period last year.”
“Oil imports during May 2018 were valued at $11.5 billion which was 49.5% higher in dollar terms and 56.7% higher in rupee terms compared to $7.69 billion in May 2017,” the government said. 
“Oil imports during April-May 2018-19 were valued at $21.91 billion which was 45.6% higher in dollar terms and 50.5% higher in rupee terms compared to $15.05 billion in the corresponding period last year,” the government added in the release.
The government, however, did mention that global Brent prices had increased by 50.7% in May 2018 compared with their levels in May 2017, as per commodity price data from the World Bank.

Nippon Steel targets India opportunity
","Japan’s top steelmaker Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal Corp. sees India as the most promising market and wants to become “an insider” to capitalise on growth of the world’s third-biggest steel market, a senior executive said.
“India will be the fastest-growing steel market in the world going forward,” Nippon Steel executive vice president Katsuhiro Miyamoto told Reuters in an interview on Thursday.
“But since it’s not an easy market to export due to trade and distribution issues, it’s important for us to become an insider. That’s why we are bidding for Essar Steel,” he said.
Nippon Steel has teamed up with Luxembourg-based ArcelorMittal, the world’s largest steelmaker, to bid about $6 billion for bankrupt Essar Steel, India’s fourth-biggest steelmaker.
But the bidding process has been delayed due to legal battles over eligibility for the bidders.
Asked if he thinks the chances are in their favour in the bidding race, Mr. Miyamoto said: “We have always believed so.
“We have submitted all the documents requested to the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) and we expect their decision by the end of this month,” he said.
World Steel Association (WSA) forecast steel demand in India will climb 5.5% in 2018 and 6% in 2019, becoming the fastest-growing market among the world’s top ten steel consumption countries.
Even so, Japan’s steel exports to India nearly halved in 2016 after India imposed duties of up to 20% on some hot-rolled flat steel products in September 2015. India also set a floor price in February 2016 for steel product imports to deter countries such as China, Japan and South Korea from undercutting local mills.
Since then, Japan’s annual steel exports to India have been hovering at about 1.3 million tonnes, just 3% of the country’s total exports of the metal.
Nippon Steel has a joint venture with India’s Tata Steel to produce cold-rolled sheets for automobiles, but it has little presence in steel used in other areas in the South Asian nation.
“If we can buy Essar, it will give us access to India’s general steel users including builders,” he said.
Nippon Steel said in March it will spend ¥600 billion ($5.4 billion) for business investment, including for mergers and acquisitions (M&A), over the next three years.
That would be up from ¥210 billion spent over the previous three years to step up global expansion.

World’s first mission to touch the Sun lifts off: NASA ","NASA’s Parker Solar Probe, mankind’s first mission to ‘touch’ the Sun, has been launched today on a seven-year long journey to unlock the mysteries of our star’s fiery outer atmosphere and its effects on space weather.
Liftoff took place from Space Launch Complex 37 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in the US early today.

The launch of the United Launch Alliance Delta IV Heavy rocket carrying the spacecraft was scrubbed yesterday due to a violation of a launch limit, resulting in a hold.
The car-sized spacecraft will travel directly into the Sun’s atmosphere, about four million miles from its surface - and more than seven times closer than any spacecraft has come before, thanks to its innovative Thermal Protection System. The USD 1.5 billion mission will perform the closest-ever observations of a star when it travels through the Sun’s outer atmosphere, called the corona.
It will make 24 passes through the corona during its seven-year mission. The mission will rely on measurements and imaging to revolutionise our understanding of the corona and how processes there ultimately affect near-Earth space.
The Parker Solar Probe carries a lineup of instruments to study the Sun both remotely and in situ, or directly. Together, the data from these instruments should help scientists answer three foundational questions about our star.
Parker Solar Probe will explore the corona, a region of the Sun only seen from Earth when the Moon blocks out the Sun’s bright face during total solar eclipses. The corona holds the answers to many of scientists’ outstanding questions about the Sun’s activity and processes.

Integrated farming model for wetlands
","A multi-commodity farming system consisting of rice, fish, broiler duck and male buffalo was evaluated at the Regional Agricultural Research Station, Kumarakom, under the Kerala Agricultural University for productivity, income, cropping intensity and generation of employment.
The study revealed that a one hectare paddy holder in kuttanad has the carrying capacity of a minimum of 5,000 fishes, 750 broiler ducks and 3-5 male buffaloes in addition to rice. In this system paddy is grown during June- October season.

Fish varieties

Fish fingerlings are stocked simultaneously in nursery ponds dug near the rice fields. A species composition of grass carp, rohu and catla at 2:1:1 at10,000 fingerlings per ha is advisable. Broiler duckling varieties like vigoa at 125-150/ha are grown simultaneously in duck houses erected over the fish pond.
Ducklings are fed with formulated feed. Spilled over feed and excrements of duck fertilize the fish ponds. It increases the primary productivity and growth of algae and higher plants.
Fishes feed on them and some of them consume duck droppings directly. The ducklings are sold after 45-50 days when they attain 2.1 – 2.5 kg body weight. In a year 5-8 batches of broiler ducks can be reared. Duck excrements to the tune of 9-10 tons are recycled for manuring the fish ponds
Paddy harvest gets over in 120-125 days and the fields get inundated after rice harvest. The nursery ponds are broken open and the fishes are released into the expanded water body.

Food material

The leftover paddy straw on decomposition generates abundant food material in addition to the duck manure flowing down from the nursery pond.
The fish species composition of grass carp, rohu and catla are capable of feeding on aquatic weeds and straw. The field bottoms are tilled by fishes during foraging.
Fish harvest is done prior to the next paddy season. Rice fields require no land preparation and preliminary weeding if the plant stand establishment is done within one week after the fish harvest.
At the present market rates the over all income will be Rs. 5.4 to 6.8 lakhs per /ha.

Upstart: What we’ll do in the future "," In 1930, at a time of tremendous economic pessimism, the economist John Maynard Keynes wrote an essay filled with optimism. It was titled ‘Economic Possibilities for our Grandchildren’, and in this essay, Keynes envisioned what 2030 would be like. The main thrust of this essay was that any sort of economic recessions are temporary, and in the long term, such economic problems will be solved for good. To quote him exactly, “I draw the conclusion that, assuming no important wars and no important increase in population, the economic problem may be solved, or be at least within sight of solution, within a hundred years. This means that the economic problem is not, if we look into the future, the permanent problem of the human race.” But there have been a few important wars, as well as great increases in population, which is probably why we will miss the 2030 deadline that Keynes set, but his basic assertion still holds. Sooner or later, we will all be living in a society where people will have more time for leisure than time that is needed for various definitions of “work”. A lot of great science fiction, such as one of my all-time favourites, The Culture series by Iain M Banks, gives us insight into what such a future may look like. There is also a famous Richard M Stallman quote on how the idea of such a future is what motivated him to start the GNU Project. He said, “In the long run, making programs free is a step toward the post-scarcity world, where nobody will have to work very hard just to make a living. People will be free to devote themselves to activities that are fun, such as programming, after spending the necessary ten hours a week on required tasks such as legislation, family counselling, robot repair and asteroid prospecting. There will be no need to be able to make a living from programming.” But I see a set of startups, even from a purely Indian perspective, that gives us glimpses into parts of such futures, both in terms of what kind of work there might be, as well as what people might do for leisure.
When you have a lot of time to spare, you will travel a lot. The sort of travel that is different from ‘a Cook’s tour’ (a British idiom that refers to a brief and cursory look at a place, having its origins in the 19th Century packaged tours organised by Thomas Cook, the likes of which are still popular today) but is instead something that is more immersive and centred around fairly specific interests of the traveller. These interests may have to do with sports, music, art, or just about anything else. Pickyourtrail, Sportytrip, Eventraveler, are all startups that are doing this.
When you have a lot of time to spare, things that you had previously consigned to the category of ‘hobbies’ (such a quaint word already, no?) become all-consuming passions. These could range from playing certain sports, to playing musical instruments, heck, even something like quizzing. And when markets for what were earlier niche interests grow exponentially, you will see startups very quickly catering to those needs. In India today, I can see around half-a-dozen startups catering to any pastime of note. And it is only a matter of time before they become far more formidable than they are now.
Also, as we inch closer to a world of plenty, the value of curation increases many-fold. And that is probably a topic for a future column.

Paleo-rivers predated Harappans by 35,000 years
","A recent study on direct dating of sediments extracted from paleochannels close to Harappan sites in the region of Sutlej-Yamuna interfluve by a team of scientists from the Physical Research Laboratory, Ahmedabad (PRL) and CNRS, France, indicate that these rivers changed their course nearly 35,000 years before the Harappans came to settle there.
Along with a 2017 paper in Nature Communications by A. Singh from IIT Kanpur and others, this study now provides scientific evidence that contradicts the suggestions on Harappans flourishing on the banks of the mythical Vedic rivers, Sarasvati and Drishadvati. These studies provide evidence that these rivers changed their course much before the time of Harappan settlements about 5,000 years ago. The study was published recently in Quaternary Geochronology.
The discovery of several hundred Harappan sites in the Sutlej–Yamuna interfluves led archaeologists to infer that like other ancient civilisations, Harappans too flourished on the banks of mighty rivers. Presence of ephemeral rivers Ghaggar-Hakra and Chautang in this area led people to suggest that these were vestiges of the once mighty glacial rivers on whose banks the Harappan civilisation was established. This gained popularity when a paleo-channel (ancient remains of rivers) was discovered in this region.
The naming of a paleo-channel and associating it with archaeological sites irked the curiosity of Prof. A.K. Singhvi from PRL. “To me this appeared unrealistic and far-fetched. A ballpark analysis of Harappan site per unit time indicated that the numbers of settlements to be supported [by a large river] were too few and the need to invoke a mighty river was somewhat misplaced,” he says.
For over three decades many papers were written but this premise was not tested scientifically using modern dating techniques till now.
This study analysed the distribution of Harappan sites along the two main rivers in the region – the Indus, which is perennial, and the Ghaggar-Hakra, which is ephemeral; examined the mineralogy of river sediments to establish their source and dated the entire sediment succession of the region using dating technique to establish the event chronology of the evolution of the region.
The authors conclude thus: “Settlement patterns and other analysis suggest that factors other than perennial rivers dictated their [Harappan’s] settlement” and that, “Major change in the river dynamics occurred between 24,000-45,000 years ago (most likely around 40,000-45,000 years ago), and since 25,000 years the landscape has not changed significantly.”
Prof Singhvi, who led the study, states that ipso-facto this study implies that so called paleo-river features are far too old to be associated with Vedic times.
“Care should be taken in making a linear association of river hydrology with abundance of archeological sites,” he says.
He points out that this inference is also buttressed by the evidences of water harvesting techniques of Harappans, the cropping patterns suggesting their dependence on seasonal monsoon rather than constant supply of water.

‘Gradient Descent’: when Artificial Intelligence meets art
"," 

Thanks to technology, the roles of the artist and the scientist, as well as their creative processes, are melding and the rigour of the resulting works is unbelievable. Our creativity has allowed our species to thrive, and now with machines having their own concepts of aesthetics, perception and creativity, it poses some important questions to artists. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is bridging the gap between technology and fine art by challenging creative intelligence and sensorial experiences, integrating networks known as GANs and cGANs, and changing how artists interact with their so-to-speak canvases. 
And with India as an AI capital, there’s endless scope to explore this realm. In fact, ‘Gradient Descent’, the country’s first AI creative showcase in Delhi, will be exhibiting this far-reaching evolution.
Assembled by brothers Raghava KK and Karthik Kalyanaraman, co-founders of art curation and research collective 64/1, the show unites an international group of artists who have melded various nodes of AI into riveting artworks which vary across the scale of immersion; building public understanding of how artists and Artificial Intelligence can come together to create art for the post-human age.
The works




Bengaluru-born Harshit Agrawal’s works, titled ‘The Anatomy Lesson of Dr Algorithm’, appears to be a disturbing look at surgical procedures. MIT graduate Harshit explores how something that’s so fundamentally human can be performed by something mechanical, like an algorithm he uses to map out a surgery. By varying the amount of training the algorithm gets, Harshit generates vivid abstract painterly images. At the same time, he refuses to erase the pixellations and digital mediation in the artwork — helpful to those who’d be a bit queasy.




Mario Klingemann from Germany will be presenting a jarring video of image distortions by AI’s sometimes-unpredictable tendencies. Using AI that has been trained on portraits of the Old Masters, Mario presents a bizarre take on how AI can build upon images. Because he’s continuously adding noise to this image, the portrait, which is morphed, starts to become more and more bizarre.




Now what about AI’s perception as artwork? A pioneer of AI and art, Tom White from London will be presenting two provocative series. The first series starts from a simple drawing made by an algorithm. Then, an AI algorithm which was trained on photographs from ImageNet, slowly transforms the initial sketch into an abstract representation of a physical object. This painting will not necessarily be recognisable to humans. The second series, a little more provocative, uses the same systems, but instead produces images that will generally be categorised as ‘inappropriate’ or ‘having explicit content’ by online image analysis AIs.




Grasping the potential of film and power, Anna Ridler from London uses the first 4 minutes of the 1928 film The Fall of the House of Usher by James Sibley Watson, handpaints every frame as a painting and feeds them into a cGAN, a type of AI algorithm that can link the frame from the film and Ridler’s artwork. Then she can generate a whole film using those paintings.
 Jake Elwes from London explores the power of language as an art, stringing together sentences and using that language to create an image. Elwes then puts an AI that interprets images in words in conversation with another AI that interprets words in images. A simple concept, the resulting interaction and interpretations made by the two AIs is celebrated for its impact on the viewer.




Turkish artist Memo Akten brings over his the investigation, ‘Learning To See’, of how the experience or memory of the machine affects what and how it sees. He describes it as “an artificial neural network making predictions on live webcam input, trying to make sense of what it sees in context of what it has seen before.” He’ll also be unveiling ‘Deep Meditations’, an extension of the aforementioned works, using machine-learning algorithms to create a two-hour meditative channel video and sound installation.




Taking AI perception to the next level, Nao Tokui from Japan will be exhibiting ‘Imaginary Landscape’. As various objects are manipulated in front of a camera, the machine, trained only on specific sets of images (for instance of beaches, or flames) reinterprets these objects as instances of categories it knows. The eerie effect of seeing a mobile phone power adapter reinterpreted by the algorithm as a cliff by a beach is not one a viewer is likely to forget, perhaps causing her to wonder whether this is all of nature that will be left for the future.
Through 64/1’s eyes
Karthik and Raghava share that finding work that is conceptually rich was key, adding, “This is the first time we are actually focussing on AI art as art — usually AI art has been treated as a step to talk about AI in society, but we do need to speak about it as art too, because that brings up the essence of creativity and the role of the human. Stylistic sensibilities across the spectrum were also key here, as well as the spectrum of algorithms they were using. The show serves as a manifesto saying ‘we really care about this and this is how artists can engage with the future’.”
For those overwhelmed by the tech-talk, the exhibition will also feature some workshops and engaging talks about AI, so even those unfamiliar yet curious people can immerse themselves into a new genre of art. Running till September 15, the show at Nature Morte gallery is open to all.

Emerging antimicrobial resistance in leprosy
"," A six-year study carried out across 19 countries has now shown that antimicrobial resistance is emerging in leprosy cases. This global data shows that a total of 8% of the Mycobacterium leprae bacterial strains studied showed gene mutations conferring resistance towards drugs such as rifampicin, dapsone and ofloxacin. Rifampicin resistance was observed in about 5% of the relapse cases and in 2% of the new ones. India and Brazil topped the list with more than 10 rifampicin-resistant cases each.
Molecular methods
Assessing antimicrobial resistance has not been possible so far as M. leprae does not grow in vitro. “Currently, there are only two techniques for studying M. leprae - the mouse foot-pad technique and genetic analysis. As the former is time-consuming, we used molecular methods for detecting the resistance genes,” explains Dr. U.D. Gupta, National JALMA Institute of Leprosy and other Mycobacterial Diseases, Agra, and one of the authors of the paper published in Clinical Microbiology and Infection.
Global data showed that among the 1,932 (1,143 relapse and 789 new) cases studied, 3.8% showed gene mutations showing resistance to rifampicin. The number was 4.5% for dapsone and 1.1% for ofloxacin.
Certain cases showed resistance to more than one drug. Globally, 20 cases showed rifampicin and dapsone resistance, four showed ofloxacin and dapsone resistance. “Interestingly there were no cases of resistance to rifampicin and ofloxacin together. More studies are needed to know in depth about this,” he adds.
In India, the study was carried out in five laboratories across the country. Among the 382 cases studied from India, 4.7% showed resistance to rifampicin, 6.4% dapsone resistant and 4.4% ofloxacin resistant.
“In 1982, the multi-drug strategy was adopted to treat leprosy just when resistance to the then used drug, Dapsone was emerging. But now after almost four decades, we are noticing rifampicin resistance. Though the numbers are not alarming, it is essential to continue monitoring,” explains Dr. Joydeepa Darlong, Head of Research at The Leprosy Mission Trust of India. “Relapse cases may be under-diagnosed as we rely on self-reporting and there is decreasing leprosy expertise.”
“Unlike the routine regime (rifampicin, dapsone and clofazimine) administered once a month and given free of cost, the alternative drug regime (minocycline and ofloxacin) given to drug-resistant patients is a daily dose, prescribed for two years, and is very expensive. The government has no provision to provide this free of cost,” says Dr. Mallika Lavania from Stanley Brown Lab of The Leprosy Mission Trust of India and one of the authors of the paper. “Now, with the emergence of antimicrobial resistance, it also stresses the need for immediate notice, routine investigation and establishment of proper treatment guidelines by the government.”
“This is also a call for vigilance on the global use of antimicrobial agents, because ofloxacin resistance probably developed in relation to the general intake of antibiotics for other infections as it is not part of the multidrug combination used to treat leprosy,” adds the report. Ofloxacin resistant cases were found to be the highest in India among the 19 countries studied.
Antimicrobial resistance monitoring is now one of the core areas in the Global Leprosy Strategy for 2016–2020 and WHO has recently released an updated guide on surveillance of antimicrobial resistance in leprosy.

Why do we have technology addictions?
"," In May 2016, Tristan Harris published an influential essay titled ‘How technology is hijacking your mind — from a magician and Google design ethicist’, describing the many ways by which smartphones suck people into their vortex and demand constant attention. Harris traced the lineage of (both inadvertent and intentional) manipulation common in the design of technology products directly to the numerous techniques that slot-machine designers use to entice gamblers to sit for hours losing money.
Inspired by Harris and other advocates of more-mindful technology product design, a small but growing Silicon Valley movement in behavioural design is advocating greater consideration of the ethics and the human outcomes of technology consumption. (After leaving Google, Harris launched a website, Time Well Spent, that focuses on helping people build healthier interactions with technology.)
Harris, New York University marketing professor Adam Alter, and others have criticised the various techniques that product designers are using to encourage us to consume ever more technology, even to our own clear detriment. Tightly controlling menus to direct our attention is one common technique (one that is not as easily available to offline businesses). For his part, Harris suggests that we ask four questions whenever we’re presented with online menus: (1) What’s not on the menu? (2) Why am I being given these options and not others? (3) Do I know the menu provider’s goals? (4) Is this menu empowering for my original need, or are the choices actually a distraction? We assure you, once you start asking these questions, you will never look at the Internet or at software applications in the same light again!
Another technique, alluded to in the title of Harris’ slot-machine article, is the use of intermittent variable rewards: unpredictability in the rewards of an interaction. The first behaviourist, psychologist BF Skinner, introduced this concept with his ‘Skinner box’ research. Skinner put rats into boxes and taught them to push levers to receive a food pellet. The rats learned the connection between behaviour and reward quickly, in only a few tries. With further research, Skinner learned that the best way to keep the rats motivated to press the lever repeatedly was to reward them with a pellet only some of the time — to give intermittent variable rewards. Otherwise, the rats pushed the lever only when they were hungry.
The casinos took the concept of the Skinner box and raised it to a fine art, designing multiple forms of variable rewards into the modern computerised versions of slot machines. Those machines now take in 70 to 80% of casino profits (or, according to an industry official, even 85%). Players not only receive payouts at seemingly random intervals, but also receive partial payouts that feel like a win even if the player in fact loses money overall on a turn…
The brain’s pleasure centres do not distinguish well between actual winning and the techniques that researchers call losses disguised as wins (LDW). The machines are also programmed to highlight near misses (nearly enough of the right numbers), since near misses actually stimulate the same neurons as real wins do.
Machine designers use myriad other clever sensory tricks — both visual and auditory — to stimulate our neurons in ways that encourage more playing… What helps these techniques entice humans to keep playing is that our brains are hard-wired to become easily addicted to variable rewards. This makes sense when you think that finding food in prehistoric, pre-agricultural times was a perfect example of intermittent variable rewards. According to research by Robert Breen, video-based gambling games (of which slots represent the majority) that rely on intermittent variable rewards result in gambling addiction three to four times faster than betting on card games or sporting events.
Smartphones were not explicitly designed to behave like slot machines, but their effect is nearly the same. As Harris writes, “When we pull our phone out of our pocket, we’re playing a slot machine to see what notifications we got. When we pull to refresh our email, we’re playing a slot machine to see what new email we got. When we swipe down our finger to scroll the Instagram feed, we’re playing a slot machine to see what photo comes next. When we swipe faces left/right on dating apps like Tinder, we’re playing a slot machine to see if we got a match…”
Through this lens we can see how many actions deeply embedded in the technology we use are acting as variable rewards systems, and when we look at the technology in our lives, we can find intermittent variable rewards in nearly every product, system, or device.

Space tourism may take-off in 2019
","The two companies leading the pack in the pursuit of space tourism say they are just months away from their first out-of-this-world passenger flights — though neither has set a firm date.
Virgin Galactic, founded by British billionaire Richard Branson, and Blue Origin, by Amazon creator Jeff Bezos, are racing to be the first to finish their tests — with both companies using radically different technology. Neither Virgin nor Blue Origin’s passengers will find themselves orbiting the Earth: instead, their weightless experience will last just minutes. It’s an offering far different from the first space tourists, who travelled to the International Space Station (ISS) in the 2000s.
Virgin Galacticcan take six passengers and two pilots aboard its SpaceShipTwo, VSS Unity. 
Mr. Branson in May said that he hoped to himself be one of the first passengers in the next 12 months. About 650 people make up the rest of the waiting list, the company said.
Blue Origin, meanwhile, has developed a system closer to the traditional rocket: the New Shepard. Six passengers take their place in a “capsule” fixed to the rocket. After launching, it detaches and continues its trajectory toward the sky. During an April 29 test, the capsule made it to 66 miles. 
Company officials were recently quoted as saying the first tests with Blue Origin astronauts would take place “at the end of this year.”

India to teach satellite tech to students from abroad
"," India has thrown open its satellite-building expertise to engineering graduates chosen from other countries.
Starting this year, and for three years, a total of 90 qualifying engineers from various countries will be taught to build and test three small satellites each year. They will be hosted in Bengaluru for two months each year and work in three annual batches of 30.
India is also ready to launch the small satellites built during the programme if they are good, Chairman of the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), K. Sivan, and other ISRO officials announced at an event in Vienna, where the global space community is meeting from June 18 to 21. 
Indian start-ups and participants at the meeting shared the details of the training proposal, called the Indo-UN Small Satellites Programme (UNSSP). 
The countries are marking the 50th year of the first UN Conference on the Exploration and Peaceful Uses of Outer Space — called UNISPACE+50. Three such conferences held earlier recognised the potential of space and laid the guidelines for human activities and international cooperation related to outer space.
ISRO’s Bengaluru-based U.R. Rao Satellite Centre (URSC) — until recently known as ISAC — will train the overseas students in November and December this year through 2020, according to URSC Director M. Annadurai. In the last 40-odd years, URSC has rolled over 100 Indian satellites for various purposes out of its facilities. 
Dr. Sivan said the capacity-building programme was India’s contribution to the world in response to a request that the UN Office for Outer Space Affairs had made to space-faring nations last year.

U.S. stepping up the earth’s protection from asteroids
","The U.S. government is stepping up efforts to protect the planet from incoming asteroids that could wipe out entire regions or even continents. 
The National Science and Technology Council recently released a report calling for improved asteroid detection, tracking and deflection. NASA is participating, along with federal emergency, military, White House and other officials. 
NASA’s planetary defence officer, Lindley Johnson, said scientists have found 95% of all these near-Earth objects measuring one kilometre or bigger. But the hunt is still on for the remaining 5% and smaller rocks that could still inflict big damage. 
Altogether, NASA has catalogued 18,310 objects of all sizes. 
There’s no quick solution if a space rock is suddenly days, weeks or even months from striking, according to Mr. Johnson.
Emergency planning
But such short notice would give the world time, at least, to evacuate the area it might hit, he said. 
Ground telescopes are good at picking up asteroids zooming into the inner solar system and approaching from the night side of the earth, Mr. Johnson said. What’s difficult to detect are rocks that have already zipped past the sun and are heading out of the solar system, approaching from the day side. 
That’s apparently what happened in 2013 when an asteroid about 66 feet in size suddenly appeared and exploded over Chelyabinsk, Russia, damaging thousands of buildings and causing widespread injuries.

Centre mulls ways to block mobile apps
","The Centre has asked telecom service providers to explore possible ways to block mobile applications such as Facebook and WhatsApp “as per the provisions of the IT Act, 2000.”
In a letter dated July 18, the Department of Telecom “once again requested” operators and Internet service providers “to explore various possible options and confirm how Instagram, Facebook, WhatsApp, Telegram and such other mobile applications can be blocked on the Internet.” Without clarifying the reason for the request, the DoT has said, “Issues have been raised by MeITY (Ministry of Electronics and IT) and LEAs (Law Enforcement Agencies) for blocking certain mobile apps like Instagram/ Facebook/ Whatsapp/ Telegram.”
“This issue was also raised during the meeting on July 4, 2018, wherein technical inputs were sought from TSPs/ISPs to explore possibility of certain mobile applications,” the letter said. The July 4 meeting, according to an industry representative present, was mainly on putting a stop to child abuse/pornography and to curb the spread of fake news. An industry source said the discussions centred around blocking these applications in an emergency, rather than blocking access to the Internet as a whole. “For example, in Jammu & Kashmir, we have Internet blackout. So, there was a discussion on whether just some social media applications could be blocked instead.”
A source in the DoT said that there is no move to block any apps. ""MeitY has informed DoT that blocking such apps during emergency situations are difficult as they work through multiple IP addresses and on different protocols, and hence there is a need for a reasonable good solution to protect national security."" 
The source added, ""Being the licensing authority DoT has initiated the discussion based on a letter received from the Group Coordinator, Cyber Law Division (MeitY) during the second week of July.""

Apple steps up encription to prevent cracking of iPhones by law enforcement agencies
"," Apple Inc said on Wednesday it will change its iPhone settings to undercut the most popular means for law enforcement to break into the devices.
The company told Reuters it was aiming to protect all customers, especially in countries where phones are readily obtained by police or by criminals with extensive resources, and to head off further spread of the attack technique.
The privacy standard-bearer of the tech industry said it will change default settings in the iPhone operating system to cut off communication through the USB port when the phone has not been unlocked in the past hour.
That port is how machines made by forensic companies GrayShift, Cellebrite and others connect and get around the security provisions that limit how many password guesses can be made before the device freezes them out or erases data. Now they will be unable to run code on the devices after the hour is up.
These companies have marketed their machines to law enforcement in multiple countries this year, offering the machines themselves for thousands of dollars but also per-phone pricing as low as $50.
Apple representatives said the change in settings will protect customers in countries where law enforcement seizes and tries to crack phones with fewer legal restrictions than under U.S. law. They also noted that criminals, spies and unscrupulous people often use the same techniques. Even some of the methods most prized by intelligence agencies have been leaked on the internet.
Were constantly strengthening the security protections in every Apple product to help customers defend against hackers, identity thieves and intrusions into their personal data, Apple said in a prepared statement. We have the greatest respect for law enforcement, and we dont design our security improvements to frustrate their efforts to do their jobs.”
Apple began working on the USB issue before learning it was a favorite of law enforcement.
The setting switch had been documented in beta versions of iOS 11.4.1 and iOS12, and Apple told Reuters it will be made permanent in a forthcoming general release.
Apple said that after it learned of the techniques, it reviewed the iPhone operating system code and improved security. It decided to simply alter the setting, a cruder way of preventing most of the potential access by unfriendly parties.
With the changes, police or hackers will typically have an hour or less to get a phone to a cracking machine. That could cut access by as much as 90 percent, security researchers estimated.
This also could spur sales of cracking devices, as law enforcement looks to get more forensic machines closer to where seizures occur. Undoubtedly, researchers and police vendors will find new ways to break into phones, and Apple will then look to patch those vulnerabilities.
The setting change could also draw criticism from U.S. law enforcement officials who have been engaged in an on-again, off-again campaign for legislation or other ways to force technology companies to maintain access to users communications.
Apple has been the most prominent opponent of those demands. In 2016, it went to court to fight an order that it break into an iPhone 5c used by a killer in San Bernardino.
Then-FBI Director James Comey told Congress that without compelling Apple to write new software to facilitate the digital break-in, there would be no way to learn if the shooters device contained evidence of a conspiracy. The FBI ultimately found a contractor that broke into the phone without Apple's cooperation.
Apple and most private security experts argue that government contractors and others can usually find means of cracking devices. They also say that weakening encryption by design would lead to more hacking by those outside of government.
Until recently, current FBI Director Christopher Wray repeatedly claimed that the Bureau had been unable to get into more than 7,000 phones in 2017. Last month, the Washington Post reported that the true number was less than a third as high. The FBI blamed “programming errors.”

Technologies that lost the battle of time ","Over the weekend, there was a flurry of activity on the Internet as a large section of netizens witnessed the passing (or transition, depending on how you look at it) of StumbleUpon, one of the sites that defined how a large section of the online populace interacted with the web in the early 2000s. The announcement that the accounts on the site would be transitioned over to Mix, a similar content discovery platform, was met with an outpouring of nostalgia, prompting us to take a trip down memory lane to revisit some of the things from the realms of software, hardware and mobile, that were once dear but are no longer available in their original avatars.




Perhaps one of the original demonstrations of the Internet coming together to establish an alternative communication syntax; memes and rage comics were all over the Internet a few years ago, before things like Instagram filters and Animoji came along to divert people's attention. 9gag, one of the original hubs of meme-related humour, slowly transitioned to other popular content, introducing multiple new sections to aid content discovery. However, upon the website turning ten years old years old on July 1, a large section of users are trying to restore the content to that from the glory days, resulting in famous memes and rage comic storytelling making a reappearance, and dissuading unrelated posts with a cryptic 'This is not a meme' comment.




Even before 9gag's time, a large section of Internet users depended extensively on Yahoo's mail services and Messenger, the company's chat client, for communication. The rise of a new wave of Internet giants has seen Yahoo slowly fall from grace, before eventually being acquired by Verizon in 2017. Messenger itself has trudged along until now, but Verizon subsidiary Oath, which manages its digital divisions like Yahoo and AOL, has announced that the plug will be officially pulled on Messenger on July 17, striking the final nail in its coffin.




Started in 2001, StumbleUpon helped a generation navigate the Internet's murky waters long before personalised content recommendations and social media discovery pages. It used a selection of user-defined interests to constantly serve up interesting websites and content related to these interests at the press of the 'Stumble' button, leading to otherwise undiscovered spaces, like experimental music websites or mind-boggling HTML5 demos. As of June 30, StumbleUpon announced a transition to Mix, a social media-driven content discovery and recommendation platform made by StumbleUpon's co-founder Garett Camp's startup studio Expa.




In 2013, when almost every game developer from upcoming indie studios to gaming legends like Nintendo, were trying to crack mobile gaming, Vietnamese video game programmer Dong Nguyen launched a simple game about an odd flying bird trying to navigate a world similar to that of Super Mario. With a simple premise, unwieldy controls and an excruciating difficulty curve, Flappy Bird took the world by storm. By early January 2014, the game was topping app store charts and increasing Nguyen's wealth significantly, before the developer pulled the game over concerns of 'user addiction'. The game's popularity has died since, and while knockoffs exist aplenty, none of them have enjoyed the same fame as the original, with many blaming the controls or the implementation of the new titles.




Much like Yahoo, Pebble was the victim of acquisition by one of the giants in the wearable space -- Fitbit. Pebble proved that Kickstarter-funded projects can go on to be successful and that smartwatches were a niche worth exploring, with their own custom-designed OS featuring retro graphics, and promising great battery life thanks to E-ink technology. Even after Apple and Google got into the wearable space, Pebble enjoyed a solid following, but chose to be acquired by Fitbit in late 2016. Fitbit has since released its own fitness-focused smartwatches, the Ionic and most recently the Versa, but the quirky, irreverent charm that people saw in Pebble was lost in the acquisition.

Incredulous and Incredibles
"," Creepy crawly aliens and derelict space stations are always a great combination for disaster. Add to that the fact that said aliens, the Typhon, can shapeshift into anything, and you have a jump scare fest on your hands. That was 2017’s Prey in a nutshell. Inspired by System Shock and BioShock, Prey did not really capture gamers as much as it should have. A year later, comes a new expansion, Mooncrash, which is a lot different than what you’re expecting.


What’s it about?
Trapped on a spy satellite is a hacker named Peter, whose job is to intercept communication messages from a super secret TranStar moonbase. Except after the events of Prey, he finds himself stuck, with the only hope of getting out lying within the moonbase itself. To uncover its secrets, he has to play through a simulation built off the experiences of five TranStar employees, to find out exactly what happened.
As a story, Mooncrash is meaty and filled with little narrative titbits. Arkane Studios have really fleshed out their world a lot more, making an expansion feel like a full-length game. You will actually enjoy this game a bit more than the original.
How does it play?
Mooncrash falls under a genre of gaming called ‘Roguelikes’. While it is still a first-person action game, a roguelike is typically a series of small levels that are generated on the fly. The objective is to play each level to unlock more of the characters. Each of which have their own abilities and playstyles. The more you do, the more of their stories come to light.
That’s not all. Each level has a timer, where you have to cut through several Typhon of various sizes and survive. Find ways to escape and find out what happened on the base before time runs out. When your character dies, reset the simulation and keep pushing on. This rinse, die, repeat gameplay is incredibly addictive.
Should you get it?
Mooncrash builds upon Prey in ways that will make you want to play the original game again. Breathing new life into the franchise, giving us a bit of hope for Prey 2. You should get it, if you especially like roguelikes.
Traveller’s Tales has carved quite a niche for themselves with the Lego games they keep releasing. From Avengers to Batman to Harry Potter to Star Wars, they’ve got that one formula and they squeeze the most out of it. While it’s showing its age at the moment, they still infuse their game with that signature zany Lego writing, and they’ve taken a stab at Pixar’s The Incredibles in their latest game.






What’s it about?
The Incredibles released more than a decade ago, and it was Pixar’s take on the Fantastic 4 super-family concept. With similar powers, the movie charmed their way into everyone’s hearts. Lego’s The Incredibles is two movies in one, letting you play through that original movie, as well as the sequel that’s in the theatres. With a little bit of masala thrown in for good measure. There are two big differences though — everyone and everything is made up of Lego blocks, and the story takes an even lighter take, edging into a simpler kind of funny. That makes a movie for kids, even more kid-friendly, making this game the perfect game to play with your kids.
How does it play?
 The gameplay is similar to every Lego game, with melee combat, and you get to switch family members to get past obstacles. You can collect Lego coins and build things. If you’ve played Lego Avengers, a lot of elements look almost similar. What it does have is a lot of fan service, with over a hundred playable characters. Undoubtedly, as with the movies themselves, Elastigirl is the star of the show.
Should you get it?
Right now, as you’re reading this, a young boy or girl is tugging their parents along to see Incredibles 2. Chances are, after watching the movie, they’re going to be bouncing off the walls in excitement. Making Lego’s The Incredibles a game you should own, if you want to spend some time with your kids in the world of the Parr super-family.

Astra successfully test-fired from Sukhoi-30 MKI 
","Marking an important milestone, for the first time an Indian missile, Astra, was successfully test-fired from a fighter aircraft — the Sukhoi-30 MKI — from a naval range in the Western Sector on Sunday.
The test-firing met all the mission objectives and the air-launch was captured by side and forward looking high-speed cameras and the separation was exactly as per simulation, according to a press release from the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO).
Astra is India's first Beyond Visual Range Air-to-Air missile and has been designed and developed indigenously by the DRDO. The 60-km plus range missile possesses high Single Shot Kill Probability (SSKP) making it highly reliable.
Astra is an all-weather missile with active radar terminal guidance, excellent ECCM (electronic counter-counter measures) features, smokeless propulsion and process improved effectiveness in multi-target scenario, making it a highly advanced state-of-the-art missile, the release added.
Congratulating the team, Avinash Chander, Scientific Advisor to Defence Minister and DG, DRDO, observed that the launch was a major step in missile aircraft integration.He said this would be followed by launch against actual target shortly. “Many more trials are planned and will be conducted to clear the launch envelope. Weapon integration with 'Tejas', Light Combat Aircraft will also be done in the near future”, he added.
V. G. Sekaran, Director-General (Missiles and Strategic Systems), who chaired the Flight Readiness Review Committee, described it as one of the proud moments for DRDO and the entire country. Dr.K. Tamilmani, Director-General (Aeronautics), who oversaw the entire flight safety in the program, said the quality of integration and performance was of high standard. This was the beginning of the phase for demonstration of launch over a wide air-launch envelope.
Director, DRDL, S. Som, said “it is a first of its kind and a good achievement”.
Astra's project director, S. Venugopal said the missile was comparable with the best in the world. He said that to completely clear the launch envelope about 20-30 trials would be carried out in a continuous fashion. The air-launch envelope would cover various aspects including altitude, speed and the angle of attack. He said Sunday's test-firing from Su-30 MKI was preceded by several weapon integration trials conducted between November 2013 and February this year. The missile underwent rigorous testing on Su-30 in captive mode for avionics integration and seeker evaluation.
He said the Mk-II variant of Astra with a range of 100 km is planned to be tested by this year end.
He said the air launch was the culmination of effort by a dedicated team from the Missile Complex, Hyderabad, EMILAC (Centre for Military Airworthiness and Certification) and the IAF. HAL carried out modifications in Su-30 along with IAF specialists, while many Indian industries played an important role in the production of reliable avionics, propulsion system, materials, air-frame and software passing stringent airworthiness requirements for the missile.

44 Indians shortlisted for one-way trip to Mars
","Forty-four Indians, including 17 women, are among 705 aspirants shortlisted for an ambitious private mission to send four people on a planned one-way trip to Mars in 2024 to colonise the red planet.
The Netherlands-based non-profit organisation Mars One announced that 353 hopefuls from around the world have been eliminated from the selection programme to become the first human Mars colonists.
The number of people remaining in this “once in many lifetimes opportunity” is now just 705, including 44 Indians of whom 27 are men and 17 are women.
The Indian aspirants come from cities such as New Delhi, Hyderabad, Mumbai, Kolkata, Pune and Thiruvananthapuram.
The applicants came from over 140 countries and more than 20,000 Indians had applied for the first round.
The remaining candidates will be interviewed by the Mars One selection committee.
“We’re incredibly excited to start the next phase of Round 2, where we begin to better understand our candidates who aspire to take such a daring trip. They will have to show their knowledge, intelligence, adaptability and personality,” Mars One Chief Medical Officer Norbert Kraft, said.
In December 2013, Mars One announced the selection of 1058 candidates, including 62 from India, from the original pool of over 200,000 applicants.
Mars One asked them to complete two tasks by March 2014: to provide a medical statement of health from their physician and open their on-line Mars One applicant profile to the public.
The 418 men and 287 women who successfully completed both tasks will be invited for a personal interview. 313 candidates originally come from the Americas, 187 from Europe, 136 from Asia, 41 from Africa, and 28 from Oceania.
The group of candidates that will not continue to the interview round dropped out due to personal reasons and medical reasons.
“The withdrawals due to personal reasons were mostly in the age group 40-50. Candidates who had to withdraw from their dream due to medical reasons were mostly in the age group of 20-35,” Mars One said.
“What really left an impression with us is the fact that the medical tests turned out to have a major impact on the candidate’s lives, as some of them found out that they needed to undergo an operation, were sick and needed medical attention, or even had a malignant form of cancer that otherwise would not have been detected in such an early stage,” Kraft said.
After the interview round, the group of candidates will be narrowed down to several international teams consisting of two women and two men.
These teams of prospective Mars settlers will be prepared for the mission by participating full time in an extensive training programme.
Training to go to Mars will be their full time job. Whole teams and individuals might be selected out during training when they prove not to be suitable for the mission.
Mars One will repeat the selection process regularly to train additional teams to replace eliminated teams and crews of settlers that have successfully left Earth to live on Mars.
Ultimately, six teams of four people will be selected to train from 2015 to 2024, leading up to the final four who will make the historic one-way trip to Mars.

Bang & Olufsen’s H9i headphones: In your own little world
"," At first glance, the Beoplay H9i over-ear Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) headphones appear to be the ideal lifestyle gadget, with soft-to-the-touch accents and clean lines. 
The unboxing itself is a pleasurable experience; with ribbon pull-ups and velvet lining of the panels. 
Given the Danish brand’s minimalist aesthetic, the H9i is no exception to their design philosophy. Available in two colours — black and natural — the headphones designed by Jakob Wagner comprise polished and anodised aluminium detailing with soft lambskin and leather for that cushioned comfort, making them slightly heavier than current Beats and Bose models. Obviously not ideal for a workout, the H9i are ideal for kick-back sessions. If you’re looking for such, I’d recommend their Beoplay E8 wireless set. Frankly, I was worried about keeping the material clean, but a gentle wipe down is enough, and worry not, a plush bag is offered to home your headphones when you’re not using them. 
Promising an 18-hour battery life, charging this gadget up is quick and easy using the 1.25m USB-A to USB-C cable provided. B&O don’t want their travelling clientèle to settle for the in-flight headphones, offering up a flight adapter which can be connected to the AUX cable provided. The light on the right ear-cup flashes orange when charging and turns green when the battery is full. 
However, connecting with devices isn’t always seamless and it takes a couple of tries at times. The white light indicates the device and the ANC are on, blue indicates pairing is underway and red alerts that pairing is unsuccessful. The H9i is equipped with an on-device touch interface that takes a little getting used to. Swiping in certain directions across the right ear-cup controls volume, track, ANC and Transparency Mode. 




Soul-stirring sound
In terms of comfort, those with more sensitive ears may feel a cabin-like pressure on the ears when first putting these on, due to the ANC. And the adjusting functions for fit are smooth. But overall, the H9i makes a strong case for quality listening, and is a major sound upgrade with memorable punches in certain songs and tracks. 
Downloading the Beoplay app to your phone lets you control the equaliser and create your own audio presets through a feature called ToneTouch. This is certainly quite the add-on and pretty ideal for those switching between podcasts, audiobooks, music and other media.
So what’s new with the H9i? B&O have upped their game with Transparency Mode, which enables listeners to tune into ambient sounds. Plus it’s also got proximity sensors for automatic play or pause when you put your headphones on or take it off.
Surprisingly, calls were clear and crisp on the H9i, something not so common among high-end headphones.
Retailing at around €499 (roughly ₹40,000) the H9i is an investment piece that can stick around in your listening arsenal for the future to come.

Thanos : A technological ‘marvel’
"," Thanos may be popular as a Marvel character, but also translates into a ‘never ending spirit’ and is an ode to the Greek philosopher Athanasius. The Hyderabad-startup named after the Greek word was established when drones were mostly used by hobbyists, photographers and videographers. Pradeep Palelli, CEO of Thanos, wanted to be more constructive and use drones to solve problems in the society. It took a year’s research to see what could come out of it. Marking a drastic transformation in life of farmers with the usage of an aerial-pesticide spraying technology and eliminating many health hazards that could potentially cause partial blindness among agriculturists, Thanos is moving into the future.
“We talked to hundreds of farmers in the Telugu states. Many complained of the non-availability of labour to spray pesticides in the fields, mostly due to the migration of people to urban areas. Even with the limited labour base, there were delays, complaints of overdosage/ underdosage of pesticides. Ideally, the spraying needs to be done with a helmet and a protective suit, which may not suit our climate conditions. One is prone to health hazards too. That’s when we realised this is an area ready for automation,” Pradeep says.




The startup co-founded by Pradeep and Prathyush Akepati, has Harish Alladi in its technical team and is backed by IIIT and ICRISAT. The tie-up has earned Thanos considerable access to summits/showcases across the country and opened them to a wide investor and academician base. The concept interested politicians, farmers and investors from Srikakulam, East Godavari initially. The regulations pertaining to drones are being worked in different states —Telangana, Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh. Thanos has tied up with field partners across tier-2 and tier-3 towns, with tractor-owners, weeders to take the solution to the market. For now, Thanos is providing the spraying as a service-model to farmers, but more intelligence aspects are being worked on, including identification of specific areas that need pesticides. 
“Many progressive farmers have expressed interest to buy the drones. They have the financial capacity, but they need to know more to fulfil it to its maximum capacity. We hire it on a per acre basis now,” Pradeep mentions. 
Paradigm shift
How have the farmers reacted to the change? “We are in the process of educating them. Even in the surveying part, many used to wonder if it was a mini helicopter that was landing. The idea of drones is gradually becoming mainstream across the country.”


Thanos takes up a low volume spraying method, uses less chemicals and covers more areas with uniform spreading. The startup is exploring avenues beyond agriculture; they’ve had discussions with the R&D wing of the Indian Army, besides opportunities for greenfield mining. 
“We are customising drones for hobbyists and serious operators too, we are also capable of repairing drones that others have built. Some of the other drone applications in future could be its use in emergencies as a first responder, tracking e-waste, for property tax billing and even pollination of flowers. There might be traffic management issues with drones, but that’s a few years away.”

Using multiple sclerosis drug to treat pancreatic cancer "," An FDA-approved drug currently used for treating multiple sclerosis has been found to be effective for pancreatic cancer. Researchers from Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology (RGCB), Thiruvananthapuram, in collaboration with Regional Cancer Centre in the city and NIMHANS, Bengaluru, found that the drug was also able to increase the efficacy of gemcitabine, the current standard drug for pancreatic cancer. The results of the study have been recently published in Theranostics.
The drug used to treat multiple sclerosis was found to act through a receptor called S1PR1 that is involved in lipid signalling and which regulates numerous cellular events such as cell growth, migration and vascular integrity.
“The precise role of the receptor in pancreatic cancer is still not clear and our study has brought out its importance. We found that the [multiple] sclerosis drug can bind to the receptor and alter the key cellular events and prevent the progression of pancreatic cancer,” explains Dr. K.B. Harikumar, from the Cancer Research Program at RGCB and corresponding author of the paper. The sclerosis drug was also found to be a potent inhibitor of NF-kappaB, a transcription factor that helps in tumour progression.
The effectiveness of the multiple sclerosis drug when used together with the current pancreatic cancer drug was checked in mice models. The combination drug treatment was able to control various signalling molecules, thereby decreasing cancer cell proliferation and increasing apoptosis. It also helped produce higher levels of reactive oxygen species and inhibited the migration of the cancer cells. They also studied the genes involved in inflammation and immunity in pancreatic cancer and found that the combination drug regime activated a tumour-suppressor gene and downregulated another that is involved in drug resistance and decreased immunity.
Better clinical outcome
The team also addressed one of the major problems in pancreatic cancer known as desmoplasia, which is the presence of a rich collagen deposition around tumour. Collagen deposition leads to poor clinical outcome due to decreased delivery of the drug to tumor. “In fact, gemcitabine itself leads to desmoplasia thereby reducing its own effect. We found that the combination drug therapy reduced desmoplasia. The [multiple] sclerosis drug loosens up the tumour and aids gemcitabine to penetrate into the tumour thereby increasing the bioavailability of the cancer drug,” adds Dr. Harikumar.
The combination strategy showed no toxicity to the normal human and mouse cell lines thereby pointing towards the promising possibility of using this for the treatment of pancreatic cancer.
“Repurposing existing drugs cuts down the time taken to bring drugs to clinical testing. Moreover, using combination drugs can reduce the dosage of the drugs thus reducing side-effects,” explains Manendra Babu Lankadasari, PhD scholar at the Centre and first author of the study in an email to The Hindu.

Bacteria develop resistance even without exposure to antibiotics
"," The environment where bacteria such as E. coli thrive can be complex with different stresses being present at the same time and changing unpredictably at different time scales — daily or seasonal. Researchers at Pune’s Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) found exciting results when they replicated these conditions in the lab — E. coli developed resistance to antibiotics and heavy metals even when the bacteria were not exposed to them.
Study design
When exposed to a combination of stresses — salt, pH and oxidative stress — that varied unpredictably on a daily basis, E. coli did not show statistically significant adaptability at the end of 30 days (170 generations). But bacteria did show improved fitness and better growth rate at the end of 100 days. Thirty days produce 170 generations of E. coli while 100 days produce 900 generations.
To make the environment complex, the researchers led by Sutirth Dey from IISER Pune’s Biology Division exposed the bacteria to one or two factors (says pH and salt) that were kept normal while one or two factors were abnormal and caused stress. Unpredictability was brought in by randomly changing the three factors that caused stress on a daily basis. Totally, 30 combinations that make the environment complex and unpredictable were used for the study.
“At the end of 30 days when compared with ancestors [or controls], the bacteria exposed to complex, unpredictable environment did not develop statistically significant advantage in terms of improved fitness,” says Shraddha Karve from IISER Pune’s Biology Division and first author of a paper published in the Journal of Evolutionary Biology.
Surprise finding
“But what came as a surprise was that the bacteria evolved the ability to tolerate novel stresses that they were not exposed to, such as antibiotics (norfloxacin) and heavy metals (cobalt and zinc),” says Dr. Karve. “We repeated the experiment all over again as the result was so surprising, and we got the same outcome.”
Another study in the Journal of Biosciences by the team confirmed that efflux pumps in bacteria show greater efficiency in throwing out antibiotics from inside (the bacteria) though they have not been able to precisely find out why and how the exposure to complex, unpredictable environment causes this.
The researchers also studied resistance at the population level. The bacteria that have already been exposed to 30 days of stress (pH, salt and oxidative stress) were then exposed to antibiotics or heavy metals. The whole population showed better growth rate than controls and could better resist antibiotics and heavy metal stress. 
“What we found was that the bacteria had much better efflux efficiency than the ancestors [controls]. It could be that during the 30 days of evolution the efflux pumps had greatly evolved either by working continuously or by becoming more efficient,” she says.
“Once the efflux pumps’ efficiency has been increased by exposure to other stresses, the ability to resist multiple drugs is only to be expected,” adds Prof. Dey.
Implications for public health
“It’s alarming that bacteria exposed to complex, unpredictable fluctuations can lead to resistance to antibiotics or heavy metals, and it could happen in about 30 days,” says Dr. Karve.
“Climatology studies have shown that variability in the environment has drastically increased in many parts of the world, India included. As a result, there is a possibility that bacteria could show increased efflux activity and greater resistance to antibiotics even when not exposed to them,” says Prof. Dey.
The isolated Amazonian tribe that had no contact with civilisation till recently showed drug resistance can arise even when not exposed to antibiotics. The gut bacteria of this population showed resistance to latest antibiotics, including synthetic antibiotics, which are not found naturally in soil.
Another study (Journal of Evolutionary Biology) by the team found that unlike bacteria which had not evolved to handle stress in 30 days, the ability to cope with stress was significantly better when the exposure to complex, unpredictable environment continued for 100 days. “Besides better growth rate and greater ability to tolerate stresses, the bacteria showed no variation in their ability to handle different stresses compared with ancestors,” she says.
In the latest study paper published a few days ago in the Journal of Evolutionary Biology, they investigated whether complexity or unpredictability that hinders adaptation over short term. And they found that bacteria could adapt to unpredictability when complexity was absent. They also found E. coli shows little adaptation to acidic pH as it is already very well adapted to it. In contrast, the bacteria show significant adaptation to salt, a stress for which it is poorly adapted to begin with.

The Banner Saga 3: Viking goodbye
"," 

While the giants of gaming usually play it safe, it’s the small studios and development teams that are brave enough to try something outrageous and magical. Stoic Studio is one such outfit. Comprised of former BioWare employees, they released the incredible Banner Saga. A hand-drawn epic that captured everyone’s hearts, so much so they released a sequel, and now the end to the trilogy. The Banner Saga 3 is a triumph in gaming, and a slap in the face to anyone who scoffs at gaming not being an art form.
What is it about?
For a game that is as story-heavy as The Banner Saga is, you’ll need to start from part one to make any sense of the third. Fortunately, Stoic has re-released the other games on all systems, but the game is especially good on the portable Nintendo Switch.
The Banner Saga is set in a Viking world that’s stuck in perpetual twilight. As the game drives you through the story, everything gets darker, and the narrative convincingly makes you feel like you are at the very edge of utter extinction. 
You truly feel for your band of characters, where every decision is well-placed and carries definitive weight. 




Once you start off on the story of one, there’s no way you can stop until you reach the end of three. Each loss hits hard, and every win tastes great, but is short-lived. The games are not too long, understandable, considering each story vignette is beautifully hand-crafted and acted out. The story is well-paced, and there’s almost no filler or bloat content employed to cheaply increase game length.
How does it play?
If you’ve played tactical RPG games like Final Fantasy Tactics, Disgaea or Tactics Ogre, then you will be at home with the mechanics of The Banner Saga 3.
Essentially, battles take place on a chess-like grid, where you move your heroes around and execute attacks. While it’s slow-paced, the incredible animated characters as well as the rich strategy of The Banner Saga will keep you hooked. It is tough though, and with each game up until 3, there are new mechanics and new enemy types to contend with.
The story puts you not only as a tactician in battle, but you also play a pivotal role as the leader of the factions. You will need to make decisions that impact the lives of people and push you along different paths in the story. The pace is relentless and The Banner Saga 3 stacks a palpable tension of battles and decisions that is worthy of a final act in the epic.
Now for the best part of the game, the art style. The Banner Saga series is hand-drawn, with beautiful character art which is inspired from the work of Ralph Bakshi, who attempted an animated The Lord of the Rings in the 70s, and Don Bluth, a prominent animator at Disney. Known for their unique styles, which are captured beautifully with Viking-like backgrounds. Every frame looks breathtaking and like it belongs in an art book. The sound design is incredible and the soundtrack by Austin Wintory is haunting. The Banner Saga is a breath of fresh winter air in an industry of same old, same old.




Should you get it?
It’s rich in story with an unforgiving tactical combat mechanic that may not appeal to everyone. Though if you want something deep to keep you company on your morning commute on the Switch, or challenges you while playing on your HDTV or PC, then you’re in for a real treat with The Banner Saga 3. Whatever you choose, just make sure you choose to play the entire trilogy, or you will end up not liking it.

ISRO to celebrate Sarabhai centenary, launch TV channel
"," The Indian Space Research Organisation will have a year-long Vikram Sarabhai centenary celebration starting in August 2019 to honour visionary scientist and its legendary founding father.
In a few months' time, it plans to roll out a dedicated ISRO TV channel showcasing space applications, developments and science issues and targeted at youngsters and people in remote areas in their language.
Sarabhai, the architect of the Indian space programme, the first ISRO chief and renowned cosmic ray scientist, was born on August 12, 1919.
Its tributes to Sarabhai start with naming the first Indian Moon landing spacecraft of the Chandrayaan-2 mission `Vikram'. The mission is planned for January 2019. “A chair each at Sarabhai's alma maters Cambridge University and Gujarat University, and MIT would be set up apart from giving awards, scholarships and fellowships in the country and abroad,” ISRO Chairman K. Sivan told at the news conference on Sunday which marked the 99th birthday of the legend. The events are being taken up with an initial outlay of ₹50 crore.
""We have planned a year-long centenary of the visionary architect of the space programme and our first Chairman, Dr Sarabhai, during 2019-20. A series of activities will be organised nationally and internationally to commemorate a great international scientist,"" Dr. Sivan said.
Earlier, former Chairman K. Kasturirangan unveiled a new bust of Sarabhai at the remodelled atrium of ISRO headquarters, Antariksh Bhavan, amidst a gathering of heads and staff of ISRO centres. Dr. Sivan said 100 lectures by science luminaries would be held across the country and in association with global space networking body, the International Astronautical Federation. Space clubs, knowledge centres, talk shows and awards are among the plans.
As it strengthens its public outreach, ISRO will shortly start allowing public to watch satellite launches from the Sriharikota launch centre. ""We are opening our space port to visitors just as NASA does. We are preparing separate systems for visitor entries. Selected students of classes 8 to 10 will be the trained at ISRO for a month and taken to various laboratories and centres across the country. Making of student satellites would be encouraged. We want to instil scientific temper and interest in space developments in youngsters,"" Dr. Sivan said.
Six Startup incubation centres were being set up across the country to tap the best brains. Technology cells would be started for industry and academia to improve the existing linkages.

Like it or not, Google tracks your movements ","Google wants to know where you go so badly that it records your movements even when you explicitly tell it not to.
An Associated Press investigation found that many Google services on Android devices and iPhones store your location data even if you’ve used privacy settings that say they will prevent it from doing so.
Computer-science researchers at Princeton confirmed these findings at the AP’s request.
For the most part, Google is upfront about asking permission to use your location information. An app like Google Maps will remind you to allow access to location if you use it for navigating. 
If you agree to let it record your location over time, Google Maps will display that history for you in a “timeline” that maps out your daily movements.
Storing your minute-by-minute travel details carries privacy risks and has been used by police to determine the location of suspects- such as a warrant that police in Raleigh, North Carolina, served on Google last year to find devices near a murder scene. So the company will let you “pause” a setting called Location History.
Google says that it will prevent the company from remembering where you’ve been. Google’s support page on the subject states: “You can turn off Location History at any time. With Location History off, the places you go are no longer stored.” That isn’t true. Even with Location History paused, some Google apps automatically store time-stamped location data without asking.
For example, Google stores a snapshot of where you are when you merely open its Maps app. Automatic daily weather updates on Android phones pinpoint roughly where you are. And some searches that have nothing to do with location, like “chocolate chip cookies,” or “kids science kits,” pinpoint your precise latitude and longitude — accurate to the square foot — and save it to your Google account. The privacy issue affects some two billion users of devices that run Google’s Android operating software and hundreds of millions of worldwide iPhone users who rely on Google for maps or search.
Storing location data in violation of a user’s preferences is wrong, said Jonathan Mayer, a Princeton computer scientist and former chief technologist for the Federal Communications Commission’s enforcement bureau.

Wandering around the web ","A true hero 
The world has been watching with bated breath for the rescue of a Thai football team of kids trapped in the Tham Luang Nang Non cave; the reason I have been refreshing Twitter all weekend. Now, the first group of boys has been expertly pulled to safety. Support for the rescue (let’s call it slacktivism) poured in from various corners of the web predictably. As Harsh Goenka tweeted, “The first time the entire world is cheering for the same football team. The resilience of the young boys, the bravery of the divers, the prayers from all corners — this mission reignites my faith in humanity.” Agreed.
But one thread on Twitter from user @yvonelim9 went particularly viral about the backstory of the 25-year-old assistant coach, Ekapol Chanthawong. The thread, having been shared and liked over 13,000 times, speaks of the orphaned boy who grew up wanting to be a monk and then proceeded to use football as a means for children to excel academically. For those raising an eyebrow at the legitimacy, the thread was taken from The Straits Times piece, in which the coach was described as the life-force for the team during this unimaginably tough time.




People like Chanthawong remind us to keep the good people around, especially when life and the Internet are teeming with some seriously questionable personalities.
Speaking of heroes 
Plant for the Planet is a global project worth getting your gardening hands dirty with. The organisation was started in 2007 by 9-year-old Felix Finkbeiner — who was inspired by Wangari Maathai, who planted 30 million trees in Africa in 30 years. He hopes for the world to have planted a trillion trees to save what we have left of our ecosystems.




And so far, Finkbeiner has observed 15,21,46,92,757 trees planted. I bring this up now because our world isn’t exactly thriving and young minds like those of Finkbeiner help secure a part of our future.

1.5 million penguins discovered on remote Antarctic islands
","A thriving “hotspot” of 1.5 million Adelie penguins, a species fast declining in parts of the world, has been discovered on remote islands off the Antarctic Peninsula, surprised scientists said Friday.
The first bird census of the Danger Islands unearthed over 750,000 Adelie breeding pairs, more than the rest of the area combined, the team reported in the journal Scientific Reports. The group of nine rocky islands, which lie off the northern tip nearest South America, in the northwest Weddell Sea, housed the third- and fourth-largest Adelie penguin colonies in the world, they found.
 




“It is certainly surprising and it has real consequences for how we manage this region,” study co-author Heather Lynch of Stony Brook University told AFP. Just 160 kilometres away on the west of the peninsula — a thin limb jutting out of West Antarctica — Adelie numbers have dropped about 70 percent in recent decades due to sea ice melt blamed on global warming.
“One of the ways in which this is good news is that other studies have shown this area (the eastern side of the Antarctic Peninsula) is likely to remain more stable under climate change than the western Antarctic Peninsula,” said Lynch. “So we end up with a large population of Adelie penguins in a region likely to remain suitable to them for some time.”
Adelies are one of five penguin species that live in and around the Antarctic continent. A medium-sized penguin, they grow to about 70 centimetres (almost 28 inches) tall, and weigh three to six kilogrammes (about seven to 13 pounds). They are identified by a white ring around the eye.
They are carnivores, and krill — shrimp-like creatures that are commercially fished in the area — is an Adelie staple.




 
The Danger Islands group was discovered thanks to Earth-monitoring satellites, said the research team from America, Britain and France. “This is called the Danger Islands for a reason,” said Lynch. “The area is covered by heavy sea ice most of the year, and even in the height of summer it is difficult to get into this region to do surveys.”
Even the most visited of the isles, Heroina Island at the chain’s northeastern tip, receives only about one ship landing per year. Evidence of the previously-unknown penguin colony first emerged in data from the Landsat Earth-monitoring satellites run by NASA and the US Geological Survey.
Lynch and her team “then went and looked at higher resolution commercial imagery to confirm the guano staining that our algorithms had picked up in the Landsat imagery,” she said. When the Landsat data originally suggested the presence of hundreds of thousands of penguins on the islands, she thought it “was a mistake”.
“We were surprised to find so many penguins on these islands, especially because some of these islands were not known to have penguins.” Then followed a field expedition for a census using a combination of drone footage, pictures taken on the ground, and an old fashioned walk-about headcount.
“We were... very lucky to have a window of time where the sea ice moved out and we could get a yacht in,” said Lynch. The Danger Islands, said the team, has felt the ravages of climate change less than the western peninsula, and knew very little human activity.
Now it turns out, the area may need stronger protection from overfishing. “The most important implication of this work is related to the design of Marine Protected Areas in the region,” said Lynch. “Now that we know this tiny island group is so important, it can be considered for further protection from fishing.”
In addition to Adelies, the team also found about 100 nests of gentoo penguins, and about 27 nests of chinstrap penguins. The polar regions are warming more rapidly than the rest of Earth as heat-trapping greenhouse gasses from fossil fuel-burning build up in the atmosphere.

World’s fastest man-made spinning object developed
","Scientists have developed the fastest man-made rotor in the world, which they believe will help them study quantum mechanics. At more than 60 billion revolutions per minute, this machine is more than 100,000 times faster than a high-speed dental drill.
“This study has many applications, including material science. We can study the extreme conditions different materials can survive in,” said Tongcang Li, an assistant professor at Purdue University in the US.
The team synthesised a tiny dumbbell from silica and levitated it in high vacuum using a laser. The laser can work in a straight line or in a circle – when it is linear, the dumbbell vibrates, and when it is circular, the dumbbell spins.  A spinning dumbbell functions as a rotor, and a vibrating dumbbell functions like an instrument for measuring tiny forces and torques, known as a torsion balance.
 




These devices were used to discover things like the gravitational constant and density of Earth, but Li hopes that as they become more advanced, they will be able to study things like quantum mechanics and the properties of vacuum.
Quantum mechanics is a fundamental theory in physics which describes nature at the smallest scales of energy levels of atoms and subatomic particles.
“People say that there is nothing in vacuum, but in physics, we know it’s not really empty,” Li said. “There are a lot of virtual particles which may stay for a short time and then disappear. We want to figure out what’s really going on there, and that’s why we want to make the most sensitive torsion balance.”
By observing this tiny dumbbell spin faster than anything before it, Li’s team may also be able to learn things about vacuum friction and gravity. Understanding these mechanisms is an essential goal for the modern generation of physics, Li said.

Have you played these games before? "," What if we told you that a lawyer game or one where you process papers can be exciting? Welcome, intrepid reader, to the road that is not oft tread in video gaming. Where unusual ideas take you to brave, new territory. Here’s a list of games that are unlike any you’ve played before.
Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney series
A legend in gaming, the Phoenix Wright Ace case files are pure gaming caviar. Spanning several games, each one tells the story of the rise of an attorney Phoenix Wright, as he fights against all odds to win his cases. With a cast of colourful characters as well as worthy opponents, the cases are deviously planned with an excellent overarching story. The original trilogy is available on iOS and Android, as well as Ace Attorney – Dual Destinies. There is a latest game out — Spirit of Justice — but it’s only on the Nintendo 3DS for now. There’s even a crossover with Professor Layton vs Phoenix Wright, which combines two characters from two very unusual series.




Undertale
While using the same familiar garb of a classic 16-bit era top-down role-playing game format, Undertale is unusual and exciting because of its excellent characters, writing that will make you laugh in delight and monsters that will make you squeal in delight. Aping games from Dragon Quest to Final Fantasy, Undertale is just one of a kind. Now also available on Nintendo Switch.
Might & Magic: Clash of Heroes
You’ve seen this before — a classic tale of heroes versus monsters. Except this has a twist in the battle system. Offering a very familiar Tetris slash Candy Crush sort of mechanic, where you match up the monsters to send waves of them against the enemy to crush their defences. A very unusual game that tells a superb story that seems to slip into obscurity. Perfect if you want a puzzle game with more oomph in it.
Danganronpa series
Leaning deep towards the darker side of Japanese storytelling, Danganronpa is a visual novel that’s in the vein of Phoenix Wright. Except that you’re a student that’s been locked in a school with other students and an evil bear. The only way one can escape is to murder and get away with it — making it an investigation and courtroom-style drama. That pairs some intense storytelling, typography and design with some truly mad characters. Also worth exploring are the somewhat similar Zero Escape: The Nonary Games, which sort of deal with the same ‘escape a hopeless situation’ through a puzzles theme.




Gone Home
A first-person shooter, where you don’t shoot at all. Gone Home is a story exploration game that’s in first person, where you play a character coming home and finding traces of what happened to her family. A magic realist tale that spans decades across a family tree, as you’re drawn into the rabbit hole of stories as to how the denizens of this deserted house lived and died.




Dark Souls
The game that kickstarted the sub-genre ‘Masocore’ is exciting on many levels. With masochistic levels of difficulty, this game will twist your perception of game difficulty. The more it punishes you, the more you come back to defeat it. Spawning several sequels as well as other ‘Masocore’ games like Nioh and Bloodborne. Yet, what it does dazzle in is a deep medieval combat system and a grisly, magical and beautiful story you have to peel like an onion, complete with tears.
Papers, Please
The most unusual of the lot, this game has you playing a border checkpoint agent in some godforsaken country. The objective is to let the right people in, except how do you know who the right people are. Sometimes the innocent and those seeking help for real look like terrorists, while the real threats look like they couldn’t hurt a fly. A masterful game that keeps flipping the proverbial table so many times, your head will spin.




This War of Mine
In a world that’s dangerously close to careening towards a war, this is an important game you need to play. Where many games focus on the glory of a conflict, This War of Mine is a survival game that lets you play as civilians just trying to get by, while all hell breaks loose around you. If you thought this game was heart wrenching, The Little Ones downloadable content will completely tear it away — focusing on a bunch of children as they survive.

Decreasing ‘greenness’ in India’s forests
"," Most forests are green. But a recent study finds that this ‘greenness’ is consistently decreasing across more than 46 lakh hectares of various types of forest in India, particularly in core protected areas. This indicates that our forests are vulnerable, write scientists.
India's diverse forests face several threats including forest degradation, as the loss of greenness signifies. Scientists at Hyderabad's National Remote Sensing Centre analysed NASA’s MODIS satellite images of India’s forests at eight-day intervals for 15 years (2001 to 2014) and assessed the persistent decreases in greenness. Using an index that determines the amount forest “vigour,” they assessed the seasonal greenness of 14 different forest types: the negative the trend of greenness over years, the more degraded and vulnerable the forest.
They found that the highest degradation is in moist deciduous forests (more than 20 lakh hectares), especially in the states of Chhatisgarh, Odisha, Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh. Wet evergreen forests – including those in the Western Ghats and Eastern Himalayas – are also affected, with the major changes observed in Karnataka and Arunachal Pradesh, followed by Kerala and Meghalaya. More than 15% of India’s total mangrove forests also showed a decrease in greenness. Nearly 80% of these changes occurred in ‘core’ forests like protected areas.
Using statistical analyses, the team determined the ‘spots’or areas where the decrease in seasonal greenness were high and spatially contiguous. West Bengal was a major hotspot of mangrove degradation. Arunachal Pradesh, Kerala, Karnataka and Meghalaya were hotspots of decreasing greenness of wet evergreen forests while Manipur, Tamil Nadu, Mizoram, Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh showed degraded montane (high-elevation) wet forests.
According to the authors, the result of this study could provide first hand information to prioritise and plan conservation of these areas or restore them to their original glory. However, while the study identifies the hotspots where decreasing greenness is a worry, it does not identify what caused this problem.
“This decreasing greenness could be due to natural or anthropogenic factors that we have not identified in the study,” said Abhishek Chakraborty, lead author of the study published in Ecological Indicators. “It could be due to changing climates, shifts in monsoon patterns, decreasing soil fertility or the impact of human activities.”

NASA names Sunita Williams, 8 others, for first space flights on commercial spacecraft
"," Indian-origin U.S. astronaut Sunita Williams is among the nine astronauts named by NASA who will fly the first missions into space on commercially provided rockets and capsules, starting next year.
 After years of vehicle development and building anticipation, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has now put the crew in commercial crew spacecraft.
The space agency announced on Friday that the nine astronauts will launch on the first crewed test flights and missions of new commercial spacecraft built and operated by The Boeing Company and SpaceX.
“Future Commercial Crew astronauts will be riding to space on partner vehicles built by SpaceX & BoeingSpace,” NASA said in a tweet.
“We are on the brink of launching American astronauts on American rockets from American soil,” said NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine during the ‘Launch America’ announcement.
 The eight active NASA astronauts and one former astronaut-turned-corporate crew member will launch on Boeing CST-100 Starliner and SpaceX Dragoncapsules to the International Space Station beginning in 2019.
 The missions will mark the first crewed launches from U.S. soil since the end of the space shuttle programme in 2011.
“Today, our country’s dreams of greater achievements in space are within our grasp. This accomplished group of American astronauts, flying on new spacecraft developed by our commercial partners Boeing and SpaceX, will launch a new era of human spaceflight,” Mr. Bridenstine said. 
He said the announcement advances “our great American vision” and strengthens America’s leadership in space.
 NASA has worked closely with the companies throughout design, development and testing to ensure the systems meet its safety and performance requirements.
“The men and women we assign to these first flights are at the forefront of this exciting new time for human spaceflight,” said Mark Geyer, director of NASA’s Johnson Space Center in Houston.
“It will be thrilling to see our astronauts lift off from American soil, and we can’t wait to see them aboard the International Space Station,” Mr. Geyer said.
 In addition to naming the crews of the test flights, NASA also announced the four astronauts who will fly aboard the first operational Starliner and Dragon missions to the space station. Both vehicles were developed in cooperation with NASA to deliver crew members to and from the orbiting laboratory.
 Josh Cassada, 45, will fly with Sunita (“Suni”) Williams, 52, aboard NASA’s first contracted Starliner mission. It will be Mr. Cassada’s first spaceflight. Ms. Williams previously logged 321 days in orbit on two stays aboard the space station, most recently returning to the Earth in 2012.
 The commercial crew members took to the stage during an event led by Bridenstine at the agency’s Johnson Space Center in Houston.
 NASA astronauts Robert Behnken, 48, and Douglas Hurley, 51, will fly together as SpaceX’s first Dragon crew.
 Veterans of two spaceflights each, Mr. Behnken and Mr. Hurley will lift off atop a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from the Kennedy Space Center’s Pad 39A — the same Florida launch pad where the space shuttle left Earth for the last time in July 2011 with Mr. Hurley as pilot.
 NASA astronauts Eric Boe, 53, and Nicole Mann, 41, will join the commander of that same final space shuttle mission, former astronaut and now Boeing executive Christopher Ferguson, 56, as the crew of the Starliner test flight, launching atop a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket from Complex 41 at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida.
 Mr. Ferguson, who has been involved from the start in the Starliner’s development, flew three shuttle missions as a NASA astronaut. Mr. Boe piloted two shuttle flights. This will be Ms. Mann’s first launch, having joined the astronaut corps in 2013.
 Mr. Behnken, Mr. Hurley, Mr. Boe and Ms. Mann are NASA’s first astronauts to be named to the test flights of new U.S. spacecraft since the March 1978 announcement of the space shuttle’s first orbital flight test crews. Mr. Ferguson will become the first former NASA astronaut to return to orbit as a company’s crew member when he flies.
 Prior to their maiden crewed missions, both Boeing and SpaceX plan uncrewed test flights in late 2018 or early 2019.
 Both companies will also conduct abort system test flights to ensure the astronauts can safely escape should their rockets go awry.
 Victor Glover, 42, and Michael Hopkins, 49, will fly on the first operational mission of SpaceX’s crewed Dragon. It will be Mr. Glover’s first time in space. Mr. Hopkins logged 166 days aboard the space station in 2014.
 The two pairs of NASA crewmates will fly to the station with Russian cosmonauts and international astronauts to be announced at a later date. Between the end of the space shuttle program and the start of commercial crew operations, NASA’s crew members have and are continuing to launch to the space station on Russian Soyuz spacecraft.
Mr. Behnken, Mr. Boe, Mr. Hurley and Mr. Williams were named in 2015 as NASA’s “commercial crew cadre” and have been working with Boeing and SpaceX on the development of the spacecraft and the simulators that will be used to train astronauts to fly.
 Boeing’s and SpaceX’s commercial spacecraft may also open the space station — and more broadly, Earth orbit — to more privately-funded visitors and spaceflight participants from countries that do not have their own domestic crewed spacecraft and rockets.

Seven free-to-play games that are worth your time
"," The very words ‘Free to Play’ in the context of video games is not necessarily a good thing. While everyone loves freebies, usually these games come with a lot of micro transaction baggage. In many cases, there are games that start out promising and end up becoming hives of toxic players and empty rooms. However, with innovative concepts unfettered by micro transactions and a strong focus on growing a community, there are some games that are really worth your time. Which is important, especially when these games demand the most important currency of all, time.




Warframe
This popular and innovative third person shooter/brawler has been around for a while. Warframe has recently got renewed popularity with a slew of new updates as well as an eventual release on Nintendo Switch. You play an ancient warrior called a Tenno, clad in an armour called Warframes, you are recently activated to save the universe from The Grineer. With shades of Destiny in it's sci-fi world, you and your friends can play through the storyline in Player vs Environment battles or take the fight to other players in the Conclave. 
Asphalt 9: Legends
The much awaited followup to the most popular racer on mobile and tablets is here. Though. Asphalt 9 is still in closed beta, you can try a few VPN tricks to get it working in India. The visceral speed, intensity and style of the original is back and amped up, Asphalt 9 brings power ups that are a lot like 2010's Blur and Mario Kart. Which grants you speed and other abilities. What we did notice too that Asphalt 9 borrows the whole action movie style collapsing environments factor from a fun game called Split:Screen. Making a fun frankenracing game of sorts that is absolutely fun. Also, the game looks amazing, especially those particle effects when you pick up powerups.




Brawlhalla
No one expected a fighting game from the house of Nintendo to be as much fun as Smash Bros. was. So much so that's it's become an e-sport with a strong following. Brawlhalla is a free to play Smash Bros. clone that's much more than just a clone. With retro looking pixel graphic background and handdrawn characters that fly around the screen hacking and slashing. The premise is simple, knock the other player off the stage. Under the cartoony graphics lies a tough to master, fun to play fighting game. 
 




Gwent
Fans of Witcher 3 will recognise Gwent, the card game that was omnipresent in the world of Geralt of Rivia, as he challenged several prominent non player characters during his travels. Finally Gwent got so popular that it was spawned of into it's own game. A worthy contender to Hearthstone, Gwent is a turn based card game that lets you play powerful cards with magical abilities. Winners get resources and card decks, adding the fun of collecting cards into the equation. Especially if you are a Witcher fan, a lot of cards are clever appearances by characters in the series. 




Star Wars: The Old Republic
A free to play Star Wars massively multiplayer online role playing game, made by legendary studio Bioware. Where do we sign up. A game that's been going strong since 2008, complete with a storyline that dates back to long before the time of Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker. Where you can chose between the dark and light side and fight for or against good or evil, changing sides at will, as well as building your characters class to complement your teams. Microtransations and subscription only shows up later in the game as you level up. 




Elder Scrolls: Legends
Much like Hearthstone and Gwent, Elder Scrolls: Legends is a fantasy card game set in the Elder Scrolls universe. Which is home to games like Skyrim, Morrowind and Oblivion. Working on the same turn based card concept, that involves not only cards but also magicka. The winner has to reduce his opponents health to zero by using clever combinations of magicka and card plays. With cards featuring artwork from across the Elder Scrolls lore and universe, thats great for any fan of the series. 




Fortnite
 What started as an Overwatch clone has now become a sensation after redefining itself into a Battle Royale game, even dropping PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds from the top charts. With it's zany presentation, superb gameplay mechanics and the surprising appearance of a story that has the entire community agog with fascination as the mysteries behind the map is revealed. Apart from the usual third person shooting action, you get to mine and collect materials to build all sorts of bunkers from which you can thin the herd. The game is out on all platforms, from PC, to consoles, smartphones and tablets and now, the Nintendo Switch. All with their own thriving communities of players.

Failure and faith
"," Like most football fans the world over, I spent late Saturday night last week, glued to a screen, watching the finals of the UEFA Champions League between Liverpool and Real Madrid, arguably one of the biggest matches in professional football. That Real Madrid won 3-1 was a result that surprised nobody really, though it disappointed many. However, the two big individual stories of that night mirrored certain patterns one sees in the entrepreneurial and startup world.
Take the biggest story of the night, for example, that of the Liverpool goalkeeper Loris Karius. He was a goalkeeping talent who at one point was considered to be at the same level, or even better, than the similarly-hairstyled David de Gea, who is now acknowledged to be one of the best goalkeepers in European football. 
But the only image that people will remember is of Karius, crying inconsolably, hands folded, apologising to Liverpool fans everywhere for two utterly improbable mistakes. He definitely did not plan for these. His coach, or investor sort of, believed that he was a better choice than Simon Mignolet, someone of comparable skill but lesser pedigree. He was just like a founder with great background and history that everyone — investors and otherwise — believes will result in unerring success. 
But something as trivial as two wrong decisions can change everything. Like it did for Karius. Karius right now is being courted by a third-tier Italian club, Rimini, in all seriousness. Hopefully, he need not accept the offer, but the startup world is littered with instances of those who had to accept similar changes. Take for example, the brashest entrepreneur out of IIT Bombay, who to be fair, upended a lot of what a startup dealing with real estate could do. If Karius does end up at Rimini, we’ll all do well to remember it is no ignominy, just as a superstar of the ‘housing’ sector working at a less fancied firm is.
Now, for the other big story of that night. Gareth Bale’s first goal. It was a feat of unimaginable athleticism that had enough visual appeal to go down in history as one of the greatest ever goals in competition history. For all the cachet that Bale has, for all the cachet that the BBC (Bale Benzema Cristiano) attack formation has, Bale’s star had been waning. When he was brought on as a substitute, it felt more like a defensive move than one that is attacking. Yet, he comes on. And his first touch is a bicycle kick that goes straight into goal. The only goal of the night for Real Madrid that did not depend on Karius’ nightmare performance. A goal that reminded many of the silliness of writing talented people off. Again something that happens all too often in the startup world. Investors tend to be so obsessed with what is fresh in the entrepreneurial funnel that they completely ignore people whose ideas demonstrably work.
They say it is too wishy-washy to draw real-life analogies from sports. But as far as I care, sports keeps proving this idea wrong.

Einstein’s gravity theory passes extreme test, says study published in Nature
"," Albert Einstein’s insights into gravity hold true even in one of the most extreme scenarios the universe can offer, according to a study.
Einstein’s understanding of gravity, as outlined in his general theory of relativity, predicts that all objects fall at the same rate, regardless of their mass or composition.
This theory has passed test after test here on Earth, but scientists have wondered whether it still holds true for some of the most massive and dense objects in the known universe, an aspect of nature known as the Strong Equivalence Principle.
The new findings, published in the journal Nature, show that Einstein’s insights into gravity still hold sway, even in one of the most extreme scenario.
To date, Einstein’s equations have passed all tests, from careful laboratory studies to observations of planets in our solar system.
 However, alternatives to Einstein’s general theory of relativity predict that compact objects with extremely strong gravity, like neutron stars, fall a little differently than objects of lesser mass.
That difference, these alternate theories predict, would be due to a compact object’s so-called gravitational binding energy - the gravitational energy that holds it together.
Withstanding tests
 In 2011, the National Science Foundation’s (NSF) Green Bank Telescope (GBT) discovered a natural laboratory to test this theory in extreme conditions: a triple star system called PSR J0337+1715, located about 4,200 light-years from Earth.
This system contains a neutron star in a 1.6-day orbit with a white dwarf star, and the pair in a 327-day orbit with another white dwarf further away.
“This is a unique star system,” said Ryan Lynch of the Green Bank Observatory in the US.
“We don’t know of any others quite like it. That makes it a one-of-a-kind laboratory for putting Einstein’s theories to the test,” he said.
Since its discovery, the triple system has been observed regularly by the GBT, the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope in the Netherlands, and the NSF’s Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico.
If alternatives to Einstein’s picture of gravity were correct, then the neutron star and the inner white dwarf would each fall differently towards the outer white dwarf.
“The inner white dwarf is not as massive or compact as the neutron star, and thus has less gravitational binding energy,” said Scott Ransom, an astronomer with the National Radio Astronomy Observatory in the US.
Through meticulous observations and careful calculations, the researchers were able to test the system’s gravity using the pulses of the neutron star alone.
They found that any acceleration difference between the neutron star and inner white dwarf is too small to detect.
“If there is a difference, it is no more than three parts in a million,” said Nina Gusinskaia from the University of Amsterdam in the Netherlands.
This places severe constraints on any alternative theories to general relativity, researchers said.
The result is ten times more precise that the previous best test of gravity, making the evidence for Einstein’s Strong Equivalence Principle that much stronger, they said.

Taxonomy on the verge of extinction: Ministry
","When P.T. Cherian started working on the group of Chrolopidae, commonly called grass flies, there were only about seven species from the group known in the country. At present, the family is known by 1,100 species from India and adjacent countries.
Conferred the E. K. Janaki Ammal award for Animal Taxonomy, the highest award in the field of taxonomy by the government earlier this month, Dr. Cherian is credited with the discovery of about 700 new species, 20 new genera from the Chloropidae, a family from Diptera, in his career spanning five decades.
Speaking to The Hindu, the 75-year-old taxonomist referred to his discovery of four new species of Siphunculina genus of Chloropidae flies responsible for spreading eye diseases in humans.
Majority undiscovered
Dr. Cherian, however, said there was a need to look beyond his achievements. and there was a lot of work pending as far as animal taxonomy, particularly taxonomy of insects was concerned.
“About 88% of the insects are yet to be discovered and named. If these insects are not discovered, many will become extinct before they are even known to us,” Dr. Cherian, a visiting faculty at the University of Kerala said.
Like Dr. Cherian, S.R.Yadav, is the E. K Janaki Ammal award winner for Plant Taxonomy for 2017. Dr. Yadav, who established the School of Angiosperm Taxonomy at Shivaji University, Kolhapur, Maharashtra, is credited with the discovery of about 60 species of plants. They include Trithuria Konkanensis, a very ancient group of angiosperms found in the Konkan region along with Crinum Malabaricum, a species with largest leaves in the genus Crinum known for its medicinal properties in the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease.
Echoing Dr. Cherian’s thoughts, the plant taxonomist described taxonomy as the “mother branch of biology”. “If the country does not have enough taxonomists, will scientists from abroad come to identify plants in India?” he said. If proper studies are undertaken, scientists can discover 5,000-10,000 plants across the country in the next few decades, he said.
Another taxonomist S. Shivaji, who is credited with the discovery of 82 new species and eight new genera of extremophilic micro-organisms (microbes that are found in very severe conditions), is the recipient of the E.K. Janaki Ammal award in the area of taxonomy of micro organisms.
Dr. Shivaji, who has done most of his work at the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology, Hyderabad, said that while researchers these days like to play around with genes, taxonomy is a basic science and if there is any problem in identification of a species it will have a lot of downstream effect on other areas of science as well.
The solution is that universities, other than the Zoological Survey of India and the Botanical Survey of India, will have to train taxonomists by encouraging students to take up field work.
Interestingly, India is a mega biodiversity country. So far, 1,01,167 faunal species have been recorded in the country, which is about 6.45 % of faunal species found in the world. Similarly, about 49,003 floral species, which is 11.4 % of the world flora, is found in India.
No takers
The Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, in response to a question in the Lok Sabha in April 2018, admitted that this traditional science is on the verge of extinction.
“It is mainly due to lack of interest among students in the discipline and significantly lower career prospects. The science of taxonomy has been declining for several years now, with very few qualified practising taxonomists and teachers in lndia,” was the response of the Ministry to a question.

Nanoparticles therapy a double blow to cancer ","A new cancer therapy using nanoparticles to deliver a combination therapy direct to cancer cells could be on the horizon, scientists say. 
The therapy, which has been shown to make breast cancer and prostate cancer tumours more sensitive to chemotherapy, is now close to entering clinical trials, said researchers from the University of East Anglia in the U.K.
A study, published in the journal Scientific Reports, confirmed that it can be mass-produced, making it a viable treatment if proved effective in human trials.
The technology is the first of its kind to use nanoparticles to deliver two drugs in combination to target cancer cells.
The drugs, already approved for clinical use, are an anti-cancer drug called docetaxel, and fingolimod, which is used to treat multiple sclerosis.
 “So far nobody has been able to find an effective way of using fingolimod in cancer patients because it’s so toxic in the blood,” said Dmitry Pshezhetskiy from UEA.
 “We have found a way to use it that solves the toxicity problem, enabling these two drugs to be used in a highly targeted and powerful combination,” he said.

In China, robots deliver snacks at home ","Along a quiet residential street in Beijing, a yellow and black cube about the size of a small washing machine trundles leisurely to its destination.
This “little yellow horse” is an autonomous delivery robot, ferrying daily essentials like drinks, fruit and snacks from the local store to the residents of the “Kafka” compound in the Chinese capital.
Equipped with a GPS system, cameras and radar, the robots are seen by their creator as the future of logistics in China. The company estimates that eventually one billion packages will be delivered every day.
At a less than overwhelming pace of 3 km per hour — a slow human walk — the robot has room for improvement, said one customer as she removed a packet of nuts from its bowels. “The weak point is that it cannot deliver directly to the door like a human,” said the customer, who does not live on the ground floor. “But it’s still quite practical. The robot delivers relatively quickly,” she said.
The robot takes advantage of Chinese consumers’ love of cashless payments and smartphone shopping. China is the world’s biggest online shopping market with more than half of its population making at least one smartphone purchase per month, according to professional services firm PricewaterhouseCoopers. This compares to 14% in the rest of the world.
The robots have four cameras that scan the world around them and a laser tele-detection system allowing them to avoid obstacles.

Human ubers and viral videos - ramblings from the web "," 
Not quite laziness 2.0
Why leave the comfort of your home when you can just strap a live feed of yourself to another human being’s face and have them be your puppet? On that note, last month the concept of a ‘human uber’ went wild. In his quest to merge computer-augmented interaction with real-world environments, University of Tokyo’s Professor Jun Rekimoto breathed life into his telepresence project ChameleonMask.
Now the concept is making rounds on the net again, compelling some serious chat about getting this off the ground for real. 
According to Rekimoto Lab, “a surrogate user wears a mask-shaped display that shows a remote user’s live face, and a voice channel transmits a remote user’s voice,” while being careful to “eliminate many difficulties of teleoperated robots wandering in the environment.” Dystopian and thoughtful.
I don’t want to decrease the potential value of this project to people’s laziness; those who can really benefit from such a project include people with autoimmune diseases who’d love to step out, even if it’s virtual, or even those with crippling social anxiety who want to take small steps towards interactions.
Worth the wait?
For the past few months, WhatsApp has let us cover up our mistakes by pushing out a ‘delete after sent’ feature, which has honestly saved us from so much trouble — the catch was that one would have a seven-minute window to delete such a mistake, unless the receiver checks their messages frantically. Now, the messaging platform has extended that window to 68 minutes.
Available to a handful of Android users for the time being, the feature is being tested in beta version 2.18.69. So, yes, testing doesn’t mean confirmed implementation. So we’ll wait... for an hour, maybe. Seriously, WhatsApp, do you know how much help that would be to a sometimes-irresponsible texter?




Old school, new mindset
I’m not very good at writing in straight lines across guideline-less surfaces; so naturally, when I watched videos of Ghanaian teacher Richard Appiah Akoto conjuring a word processing program on a blackboard for his students, my jaw was on the floor and my mouth was catching flies. 
The genius was teaching IT to his students at Betenase M/A Junior High School in Sekyedomase, and when his Facebook post of this particular educational escapade went viral, he was immediately dubbed ‘Owura Kwadwo’, until he was finally identified. 
Detailed labelling of the various task bars and the shortcuts are seen, and the whole experience gave us serious pause, as a majority of the schools in third-world and developing countries don’t have computers and ready Internet at their disposal. It gave Microsoft pause too; they reached out to Akoto and offered him solutions to these logistical challenges: computers and software.
It’s nice, to say the least, that when matter goes viral, it’s not just the trolling that captures attention, but resulting helpful collaborations.

IISc researchers find asthma drug effective in treating TB "," A drug (Pranlukast) currently used for treating asthma has been found to be effective against tuberculosis, researchers from the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bengaluru, have found. Studies carried out in mice models found the drug to be effective in treating TB both when used alone and in combination with an anti-TB drug rifampicin. The results of the study have been published in EMBO Molecular Medicine.
Besides speeding up the process of drug discovery by repurposing an existing drug, the highlight of the study is the new approach adopted by researchers led by Prof. Avadhesha Surolia from the Molecular Biophysics Unit at IISc to zero in on the asthma drug. The drug uses a unique strategy to target the TB bacteria and is therefore quite unlikely to cause any adverse side-effects either to the human cells or the beneficial bacteria found in humans. 
Most of the current anti-TB drugs target either the RNA synthesis (transcription) or cell-wall synthesis of the bacteria. “But we decided to look for drugs that target the arginine (an amino acid) biosynthesis pathway that is essential for the survival of the TB bacteria as well the pathogenesis [process by which the bacteria cause the disease],” says Prof. Surolia.
Many steps make up the arginine biosynthesis pathway and one of them involves an enzyme ArgJ (Ornithine acetyltransferase) which is essential for the survival and virulence of TB bacteria. The ArgJ enzyme is unique to TB bacteria and its counterpart neither exists in humans nor in the beneficial bacteria of human microbiome. This makes the ArgJ an exciting target for drug development and is very unlikely to cause any harmful side-effects in the human host.
To further reduce the chances of the chosen drug causing any side-effects, the researchers decided to target a unique site on the ArgJ enzyme that is not found in other proteins described so far. “If you target the active site in the enzyme, there is a possibility that the drug will target the same site in other biochemical reactions in the body,” explains Prof. Surolia.
Based on these conditions, the researchers carried out in silico computational modelling of all FDA-approved drugs that bind to the site. After screening 1,400 drugs, 34 were found to be binding to the site. “Of the 34, we tested 15 drugs for their ability to bind to the enzyme site, and two drugs — Pranlukast (anti-asthma drug) and Sorafenib (anti-cancer drug) — were found to have inhibitory action,” he says.
Effective drug
Both these drugs were tested in vitro and were found to be effective in curtailing the growth of TB bacteria. “The asthma drug was found to be more effective in curtailing the growth when used alone and in combination with other anti-TB drugs — rifampicin and isoniazid,” says Archita Mishra from IISc and first author of the paper. “The combination of asthma drug and the two anti-TB drugs was significantly better in killing the bacteria than the currently used first-line combination drugs — rifampicin, isoniazid and ethambutol.”
“Like the asthma drug, ethambutol is also a metabolic inhibitor. So replacing ethambutol with the asthma drug for the combination therapy would be a viable strategy,” Mishra adds.
Both the drugs were also able to kill the bacteria found inside the macrophages (white blood cells) without causing any harmful side-effects to the macrophages. 
The potency of the asthma drug was much higher than expected. This would mean that lesser amount of the drug will be sufficient to kill the bacteria within the macrophages. The higher potency comes from the drug’s ability to counter the survival strategy of the TB bacteria. When bacteria infect the macrophages, they usually cause inflammation within the cells, which helps the bacteria multiply. The asthma drug was able to prevent the bacteria from causing inflammation thereby proving to be more potent in killing them.
“Since the drug targets the pathogen as well as the host pathway, it could potentially help in treating multidrug-resistant TB bacteria,” says Mishra. The researchers are already working in that direction. 
Animal trials
Even in mice models, the drug was more effective in killing the TB bacteria both when used alone and in combination with rifampicin. There were fewer granulomas in the drug-treated mice. “Our studies show that ethambutol can be replaced with the asthma drug,” he says. 
The researchers plan to test the drug on guinea pigs in a few months’ time. The efficacy will be tested by using it alone and in combination with rifampicin. “If we get encouraging results from guinea pig studies, we can straight away conduct Phase II trials in humans, as the safety of the drug is already proven,” says Prof. Surolia.

Novel packaging extends shelf-life of chicken
"," Now, chicken kept in the chiller of the fridge may remain fresh and without any bacterial contamination for up to two weeks thanks to researchers from Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC), Mumbai. The researchers have developed a new eco-friendly food-packaging material using mango peel extracts and three other biodegradable polymers to extend the shelf-life of chicken. The packaging film showed good antimicrobial properties against common food microbes and also exhibited high antioxidant characteristics.
Peels from four different mango varieties were used for the study — Alphonso, Kesar, Langra and Badami. The peel content was extracted using different techniques and the bioactive properties, antioxidant and antimicrobial activity of the extracts were studied.
Amongst the four mango peel varieties studied, the Langra variety extract exhibited the highest inhibition against Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas fluorescens. It was also rich in bioactive compounds like phenolics and carotenoids and thus had high degree of antioxidant capacity.
The packaging films were then made using the Langra extract (5%), polyvinyl alcohol, gelatin and cyclodextrin. “All the ingredients are biodegradable, and the new film can be a viable option for developing new eco-friendly packaging material. Also, India is one of the highest producers of mango, and the peel, which is usually thrown away, has higher phenolic content than the pulp and can serve as a good antioxidant,” explains Dr. Sweetie R. Kanatt, Senior Scientific Officer from the Food Technology Division of the Centre and first author of the paper published in Journal of Food Safety.
The packaging film was 150 microns in thickness and exhibited good tensile and puncture strength. The package was then tested for storing minced chicken meat.
The meat was stored at 2–4˚C and tested every three days. The meat packed using the mango peel film was able to keep the meat fresh and without spoilage for up to 12 days whereas the ones packed in normal polythene bag got spoilt within three days. 
“Meat has high lipid content that is prone to oxidation on storage/processing. We wanted to check how the film preserved the meat from both microbial spoilage and oxidative rancidity,” adds Dr. Kanatt. “Increase in shelf life as well as safety of the meat will be a boon to the food processer as they can store this meat in chilled rather than frozen state. Film preparation methods are being fine-tuned for possible commercial applications.”

What do you do with a whale that won't explode?
","The residents of Trout River in Newfoundland, Canada have a stinking whale of a problem. What to do with the 81-feet-carcass of Balaenoptera musculus on their shore?
While such an occurrence is not uncommon, the blue whale of Trout River is a worry because some dead marine mammals can explode. In 2013 an >exploding sperm whale was recorded on camera.
In 2004, in the hope of studying it, Chinese scientists decided to move the carcass of a 60-ton sperm whale through the city of Tainan, Taiwan. While on the tractor-trailer, the sperm whale exploded, showering stores, cars and onlookers >with whale insides.
Whales explode because of gas buildup in their abdominal cavity. When mammals die, their last meals start to rot. For the gut bacteria digesting that rot, it provides a tasty meal. But the digestion process releases methane gas, which makes the whale bloat and sometimes explode.

Gut reaction

I have a vexed relationship with exploding whales. On the one hand, I have a visceral disgust for mammal anatomy, to a near debilitating degree. I walked an extra block in college just to avoid going through the vertebrate anatomy lab. I had to leave the only mammal dissection I ever attended because I couldn’t stop gagging. And yet, despite all this, I will stop whatever I am doing to watch an exploding whale video, with disgust and fascination.
And I am not alone. Millions of people worldwide are obsessed with this cetacean time bomb. To capitalise on this, scientists decided to create a very different kind of whale watching experience. >HasTheWhaleExplodedYet.com allows you to receive regular updates on the state of the ballooning carcass.
I, like many others, want so badly for the whale to explode. But sadly, it doesn’t look like it will happen. The carcass has begun to deflate. This is because, unlike the exploding sperm whale of 2013, blue whales are built for this.
As lung-filter feeders, blue whales make a living by withstanding massive internal pressure. When blue whales find a school of krill, they open their jaw wide-open, and fill a specialised abdominal cavity at a rate of 20 tonnes of water per second. This makes the blue whale, unlike the exploding sperm whale, a tough balloon.

Post-mortem

Something needs to be done about the carcass to stop the stench. In 1970, when faced with the same problem, the Orgeon State Highway Division decided to blow up the whale with dynamite. The event cannot be termed a complete success. Onlookers hundreds of feet away were showered with whale blubber and a car was destroyed. But the >TV news coverage of the event is probably some of the best ever produced.
So, given the lessons of the past, the residents of Trout River should be pleased by the Royal Ontario Museum’s decision to >remove the carcass for study. If successful, they will get rid of the stink without a whale-blubber shower.

MDMK stages protest, urges govt to implement RTE
","Members of the Marumalarchi Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam staged a protest in Sulur on Friday urging the State Government to implement in full the provisions of the Right to Education Act after making the necessary changes.
A release from the party said that the Government must issue a new Government Order replacing the existing one so that the intended beneficiaries get the benefit from the RTE Act, bring about a single window system of admission under the RTE Act. It said that the Maharashtra Government had implemented an online admission system.
The party through the information obtained under the Right to Information Act had clearly established that 90 per cent of the 2,163 students who were admitted under the RTE Act were not as per law. Across the State, 19,971 students were admitted under the RTE Act. It had also established that due to the deficiencies in admitting students under the Act, the real beneficiaries – students from families from economically weaker section – had not benefitted.
The party then sent the information to the State School Education Minister, the head of the State Commission for the Protection of Child Rights, the district administration and also the Chief Education Officer, Coimbatore. It had also sent a representation to the State School Education Minister that the Government Order issued for admission of students under the RTE Act (GO 60) was not clear and proper and that it ought to be changed.
But, there had been no response from the recipients of the letter and complaints.
The Government ought to have paid to the schools the tuition fee of the students admitted under the RTE Act by September last year. But to date the Government had not disbursed the money. This was because the Government was yet to determine the school-wise fee, the release said and pointed out that Karnataka had allocated Rs. 45 crore for the purpose. The inaction on the part of the Government was condemnable and it was to highlight this that the party had staged a protest, the release said.

Crude bomb explodes in Chidambaram, 5 injured
","Five persons were injured when a country—made bomb exploded in a residential area here on Saturday, trigerring tension even as the case took a curious turn when four of them fled from the hospital, giving the slip to the police.
The explosion comes close on the heels of Thursday’s twin blasts in the Guwahati Express train at Chennai Central station that claimed a woman’s life and left 14 injured.
The crude bomb went off in a house in a residential colony in this temple town, causing damage to the room atop the building in which five persons were injured including an employee of a well—known University.
Police rushed to the spot and admitted three of the injured to a government hospital and the remaining two in a private hospital.
The trio undergoing treament at the government hospital tricked the police and escaped under the guise of answering nature’s call and one of their associates did likewise from the private hospital, police said.
The police have launched a hunt for the injured and are keeping a watch on the lone person who remained in hospital and is suspected to have brought the bomb to the room where it exploded.
The injured, Mohan Ram, is an history—sheeter hailing from Dindigul, police said.
The employee of the university, identified as Arul, who is stated to have suffered damage to his eyesight, is among those who escaped.
According to Cuddalore Collector Kirlosh Kumar, who visited the spot, a country—made pistol and material suspected to be used in making explosives were recovered from the house where Arul was staying.
Police said they have launched a probe into the matter from various angles in the wake of the four making good their escape.
On Thursday, when twin blasts had rocked the train in Chennai, an alleged Indian Mujahideen operative from Rajasthan was arrested by the police of that State at Parangipettai in this district.

Probe ordered into death of Srinagar youth
","Kashmir Divisional Commissioner Shailendar Kumar on Friday ordered a magisterial inquiry into the >death of a youth in firing by the Central Reserve Police Force on April 30.
Srinagar District Magistrate Farooq Shah was appointed the Inquiry Officer and asked to submit his report and recommendations in 15 days.
Twenty-four-year-old Bashir Ahmad Bhat of Gratabal, Nawakadal, died when the CRPF fired at unruly demonstrators near Nawakadal Crossing on Nallah Maar Road.
Officials maintained that the crowd had attacked a polling party carrying EVMs to the fortified SKICC counting centre, which was being escorted by the CRPF and snatched a CRPF constable’s gun.
“The miscreants snatched the weapon of a security force personnel. In the ensuing scuffle two persons identified as Bashir Ahmed Bhat, son of Ghulam Hassan Bhat and Nazir Ahmed Kaloo of Nawakadal were injured.
Bashir Ahmed later succumbed to injuries,” a Police bulletin said on April 30.
Three residents of Gratabal and Braripora neighbourhood in Nawakadal dismissed the official version as a “blatant lie.”
“We will thoroughly investigate how the civilian died in the firing. We will see if the Standard Operating Procedure had been violated,” Mr. Shah told The Hindu.
Meanwhile, half-a-dozen government vehicles were damaged and several officials sustained injuries in different incidents of stone-pelting in Kashmir since Thursday night. Official sources said that Superintendent of Police Srinagar Airport Manzoor Ahmad Dalal was injured and his vehicle was damaged in the incident.
Informed sources said that the demonstrators clashed with the police and the CRPF at over a dozen places. Curfew remained in force in downtown Srinagar on the second consecutive day on Friday.

Another man caught on cam in Bangalore
","Investigators probing the twin blasts on the Bangalore-Guwahati Express here on Thursday appear to have inched ahead in zeroing in on the culprits, with another CCTV footage showing a man hiding his face while going to board the train in Bangalore the previous night.  
“The man is seen carrying a piece of baggage, and he consciously covers his face to avoid being caught by the CCTV camera installed there,” a police official said here on Saturday.
The Tamil Nadu CB-CID Police have developed two portraits of persons who were found moving in a suspicious manner in the Chennai Central and Bangalore stations.
While one man was seen running out of the coach after the train arrived in Chennai on May 1, the other man caught on camera in Bangalore was seen hiding his face to escape the lens.

Unmanned coachesIn a stunning revelation, it is now known that the twin blasts occurred in coaches unmanned by any Travelling Ticket Examiner (TTE) between Jolarpet and Chennai Central. Investigators are hence trying hard to identify the unauthorised persons who had boarded the train, sources in the Crime Branch-CID said.
Police probes revealed that six TTEs boarded the train in Bangalore on the night of April 30, and three of them got down at Jolarpet.
The sleeper-class coaches S-3, S-4 and S-5 were left with no TTE till the train reached Chennai Central the next morning. “We have information that many unauthorised persons boarded the train without a confirmed or reserved ticket. They slept along the aisle or near the toilet of these coaches. Since their names or addresses were not available with the Railways, we are finding it difficult to identify them,” a CB-CID official told 
The Hindu.
Two bombs exploded in quick succession, killing a woman passenger and injuring 14 others of the train after it reached Chennai.

Construction of Rs.100 crore HKM temple begins today
","The Hare Krishna Movement (HKM), Hyderabad, an affiliate of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON) Bangalore, is set to begin construction of its ambitious Rs.100 crore temple complex and culture centre at Sri Lakshmi Narasimha Swamy Temple premises in Banjara Hills from Friday.
The HKM, which runs the ‘Bhojanamitra’ free food scheme in government hospitals and ‘Akshaya Patra’ for students in government schools, said they had received the mandatory permission from municipal authorities to take up construction of the temple and cultural centre.
“Friday is ‘Akshaya Tritiya’ and it will mark beginning of the construction of the temple dedicated to Lakshmi Narasimha in a 4.38-acre land allotted to us by the government,” said HKM Hyderaba-d’s head Gaura Chandra Dasa.
Other cultural attractions include the themed experience of ‘Narasimha Leela’, ‘Narasimha Kala Kshetra’ or an open air theatre and a ‘Vedic Samskara’ Hall.
The temple shot into limelight in 2012 when the then Labour Minister, Mr. Danam Nagender, and his followers locked the temple gate to prevent the holding of ‘Krishnashtami’ celebrations. Anticipating trouble, HKM officials said they had received police protection at the construction site after directions from the High Court.

Homing in on faith
","For a remote mountain hamlet of barely two dozen households in a predominantly Hindu and Christian region, Thinghejang in Manipur seems an unlikely setting for a synagogue resonating with Hebrew chants. Unlikelier still is the carnival spirit that sweeps nearby villages like Matiyang, a cluster of 150-odd residents, when hundreds of people converge to celebrate Israel’s Independence Day.
At play here is the curious lore of the Bnei Menashe, a community of around 9,000 people who trace their ancestry to the tribe of Manasseh, one of the 10 tribes of Israel lost to history over 2,700 years ago. What began a few decades ago as a search for their theistic moorings has since turned into a quest for a new national identity. “Israel is our home, our Promised Land,” gushes Leah, a student in Aizawl. “Residing in Israel is a must for every Jew,” says Khizkiyah Menashe, a law graduate from Lunglei. Those already there, such as Avishai Guite and Mirna Singsit, affirm that the greatest longing of their people back in India is to return to their ancestral land. For Shalem Gin, becoming the first Bnei Menashe officer in the Israeli defence force in 2011 marked the fruition of a childhood dream to serve as an Israeli combat soldier.
At Tel Aviv’s Ben Gurion Airport, every touchdown of the Bnei Menashe waving Israeli flags is imbued with emotion. Around 2,000 Bnei Menashe have already migrated to Israel. Those eagerly awaiting their turn erupted in tears and jubilation recently after the Israeli government passed a resolution paving the way for another 899 to return to Israel.
The Hebrew nation, claim the Bnei Menashe, was their home until their ancestors fled eastwards to escape the Assyrian conquest of the Northern Kingdom circa 722 BCE. Pushed further out by the marauding armies of Alexander the Great, they ended up in China nearly five centuries later. When their faith was persecuted there, nearly two generations were forced to seek refuge in lonesome caves, earning the name Shinlung (cave-dwellers). After the Chinese found them, they fled south to Indochina, before migrating to their present-day habitats some 600 years ago.
All along, the community held on to the oral history, songs and traditions handed down by their ancestors. Yet it wasn’t until they were introduced to the Bible in the 19th century by Welsh evangelists seeking to convert them to Christianity that the Bnei Menashe identified Manmasi or Menasia, a legendary ancestor of theirs, as the Biblical Manasseh, the son of Joseph.
“My grandfather was full of anecdotes about community elders uncovering the parallels between our customs and those of pre-rabbinical Judaism,” says David Yambem. “It must have been quite a revelation for the missionaries that our community would celebrate a springtime festival by singing songs about crossing a sea although we lived nowhere near one and by eating unleavened bread although our staple is rice.” The missionaries are said to have acknowledged the community’s Israelite origins when they saw them observing Sabbath and the laws of Kosher, circumcising new-born boys on the eighth day, and invoking Mount Sinai, Mount Moriah and Mount Zion in sacrificial ceremonies performed on altars reminiscent of the ancient Jewish Temple.
The community’s belief in a Jewish identity was reinforced in the early 1950s when Mei Chalah, a revered Pentecostal minister from Buallawn in Mizoram, dreamt that his people belonged to Zion. “Uptil the generation of my grandparents, the community yearned for Zion, but thought that was in heaven,” says Binyamin Haokip. “That changed after we learnt about the state of Israel.”
Realising the dream to migrate to Israel has not been easy. In 1955, a few Bnei Menashe set out on foot to Israel, but were turned back by Indian authorities. In the 1980s, after having started living according to halacha (Jewish laws), they reached out to organisations in Israel to make their case for aliyah (return of the Jewish diaspora to Israel) in fulfilment of a Mitzvah (a Jewish commandment) that calls upon all Jews to come home to Zion. “We couldn’t study for conversion in India for want of a Rabbi, so some of us decided to travel to Israel in the 1990s on tourist visas,” says Haokip.
In 2005, one of Israel’s chief rabbis recognised the Bnei Menashe as the lost children of Israel and made them eligible for aliyah. However, for that to materialise, Israel’s law required them to first convert to Judaism. “That was far from easy in India where proselytisation is a touchy issue,” says Yambem. Matters came to a head later that year, when an Israeli rabbinical court’s visit to India for mass conversion triggered a diplomatic row between the two countries. “The Bnei Menashe now undergo the process of returning to the Jewish people only after they arrive in Israel,” says Michael Freund, chairman of Shavei Israel, a Jerusalem-based organisation that helps descendants of lost Jewish tribes return to their roots. Interestingly, it was a Bnei Menashe plea for help with aliyah that inspired Freund to form Shavei Israel a decade ago.
In the complex mosaic of faiths and ethnicities that is the north-east of India, one’s religious identity is often a matter of social adjustment and assertion. “We were always acutely aware that we were different from the others around us,” says Leah. “Be it observing Saturday as a weekly day of rest and worship, or adhering to the strictures of Kosher food, pursuing a Jewish way of life is not without its difficulties here,” adds Liyon Fanai, a Mizo Bnei Menashe leader based in Zarkawt, Aizawl.
Nonetheless, it is possible today for the Bnei Menashe to announce their religious identity by wearing kipots (skullcaps), tzitzit (ritual fringes) and tassels on their person or writing “I am the son of Manasseh” in Hebrew or Latin on their houses without turning heads or raising eyebrows. “It is a testimony to India’s greatness that unlike most Jewish communities in the diaspora, the Bnei Menashe do not suffer from any hostility or discrimination,” says Freund.
In October 2012, the Israeli government revoked its predecessor’s suspension of the aliyah programme. Yet, opinion on the Bnei Menashe claim continues to be divided within Israel. “There are no scientifical proofs of Israelite affiliation, but narratives that are spun and sometimes take hold. This is true of the Bnei Menashe, as others,” says Dr. Shalva Weil, anthropologist at Hebrew University of Jerusalem. “There are neither Biblical nor rabbinical tractates on their existence. Historical myths are authentic for the people who believe in them and become realities for those who listen.”
Many in Israel also fear that allowing migration on the basis of historic legends may snowball into a serious immigration challenge. They feel that the Bnei Menashe might be using Israel as a way out of economic hardship in India. Israel’s former interior minister Avraham Poraz once called the Bnei Menashe “peasants seeking to escape poverty”. “That is incorrect,” counters Jeremiah Hnamte, who runs a successful bamboo business in Aizawl. “Most of us are educated and make a decent living in India”. A case in point is Azriel Hmar, a government employee, and his wife Mayian, a teacher, who are willing to give up their comfortable lives in Aizawl to be in Israel. “It is not as though we are going to heaven,” says a Bnei Menashe youth. “We will still have to work hard, perhaps even harder than in India. We may not be as well off as the Israelis, but it is unfair to label us economic migrants.”
“I know the community well,” says Zaithanchhungi (Zaii), Aizawl-based researcher and author of the book Israel-Mizo Identity. “Their decision to migrate to Israel is indeed driven by faith.” Fanai avers, “People can think or say what they like, but India is our second home and will always be a part of us.” That was evident when the Bnei Menashe performed Mizoram’s Cheraw folk dance during India’s Independence Day celebrations in 2013 in Herzliya, Israel.
Many like Poraz and social scientist Lev Grinberg even view conversions as a right-wing game-plan to boost Jewish majority in disputed territories, an issue brought back into sharp focus by Israel’s recent approval to build nearly 1,200 apartments there. “In Israel,” writes journalist-activist Mike Marqusee in If I Am Not For Myself: Journey of an Anti-Zionist Jew, “champions of the Bnei Menashe openly describe their immigration as part of the solution to the ‘demographic problem,’ that is, the numerical preponderance of non-Jews in Palestine.”
Freund dismisses that view. “The Bnei Menashe immigrants to Israel are spread out across the country, from north to south. Israel, like India, is a free country and the Bnei Menashe are free to choose where they wish to live. Those who criticise their immigration do so largely out of ignorance tinged with a whiff of racism.”
The quirks and demands of starting all over again in a new land are no deterrents for the Bnei Menashe. For Menashe Lhundgim, Gidonmung Khongsai and Hila Singson, migrating to Israel has been an experience in contradiction. While the tranquillity of their life in Manipur and Mizoram did little to assuage their inner turmoil, they claim to be at more peace even amid the occasional blasts of Qassam rockets and Grad-type Katyushas in their neighbourhoods in Sderot and Kiryat Arba, even as they go about their lives in the eye of the Israel-Palestine conflict.
To many in Israel, the suggestion of a racial kinship with the Bnei Menashe seems far-fetched: the balance is often tipped more towards the differences in their Semitic and Mongoloid traits than the quiet similarities in their ritual observances. “We were often told we didn’t look Jewish and we didn’t quite understand what it meant to ‘look’ like one,” says Amos. “We felt like outsiders in India because of our looks. In Israel, we get mistaken for Filipinos and Chinese,” laughs Yitzhak.
“Like any immigrant community, the Bnei Menashe who come to Israel must learn to adjust to a new mentality, a new language and a different way of doing things,” says Freund. “Being an immigrant is never easy and it does not matter if you originate in India, the U.S. or elsewhere. But the Bnei Menashe absorption in Israel has been successful.”
As it turns out, Thinghejang and Matiyang are as much about the Bnei Menashe’s long wait at the intersection of faith and history, as about the beginning of a journey that seems no less exhilarating than the destination.

Know your trees: Baobab in Mumbai, Senegal lilac in Malleswaram
","A ready prop for string lights and suitable canopy for parking like any other avenue tree, the solitary Baobab on a busy Mulund (Mumbai) street has turned overnight into the subject of substantial curiosity and debate among participants of a citizen science project to document trees across the country. Titled ‘TreesIndia’, it is an effort to create awareness about neighbourhood trees and aggregate information on tree diversity in India.
After all, the Adansonia digitata (known also as the “upside-down tree” as its branches can resemble roots) belongs to the dry savannahs of sub-Saharan Africa, and while it is known in botanical gardens in India, the Baobab is not the commonest avenue tree here.
The campaign was launched on Earth Day, April 22, and is hosted by India Biodiversity Portal. Among 3500 entries received so far by the crowd sourcing campaign, Mulund’s Baobab, a Senegal lilac (or Lonchocarpus sericeus from West tropical Africa) in Malleswaram and other exotics were unexpected finds, says R. Prabhakar, who created the India Biodiversity Portal.
Nature enthusiast, Ravi Vaidyanathan, who uploaded photos and observations about the Baobab, says it grows near the Mulund railway station (East) and is more than 50 years old. He has seen the tree “grow from a small slender tree during my school days to the huge tree that it is now [with a] base diameter an easy 2.5 metres”.
Anvitha S. from Bangalore says she has seen five Senegal lilacs around 11th Cross Road, Malleswaram. Indeed the biggest contribution to the portal has come from the increasingly mowed-down Garden City. Of the around 680 tree species identified and mapped, 400 have come from Bangalore, said Mr. Prabhakar. The most commonly recorded species across the country were Peepul, Gulmohar, Mango and Jacaranda.
The campaign continues to receive observations that will be used to build an open-access information system for tree species and distribution in India, he added. The enthusiastic participation from citizens “has convinced us that crowd-sourcing is an effective way to aggregate biodiversity data from different locales,” the TreesIndia team says.
“We hope to create a page for every one of the 7500-odd species in India and have this information up in the public domain,” Mr. Prabhakar said.
The campaign was launched in association with ATREE, SeasonWatch, Nizhal (Chennai), Keystone Foundation (Kotagiri), Strand Life Sciences, Azim Premji University and others. To upload your observations visit http://treesindia.indiabiodiversity.org.

Were the bombs timed to explode in Andhra Pradesh?
",": Did those who planted the Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) on Bangalore-Guwahati Express train aim at carrying out the explosions in Andhra Pradesh where BJP prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi was to address a series of election meetings?
The A.P. State Police are disinclined to believe so, though they do not rule out any such possibility. The train was supposed to reach Chennai at 5.40 a.m. and with railway officials stating it was running nearly 90 minutes behind schedule, the train would have reached closer to Gudur and not beyond going by the average speed of 55-60 kilometres per hour, said investigators.
Interestingly, Mr. Modi was addressing the first meeting at Madanapalle of Chittoor followed by Nellore, Guntur, Bhimavaram and Visakhapatnam. “Detonating the IEDs would have killed the passengers on board the train even if it had entered A.P. So the theory of the attackers specifically targeting A.P. doesn’t hold water,” opined intelligence officials.
They maintained that while Mr. Modi did face the threat to his life and central intelligence agencies have been sending alerts from time to time, most were general in nature with no specific alert was sounded so far with regard to his A.P. tour.

A tradition kept alive
","Temple festivals not only unite all communities together under a common platform and provide a space for youth to display their talents and courage but also ensure survival of traditional sports.
Double bullock cart race, locally known as ‘rekla’ race, was one such traditional and famous sports held as a part of the annual Chithirai festival of Sri Muthalamman Temple at Thummalapatti near Batlagundu near here. The entire village wore a festive look on Friday and people from Thumallapatti and nearby areas thronged it to witness the festival since morning.
The main road connecting Thummalapatti, Kanavaipatti Sri Lankan refugee camp and Pudhupatti Kamarajapuram was converted into a race track. Traffic was closed on this road.
Spectators converged on both sides of the road to witness the event.
Under big bull category, bullocks owned by Madhu Bala of Cumbum clinched the first prize.
Vairam of Goodalur bagged the second prize. In the mid-size bull segment Sellayi Amman of Vadipatti emerged winner and Sridhar of Goodalur settled with second prize.
In the small size category, known as ‘Karichan Kunju’ segment in the local parlance, bullocks owned by Arivu of Uthukuli emerged winner and bulls of Arunkumar of Chinnamanur got the second prize.
Cash award of Rs.10,000 Rs.7,000 and Rs.6,000 were given to top three winners. Majority of prizes were bagged by bulls from Theni district.
Race organizer Pon. Kuppusamy said that 138 bullock carts from Dindigul, Theni, Madurai, Cumbum, Theni, Chinnamanur, KK Patty, Alanganallur, Iyyampalayam, Natham, Singampunari, Melur, Sholavandhan, Tiruchi and Manaparai participated in the race.
This race will test the agility of bulls and riding tactics of young riders, he added.
Sufficient force was deployed at the village to regulate the crowd.
The bullocks were divided into three categories – big bullocks, mid size bullocks and small size bullocks - on the basis of their size, height and capability to take part in the race. Separate races were conducted for each category.

Action plan sought to rebuild ‘T’
","Justice L. Narasimha Reddy of the High Court said that compared to the 1960s and the 70s, governance was at the crossroads.
With Telangana set to become the 29 State, what is required of the political executive is to formulate policies and for officials and administration is assurance of their implementation in letter and spirit.
He was addressing a gathering comprising members of the Telangana Commercial Taxes Gazetted Officers’ Association (TCTGOA) at a symposium titled ‘Perspectives on Telangana State & the Role of the Executive’ here on Friday evening,
In a market economy, the focus was on the standard of living of people, but what was more important was improving the standard of life per se and that would come only with an element of simplicity and sacrifice, he said.
This required an attitudinal change in employees and officers, he said, adding that they should view work as a service to people, without dishonesty in approach.
G. Vivekanand, MP, said the need of the hour was to chalk out an action plan with a half-a-dozen indicators for a start, in the endeavour to recreate Telangana State.
“Let us have just five or six points on which to work on. Land records management is an important task and titles will be crucial in the new State, apart from maintaining law and order. All these would create an atmosphere conducive enough for all to work together and make Telangana a development model for others to follow,” he said.
Other key speakers included Telangana Joint Action Committee chairman. Prof. M. Kodandaram, Telangana Employees JAC, G. Deviprasad, Prof. G. Haragopal, Chief Editor of the Telugu daily ‘Namasthe Telangana’, Allam Narayana, Convenor of the Forum for Telangana, Osmania University, Prof. G. Laxman, Chairman, Telangana Commercial Taxes JAC T. Vivek
TCTGOA General Secretary C. Anil Kumar presided over the occasion that was also utilised to felicitate Joint Commissioner (CT) N. Ashok Reddy on his superannuation.

Chennai blasts probe: CCTV image provides first clue
","In a find that could help crack the mystery behind the May Day twin blasts in a train at the Chennai Central railway station, the State police on Friday released the CCTV footage of a man running on the platform soon after the train’s arrival.
The Crime-Branch CID, investigating the blasts on board the Bangalore-Guwahati Express that killed a woman passenger and injured 14, disclosed here that the explosives planted in the train were similar to those used to trigger multiple blasts in Patna hours before the BJP’s prime ministerial candidate, Narendra Modi, was to address an ‘Hunkar rally’ on October 28, 2013.
The police’s announcement came after experts from the National Security Guards (NSG) inspected the scene and the materials seized from the damaged coaches.
Inspector-General of Police Mahesh Kumar Agarwal said remnants of clock pieces, batteries, metal pellets and a metallic pipe suggested that a timer device was used as the trigger. Releasing the footage, he said the “person’s movements were unusual and required verification.”
Crime Branch officials also confirmed that the train was running 90 minutes late and had it been on time, the bombs would have gone off after the train entered Andhra Pradesh. Mr. Modi addressed election rallies at five places in the neighbouring State on May 1, including Nellore, close to the Tamil Nadu border.
Any information on the man in the footage could be passed on to the CB-CID on (044) 2250 2500/10 or (0)77086 54202, he said. The man apparently got off the S-3 coach and ran away after the train arrived; we have not seen him getting into the train again,” Mr. Agarwal said.
He said the investigation so far had not indicated any link between the blasts and Zakir Hussain, a Sri Lankan national arrested by the State police three days ago.
Senior officials of the CB-CID rushed to Bangalore following a tip-off.

Ancient granary found in Haryana
","A “beautifully made” granary, with walls of mud-bricks, which are still in a remarkably good condition, has been discovered in the just-concluded excavation at Rakhigarhi village, a Harappan civilisation site, in Haryana.
The granary has rectangular and squarish chambers. Its floor is made of ramped earth and plastered with mud.
Teachers and students of the Department of Archaeology, Deccan College Post-Graduate & Research Institute, Pune, and Maharshi Dayanand University, Rohtak, Haryana, excavated at Rakhigarhi from January to April this year.
Vasant Shinde, Vice-Chancellor/Director, Deccan College, who was the Director of the excavation, said: “We excavated seven chambers in the granary. From the nature of the structure, it appears to be a big structure because it extends on all sides. We do not know whether it is a private or public granary. Considering that it extends on all sides, it could be a big public granary.” He called it “a beautifully-made structure.”
The excavating teams found several traces of lime and decomposed grass on the lower portion of the granary walls.
“This is a significant indication that it is a storehouse for storing grains because lime acts as insecticide, and grass prevents moisture from entering the grains. This is a strong proof for understanding the function of the structure,” explained Dr. Shinde, a specialist in the Harappan civilisation.
The discovery of two more mounds in Rakhigarhi in January this year led to Dr. Shinde arguing that it is the biggest Harappan civilisation site. There are about 2,000 Harappan sites in India, Pakistan and Afghanistan. With the discovery of two more mounds, in addition to the seven already discovered, he estimated that the total area of Rakhigarhi was 350 hectares. It thus overtook Mohenjo-daro with about 300 hectares, in Pakistan, in laying claim to be the biggest Harappan site, he said.
The Rakhigarhi site belongs to the mature Harappan phase, which lasted from 2600 BCE to 2000 BCE. The teams have also found artefacts, including a seal and potsherd, both inscribed with the Harappan script.
In Mohenjo-daro and Harappa, granaries were found in citadels, where the ruling elite lived. So mound number four in Rakhigarhi, where the granary was found, could have been the settlement’s citadel, Dr. Shinde said.
Rakhigarhi is situated in the confluence of Ghaggar and Chautang rivers and it was a fertile area. “So Rakhigarhi must have grown a lot of food grains. They could have been stored in the granary to pay for the artisans or other sections of society or to meet any crisis,” said Dr. Shinde.

‘Trans Queens’ ooze confidence
","Turning up in beautiful chiffon and georgette saris and ‘lehengas’, along with spaghetti-strapped designer blouses, the contestants exuded poise and confidence at the national-level ‘Miss. Trans Queen’ beauty pageant.
The much-awaited beauty contest for the third genders, which stopped due to sudden thundershowers on Thursday, resumed its charm with heart-pounding music, dance, and energy-packed audience at Gurajada Kalakshetram here on Friday. Of the 125 contestants who made their way to the venue from different places like Delhi, Pune, Kolkata, Kochi, Hyderabad, and Visakhapatnam, among other cities, 22 were short-listed for the final round.
With the tagline ‘Hum kisi se kum nahin’ attached to the beauty show, hosted jointly by Naandi Service Society and Moon Power, the participants walked down the ramp with ease, teaming their attires with attractive stilettos. Apart from creating a platform for the others, the pageant kept its focus on raising awareness on the acceptance of the third gender community.
“We are not bothered about winning or losing the beauty pageant, but a platform such as this is really heart-warming. What our hometown (Delhi) has not done so far, the City of Destiny has done for us. Whoever we are, all we need is your love and acceptance,” one of the contestants from Delhi said. While some of the participants surprised the viewers by introducing themselves in Telugu, a few shared their wonderful experience of being part of the national-level beauty pageant. It was the first time the beauty contest for the community was being organised in Andhra Pradesh. “We have been planning for the event for the last five years. The objective is to provide a platform for the others to exhibit their talent and allow them to express themselves,” director of Moon Power Srinivas said.
The top winner walked away with gold crown worth Rs.1 lakh and the second and third winners grabbed silver crowns. The other titles of the pageant included ‘beautiful eyes’, ‘best skin’, ‘best walk’, ‘beautiful smile’, and ‘beautiful personality’.

Police rudderless in the case of blasts: Karunanidhi
","In the absence of the Chief Minister in the State capital, the police force “is directionless and unable to act decisively,” DMK president M. Karunanidhi said reacting to the train blasts at the Chennai Central.
In a statement, Mr. Karunanidhi said the police arrested an ISI operative, Zakir Hussain, two days ago. But even if the police were efficient, they could not take precautionary measures in the absence of the Chief Minister from the capital at this critical time and act with precision. This led to the twin blasts on a train.
 “The police are clueless and directionless,” he said. The blasts could have been averted if investigation was carried out properly after the arrest of Zakir Hussain. The police should take action based on inputs on terror plots from the intelligence wing.  Quoting media reports, Mr. Karunanidhi said the State was reeling under drought and worsening in law and order situation. The power situation was also bleak, he said wondering if the government was functional.
 DMDK founder and Opposition leader Vijayakant questioned as to what the police were doing to avert the blasts even after warnings from Central intelligence agencies. He also wondered why Chief Minister Jayalalithaa was in Kodanadu when the State was facing crisis on multiple fronts.

Kani tribe uses age-old techniques to good effect
","At a time when the Forest Department is using various methods such as erection of solar fence to prevent wild animals from entering villages and raid crops, Kani tribe in the Western Ghats of Kanyakumari district follow age-old techniques to good effect.
Madhavan Kani of Padupparai Kani settlement says the techniques are passed on from one generation to the next. He says they have developed tools using bamboo and wood to chase animals back into the forest before they raid agricultural crops. They use ‘stone bow’ — a bamboo bow with two strings — using which they shoot stones instead of an arrow to chase animals such as monkeys, langurs, squirrels and birds that may destroy their crops.
They also use ‘Kulikkai,’ made of bamboo. It is two-feet long. A wooden stick is kept in place in the middle cross-wise using a rope. When the tool is moved left and right, the wooden piece in the middle strikes on the hollow bamboo and creates noise. On hearing this noise, animals get scared and leave the fields.
Another tool of the Kani tribe is ‘adi-udukkai.’ It is made from a two-feet-long bamboo piece. A slit is made in the bamboo for half an inch where the slit portion remains as a separate piece, but remains attached to the major piece at one end. When the bamboo is shaken upwards and downwards, the slit portion strikes at the major piece, the vibration of which creates noise to scare away animals from their fields. This tool is used during daytime to scare away squirrels, monkeys, and birds. At night, it is used to drive away wild boars and small nocturnal animals.
Chathan Kani of Velampi kani tribe settlement says four to five feet deep trenches are dug to prevent elephants from entering agricultural fields. Because of its large size, an elephant cannot step down into a narrow and deep trench and come out of it, he says.

KSRTC increases bus fares by 7.96 per cent
","Fares of the Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) buses were hiked by around 7.96 per cent from Saturday midnight.
A day after Transport Minister R. Ramalinga Reddy told reporters that a hike in KSRTC bus fares was inevitable, the corporation announced the hike to “off-set the increase in financial burden” arising from the rise in fuel prices and increase in dearness allowance to its employees.

Diesel price hike

In a statement here, the KSRTC said the financial burden on the corporation due to the hike in diesel price was Rs. 105.05 crore a year and increase in dearness allowance to its employees amounted to Rs. 102.77 crore a year.
The KSRTC expects to garner additional revenue of Rs. 123.87 crore from the fare hike. The deficit of Rs. 83.95 crore a year would be mobilised by improving efficiency of operation, the statement said.
The North-Western Karnataka Road Transport Corporation and North-Eastern Karnataka Road Transport Corporation fares had also been hiked.
The increase in ordinary bus fares is, however, limited to only 7.66 per cent to reduce the burden on rural passengers, the statement said.

Volvo buses exemptedThe premium Volvo and Rajahamsa bus services have been exempted from the hike, a KSRTC official said.
“The fares of Volvo and Rajahamsa bus services are increased seasonally depending on demand. Their fares were revised in April for the peak summer season. The fares for these two services are dynamic, as they are different on weekdays and weekends,” the official added.

Nature writer non-pareil
","By the time I learnt that my favourite wildlife writer Peter Matthiessen was in India — he was studying the migrating cranes that gather annually in the village of Kichan, Rajasthan, for his book The Birds of Heaven: Travels with Cranes — he had already flown out of the country. I missed a chance to meet him. Now comes the news of his death at the age of 86.
Novelist, explorer and Zen monk, Peter Matthiessen became known in India after his epoch-making book Snow Leopard in 1978. Joining wildlife biologist George Schaller in his expedition to look for the rarest and most beautiful of all cats, Matthiessen trekked in the snow-bound Himalayan ranges. Though he never sighted the elusive leopard, Matthiessen’s account of travel across the Himalayas turned out to be a quest for the meaning of being, particularly the Buddhist point of view. He learnt from the sherpas and documented their wisdom. “The great sins, the sherpas say, are to pick up wildflowers or to threaten children.”
Matthiessen developed a style of nature-writing that makes the reader pause and look at the external world with all its life forms. Meticulously researching on the subject at hand, be it rhinos or turtles, he encapsulated his observation with magical descriptions. He showed that one of the purposes of a writer is to make people awake, to be alive… when he wrote about trekking in the hills, his reader trekked too. Through his lyrical prose, he passed on the essence of his experience in these searches.
In The African Silence, he wrote about his search for the pigmy elephants and The Tree Where Man was Born is a gripping account of the wildlife of East Africa. He wrote about India and its efforts to conserve wildlife in The Birds of Heaven.
There are two kinds of nature-writing. One is to write intuitively reacting to nature and its myriad forms of expression, like Thoreau, and the other is to look at wildlife from the point of view of a biologist, like George Schaller. In his works, Matthiessen effectively combined these two approaches with his imaginative literary technique. In his book on cranes, Matthiessen put down his philosophy: “One way to grasp the main perspectives of environment and biodiversity is to understand the origins and precious nature of a single living form, a single manifestation of the miracle of existence; if one has truly understood a crane — or a leaf or a cloud or a frog — one has understood everything.”
The most well-known of his novels is At Play in the Fields of the Lord, which is set in the Amazon with two American missionaries as the protagonists. Even when writing fiction, he remained a nature-writer nonpareil. It was made into a memorable film with the eponymous title.
However, his most plucky venture was his exploration of Zen. He began studying and practising Zen and became a monk. He set up a Zendo, a meditation centre, near his New York home. He recorded his insights in the book Nine-headed Dragon River. He acknowledged, “Anything written about Zen inevitably separates itself from Zen’s ‘instantaneous’ spirit. In using dead words to say that Zen is this or that, a separation is created and the freshness of the Zen moment is lost.” Yet he succeeded in bringing Zen as close to the reader as possible through his words.

An archive of archives
","Dayanita Singh’s File Room opens with an image of a lot of closed bundles, containing what we imagine might be files. The walls are peeling; no one has been in here for decades. Though the photographer is present, there is no sign of her, because, though the composition is precise, the perspective is neutral. Light enters from a sole window, which we do not see in its entirety, yet the camera has likely illuminated the photograph. Like the light of the moon in the dark. Immediately, there is no source, no centre. This image seems to instruct the viewer on how to read the book: we will see parts of a whole that may not exist, so desire not to piece this puzzle.
A series of images recount stacks of things; the repetition of the action of flipping pages mimics the repetition of what we see on them. Though the files, the cabinets that contain them, the men who handle depict a culture of the serial, each image is differentiated. The book, sans page numbers and a title on its cover is anonymous, it is also an editioned object. This tension between the standard and the singular permeates every side of paper. While its ideas are heady, they are also human, never initiating but not precluding the culture in which these stories are made, and the stark Indianness of governmental rooms, the way they date themselves in wear and tear, and the bureaucracy that they have come to represent.
The series is only interrupted by two passages by Aveek Sen, but the writing, in its sensual objectivity, mirrors the images, till the lines between that which is to be viewed and that which is to be read blur. ‘A Forest of Paper’ is told with the conceit of the author researching the smell of the whittling paper, and weaves us into the deep, chaotic, worm-ridden, rodent-infested corners of the rooms in which the photographs are taken. Yet, the place described does not seem to be decaying as much as bursting with life. The predators, lizards, bats, rats, play out their earthly dramas “in that moonless forest of paper, together with the rustle of its less tangible ghosts”. Truth is tucked deep into the files, so that the more that is concealed, the more is revealed. Sen’s words, “to lie unread in the dark is to last a little longer…” seem to resonate with all the ideas that are flipped on itself in the book at large.
The second story tells the tale of a woman, presumably Dayanita, who has spent her life with files, fighting a battle over land in the courts. The files seem to multiply, indexes, dates, waiting time repeating themselves and in vain. They seem to have a life of their own, and suddenly these files come to mean real lives on the line, vast spaces in dispute, a test of patience, love and priorities. The files become objects of idolatry, woe, sentimentality, hope. Paper is personified.
When we continue flipping through the pages of photographs of files, they no longer remain as stoic as they did before. The last image we see is of a room of bundles, this time, not as condensed, more haphazard, windowless. This moving finale is followed by a conversation between Dayanita and the curator, Hans-Ulrich Obrist. She describes that first photograph at the outset of the book as “bodies, they are like families” before Ulrich describes the room as “a morgue, or there’s something very death-related about it. The bundles make it related to death”. These individualised interpretations reflect the lack of a generic code in the very archival system represented. They measure the humanity of a hall, the whim of a wall.
The size of the book is unusual, large, register-like, yet the design is pristine, self-aware. This “monument of knowledge”, as an archivist in the interview calls it, is a trove of secrets that smell of the earth, secrets that were perhaps long sent away into the skies, never to be retrieved. And then are the things that stay with you at the end of the book, things omnipresent and everywhere.

Room without a View

Dayanita Singh opens up about the making of the book and how it turned out to be her most biographical work. Excerpts from an interview:

As a child, how did you occupy yourself? 

The usual — making sketches, re arranging furniture and making rooms within rooms, houses in bunk beds, and baking cakes.

Give instructions to your reader. Now give instructions to any reader, of any book. (What does it mean to read?) 

I read to travel and gather all kinds of experience. Equally I gather to study form — from Calvino and Geoff Dyer the form of making a new form for each work, from Ondaatje the art of withholding and so on. I think there are many ways of reading and underlining and re-reading.

How do you archive that which cannot be seen?

In the finest literature I think…

What playful bookmaking is next? Will it be contained in a portable, unfoldable museum, like 
File Room
 is contained in the Book Museum? 
The book has to be substantial in itself and then when it can also be an object, it becomes part of a larger object; that’s an extension. A wonderful bonus. But, the core is the book and that must be solid. That’s why I kept bringing you back to the book. It’s full of circles and secret layers. The next book is full of chance; in fact it’s called Museum of Chance!

I found myself feeling absurdly melancholic after closing your book. I was not simply thinking about memories and records and preservation at its end, I was thinking about the essential existentialism of living, I was wondering about love, the future, gardening. Can you read me back into your book and tell me why I felt like I did? Do you think this book can make you live better? 
Not sure if it’s for me to say if the book can make you live better, but certainly it’s a book about forgetting and remembering and by now you must have read my own biography in it. And to think I started off thinking I was finally making an objective documentation of paper to find this was my most biographical work. Yes I can imagine it can bring on melancholia and dizziness.

Nature, nurture and niches in cities
","Holiday plans ensure promises and perils; hopes and hypes; excitement and disappointments; good news and not-so good news. The not-so good news is that not everyone can plan a vacation to Arctic Alps or to the Amazon to observe the diverse wildlife there for obvious reasons like lack of resources or failure to obtain the necessary sanction for leave. The good news is that there is so much to eye, experience and enjoy right where you live – amidst the hustle and bustle of the city. For some, vacation is all about circus, beach, malls, movies, shopping, reading, and catching up on sleep. But for nature enthusiasts this is the time to make the best of wildlife spotting in the city.

Urban wildlife

The wildlife diversity and cities have always been treated as an oxymoron. In highly congested and thickly populated cities with myriad skyscrapers, flyovers, malls, real estate, heritage buildings and magnificent edifices, it’s incredibly amazing to see wildlife abound in their own secretive niches. The untamed birds, insects, mammals, reptiles, amphibians and of course the untended plants are all over.

Bustling neighbourhood

Summer vacations render an awesome reprieve from stressful work schedule and also bestow time to enjoy pleasant surprises over a cup of morning coffee in your own neighbourhood – birds busily engaged in courtship and nesting, squirrels relishing mangoes, spotted owlets peeping out in stupor from tree holes, butterflies hovering over the peacock flower, bees visiting the yellow elders, sunbirds hovering over the fire bush.
This is the season to look out for the fiery blossoms of Indian Laburnum and Copper Pods. Indian Laburnum otherwise known as the golden shower tree produces gorgeous pendulous inflorescence and is a greatly refreshing sight to behold when the city is actually reeling under heat wave. Copper pods produce dense clusters of crinkled yellow flowers which are highly relished by the rose-ringed parakeets. The flowers fall down to the ground and truly form a magical carpet of gold that brings nostalgic memories of examinations in school and college campuses. Another tree to look for during this time is the indigenous Crepe Myrtle, also known as Pride of India, which produces upright blooms in shades of pink and purple. Also not to be missed are the Siamese and Java Sennas, African Tulip Tree, Rosy and Yellow Trumpet Flowers, to name a few.
Birds to look out for in home gardens and in the neighbourhood are magpie robins, tree pies, golden orioles, wagtails, hoopoes, sunbirds, sparrows, tailor birds, barbets, kingfishers, woodpeckers, babblers, warblers, bee-eaters, bulbuls, shrikes, shikras, koels, pipits, parakeets, rollers and sometimes even the rare paradise flycatchers and pitta. Each bird has a distinct call and it is easy to trace their presence to their sound, which is otherwise not too easy. Water bodies too nurture and sustain a lot of aquatic birds. Easily one can spot snipes, sandpipers, black-winged stilts, pelicans, painted storks, darters, purple moorhens, pond herons, lapwings, pin-tailed ducks, coots, flamingoes, avocets, godwits and shanks.

Field trips

One day trips to observe, understand and document wildlife inspire city-bred children to develop passion and concern for wildlife and instills in them the need to engage in appreciation for nature, species conservation and in the protection of our ever-shrinking natural resources from further loss or damage. Time spent outdoors is a worthy investment that gives simple pleasure but great satisfaction. Just in case, you turn into a hardcore nature enthusiast and decide to visit national parks, reserve forests and wildlife sanctuaries that come under the jurisdiction of wildlife authorities and forest department you need to take prior permission and respect rules. Be on your guard as it is really ‘wild’ there unlike the urban wildlife that has evolved to coexist with human beings.

Role ofpolicy-makers

The role of urban policy-makers and city-planners is very crucial in earmarking areas that are rich in biodiversity that support diverse life forms. These areas should never be utilized for developmental purposes otherwise it may lead to local extinction of certain species. It is highly important to make a sincere effort to protect the wild side of nature in a war-footing spree in cities, since scores of water bodies, trees and parks have already been lost to intensive urbanisation thereby painfully facilitating habitat loss for birds and animals. Also, government authorities need to ensure that these places are garbage-free, provide adequate protection to wildlife as well as to people who visit these places, being clear of anti-socials, thereby making it a pleasant experience for those who come to study, enjoy or appreciate wildlife.

Friends for life
","Life is full of uncertainties and it is only friends and the camaraderie which makes it possible to cope with it. Madhuri Iyer’s first printed fiction, Manhattan Mango, is the story of three Indians — Neel, Shrikant and Shankar — and their bonding. Hailing from different parts of India, their friendship begins in Mumbai and continues in Manhattan, New York, where they add new friends to their circle.
As a child, the author was fond of narrating stories to her younger sister but admits that she used to reveal the end only when the ardent listener forked out chocolates. Later, she continued to write short stories though none were published. On completion of graduation in applied arts from Sophia Polytech, Mumbai, she started working as a visualiser in an advertisement agency and later became a copywriter. She has 25 years of experience in the field. “Honestly I could not have written this novel had I not got my basics right having trained as a copywriter,” she says during a telephonic conversation from Mumbai, adding, “It helped me to stick to the word limit.”
Having stayed in Manhattan for more than two years, she found the place fascinating as it was multicultural and multiracial and that inspired her to locate the novel in that city. Fond of Mumbai too, Iyer says she found similarities between the two places — both are hives of commercial and financial activities, cosmopolitan and imbibed with fast-paced life — though Manhattan attracts people from all the corners of the world. The protagonists in the novel share almost similar cultural and family background with the majority of them hailing from upper middleclass strata — all familiar to Madhuri — yet none of the characters resemble her friends or relatives.
According to Madhuri, Indians in New York have a mixed selection of friends and do not tend to restrict their circle to fellow countrymen. Can the place be termed a melting pot? “No, though the English-speaking Indians hailing from big metros tend to have friends transcending races, they still maintain their identity,” she says. “They are open-minded, accepting as well as contributing to the cultural space.” This, according to her, is the essence of the Manhattan experience which adds a whole new layer to their being.
The novel which was completed in less than a year — having started it in 2012 — underlies the value of friendship in a turbulent life. With more conflicts and problems, the characters tend to gravitate towards the known comfort zone — buddies. “Honestly, young people seek the opinion of their friends and peers more than parents,” reflects Madhuri. This is more so due to the absence of family.
Another pertinent point highlighted in the story is the desire of the youngsters to be intimate with their family circle but demanding a hands-off approach when it concerns their personal lives.
Fond of painting oil on canvas, Madhuri has already finished the draft of her new novel The Strongman's Daughter and is working on two Bollywood screenplays. She also plans to write a lifestyle cook book.

Waterfalls come alive in Courtallam
","The residents of the district perhaps enjoyed one of the finest weather conditions of this year on Tuesday as the intermittent drizzle triggered by the low pressure in the Bay of Bengal continued for the second day on Tuesday.
Though the Meteorological department predicted heavy rainfall in the southern districts, the coastal district of Tirunelveli experienced only intermittent drizzle on Tuesday that may not help in any way to improve the groundwater table.
However, the weather was so pleasant throughout the day with the overcast sky.
Once again, areas close to the Western Ghats received some rainfall while other parts of the district had to be content with the drizzle.
The Main Falls and the Five Falls at Courtallam experienced flood after 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday following rains in the Western Ghats.
While the Five Falls had heavy inflow of water around 2.30 p.m., the Main Falls experienced flood 15 minutes later.
Police prevented tourists from taking bath in the waterfalls as water was flowing dangerously.
The situation continued to be the same in both the waterfalls even after 6 p.m.
However, tourists had scintillating bath at Old Falls and children at the Tiger Falls, thanks to the copious inflow.
Rainfall in the district (in mm): Servalar dam – 40, Gundar dam – 31, Tenkasi – 27, Shencottai – 21, Karuppanadhi dam – 17, Ramanadhi dam – 12, Palayamkottai – 11.20, Adavinainar dam and Tirunelveli – 10, Gadana dam – 5, Ambasamudram – 3, Alangulam – 2.60, Veerakeralamputhur, Cheranmahadevi and Nambiyar dam – 2, Sivagiri – 1.
Tuticorin district experienced widespread rain on Tuesday.
The rain that started around 7.15 a.m. caused inundation in lowlying areas, affecting traffic in several places. A tree at Chidambara Nagar here was partially uprooted following rain accompanied by strong wind.
Many country boats did not venture into sea since weather was unpredictable.

India ranks third in contribution to global malicious activity: Symantec
","Alarming as it may sound, according to a report by data security solutions provider Symantec, India ranks as the third highest source of overall malicious activity globally.
Terming India ‘A Key Threat Frontier’, the annual internet security threat report said 5.1 per cent of all malicious cyber activities in the world originated from India in 2013. At the top spot was the US (20.33 per cent), followed by China (9.93 per cent).
India is followed by Netherlands (3.52 per cent), Germany (3.26 per cent), Russia (2.63 per cent), UK (2.58 per cent), Brazil (2.53 per cent), Taiwan (2.45 per cent), and Italy (2.35 per cent), as per the report.
Moreover, India continued to hold its position as the spam capital of the world.
An interesting trend that the report points out is that newer industries, rather than the traditionally targeted industries, are low-hanging fruits for cybercriminals.
In India, 39.92 per cent or nearly four in 10 attacks were carried out on non-traditional services industries like hospitality, business and personal services. This was followed by attacks on manufacturing (33.33 per cent) and finance and insurance (11.11 per cent).
Cyber criminals, the report said, are unrelenting in their focus on large enterprises with a staggering 69 percent targeted attacks carried out against them. “Despite stepping up their information security measures, businesses in India continue to be an attractive target for cybercriminals,” it noted.
As the same time, it points out that small businesses received the highest number of phishing and virus-bearing emails — almost three times as much as the larger targets.
“Small and medium-sized businesses often have less adequate security practices and resources.  Attackers are increasingly targeting smaller businesses that have a relationship with a larger company,” the report said.

Ready to serve life term if ill-gotten money is proved: A. Raja
","Former Telecom Minister A. Raja, accused in the 2G spectrum case, has said he is ready to live his entire life in jail if any ill-gotten money is found with him.
Mr. Raja, who is contesting the Lok Sabha Elections from The Niligiris in Tamil Nadu, cited a report published an English daily in 2011 quoting CBI sources that he had kept Rs. 3,000 crore abroad.
“The same day I went to the judge, showed him the newspaper report and said I want to challenge Income Tax, Enforcement Directorate and CBI if they find one rupee or a dollar in my name, I will not contest the case and I will live my entire life in jail,” India TV quoted Mr. Raja as saying in a release on his interview.
Mr. Raja was arrested on February 2, 2011 and is under trial in an alleged mutli-crore 2G scam by CBI. He is out on bail now.
The Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) had estimated that 2G licences allocated to companies under the tenure of Mr. Raja in 2008 caused the government a notional loss of about Rs. 1.76 lakh crore. The calculations were based on the auction price that government got for 3G spectrum in 2010.
“The CAG failed to differentiate between 2G and 3G. 2G is meant for voice and 3G is meant for data (internet) transfer. You can’t compare PDS rice with Basmati rice. The rates will be definitely different,” Mr. Raja said.
The Supreme Court of February 2, 2012 cancelled all licences allocated in 2008 and ordered fresh auction to allocate spectrum at market determined rates.
The auction of spectrum in November, 2012 and March, 2013 fetched bids of about Rs. 13,000 crore. The last auction for 1800 Mhz (widely known as 2G spectrum) in February fetched government bids worth Rs. 37,572 crore which as per present policy can also be used for 4G services.
Mr. Raja said whatever media portrayed as the biggest corruption is largely based on assumptions and not on the basis of record.
The former Telecom Minister alleged business cartels, whose business were going to be affected by 2G spectrum allocation, have targeted him.
“I think they might have been afraid of what Raja was going to do will have complete aberration on the business network that was created by these people. They may be afraid of, (and) injected through the media that Raja is doing this, this wrong,” Mr. Raja said.
Mr. Raja claimed that it was because of him telecom call rates lowered to 50 paise per call. Basic call rates, without any scheme, are now 2 paise per second across most of the mobile operators.
“I am challenging through this forum. Let all these institutions come together (and say) Raja did wrong, Prime Minister’s Office, Union Cabinet, Parliament, Planning Commission, CAG, CBI, Supreme Court, in all factors that were indicated in the charge-sheet,” Mr. Raja said.

Down to earth
","These wriggling, weak-looking worms hardly trigger respect on sight. But looks can be deceiving, and these down-to-earth worms could actually hold the key to reinstating soil vitality. That is because earthworms eat huge volumes of leaf and all kinds of organic litter (as much as three to five times their body weight, every single day) and cast out nutrients that are easily absorbed by plants. In fact, vermicompost (organic wastes composted by earthworms and associated organisms is considered to be the most nutritious of all manures), while vermiwash (water run through columns of organic matter and cow dung composted by earthworm and microbial activity) has been found to promote plant growth, thanks to the presence of the plant growth hormone IAA in vermiwash. Earthworms also secrete a slimy fluid that contains nitrogen, a plant nutrient. And in the process of burrowing, earthworms mix up the top soil with the bottom soil which distributes manure and moisture throughout the soil. The burrowing action also aerates the soil, which is crucial for plants’ growth.
In conversation with us is Dr. Sultan Ismail, international expert on earthworms. This Chennai-based soil biologist, ecologist and founder of Ecoscience Research Foundation is the one who first coined the term vermitech, the technology for composting organic wastes using earthworms. ""Earthworms are the pulse of the soil. The more earthworms there are in the soil, the healthier is the soil,"" says Dr. Ismail. Here is how we can welcome earthworms into our gardens and potted plants. For more, check out www.erfindia.org

What earthworms can we introduce in our garden or potted plants?

Local worms are recommended rather than imported worms because local worms burrow better and are more adapted to survive in our soil. I recommend Perionyx excavatus (surface dwellers) and Lampito mauritii (subsurface burrowers). A mix of surface and subsurface worms is ideal.

Where can we obtain earthworms?

You can collect earthworms from your neighbourhood. One can also contact the local agricultural department, municipalities, and nurseries of the forest departments, and select horticulture shops for earthworms. Alternatively, you can use cow dung sold in cow sheds. This cow dung will have eggs of local worms. Acquire this cow dung in a semi-dry condition, neither as fresh cow dung nor as dry cakes.

How can the soil be readied to sustain earthworms?

Keep mulching the soil. Don’t clear away the fallen leaf litter. This mulch layer is crucial and will protect the soil’s moisture and beneficial microbes and attract earthworms. Keep the soil moist but not waterlogged. For this, sprinkling of water once a day will do. Native trees attract worms, so plant native trees rather than exotic species. Remove construction debris from the soil. And don’t spray synthetic pesticides. This kills earth worms.

What is the food that has to be supplied for these earthworms in the soil?

Besides naturally falling leaf litter, you could add semi-composted kitchen waste to the soil occasionally and mix it with the soil lightly. Soon worms will multiply and arrive at an ideal sustainable number.

Can earthworms spread any disease?

Earthworms do not cause any plant disease. They don’t spread any plant infection, unless the infection is already present in the vicinity. And they are absolutely harmless to human beings. In fact, earthworms are used in Siddha medicine.

Can we introduce earthworms to soil in pots?

Yes, but keep watch and remove a few worms, in case they become too numerous for the soil and loosen the soil. Dead earthworms needn’t be removed. They decompose fast and become part of the soil.

Will earthworms crawl into our houses from soil in potted plants/gardens?

Earthworms prefer to stay close to soil with food source and moisture.

Earthworm trivia

Earthworms can grow back segments or parts of their body that get severed!
Common earthworms are just a few centimetres long, but the the Giant Gippsland Earthworm found in Australia reaches a length of 4 metres.
Earthworms are hermaphrodites, have both sex organs within the same individual.
So fascinating are earthworms that the grand old man of evolution, Sir Charles Darwin studied earthworms for over 44 years and put up his observations in his book ‘The Formation of Vegetable Mould Through the Action of Worms, with Observations on Their Habits’, which instantly became a best seller.

Techie attacked for opposing encroachment
","While the traffic police are encouraging the public to take pictures of traffic offenders and post them on their website as part of their ‘Public Eye’ initiative, a 32-year-old woman software engineer, who tried to do just that, was allegedly assaulted publicly.
But MICO Layout police are yet to take action against the alleged attacker, while the traffic police have promised to act on her complaint against encroachment of a footpath by a car showroom.
The complainant, Shanthala Patil, works in an IT company on Bannerghatta Road. She said she was returning home from work and walking towards Sagar Apollo hospital junction on April 30 when she noticed that the footpath has been encroached upon by the car showroom, forcing pedestrians to walk on the busy road.
When she questioned the showroom staff, they promised to remove the cars. Ms. Patil waited for some time to see if they would remove the cars, but they did not.
Ms. Patil, who was aware of the ‘Public Eye’ initiative, began taking photographs of the encroachment.
Seeing this, one of the showroom’s employees confronted her. The argument between the two took an ugly turn with the employee allegedly trying to snatch the complainant’s mobile phone. He slapped and kicked her when she resisted, the complainant has alleged.
Ms. Patil called her husband and later the police. Some policemen arrived and tried to persuade the two parties to settle the issue amicably, instead of filing a complaint.
Ms. Patil insisted on registering a case of assault against the showroom’s staff and demanded an investigation. Eventually, a complaint was registered with the MICO Layout police.
Personnel at the police station described the incident as a trivial one and said that action would be taken after Sunday as they had to make security arrangements for the IPL cricket match at the Chinnaswamy stadium.
Additional Commissioner of Police B. Dayanand said that he was aware of the incident and would instruct the jurisdictional traffic police to clear the footpath of encroachment at the earliest.

Blasts bring to fore RPF squad’s needs
","To make the Bomb Detection Squad (BDS) of the Railway Protection Force (RPF) more effective, a high-level committee of the force has recommended that only trained personnel form part of the squad.
Aware of the key role played by the BDS in emergency situations, the committee has made it clear that the personnel should not be utilised for any other duty.
The committee was constituted on the instruction of the Inspector General-cum-Chief Security Commissioner, RPF Southern Railway, to review the functioning of the BDS units in the Southern Railway zone. The panel, comprising the Additional Chief Security Commissioner, the Senior Divisional Security Commissioner, Chennai, and the Divisional Security Commissioner, Palakkad, made recommendations in March on manpower strength, duties and the working pattern of the BDS. The recommendations have been circulated to various divisions of the RPF in Southern Railway, railway sources here told The Hindu.
Foremost among the recommendations was that the BDS consist only of trained personnel adept at handling and maintaining equipment used in anti-sabotage operations. The committee also made it clear that the role of BDS personnel was only to detect explosive substances and not to dispose of them. The disposal had to be done by the Bomb Detection and Disposal Squad of the State police.
The committee said the BDS should be constituted in stations where the Integrated Security Scheme was being implemented. The BDS should function round the clock on three shifts, and its personnel should be sent for specialised courses as well as refresher programmes from time to time to enhance their skills.
The sources said the BDS units were now functioning in the Chennai, Tiruchi, Madurai and Thiruvananthapuram Divisions, besides Coimbatore.
The strength of the BDS in Tiruchi would come down to 11 from the existing 15. Those who were not trained would be taken out as per the committee’s recommendations. Instead, those who were trained in handling and maintaining anti-sabotage equipment and serving in different locations in the division would be attached to the BDS.

HC deplores police dharna, accepts apology
","Policemen staging a dharna in a court complex is a disturbing trend in society. Those entrusted with the task of enforcing law, themselves were instrumental in breaking law and order.
This is what the Madras High Court has observed in its order on a petition about suo motu contempt against nearly 90 police personnel who staged a dharna on the premises of the District and Sessions Court, Puducherry on December 19, 2008.
However, the First Bench comprising the Acting Chief Justice, Satish K. Agnihotri, and Justice K. K. Sasidharan accepted the unconditional apology tendered by the police personnel and closed the contempt proceedings with a warning that such things should not recur.
Trouble started after a Sub-Inspector of Orleanpet police station, Sreedharan, was denied bail by a Special Judge. He was arrested by the CBI’s Anti-Corruption wing, Chennai unit. Protesting the denial of bail to their colleague, policemen raised slogans and used derogatory language against the Special Judge. The agitating policemen even lathicharged photo journalists who took pictures of the protest. Some journalists were injured and their cameras destroyed. The agitators even refused to obey the orders of their superiors, including Inspector-General of Police.
The Special Judge (CBI cases) submitted a detailed report to the High Court. Following this, suo motu contempt proceedings were initiated against the policemen who were involved. Even though there were about 200 police personnel who were involved, only 92 could be identified.
The Bench observed that sit-ins and shouting slogans against the Judge were all intimidating tactics to exert pressure on him which could not be countenanced. It was rather astonishing that the police did not obey even the Inspector-General of Police’s direction.
Since the policemen tendered an unconditional apology, the Bench said, it was taking a lenient view of the matter. The Bench quashed a Union Territory G.O. of December 26, 2008 appointing a Commission of Inquiry to go into the incident, without consulting the High Court.

The past train tragedies
","The erstwhile composite Tiruchi district witnessed three major train bomb blasts in the last few decades.
The explosions involving the Tiruchi-Erode passenger (1986), the Chennai-Tiruchi Rockfort Express (1987) and the Chennai-Madurai Pandian Express (1997) claimed more than 30 lives, besides injuring about 160 passengers.
Bomb culture was something unheard of in the State till an explosive went off in a carriage of the Tiruchi – Erode passenger at the Mutharasanallur Railway Station, seven km from Tiruchi, on December 23, 1986. One person was killed and 25 were injured.
In a tragedy that shook the whole nation, about 25 persons were killed and over 150 injured when the diesel loco and eight bogies of the Chennai - Tiruchi Rockfort Express met with an accident over the river Marudaiyar bridge between Ariyalur and Sillakudi Railway Stations at 4.40 a.m. on March 15, 1987. A bomb blast caused it.
The blast was a case of perfect and consummate planning. The entry of the engine on the bridge coincided with the blast at the other end of the 600-feet-long structure. The loco had fallen perpendicularly just outside the bridge, with the following eight bogies telescoping into one another.
The entire rails to a distance of about 30 to 40 feet had been pulled out and the base steel structure of the bridge got twisted.
The bogies were seen hanging topsy-turvy on the bridge. One bogie had landed on the dry river bed, while the others were found hanging in a precarious position.
The intention of the criminals seemed to blow off the bridge when the Rockfort Express reached it. In yet another incident that took place on the Babri Masjid demolition anniversary day of December 6, 1997, a powerful bomb ripped apart a second class sleeper coach of the Madurai-bound Pandian Express just minutes after the train arrived at the Tiruchi junction at 4.45 a.m. Four persons were killed and eight were injured . On the same day, two other blasts took place in the Coimbatore-bound Cheran Express near Erode and the Alleppey Express entering Kerala.
All the three trains had started from Chennai the previous night.

Strange fish netted at Pamban
","A day after catching deep sea lobsters, considered a ‘prize catch,’ country boat fishermen have caught strange-looking rare fish, believed to be fully grown ‘Rhinochimaera,’ a deep sea fish.
Fishermen, who ventured into the south sea for fishing in a motorised ‘vallam’ (country boat) on Friday morning and returned on Saturday morning, caught the fish while fishing about 40 nautical miles south of Pamban.
I. Litisan, who owned the ‘vallam,’ said the fishermen had gone to the deep sea looking for a better catch when they caught the rare fish. Each fish weighed about six to seven kg. As the fish were not consumed, they were cut into pieces for drying, he said.
Sources in the Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute (CMFRI) said the fish belonged to the Rhinochimaera genus and Chimaera family. The exact species could be confirmed only after a detailed study, they said. These fish could have migrated from the deep sea, they added.
Mr. Litisan said fishermen in his boat also caught about 50 deep sea lobsters, totally weighing about five kg. They were sold at Rs. 1,000 a kg, he said.
“We get such rare fish species, giant lobsters and prawns as the sea is undisturbed when the mechanised boat fishermen are staying away from the sea since April 15 when the 45-day ban period began,” he told The Hindu.
R. Roosevelt, who was engaged in fishing and trading, said country boat fishermen in the Pamban region used to get a range of fish such as Groupers, Basslets, Goat fish, Anchovies, Travallies, whitings, Barracudas, Pomfrets, Seer and Halfbeaks, besides crabs and lobsters.
They said there were about 800 motorised country boats in Pamban area alone and the fishermen ventured into both the north and south sea for fishing. On a given day, 500 boats would venture into the sea and the average day’s catch from all the boats would be around 35 tonnes, Mr. Roosevelt said.
While crabs and lobsters were exported to foreign countries, the other varieties were sold in the domestic market, he said. About 7,000 families in the region depend on fishing for their livelihood, he added.

Border Crossings
","Commander Mahmud had previously fought against the Soviets, the Taliban and a few others he called traitors. His stories changed a little every time he narrated them to me. He was a creature of a ruptured society, which required certain murkiness of character and malleability of beliefs to negotiate alliances and friendships with an unlikely spectrum of characters. In his new role he would recruit, train and command the Afghan Local Police. Created at the behest of and funded by the Americans, the ALP was a policy designed to “secure local communities and prevent rural areas from infiltration of insurgent groups.”
It was the very young, the poor, the orphaned, the uneducated and the disenfranchised who were regularly conscripted and forced to fight under threat of violence. One of the cadets, who looked no older than 15, said he regularly crossed into Pakistan to see his family and moved there every winter in search of employment. “My maternal cousin joined the Taliban”, he said. “They pay well for doing nothing. He had the gun first.” Pointing to his gun he said, “These guns are not bad, either”.
Young boys were being prepared for slaughter; the accidental recruit was meant to fight the accidental guerrilla across the border. The US sergeant in Sar Howza, brushed it off saying “It is an Afghan solution to an Afghan problem”. I repeated this to Commander Mahmud and he responded with silence.
The day I left Sar Howza, the commander prepared a grand meal of goat and rice, and sent me away with words that betrayed his appearance. “Memory is a funny thing. It differs from the history you came here with.”
On the road back to Kabul and for the next two years I thought about the palpability of an arbitrary border and what it did to people. A border might create two distinct nationalities out of the same stock, but can it create a break with people and their past? The territory that divides the citizen and the alien is messy. Yet these lines are imperative for the politics of statehood and statelessness, who belongs and who is excluded. It separates us from them; it creates hierarchy and order; it consolidates and defines.
***
With the Partition, something unique, unprecedented and disorienting happened in the subcontinent. The clarifying violence at the moment of creation made the borders palpable, political and personal. Contested borders, territorial disputes, population transfers, communal strife, sectarian violence, self-determination movements have happened within the territory of the state. All these events remain traditionally described within the clinical framework of historical cause and consequence that discounts the haemorrhage; that bleed into each other. I instead stand with Thomas Carlyle when he says, “History is the essence of innumerable biographies.” These biographies are the finer details that don’t fall into delineated categories of cause and consequence.
Sitting in his backyard, Gazi, an Indian, said, “The Partition did not just happen; the war did not just happen. It is unfinished and ongoing.” His backyard was also home to one of India’s border pillars with Bangladesh. The backyard opens into a river, through a narrow passage that acts as the riverine border between the two countries. As we walk by the river, I see people from both sides crossing regularly. “Yes, it happens” he says. “How do you cut a river into two”? Like thousands who live along this densely populated border, he has family just a few metres away in another country. Gazi’s grandmother was born when there was no border, just British India. A few years into her life, she became a citizen of Pakistan. One of her sons was in India. East Pakistan then became Bangladesh; then came the border pillars and more treaties. Gazi was born into a farming village with porous land and riverine border. Throughout his adolescence he witnessed ubiquitous BSF camps mushroom along the farmlands, barbed wire fences being erected, floodlights being installed, and a visible militarisation of the border. Fencing and floodlights, accompanied by aggressive and violent state intervention, are now rapidly transforming a once porous border. Fencing petitions a powerful logic through narratives around illegal migration, national security, counterinsurgency and illegal trade that is difficult to contest. Yet, this logic is regularly betrayed by the dailiness of it all. People like Gazi continue to transgress and subvert the border. It has not stopped migration, illicit trade, or secured the border. Instead, it has increased social and personal cost of the crossings.
Felani Khatun and her family, like millions before her, crossed over into India illegally a few years ago. Felani’s father Nurul Islam was taking her back to Bangladesh to have her married. They were crossing the border illegally at night by climbing over the barbed wire fence in Anantapur, Fulbari. It was widely reported that Felani’s clothes got caught in the barbed wire and she screamed in panic. BSF constable Ghosh fired at her, wounding her fatally. What followed were multiple repetitions and versions, with the most gruesome being that Felani struggled to stay alive for four hours, begging for water before dying.
A year later, I travelled through the region and asked various BSF guards and officers along the Bengal frontier about the killing of Felani. Most of them had never heard of this incident; almost all BSF personnel responded in abstractions or replied with questions. The afterthought was unhappiness about India’s new policy of restraints and how it was impossible to protect the borders without coercive force. “These women cross illegally and cry rape; they smuggle goods inside their purdah…Some are Indians only in name; all of them have relatives in Bangladesh. Family means more than the lines,” said another young officer in Amudiya, who went on to show a video in his phone, where his team had apprehended two women smuggling in Nike shoes. The more time I spent with the BSF guards, the more they reminded me of the young recruits I met in the remote borders of Afghanistan.
By the time I returned, Felani’s trial had had its day in the General Security Courts set up by the BSF. Constable Ghosh was charged and acquitted of culpable homicide. Evidence against him was deemed “inconclusive and insufficient”. Constable Ghosh and thousands like him are responsible for the preservation of the State’s rights in these exceptional places, where they are vested with the power to make unilateral decisions over life and death, without being accountable to the law. They are not evil, wicked, sadistic or vile; yet they are terrifying in that, with all this power, they are trained to act, not think. The BSF border guards are ingrained through training and constant reinforcement that the borderlands are “a different space, a contentious space” where order must be established through force. Here exceptional acts of coercion and violence are the new normal. The most clinical and pathological argument in defence of killing was: “Since Felani and many others like her were illegally transgressing into Indian territory — often at night, paying touts and traffickers — they were ‘not innocent’, but ‘legitimate targets’.” Felani’s death and other deaths over the border is a face to a much larger politics of State of Exception that transforms identity, migration and militarisation of territory into issues of national security.
“There is no end to the ideology of difference,” said Pakistani political scientist and writer Eqbal Ahmed. Yet along the borders people are regularly turned into religious and cultural categories. Bengali becomes differentiated into Hindu Bengali and Muslim Bengali. Within Muslims, the categories are locals and Bangladeshi. While turning people into categories is accomplished easily on paper and policy, in practice how do you differentiate local Muslims and the Muslims from Bangladesh who speak the same language, follow the same customs, and are part of the same cultural composite? When I asked a BSF guard in Taki, he acknowledged that it was hard. “They all look the same, speak the same.” Then “that it is why we need to keep a closer watch”. Here suspicion and surveillance go hand in hand.
A BSF document produced earlier this year describes the border population’s characteristics. Key attributes include, “Predominantly Muslim”, “Illiteracy, backwardness and poverty”, “Inclination of youth towards easy money”, “Hostile towards the forces”. An officer at Petrapole remarked, “They don’t drink, so they use cough syrup.” It is tacitly implied that people’s behaviour can be predicted based on their religion, and socially deviant behaviour is a residue of one’s religious and cultural beliefs. Stereotypical depiction of an entire group of people as shiftless and inclined to criminal behaviour sustains the idea that the populations they secure is fundamentally different and demand such treatment. Complex and nuanced accounts regularly become esoteric reductions and representation of whole groups of people, their history, memory and boundaries. Obligation towards ‘individual truth’ is regularly and systematically undermined in these edges. Truth is neither altered nor silenced, instead setting limits to it, has become the greatest weapon against resistance.
Nietzsche once noted that only that which has no history can be defined. And yet the discourse of nationalism is aimed at creating foundational myths about a Nation’s beginning, defining the people, its conflicts and its aggressors. While defining the “problematic other”, the state always casts them as actors in the discourse of conflict, stripped of history and agency. “A nation is bound not only by the real past, but the stories it tells itself, by what it remembers, and what it forgets,” said Colin Thubron. We are at a time when we have not earned the right to forget the past, yet around us is a vigorous effort to prematurely rewrite a singular history that is fraught with multiple, competing narratives of memory.

Borderlands Project is Suchitra Vijayan’s 9,000-mile journey through India's borders to understand the human dimension of political borders. The project is conceived as a travelogue chronicling stories along India’s border with Pakistan, China, Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh, and Burma. Partly visual anthropology and partly an attempt at understanding the Indian state, and the fringes it governs.

CB-CID teams rush to Guwahati, Patna
","As part of the probe into the twin blasts on the Bangalore-Guwahati Express here on May 1, special teams of the Crime Branch-CID have reached Guwahati and Patna, agency sources said on Saturday.
Armed with the CCTV footage of two persons who were found moving in a suspicious manner in the Bangalore and Chennai Central railway stations, investigators would make inquiries with some passengers who travelled in S-4 and S-5 coaches up to Guwahati.
After preliminary inquiries, the State police and National Security Guard (NSG) officials revealed that the explosives were similar to those used in the Patna blasts, another team reached Patna.
“We want to examine the suspects arrested in the multiple blasts in Patna, which occurred hours before BJP leader Narendra Modi was to address an election rally there,” a CB-CID official said.
Meanwhile, forensic experts who analysed the debris from the scene of blast indicated that Ammonium Nitrate was the main ingredient. Investigators were seeking the help of Information Technology experts to extract a better visual from the CCTV footage.
The footage in Bangalore showed a man taking the escalator and walking towards Platform No. 3, from where the train departed, sources said.
“Since he was carrying a bag, it is possible that there was another person who either boarded the train in Bangalore or the following stations. We are seeking the assistance of IT experts to improve the quality of images found in the CCTV footage,” a CB-CID official said.

Love of singing
","“We all used to meet at the same bar and for us the glass that we were having was obviously half full. The essence to us was the love for music and our story has always been about friendship and music and the opportunity to live new experiences,” said Sharif D Rangnekar, one of the voices of the band Friends of Linger.
The band performed at Hard Rock Cafe, Saket, recently. They have always shared the common dream of performing live on stage, a desire that has become real thanks to their tenacity and due to the help of the renowned professional guitarist Adhir Ghosh.
As the band is new, they play mostly covers, and they do it in a very democratic way. The experience of this group, in fact, is quite unusual since there are five amateurs singers – Sharif, Craig Cranenburgh, Deepak Sharma, Devyani Shankar and Varun Kapoor – and none of them is the leading voice: while performing they switch from one genre to another according to the skills or the feelings of every member. Asked about the difficulties arising from the vocal limitations of the members and to the criticism they make about each other without quarrelling, they in unison commented: “Once in the studio, the larger part of our egos is left outside the door.” All of them have very different working experiences and, as the only female voice Devyani said: “We sing because we love singing. Our experience is purely fun based.”
The band is also working on self-produced songs and one of those, titled “Head held high”, is nearly at the end of the creative process. While having fun with covers, the group wants also to spread messages through their music. They would like to play a role in building a tolerant society willing to accept and making the people aware on how they can contribute.
“Head held high” has a human rights approach and it is about the LGBT community which has been in the limelight in recent times and the problems faced by them currently in the Indian society. The message, as Craig said is, “At the end of the day it does not matter if a couple is made by a man and a woman, by a man and a man or by a woman and a woman. The only thing that matters is that there are two human beings who love each other.”

Food delivery apps are the order of the day "," 
Feeling spent after five days of toil and stress at work and in no mood to fix a meal? Don’t fuss. Simply reach for the phone and make a couple of swipes before tuning in to the next episode of your favourite TV show. Voilà! The chow you’ve been craving for all week is at your doorstep soon enough.
With the mushrooming of app-based home delivery services in the city, “eating in” has become the new thing, with many denizens preferring to indulge their taste-buds while enjoying the familiar comforts of their homes or multi-task at work and still not skip that vital energy-boosting meal. Such apps are proving handy not just for gourmets keen to relish their favourite delicacy from a preferred restaurant but also for those looking to tuck into some authentic naadan food prepared by professional home chefs. PinStove, Swapp, Hoppon, Streetbell and Rabbito are some of the popular options available.
As the trend catches on, MetroPlus catches up with some entrepreneurs behind the tech-driven hunger solution in the city.
With over 100 home chefs on its rolls, PinStove has quickly established itself as a trusty conduit to connect customers with verified home chefs at their service. Officially launched in early 2017, the app was brought to life by a core team of four business partners — Baiju Muhammad, Bhagavan Das, Harry Croydon (from the U.K.) and Jayamohan R.S — of an IT company who often met up in London in course of their work.
“Though there’s a multitude of home chefs in the city, the sector used to be quite unorganised. With PinStove, we wanted to bring in more connect and cohesion. We knew that such an app would also remove uncertainties over placement and delivery of orders for chefs as well,” says Aneesh V.K., one of the directors of PinStove, head-quartered in Technopark.
Once a home chef registers himself or herself with PinStove, a team visits the person to “create a personal bond” and assesses the kitchen facilities for certification. The chefs are given the freedom to decide the prices depending on the dish. Despite choosing not to tie up with restaurants, Aneesh says the response from customers for home-cooked food has been rather overwhelming. Ask him what the most sought-after item on the menu is? “Inevitably, pothichoru,” he says. 
For the fast-expanding mobile app Swapp, food delivery is one of the many services on offer. “We believe there are two kinds of hungry customers. First, those who need a bit of help to decide from where they want to eat or what they want to eat. Then there is the second type who knows exactly what food they want and where they want to buy it from, say a specific masala dosa or a specific biriyani from a specific restaurant. Swapp works for the second type, as it is a platform that fosters a direct relationship between a loyal customer and a restaurant,” says Bavani Srinu, who co-founded Swapp with her husband, Ashwin Panicker. 

Once you are connected to a particular restaurant or eatery, the next time you open Swapp, they automatically appear in the “wallet section.” Users can thus keep on adding their personal favourites, in effect creating a list of preferred options. Bavani says Swapp aims to finish the delivery within 30 minutes from the time the food is prepared, depending on the locations, while also employing an “internal” delivery team.

For Hoppon, an e-commerce platform for “hyper-local businesses” currently supported only on Android, the food delivery department is an integral part of its larger business network. Started in January last year, Hoppon now predominantly focusses in and around Technopark, apart from certain “busy” pockets in the city. Though started with tie-ups with restaurants having delivery facility, the company has been utilising its own team for the purpose for the past six months or so, says Suri Amarnath, CEO of ThoughtLine Technologies, which powers Hoppon. Suri plans to expand the network beyond Thirumala in one direction and Pappanancode in another soon.

With rising prices of fuel and the sheer number of orders flooding in every hour, Streetbell, an online shopping market platform, however, prefers to tie up with only those restaurants with a home delivery service. 

“The mechanism of having a small delivery team that has to rush to places may not be always feasible, especially on weekends when orders pile up,” feels Hari Sambudevan, CEO of Streetbell, which takes orders on both its app and website. Streetbell’s app, which was part of the Kerala Start-up Mission, was conceived and brought out by a core team of nine members. It now has tie-ups with over 50 restaurants in the city, with over 14,000 registered customers.
If the four key players in the market have IT-based origin, Rabbito, a stand-alone food delivery app launched earlier this year, took wing after a group of four friends faced a practical dilemma. “We once wanted to order a cake for a friend’s mother. However, we couldn’t find anyone in the locality. We then had to zoom in on a seller located some distance away and had to pay extra for delivery charges. That’s when we realised we could establish such a service ourselves. That’s how the idea came about,” says Anto Joseph C.J., a co-founder of Rabbito, who works with the police department.
When they consulted a software service provider in the city for technical support, it so happened that it had already done a similar model for a U.K.-based firm. “So we could easily formulate an Indianised version and add necessary features to it,” says Anto. With an in-house delivery apparatus, the three-month-old service is open from 11 am till 11 pm.
However, despite the digital ease of placing an order, a lot of manual work goes into the system, and sometimes things may not go according to the plan. “On delivery failures or other glitches, customers can avail themselves of either refund or loyalty points that can be redeemed for another order,” says Aneesh of PinStove. Hari of Streetbell points out that delivery issues can crop up once in a while, but “we cannot categorise a seller right from get-go.”
With an eye on the burgeoning market pie, Zomato, an online restaurant search and food delivery platform that was started in India and now has presence in over 20 countries, is taking baby steps in the city.
Restaurants and home chefs seem to embrace this symbiotic model of food delivery as it helps cut down transportation charges and tide over practical hurdles.
So, next time pangs of hunger gnaw your tummy and its either scorching hot or raining cats and dogs outside, just sate your appetite with a simple swipe of your finger.

On Parkinson’s trail ","Despite research spread over decades, scientists are yet to figure out the cause for Parkinson’s disease, a neurodegenerative disorder. One thing is clear: the aggregation of a protein called alpha-synuclein plays a key role in development of the disease. The aggregation pathway of this protein is the subject of intense research and studies so far have focussed on protein aggregates, called amyloid fibrils, which form late in the aggregation pathway.
Researchers at the CSIR-Indian Institute of Chemical Biology (CSIR-IICB), Kolkata, have now proposed that alpha-synuclein oligomers that come into the picture early in the aggregation pathway could be responsible for the development of Parkinson’s.
They used two amino acids to conduct their study in live neuroblastoma cells. The first one was glutamate, which happens to assist the formation of amyloid fibrils by facilitating generation of early oligomers. The second one was arginine, which inhibits amyloid fibril formation by inducing a large change in the shape of the native protein.
The study has shown that it is possible to monitor early events of the aggregation pathway when the native protein fluctuates in its monomeric states or when it forms early oligomeric molecules by using a combination of conventional methods and spectroscopy at the single molecule level.
“We have shown that it is possible to monitor and understand the early events in aggregation. It gives us hope that a therapeutic molecule may be possible against early oligomeric molecules,” says Dr. Krishnananda Chattopadhyay, leader of the research team.
“The study establishes that glutamate acts as a facilitator and arginine acts as an inhibitor of the late stage of alpha synuclein aggregation. However, it is not clear if the observed effect is because of other cellular changes due to the addition of these molecules or direct interaction of these molecules with alpha-synuclein. The mechanism of internalisation and interaction of these molecules with alpha-synuclein needs to be better understood. It will also be challenging to understand how one can transform this knowledge for drug development for a complex disease such as Parkinson’s,” says Dr. Samir K. Maji of IIT Bombay, who was not connected with the study.
Other researchers in the study included Sumanta Ghosh and Amrita Kundu of the CSIR-ICB. The research results have been published in the journal, Scientific Reports, and the work was funded by the Department of Science and Technology, Government of India.

From the bazaars of Hyderabad
","A whiff of spices invites me to Nizam’s Khana, the Hyderabadi food festival at Fairfield by Marriott. Waiters are clad in white kurta-pyjama and traditional prayer caps on their heads. A live counter at a side serves fish, chicken and beef kebabs. I settle down to a glass of Hyderabadi lassi to start that somehow reminds me of the flavour of sweet paan. G. Somu, the head chef tells me why. “I have added a twist to the drink by adding gulkand in it that is used in meetha fan, an integral part of Hyderabadi cuisine.” He recommends I try Haleem. Garnished with caramelised onion and mint leaves on top, it is gooey and has a strong flavour of lamb meat and ghee. “Muslims in Hyderabad usually break their Ramadan fasting with haleem. It is rich in proteins and has almonds, pistachio, cashew, oats, ghee, broken wheat,lamb meat and chana dal as it’s ingredients. It takes nearly 12 hours to make haleem in the traditional way. Even the bones of the lamb have to melt into the meat during this process,” explains the chef who lets me into a secret that he has a technique up his sleeve that cuts down on time of preparation. 




I savour the tender chicken pieces that are in the Murg Badami Shorba. I like its mildly spiced flavour. The beef kabab is perfectly grilled and the pudina chutney is a perfect companion to it. I am served some small sized puris, which I learn are Lukmi - crisp on the outside and stuffed with spinach and corn. I spoon up the tangy Lagaan ka Murg with the sheermal, a flat, slightly sweet bread. There is saffron in the sheermal and it is often eaten with Haleem too, I am informed. 
I am expecting a spicy biriyani but I am pleasantly surprised when I eat the Kacche Gosht Ka Biriyani. I taste a hint of cinnamon and am regaled with a story about its origins by the chef as I dig in. “Long ago in Hyderabad, during a battle, soldiers found they were running out of rations. Their chef was instructed to come up with a dish that could be eaten by itself without any side dish. He suggested a rice dish made with spices and was both healthy and delicious. This was the Biriyani.” Chef Somu says the Kacche Gosht Ka Biriyani took him two years to master. “The meat used is not cooked before marination, hence its name. And there are less known ingredients such as Khus Ki Jad and Pan Ki Jad that are also added to give it its unique flavour,” he says.
The Kubani ka Meetha is the perfect finale with its apricots, rabdi, slivers of cashew and badam. It is delicious and I can’t leave for home without a second helping.

The craft of documenting food
","Let’s admit it, we live to eat. And what better way to kickstart the weekend than a food conclave that offers discussions and masterclasses on art, literature, photography and media production all which centre on food. The event dubbed The Culinary Chroniclers Conclave is helmed by food consultant and author Rushina Munshaw-Ghildiyal and Vikhroli Cucina. “Many people have taken it upon themselves to record the diverse facets of food consumption, using whatever mediums are available to them at the time. Their chronicles become important windows to understanding their cultures, and sometimes through that, our very own,” says Munshaw-Ghildiyal who will conduct a food doodling session at the event. The event will also host food installations: ‘Layers of a Tiffin’ by Sonal Ved and Shirali Tyabji; and ‘The Story of Chocolate’ by chocolatier Zeba Kohli.Here are six sessions from the food conclave that should not be missed:
From plate to page
Ankiet Gulabani who has a popular Instagram account, Belly Over Mind takes you through the nuances of recipe writing. “When you are writing a recipe, you are talking to a friend. To make sure a reader follows the steps to the tee, it is important to know how to record a recipe and structure it with an interesting narrative,” he says.
Oral traditions
Author Saee Koranne-Khandekar will be in conversation with writer Lalita Iyer and television food content producer Shubra Chatterji. “Together, we will unearth culinary oral literature through harvest songs, nursery rhymes, kitchen songs that pass on food wisdom from one generation to the next,” says Koranne -Khandekar.
Media
Be it for your YouTube Channel, Instagram or Facebook content, learn to make food videos from food content TV producer Ruchi Srivastava. “People are passionate but don’t know how to shoot a video properly. I will take participants through shoot planning, must-haves for a shoot and how to get good content out of limited technology,” declares Srivastava
Culinary histories
Food historian Dr Mohsina Mukadam will take you through the sources for documenting culinary history. “Conventional methods consider archival material and archaeological sources, while unconventional references include cookbooks, ayurvedic texts, menu cards and even advertisements,” explains the good doctor.
Cooking the books
Journalist and food writer Vikram Doctor will be in conversation with food authors Saee Koranne-Khandekar and Jyotsna Shahane, who are knowledgeable about Marathi cookbook scene. “We will go to the depths of Maharastrian food culture, some of the earliest cook books, practicality of cookbooks, what makes people want to use cookbooks, and meaning of tradition among other things,” says Doctor.
Food fables
Celebrity chef Ranveer Brar “I am concentrating on the importance of food folklore and fables, as they are relevant towards documenting cuisine. We get fascinated towards facts, but there is a romance is storytelling,” says Brar, who will cite examples from the city and beyond. “The idea is to inspire people to collect and chronicle.”
Culinary Chroniclers Conclave takes place today from 10 a.m. to 7.30 p.m. at Vikhroli Cucina, Auditorium, Godrej One, Vikhroli; tickets are from ₹500-1500; for more details check at vikhrolicucina.com

What your gut is telling you
"," 
Millions of microorganisms that live inside the human gut play a critical role in not just metabolising food but also in maintaining overall health. The type and composition of gut bacteria depend on where we live and what we eat. For example, a study of gut bacteria among groups of Indians has shown that they vastly differ from those found among western populations and even depend on multiple factors such as exposure to pollution and the cooking medium.
The India focus
Human microbiome (colonies of bacteria) plays a key role in digestion, fat metabolism, ensuring resistance to infection and boosting human immunity against diseases. They are linked to a variety of human conditions ranging from obesity to anxiety and even one’s armpit smell. Thus, a study of the dynamics of microbiomes could help scientists understand/treat various conditions/diseases.
The new study, on the nature and composition of gut microbiomes of healthy Indians, has shown interesting trends. It was done among healthy individuals living in Ballabhgarh near Faridabad, Haryana, and Leh in the Ladakh region of Jammu and Kashmir; the findings have been published in the journal, Scientific Reports. The samples from Ballabgarh were categorised into rural and urban as there are different food habits/patterns of living. Faecal samples were analysed to document gut bacteria.
The findings
It was found that the gut microbiome of Indians are generally dominated by Firmicutes bacteria followed by Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, Spirochetes, Verrucomicrobia and Fusobacteria. There was marked variation in the functional compositions of microbiomes in the sample populations from the two regions. Variation was also seen between rural and urban areas as well as between plains and high altitude areas.
The study also suggests a link between the use of cooking oil and an abundance of specific microorganisms. For example, Collinsella was abundant in the gut of individuals who consumed ghee. Pseudomonas, which is associated with dairy products, was largely lacking in the Leh population probably because they don’t much consume dairy products. However, people here had a significantly higher concentration of bacteria like Faecalibacterium and Lachnospiraceae, which have anti-inflammatory functions.
The gut microbiomes from Ballabhgarh were found to have an abundance of genes which play an active role in the degradation of xenobiotic substances (carcinogens, pollutants, drugs and pesticides). This could be as a result of high exposure to industrial or agricultural chemicals such as fertilizers and pesticides. This means that in addition to food, environmental exposure plays a role in shaping our gut microbiome.
“Gram-positive bacteria (Fermicutes) are in more abundance in Indian microbiome. This is in sharp contrast to the earlier belief, according to which Gram-negative bacteria dominated the gut of Indians,” said Dr. Bhabatosh Das, lead researcher of the study. Gram positive and Gram negative are two broad categories of bacteria based on the difference in their cell walls.
Road ahead
“This research could open up possibilities of new interventions such as faecal transplantation in future to counter diseases such as Inflammatory bowel disease and Clostridium difficile infection, where antibiotics are proving to be less effective,” added Dr. Das.
The study was funded by the Department of Biotechnology and the Department of Science and Technology (DST)-UK India Education Research Initiative. — India Science Wire

The royal flavours of Awadh
","Known for its royal cuisine with delectable flavours, Awadhi cuisine has a specific style of cooking that brings out the real essence of the delicacies. “The bawarchis (cooks) of Awadh were the ones who first brought the concept of the ‘dum’ style of cooking or the art of cooking over a slow fire. It is this combination of slow cooking with perfect ingredients that brings the flavours,” says Chef Bulai Swain of Euphoria which is currently hosting an Awadhi Food Festival.
The Awadhi cuisine is originally from Uttar Pradesh’s Awadh region, which is a part of Lucknow now. Greatly influenced by Mughal cooking techniques, it bears similarities to the cuisines of Persia, Kashmir and Hyderabad. “The richness of Awadhi cuisine also lies in liberal use of ingredients like mutton, paneer and rich spices including cardamom and saffron,” Chef Swain explains.
And indeed, the kebabs dished out at the festival have a fine flavour of the spices that brings a delectable softness. One of the must-haves in the menu is the Kakori Kebab. This Mughlai dish has minced lamb marinated with a mix of ingredients and almost melts in the mouth.
The Nawabs considered cooking as a distinct form of art and were rather touchy about it , the chef tells us. Thus, you will find that every dish has been carefully presented with a distinct artistic touch.
One of the features of this cuisine is the Dum Pukht process, which involves sealing the ingredients in large ‘handis’. “There is an underlying sweetness in most of the dishes; that’s typical of Awadhi cuisine,” says the chef.
The Awadhi Biryani, unlike the Hyderabadi one, is simple and meaty wherein the rice and the meat are cooked separately and then mixed together. Some of the other dishes in the a-la-carte menu includes Dum Pukth Galouti Kebab, Mutton Boti Kebab and Murgh-e-Kalmi. The main course includes Khade Masala Ka Ghosht, Nihari Ghosht, Makhmali Murgh, Saffron Murgh and Nargisi Kofta with Ulta Tawa Paratha and Rumali Roti.
Vegetarians fret not. There are some delicious options in the menu like Veg Seekh Kebab, Badam Pasanda and Khumb Palak Kofta. And to wrap the culinary tour to the erstwhile kingdom of Awadh, there some delicious desserts like Shahi Tukra and Sohal Halwa. The restaurant’s live musical band enlivens the entire experience with a string of ghazals.

The festival is open for dinner till May 11.

No lillies at Lilypool but plenty of good food "," Thomas and Ancy Pottenkulam called Dubai home for over three decades with Thomas sailing the seas as a captain in Merchant Navy and Ancy running a bed and breakfast. But now they have dropped anchor in Agrahara Samakulam, about 25 kms from Coimbatore and opened the doors to their lovely home in the form of a weekend pop-up restaurant in a farm.
The dropped pin in google maps guided us through the country roads outside Coimbatore and reached Lilypool in about 45 minutes. We were warmly greeted by Thomas and led into the beautiful courtyard of their family home. For the Sunday lunch, our group consisted of a dozen adults and four kids. We had the courtyard and an air-conditioned dining room all to ourselves while Ancy and her daughter, Maya who was visiting from China, kept busy in the kitchen preparing our lunch.




As we settled down into a comfortable couch and a quaint wooden swing, piping hot and crispy Bread Bombs with a cheese filling were served with a creamy and tangy sauce. A set menu is served to the guests at Lilypool which can be tweaked based on our preference over the phone while making a reservation. We had asked for a non-Indian meal and were looking forward to tasting our way through Ancy’s culinary creations.
As we did not see a Lily pond in the vicinity and were curious to know more, we asked Ancy about the significance of the name. “I am an ardent fan of Maharani Gayatri Devi and the home she moved into after Rambagh Palace was called Lily Pool and I wanted to name my home the same,” was her reply. Soon after came a couple of more appetisers – crispy homemade Pita Bread served with a creamy Hummus and Pork in Garlic sauce. We had to hold back as we knew an elaborate lunch was waiting for us.
The dishes were laid out buffet-style in the dining room, and we started. The Prawn Salad that was served as individual portions in glasses was refreshing and light. There were two more salads – a juicy one with mangoes and pomegranate and a crunchy one with apples and cucumber. “I source all my ingredients locally and do not use any frozen products. The meat and vegetables are bought from multiple locations in Coimbatore from the best possible vendors even if it means that I have to drive from one end of town to the other,” said Ancy. 
 The Chicken Khowseuy with all its interesting little toppings was a favourite among the diners that afternoon. The Mutton Moussaka and Garlic Butter Fish were equally delicious. Some of us sat around the dining table while the spill over crowd found seats in the courtyard under a canvas canopy.
After a short pause, we were served Chocolate Fondue with fruits and an Apple Crumble with Vanilla Icecream for dessert. 
Many of us dream of Sundays in a farm with our family and friends. Lilypool offers just that with a very relaxed ambience and an indulgent spread that is hard to duplicate at home. With her roots in Kerala, Ancy is also adept at cooking Syrian Christian and Nair community specialities. This is enough reason for me and my family to head back there again.

Baking goals of homebakers
"," 
 Although Swathy S. Soman and Ann Vijo are no football buffs, they are down with ‘football fever’. Both Swathy and Ann have launched a range of football-themed cupcakes in connection with the ongoing FIFA World Cup. While Swathy plans to introduce cupcakes topped with the logos of various teams participating in the World Cup, jerseys of individual players, each team’s flags and the like this weekend, Ann has already delivered two football-themed cakes and is expecting a fresh set of orders. 




 It was a recent order of cupcakes Swathy received that sprouted the seed of idea of introducing such cupcakes. “A customer ordered cupcakes for her son’s birthday. As her son is a Chelsea (football club) fan, she wanted me to make cupcakes based around that theme.” And so with the help of fondant and edible print sheets, Swathy created Chelsea-inspired toppers for the cupcakes. “There was the Chelsea jersey, a football on a football ground, the Chelsea team logo... as toppers,” she says. 
Although you can choose your favourite flavour, red velvet is Swathy’s speciality. While there will be a few boxes of cupcakes available for sale over the weekend, Swathy says the cupcakes will be prepared on order during the rest of the World Cup period. Swathy can be reached on her Facebook page, Red Velvet Bakers.




 A homebaker, Ann is known amongst her customers for her customised theme cakes. “I love challenges and making themed cakes fits the bill.” So, when a customer sent her a picture of a round black-and-white chequered cake shaped like a football, she decided to go a step further. “While surfing the Internet one day, I saw a dome-shaped cake and have been itching to make one. When my customer told me the cake was for her husband, who is a die-hard football fan, I decided to make the dome-shaped cake and turn it into a football-themed cake.”
The cake with vanilla and chocolate as a base and whipped cream and chocolate ganache topping was a success.
Once she posted the picture of the cake on her Facebook page, Ann’s Patisserie, Ann received another order, from a daughter who wanted to pick up a cake for her father, who is fan of the Argentinian team. The customer wanted a similar cake but with the colours of the Argentinian team’s jersey — blue and white. 




“From birthdays to get-togethers to pre- or post- match parties, football themed cakes and cupcakes seem to be a hit with the public, especially with Malayalis, who are fond of the game,” says Ann.

All you need to know about growing pumpkin in your kitchen garden ","Pumpkins come in unique shapes, sizes and hues and have diverse flavours. They are a rich source of Vitamin A, potassium and fibre. Unlike vining gourds and cucumbers, they do not require a trellis or stakes for support. As the fruits are large and heavy, the plants are allowed to spread on the ground. Ideally grown on the edge of a garden bed where it receives adequate sunlight, they can also be grown in large troughs or grow bags. As with most plants, they thrive in loose, well-drained soil and under direct sunlight which allows the fruit to ripen evenly. Most kitchen gardens have a few pumpkin vines growing with companion crops, or even on a compost heap. Though they are considered monsoon crops, pumpkins can be grown throughout the year — successive planting will provide a steady supply of fruits. Look for local varieties like amir or new hybrids like arka suryamukhi, ambili, suvarna and sooraj in succession for a wide range of flavours and textures.
Soil: Pumpkins and other cucurbits grow best in neutral or slightly acidic soil. Choose a sunny location with well-drained soil. Add neem cake or neem solution to the soil a week before planting. Mix organic matter, wood ash and well-rotted manure into the soil. Pumpkins grow best when sown on a raised soil base with a depressed ring below to keep it moist but well-drained. The mound should be about 8-12 inches high and around 2 feet circumference at the base. This can also be done on a long raised ridge with the same proportions.
Sow: Soak the seeds in warm water for a day to promote germination. The seeds can be started in a nursery and shifted later, but for best results sow directly in prepared beds. If they are to be planted on flat ground, keep a distance of 3 feet for the vines to spread out. For raised soil, flatten the top of the heap and press the seeds an inch deep — 3 seeds per mound or 3 feet apart if it is on a ridge. For terrace gardens, use large deep troughs with at least 1.5 feet depth and sow 2 seeds in each.
Moon Phase: Pumpkins, like all cucurbits, are best sown after the second quarter, as the moonlight increases and the gravitational pull decreases.




Companion Plants: Corn, radish. Marigold and nasturtium grown alongside will deter pests. In turn, the leafy foliage of the cucurbits deters weed growth, which is a boon for its companion plants.
Care: Once the seeds have sprouted, restrict weed growth around the seedlings with an organic mulch of leaves or grass cuttings. Remove weak seedlings at this stage. As the long vines supply nutrition to the plants, they should be well-maintained by trimming dead leaves and weak side vines. Watering is best done in the evening, preferably by drip tubes which supply water directly to the roots; excess water on the leaves can cause powdery mildew. Deep drenching once a week is sufficient to keep the soil and plant moist. Protect against aphids, ants and other pests by spraying with a neem solution; peppermint solution is another insect repellent which can be sprayed once a week. Look for squash bugs under the leaves and remove them by hand. The plants should be nourished weekly with compost tea or diluted panchagavya. Once the flowers appear, sprinkle wood ash around the plant on alternate weeks to supply potash.
Pumpkins produce male and female flowers on the same plant and are naturally pollinated by insects. Often, nature doesn’t comply and the plant will produce malformed fruit. To ensure this, pollination can be done manually. Identify the flowers — the female flower has a small fruit at the base and the male is distinguishable by its absence. Rub the male flower over the female flower to transfer pollen. This will increase chances of healthy well-proportioned vegetables.
Harvest: Most pumpkin varieties can be harvested after three months, when the fruit has ripened on the vine.
Saving Seeds: Save enough seeds from the ‘best-of-the crop’ for the next season. Let the pumpkin ripen on the vine and leave to soften further. Remove the seeds and leave to dry completely in direct sun. Mix with ash and store in an airtight container.

A dose of health "," Stop me if you have heard this before, but health is wealth. Or, at least, that’s what many of my friends seem to believe. I am being flooded with suggestions on healthy living and being introduced to food with high health quotients. I am not really complaining, for I have come to the conclusion that healthy food doesn’t taste bad at all. Taken in small amounts, that is! 
It was with a halo over my head that I agreed to a friend’s suggestion that we meet at a small place called Minerals in the DDA sports complex in Asiad Village. I was told it had two USPs: the food was light and tasty, and the surroundings were beautiful. 
Both turned out to be true. Minerals is fairly new. If you are on Khel Gaon Road, coming from India Gate, turn left at the Siri Fort crossing. Minerals is right at the end and is open to all. We went there one weekend and found the place bustling with life. 
Lively ambience
A lot of people stop there after doing their regular exercises at the sports complex. We took a table by the window, and I was struck by the greenery all around. There were too many people being overly active all around me (walking, jogging and doing other such unspeakable things), but I felt at peace when I saw the green expanse. I sipped my coffee and looked at the menu.
We asked for a plate of grilled egg sandwiches (₹180), French toast (₹95 for single; 155 for double) and assorted vegetable poha (₹125). 
We thought we’d have idlis (₹75) or vegetable-stuffed idlis (₹99) but they had just finished a batch, and the new one would have taken some time. We asked for cold coffee and fresh coconut water along with the food.
I had a grilled egg sandwich after a long time and enjoyed it thoroughly. French toast, again, is a favourite of mine, but in our house it is cooked in two ways – a sweet version with cinnamon that the other family members like, and my kind, which is savoury and has onions. This was a mix of the two, mildly sweet and salty, and quite nice. 
Wholesome dish
 


But what I enjoyed the most was the poha, which was light and fluffy and great to eat. Poha, if not cooked well, can be either soggy or too dry. This was just right.
There are other interesting items on the menu, which has various kinds of fresh juices, snacks and soups and salads. 
The menu includes tomato and basil soup (₹79), lemon and coriander soup (₹ 89), hummus and pita (₹159), sprout salad (₹95), lemony chickpea salad (₹175) and Caesar salad (₹195). It has a vegetable club sandwich (₹125), paneer and salsa tortilla wrap (₹175) and different kinds of Blue Tokai coffees.
I liked Minerals. The traffic was light that day, and we cruised our way there for our early lunch. I tried not to look at all the men in their shorts and tees, drinking their orange juice after a heavy work-out, and instead concentrated on the picturesque green lawn outside. I’d had my dose of health.

On bunny chow, a staple food at Durban "," I couldn’t believe we were travelling 30 kilometres to eat bunny chow. Can’t we just stop at one of those ubiquitous Nandos instead? 
But a friend insisted we savour the Durban delicacy, and promised it would be worth it. So we reached De’Ma restaurant at the Gateway Shopping Centre in Umhlanga in Durban to eat the famed bunny chow. “Quarter or half?” the waiter asked, followed by, “chicken or mutton?”
Asking for a quarter with chicken seemed a safe bet. The size of the loaf and overflowing chicken curry, like volcanic lava, was an overwhelming sight. The look and taste of the gravy was pretty much Indian. Unlike the Gatsby, which is Cape Town’s favourite sandwich, where a foot-long bread is stuffed with just about everything available in the refrigerator, bunny chow has just one filling — curry.
It’s the plating that truly takes the cake. An uncut loaf of bread, hollowed out in the centre is filled with curry, either chicken, mutton or sometimes beans-based gravies. A big cut-potato and carrot salad are served on the side along with the scooped-out bread, to be eaten with the gravy. 
Succulent chicken pieces are well-cooked in tomato gravy and you can detect the distinct flavour of Indian spices. The closest Indian parallel I could think of is pav-bhaji. Halfway through, the bread loaf absorbs the curry, and as you go breaking the mountain of the bread, more curry spills out from the well. It’s a mess... but a delightful, finger-licking mess.
There’s no clear historical origin to Bunny Chow, though. It’s believed to be an Indian innovation in the 19th Century, when Indian workers arrived in South Africa. In between laborious work, they would pack their curries inside the bread to save time. 
Bunny Chow also became popular during Apartheid, when most restaurant owners would not allow black diners inside their restaurants, and instead, would pack the curries inside a loaf of bread and give it as a takeaway. 
The very name ‘bunny’, many agree, is derived from the ‘bania’ community, who’d run these restaurants. But for most Durban residents now, bunny chow is a staple, a fast takeaway option, or even an evolved fine dining experience. 
Either way, while in Durban, make sure not to miss this chow!

For the love of feathered friends
","Amongst several thick books on accounting and finance one can spot a book or two about birds and bonsai gardening in Vikram Penmetsa’s office. A chartered accountant by profession, Penmetsa’s heart lies in birdwatching. 
Even amidst lush green leaves or thick bushes, Penmetsa can easily sense the presence of a bird. This is a gift that one acquired after many years of experience. “I can spot birds at a considerable distance, even when no one else can see them. There have been many instances when I have pulled over while driving to find a bird. Even at the speed of a moving car, I can easily spot a bird,” he laughs. 
He explains that birdwatching is a hobby that demands a lot of patience. “All it takes is a pair of binoculars, a field guide and lots of patience to enjoy birdwatching,” he says.
 Apart from birds, it also teaches enthusiasts about nature, habitat, landscape and biodiveristy. “Initially, it requires patience as amateurs know little about birds and it takes a lot of time for them to recognise each one. So going along with people who are experienced would help them learn and make it a better experience,” he says.
The spotting and recognition of a bird usually depends on the four major factors — size of the bird, size of the beak, shape of the beak and colour of the feathers. “The size of the bird is compared to that of the crow because everyone has seen a crow and hence it makes comparison easy,” he says. 
However, Penmetsa did not acquire this expertise in a matter of days. It has taken him 18 years and innumerable trips to the fields, hills and water bodies to see the birds and study their habitat. 
“I started birdwatching from 2000 when I became a member of Birdwatchers Society of Andhra Pradesh (BSAP) in Hyderabad. When I moved back to Visakhapatnam, I wanted to continue with the hobby. Through social media, I tried to connect with more people and eventually formed Vizag Birdwatchers Society,” he says. 
Nestled among the Eastern Ghats, Visakhapatnam is blessed with a rich biodiversity making it a hub for birds and a delight for the birdwatchers. Today, Vizag Birdwatchers Society has roughly 500 members who gather and set out for birdwatching at least once a month. “The best time for birdwatching is during the winters. Most of the Himalayan birds migrate down South to avoid the harsh winters. So October to January would be an ideal time for birdwatching,” he says. 
Some of the birds that frequently visit the region are Great crested grebe, Tufted duck, Pochards and Mallards. “Three years ago, we had the opportunity to see a thick-billed Green pigeon which has not been spotted in this region before,” he says.
Birdwatcher’s paradise
For those who are interested in picking up this hobby, Penmetsa has a list of places to begin. Meghadri Gedda Reservoir, Araku Valley, Thatipudi Reservoir, Kambalkonda Wildlife Sanctuary and Thotlakonda are the must-go places for birdwatchers in the city. Apart from birdwatching, the chartered accountant also conducts bird census in Visakhapatnam and Vizianagaram areas. 
“The data collected from this census is first given to BSAP which is then passed to Bombay Natural History Society before it is sent to Singapore and Netherlands where the world database for birds is made,” he says.

How to make the perfect espresso martini ","The bartending industry is, as always, throwing both serious and fun together: the Delhi chapter of the Ultimate Bartender Championship 2018, held on the 12th of this month at Studio XO Bar, in South Extension, saw 55 of the city’s most talented bartenders battle it out for a win. Bartending may not be a profession you tell your folks you’re hankering after in class 12, but it’s definitely one that’s drawing serious attention for those in the F&B industry.
“As a profession, it has become as important as that of a chef in a restaurant. Slowly, the trend of bartender-driven bars from London and Paris is trickling into India too. It’s a very good time to be in the industry,” said Pankaj Balachandran, the India Brand Ambassador for Monkey Shoulder that has brought the bartender championship to India for its second season (worldwide it’s in the fourth year). As a malt, Monkey Shoulder is a Scotch whisky blended from three speyside single malts, and is perfect for cocktails.
Over the course of the day, competitors were tested on “skills that pay bills” such as ingredient knowledge, budgeting, mixing, nosing, and speed. Rounds included a quiz, the Mixiodic Table (a play on the more conventional Periodic Table), and the final Speed Challenge. This last test, refereed by last year’s national winner Paramveer Singh, required the six finalists to prepare a melange of eight cocktails, including an Espresso Martini and a Monkey Splash, in under five minutes. After a high-pressure round, the contest’s host, Balachandran, announced that the city’s bartenders had performed exceedingly well and achieved commendable total scores. Unfortunately, unlike Mumbai and Pune, Delhi lacked female participation.
Tanka Gurung, who works at Perch Wine and Coffee Bar, in Vasant Vihar, emerged as the winner of the Delhi round with seven out of eight correct drinks, a clean bar, and the best time record. “Now my focus is on the finals. This is the most interesting competition that I have participated in through my career because we are tested on everything we do behind the bar on a daily basis,” he said. He, along with three other finalists, Chirag Pal, Vineet Kumar, and Ankur Kashyap, will compete in the India Grand Finale to be held in New Delhi on 28th June. 
The finale will see the top contestants from Hyderabad, Bengaluru, Chandigarh, Goa, Mumbai, Gurgaon, Pune, Kolkata, and Delhi battle for a customised 500 CC motorcycle and a coveted place in one of the bar industry’s most prestigious global event, the Athens Bar Show, with an all-expenses-paid trip. 
Exploring global trends
 
“This competition gives us the chance to explore global trends and implement them in India. My aim is to take Indian bartending to the next level so we can compete with countries like USA and UK. It’s not easy. I belong to a pure non-alcoholic, vegetarian family. We do 12-13 hour shifts without enough money or recognition. But things are definitely getting better,” Pal said.
The Indian bartending industry is reaching an exciting stage of broadened scope, more innovation, and greater appreciation for the art that it is. Contests like this will hopefully break stereotypes, establishing this as a career that goes beyond flair bartending. 
“You cannot be the ultimate bartender if all you know is how to throw a bottle in the air. You need a number of different skills. The idea of this contest is to train and groom youngsters,” Balachandran said, of the competition with an average age of 25.

From flab to fit once more
","A few months after she delivered her first baby, a young mother posted a photograph of herself with a caption ‘getting back to shape project’ and Facebook friends of the former journalist were quick to cheer and motivate her. She followed it up with sporadic status updates, outlining her diet and fitness routines. Months later, she posted photographs of herself, much slimmer after all the working out.
Many young mothers choose not to be oblivious to post-partum weight gain. The intention to walk that extra mile and get back to being their former selves stems from a growing awareness towards being healthy and fit and the yearning to be a young, fit mother. “There’s a lot of peer pressure. I looked around me and realised all my friends went back to being fit in no time after pregnancy,” says Sunaina Sood, a mother of two.
Between golf, swimming, gym and jogging, Sunaina manages to keep herself fit amidst her family and work commitments. “Women today take on so many responsibilities that keep us on our toes because unlike the previous generation, we have only one or two children,” she adds.
The journey towards being healthy and fit begins during pregnancy with a firm focus on ‘eating healthy’ than ‘eating for two’. “The book ‘What to expect when you’re expecting’ was my bible and I was stuck by an observation that one could get away having an ice cream in normal condition but during pregnancy, the empty calories without nutrition are going to add to your waistline. I understood the need to eat sensibly,” explains Sunaina.
Women who habitually lead a healthy lifestyle find the path back to fitness easier to handle, observes fitness trainer Gavin Holt who mentions a young mother’s transformation from flab to fit in six months. But he also points to the danger of fitness turning into an obsession. “When new mothers come to the gym, we check their medical history — normal delivery or a C-section, and find out if they are nursing. Nursing mothers should take up easy to moderate workouts and have a regular, nutritious diet.”
In many cases, training new mothers calls for counselling to deal with post-partum depression. “Some women take time to cope with the changes in their body. They want to get back to their pre-pregnancy weight as quickly as possible and don’t like walking around with a sagging lower abdomen. We make them understand that it’s all part of a natural process and losing weight is not tough,” says Gavin. In the initial stages, he suggests working out as and when possible. Twice or thrice a week would suffice for women attending to the new born day and night.
Consistency and moderate exercise help in gradually knocking off extra pounds, notes trainer Faiyaz Ali. “One has to be rational. For nursing mothers, I would recommend a 20 to 30-minute workout that consists mainly of cardio and light weights. Going overboard can stress the body that’s witnessing hormonal changes,” he says. Faiyaz suggests maintaining an active lifestyle coupled with healthy eating habits. “I ask women to take it easy and be judicious with their workouts. The intensity can be stepped up eventually. I’ve come across mothers who are good runners. Think long term and don’t fret if it takes a few more months to get back in shape,” he sums up.

Fitness checklist

- Consult your doctor before you begin a fitness routine.
- Sleepless nights while attending to the newborn can make it tough to stick to a workout pattern. Begin with two days a week.
- Remember the basics — eat moderately at regular intervals and get enough sleep.
- Do not starve.
- Eating leftovers of baby food is not a great idea.
- Exercise can help overcome post-partum blues, so enjoy the process.
- Don’t give in to peer pressure to get back in shape. For some, the process takes only a few months while for others it might take a year or two. Be consistent with workouts.

Yoga and smoothies "," Quaint little vegetarian cafes, often attached to yoga studios, are coming up all over the country. They offer a contemporary vibe, greenery, and nutritious food that call for mindful eating. We explore a few. 
Yogi-sthaan, Bengaluru
Plot 89, 11th Cross Road, Indiranagar, Stage 1
Yoga studio, B&B, café, retreat. When Ajitsingh Tapasvi conceived Yogi-sthaan, all he wanted was a fluid space where one could ‘just be’. “I wanted this space to be like home — you can treat it as your office or as a café; you can do yoga or read; you can even stay over,” he explains. “We ask no questions and force nothing upon you. When a guest walks in, he gets a copper water bottle with two kansa glasses. After that, we do not disturb him.” Open, green, unobtrusive, and relaxed, Yogi-sthaan’s food is vegetarian, uses macrobiotic practices, ancient grains and traditional methods of cooking. Try their hash browns that come with mozzarella, red and yellow pepper, spinach and herbs served with yoghurt dressing. Or simply ask for tea with toast and liquid jaggery. 
Mystic Yoga Café, Kolkata
20A, Camac Street, 2nd Floor
The yoga practitioners coming to Mystic Yoga centres asked what they could eat after an invigorating session of yoga; some just wanted to spend more time in the peaceful environment of the studio. It’s what led Abhishek Maheshwari to start the cafés (four, across the city). They serve small meals, snacks, and an all-day breakfast. “Our meals are cooked using the principals of Ayurveda and are based on four pillars: healthy, tasty, satisfying and affordable,” says Maheshwari. If the no-fuss décor, fresh menu, and wide range of spiritual books doesn’t bring you back, the spinach and chickpea soup, or the vegan omelette might. 
Yogi’s Belly, Hyderabad
IshaLife, Plot No 522, Road 27, Jubilee Hills
White wrought-iron chairs set under a large mango tree, bare white walls and a chequered tile-grass floor beneath, Yogi’s Belly is the zen you need in the middle of the busy Jubilee Hills. An extension of the Yoga Studio, crafts store, and Mahamudra, a fine-dining restaurant, at IshaLife Foundation, the place marries the traditional with the modern. Try the ice tea with turmeric and sabja seeds, drumstick soup, ragi mudde, and rice waffles. 
Artjuna, Goa
No 972, Monteiro Vaddo, Anjuna Bardez
Attached to an Iyengar-style yogashala that also has a quaint boutique, on the Anjuna beach, the Artjuna Goa was set up in an old Portuguese house, and has both indoor and outdoor seating. Moshè Imbar, who owns the place, tells us, “Our café primarily serves Mediterranean cuisine.” A lively space, and one of the few yoga cafés that has a small section of non-vegetarian fare, Artjuna serves an all-day breakfast and small eats. Its USP is the freshness of the ingredients, home-made cakes and coffee, and a vegan menu. 
The Yoga House, Mumbai
Nargis Villa, Water Bungalow, Sherly Rajan Road, Bandra West
A bright space in the heart of suburban Mumbai, The Yoga House Café takes you away from the noise and traffic of the city, even if for a little while. Sheer curtains, white furniture and sea-green walls make the place a haven. Attached to the Yoga House, the food here is based on macrobiotic recipes rooted in ancient dietary wisdom and traditions, and the menu centres around whole grains and local, seasonal produce. Try the 10-grain toast, home-made muesli, fresh juices and smoothies and the signature hash brown at this plastic-free hangout.
Yogi’s Belly Café, Chennai
New Number 117, Old Number 50, Luz Church Road, Mylapore
The Yogi’s Belly Café brings together the best of Indian culture: yoga, traditional cuisine and artisanal craftsmanship. Located within the IshaLife premises, it blends traditional with contemporary. “The menu here has been curated with a unique approach to health and fitness that stems from a deep understanding of the yogic sciences,” says Meena Thennaapan, who manages the centre. Café offerings like raw turmeric juice, papaya and red capsicum salad, and black sesame kulfi blend the regular and the exotic. With large rattan chairs, comfy couches and sheer curtains, the café is a modern take on an ancient science.

On a snail trail "," Is it a fish? Is it a shell? It’s a snail! On one of our usual trips to the Nochi Kuppam fish market one evening, we spot something unusual. Snails, in gleaming black and brown shells, float languidly inside a box filled with water. When we stop for a closer look, J David, the seller, runs up to us.
“Take the whole lot for ₹200,” he says. “I collected these at the Narayanapuram eri near Pallikaranai,” he adds. “I went in at noon today. I don’t go into deep waters. I simply walk with a bag secured at my hip and pick the snails from under the water plants.” The 65-year-old heads to the marshland every time there’s a spell of rains. “That’s when the snails come out; there will be plenty of water in the ponds and the snails will have a lot to eat.”




David has been collecting snails from the time he was a little boy. “Back then, I would go jump into Retteri with my friends to look for them. We sold them for our spending money,” he says. 
A resident of Villivakkam, David works as a daily-wager for a living and turns a snail collector on rainy days. He pulls out a bunch of visiting cards from his shirt pocket to show us. “These belong to my customers. I give them a call every time I get snails.” He has quite a large customer-base. 
According to David, snails are a delicacy. “It’s good, especially for women,” he says. P Sasikala, who has offered him space to sell the snails at her fish stall, says that the snails should be boiled like eggs in water, or can be steamed like idlis. “The flesh can then be slid out of the shell using a spoon. It can be cooked like prawn thokku — sauté onions and plenty of tomatoes, add the flesh and sprinkle chilli powder, coriander powder, turmeric and salt and cook for a few minutes.”

‘London Bubble Co’ makes its entrance in Chennai
"," Subtle shades of pink and white in a striped fashion, reminiscent of English-styled creameries — or more appropriately, toy stores — greet one at the Mumbai-based London Bubble Co’s maiden Chennai branch outlet. ‘Next Level, Desserts!’, says the board, in an evident effort to channel a local flavour to an otherwise predominantly North Indian venture.
The cute little joint was filled with teenagers eager to see how different this new ‘waffle place’ would be. Cut to the corner table, where a surprised bunch of friends — young enough to be in school — debate why the waffles look as though they are inflated. It’s because they’re bubble waffles. 
“I feel that Chennai doesn’t have the kind of varieties that are usually seen in Pune or Mumbai. I hear this from my friends here all the time. That’s why I decided to open my flagship branch in Chennai,” says Veeral Bafna, one of the proprietors/owners and the in-charge of the Tamil Nadu franchise. 




Bafna also adds that the location was chosen because of its proximity to schools. Inside , contrasting colours and random quotes drenched in sexual innuendos scream at you (it’s difficult not to notice), while a panel of white light bubbles overhead offer a thematic touch. For no discernible reason, the quotes chosen are attributed to personalities like Isaac Newton for instance. This waters the theme down quite a bit, even as the proprietors inform us that the contrasting colours were meant to invoke the feel of ‘old-school’ London restaurants, while keeping the interiors youth-centric.
Bafna’s debut venture boasts of an exciting menu, all laden with sugar bubbles — Bubble waffle wraps, waffwiches, iced bubble chais, pocket waffles, bubble milkshakes, to name a few. The Peach Bubble Ice Tea, among other, have a generous amount of thin-lined sugar bubbles in them, which immediately pop in your mouth to leave a hint of sweetness. In some drinks, these bubbles are filled with fruit syrup to enhance the flavour — a noticeable twist to an otherwise light drink.
One of their best-sellers, the Black Jack, is a filling brownie-flavoured waffle, served in half or full portions, along with charcoal ice cream, and topped with colourful sprinkles, chocolate shavings and chocolate sticks. It’s filling enough to make you skip a meal, with mushy insides that blend effortlessly with the gooey ice cream accompanying it: a messy affair indeed! This rich mix of flavours, accompanied by the sheer size of it, is overwhelming. While Black Jack is one of the best-sellers of the brand, Roche Rust and Nutella Pockets compete for second spot: moist and rendered even more irresistible when paired with a scoop of Nutella. 
These vegetarian waffles are accompanied by gelato ice creams, which, owners claim, are specially prepared for the brand.
London Bubble Company is located at 46, Barnaby Road, Kilpauk.

Palette of plant healers
","Plants such as tulsi or hibiscus have been part of Indian gardens, even if the garden is relegated to a pot on the balcony, for centuries now. Just that over the decades, many other plants, which would have otherwise been staples have disappeared in urban homes and are gradually making a comeback.
Most such plants have potent medicinal value – doddapatre (Indian Borage/ ajwain leaf), adusoge (Adathoda vasica/Vasa/Malabar nut) or mehendi (henna/Lawsonia inermis), for example, which our grandmothers had efficiently worked into their families’ lifestyles. Some of these plants, including Aloe Vera, Bhoomi amla, Brahmi, Bhringaraja, Basale soppu, Hibiscus, Shatavari, Shankapushpi, Tulsi and Baje can be grown in pots at home while others such as Pomegranate, Moringa or the Ashoka mara need more space, as they grow into trees. Plants such as Bilva, for instance, are not easy to grow at home and can be procured in shops that sell native medicine or produce.
On the occasion of World Environment Day, The Green Path and Om Sri Sairam Deeksha Training Centre organised a workshop on the ‘role of medicinal plants in primary healthcare – home remedies’ at The Green Path Organic State premises in Malleswaram.
The workshop was conducted by Dr MJ Prabhu, an Ayurvedic doctor and medicinal plants consultant with the Karnataka State Medicinal Plants Authority as well as Dr Pushpa, Asian facilitator, FAO (on Traditional Herbal Food in Healing Systems). Guests at the event were Ashish Kumar Ballal, Former India hockey captain, Olympian and Arjuna awardee; EP Nivedita, Principal Accountant General (A & E), Karnataka; and Dr Latha TS, PRO, KSRTC and Chairperson, Public Relation Council of India, Bangalore.
“It is possible to handle certain recurring or bothersome medical conditions through medicinal plants, if one knows to use them,” said Dr Prabhu beginning his session. “There are remedies for a range of conditions from acidity to indigestion, gastro-intestinal issues, diabetes, jaundice, UTI, menstrual problems, or joint pains, in medicinal plants.” 
Medicinal plants and their benefits according to Dr Prabhu
Amritaballi /Giloy /Tinospora cordifolia: While the leaves of this herbaceous vine are nutritious, the potency in this plant lies in its stem. The stem is ready to be used when mature and flaky. The mature stem can be cut into pieces and used to make a reduced concoction with water. It is useful in handling acidity and gastro-intestinal issues as well as skin diseases. It can be consumed with buttermilk in order to heal the early stages of piles. It is also a haemostatic and can be used to control excess bleeding during menstrual cycles. Its value is enhanced when combined with dry ginger powder, black pepper powder or long pepper. 
Adusoge/Vasa /Adathoda vasica /Malabar nut:
 The leaves of this plant are known to cure asthma. Powdered Adusoge leaves can be combined with dry ginger powder, haritaki powder, and honey for the same. Green tea, made from dry Adusoge leaves help heal thyroid as well as tonsillitis and related conditions. They can be used to make home-made cough syrups. An extract of steamed Adusoge leaves can be combined with sugar candy, for dry cough and honey, black pepper and ginger, for wet cough. 
Madhunashini/Gurmar/Gymnema Sylvestre: 
This climber is known to be a potent medicine for diabetes. The leaves of this plant (five to seven leaves) can be chewed and swallowed with a glass of water. Powdered leaves of Madhunashini can be mixed with warm water and consumed an hour before food to battle constipation. They help combat malnutrition and are known to improve intestinal absorption and handle indigestion.
Ashwagandha/Withania somnifera:
 The roots of the Ashwagandha are known to have several benefits. A paste made from Ashwagandha leaves can be consumed with honey to aid weight-loss. The roots of the plant are known to have anti-aging properties and are known to induce sleep. Three to five grams of powdered Ashwagandha root combined with milk, when consumed at bedtime, can be beneficial for joint pains. 
Alale Kayi/Haritaki/Terminalia chebula: 
This plant, unlike the other plants mentioned above, is not meant to be a potted plant and can’t be typically grown in a home garden. However, the product is available in most native or indigenous medicine stores. It is one of the three constituents of Triphala. It is known to help heal gangrene as well as scars, when combined with ghee and honey. It is known to ease bowel movement while also arresting conditions such as IBS and amoebiasis. It is known to arrest bleeding gums when used as a tooth powder in combination with salt and clove powder. Gargling a concoction of Haritaki can heal tonsillitis and mouth ulcers.
For details on medicinal plant procurement or usage, call the Karnataka State Medicinal Plants Authority, 4th Floor, Vanavikas Building, Malleswaram at 23464089.

A spoonful of goodness
","I have a strong belief that whatever we eat reflects on how we look and react to situations. As the one-liner goes, “We are what we eat”.
Somewhat believing in my philosophy and attempting to execute it is a young entrepreneur Prasoon Gupta who after passing from one of India’s most reputed colleges, IIT Roorkee, thought of feeding people food which is healthy and light on the stomach. After a lot of R&D, he came up with an idea to start a restaurant in the M block market of New Delhi’s Greater Kailash Part II by the name of Sattviko which is based on sattvik food.
Though a vegetarian restaurant hardly attracts me, Sattviko has a menu which is selective but offers dishes from across the globe. It is slightly biased towards the Mexican flavours, though. I quite liked the vibrant feel of the 35-seater restaurant and left it to Chef Rishi to decide my course of the meal. He began by serving me a small bowl of sabudana poha and fruit oatmeal. Having a mix of tastes like sweet, sour and spicy, the poha was light and tasty and could be a perfect dish to have in between meals to kill the cravings. The oatmeal having crunchy muesli complimenting the nuts and raisins was so refreshing that a spoonful after a hectic day could bring back the lost energy within minutes. Though the fchilled melon salad that followed it was not chilled to perfection and even lacked the zing and tanginess of a salad.
Trying the Mexican imports was fruitful as the quesadillas and even the burritos were tasty. Kudos to the chef who was able to keep the flavours and taste intact, even though it was a sattvik preparation. Another two dishes which were bang on were the quad burger and vada croissant. I loved the aroma and freshness of the focaccia used to hold the stuffing. Mumbai’s vada married to French croissant turned out to be good. Vada laid on the special dried chilli powder mix gave life to the preparation.
The dishes which were a disappointment were the pindi cholas and paneer curry. The chola was too dry and slightly under cooked while the curry had an unappealing texture and suppressed flavours.
Nitisha Jain, the Experience Head at Sattviko who educates customers about the Sattvik lifestyle, helped me by suggesting to end the meal with sabudana kheer and shrikhand. Both were yummy and delicious though a tad more of cardamom powder would have given the shrikhand a nice flavour.

Sattviko is at M 72, M block market, Greater Kailash Part II

On the Dessert Trail: Around the World in 80 Desserts
"," What happens when a chef, restaurateur, and cookbook author has a sweet tooth? “I set out On the Dessert Trail: Around the World in 80 Desserts,” laughs Monish Gujral, the custodian of the Moti Mahal brand. On the Dessert Trail: Around the World in 80 Desserts also happens to be the title of Gujral’s fourth book, which recently won the Best Pastry and Desserts Book Award at the 2017 Gourmand World Cookbook Awards, an awards collective created by Édouard Cointreau.
Growing up surrounded by good food, Gujral was an integral part of many food stories and discussions by default. “This developed my interest in food beyond eating. I was interested in knowing all the aspects of food, which got me actively involved in the business and industry. I had a sweet tooth naturally, so my weakness led me to quiz chefs about desserts I ate and relished during my travels.”




Gujral is the managing director of Moti Mahal Deluxe Management Services, and is credited for the trail-blazing turn-around of Moti Mahal — a transformation from a humble joint to an iconic restaurant, and eventually into a mammoth franchise business. “As I multiplied my business and opened outlets and also signed franchise partners, I had more and more access to international chefs, their recipes and ingredients. My love for desserts started taking a wave, and even before I realised, I had tried about 80 to 85 desserts in my own kitchen,” recollects Gujral.
As a traveller, chef and cookbook author, Gujral wanted to draw the attention of people to classic desserts and the stories behind them. His research threw light on the fact that while there were many recipe books on desserts, there wasn’t anything that listed many classics in one, woven into a story. Gujral is proud that his book has recipes from places like Algeria, Brazil, Poland and Lebanon, apart from the usual sweet suspects.
“Did you know that there was a cold war between France and Britain on the invention of the crème brûlée?” asks Gujral, who’s curated close to 80 international dessert recipes. “Or that the torte, a dessert from Austria, was also the subject of a long trademark battle between creator Eduard Sacher and the Demel bakery, where he worked? Me neither. All these nuggets of information form a part of the recipes I chose. I spent close to two years talking to chefs to learn beyond what was easily available. These anecdotes accompany the recipes of the desserts. I wanted everyone who reads the book to read beyond ingredients, method and bake- or no-bake desserts.”

Slim pickings
"," At first glance it appears we have walked into a film set, of the kinds associated with over-the-top dramas featuring rich businessmen and heavily bedecked women. One sweep across the long narrow space that is Plum by Bent Chair throws up purple walls, green creepers (all fake) hanging from the ceiling and snaking out of massive vases, glass shelves with typewriters masquerading as teapots, horses leaping out of columns, and stuffy high-backed chairs. There’s even a table formed in the shape of a man bent over. It’s big and colourful and quirky and the only relief comes from looking out onto Lower Parel’s concrete skyline. 
There’s nothing quiet about this new restaurant: it’s meant to capture your attention and keep it. It is understandable in a way because Plum is competing with its own sister establishments, Lord of the Drinks and Rocky Star (they all opened around the same time). The three restaurants share an owner — First Fiddle Restaurants, and a space — demarcated from each other by floor to ceiling windows. Plum is a collaboration with Bent Chair, a home décor brand by Natasha Jain, and it doubles up as a retail space — you can shop while you eat. Everything is on sale, from crockery and wall art to the furniture.
Missing zing
 Leafing through a menu that doubles up as a brochure helps us bide the time as we wait for our orders. On that day, service is slow and turns our lunch turns into long lazy brunch. We put it down to opening week blues. Our cocktails, when they do arrive, are a hit and miss. Our Plum Berry Sour (₹575) has elements of a sour but is an otherwise confused drink with too many elements that don’t work well together — why add in blackberry liqueur and cookie dough? Plum and Passion (₹500) fares better with rum and vodka muddled with passionfruit juice and lemon. There’s an aftertaste of wasabi to cut through the sweetness. The Pumpkin and Cinnamon Fruit Bellini (₹500) lacks the flavours of its two main ingredients and turns out to be a bitter, fizzy drink. 
Plum’s interiors are dressed to the nines but the food is not. Chef Sagar Bajaj defines the offering as pan Asian but it is largely Chinese. We don’t have a problem with Indian Chinese food, it’s comforting at its best and familiar at its worst. Bajaj’s food falls somewhere in between — there were a few standout dishes but overall, we just expected more. 
Mixed fare
 Our plates have animals on them, monkeys and zebras, dressed in glares. These are soon covered with Edamame and Truffle Dumplings (₹425), with translucent skins packed with cream cheese, carrot and corn and earthy truffle. It is a bit dry and our demand for dips brings a plate of six spicy sauces to the table — all of which drown out the delicate flavours of the dumpling. The Prawn Tempura Uramaki (₹690) is adequate, crispy prawn helped by lashings of mayonnaise and teriyaki glaze. Fermented Garlic Oil Chicken (₹495) is a light curry that’s heavy on the garlic. Mongolian Chicken Claypot (₹555) is sweeter and has a fair amount of peanuts. The accompanying rice, Truffle Shimitzu Fried Rice (₹425) marries the umami of mushroom with the earthiness of the truffle. It’s a dish worthy of second helpings. 
For dessert, we order the much publicised Plum Tropical Fruit Citrus Cheesecake (₹590). The ingredients are in the name and the cheesecake is served in scoops, like an ice cream but lighter and creamier. It comes on a bed of sliced fruit, which though refreshing would have taste better served cold instead of warm. It’s a dish that is symbolic of the dining experience at Plum by Bent Chair: a good idea that just needs some polishing.

No crossover in the kitchen
","“I rather not eat the food I was not expecting.” Gurinder Chadha comes across as a different kettle of fish across the table. Going through the menu at Elan in The Lodhi hotel, she wants to distinguish between Rajasthani and Punjabi karhi and asks existential questions about ulta tawa parantha. “Why do you need to turn the griddle upside down,” she asks. Sometimes, she uses her husband as a taster before proceeding with a dish but here she is eager to play the role for me. “Can I order for you? I like the menu here for there are elaborate descriptions,” says Gurinder as she picks palak ki chaat and bhalle ki chaat to set the spicy tone for the evening. “I love the yoghurt stuff that you get here. We don’t get it in England. Many times I have tried to make chhach at home but I just don’t get the same flavour,” laments the British Indian filmmaker.
Adept at cooking, Gurinder — who was in India recently for the recce of her next project on Partition — is fond of an array of cuisines and has a number of experiences to narrate. “When I was in school, during cookery classes we used to make traditional English dishes. One of my favourites was Lancashire hotpot. It is from the North and is basically lamb fried with onion and you have it like a stew. When I brought it home I was very proud to show it to my mom. My dad had one look at it and then he made my mom re-cook it as lamb curry! In fact whatever I would make, they would ‘Indianise’ it with masala masoola and tadka laga as my dad would say. And I would cry: you guys are ignorant! Once I made chicken casserole and as usual they described it as bilkul pheeka (absolutely bland). Again my mom turned it into chicken curry, and he said, ‘She brought casserole and we turned it into casserolla’.”
Things have changed now as new generation British Indians can flaunt their spicy food openly. “Oh! Yes. I think what is interesting is when my parents first came to England whenever my mother would cook people, going past would make all sorts of faces, calling the smell awful. And 20 years later when the tables turned, people would come and ask what the recipe was. ‘Give me the recipe. That thing smells so good.’ Today curry is the number one food. You can find an Indian restaurant on every prominent lane. Indian food has become an important part of British cuisine.”
She cites how deep the relationship has become. “Halloween is a big thing in the part where we live. And making Halloween cupcakes with scary faces on them is the norm. But last year, we had a party and instead of making cupcakes, we made jalebis and put scary faces in the middle of each of them. They looked like a spider’s web.” Does she see a movie in these anecdotes? “May be…possibly,” she says after a pause.
From Thai to Jamaican, she tries her hand at a variety of delicacies. “My favourite recipe is aloo wadiya which goes well with a watery contraption of ginger and garlic. In England when the weather is cold and you have sore throat, this is the best thing. I also like kadhi chawal.” Then in Jamaican food she cooks chicken stew by using one of the hottest chillies in the world, the scotch bonnet. With her husband and long time collaborator (Paul Mayeda Berges) being of Japanese origin, wasabi is also an important ingredient in Gurinder’s kitchen. “I have different kinds of chillies for different cuisines. We try to keep it as pure as possible. No crossovers here!” she laughs. However, she adds, “There is not enough space to store all the ingredients in the British kitchen. The British cut it, grill it and boil it. They don’t need too many ingredients, but our case is different and my cupboards keep groaning.”
Gurinder feels a fondness for spicy stuff doesn’t mean that she has lost interest in the simplicity of British cuisine. After a round of spicy food when I crave for something plain, I bake potatoes in the oven and then we have it with cheese and tuna fish. That’s comfort food.” Right now ulta tawa parantha is here and Gurinder is glad that “we are breaking our roti in a smart restaurant!”

Quinoa upma on-board to Zurich
","While the Indian media contingent dug into the pan-seared seabass and roast lamb leg, Wolfgang Will slowly ate his khandvi and beetroot tikki. As a vegetarian, Will is happy to be in India, because people here get vegetarianism: “With it divergent spices and ingredients, India offers such a vast culinary variety, that I find myself in heaven here!” We’re at the launch of Swiss International Air Lines’ new in-flight menu that caters to their Mumbai-Zurich, Delhi-Zurich sectors, and he’s leading the programme, as Senior Director, South Asia Lufthansa Group.




Taste matters
Since Indians now form about half their customers, the airline felt the need to relook at the menu to make it better palatable to local tastes. Some market research later, the company realised a few things: that Indians preferred a local breakfast – most picked dosa; that they loved locally-sourced ingredients when it came to desi dishes; and that fusion wasn’t seen as fancy. What surprised them (and us): that many Westerners living in India also preferred local food.
So they went ahead and made sure they sourced the best ingredients locally, added Indian favourites and introduced a few tweaks to cater to health-seekers, while offering Western staples. First-class passengers get a range, from Roast Lamb Leg Forestier, Pan Seared Seabass and Matar Badam Ki Tikiki with Olive Kofta (with the accompaniments) for mains. Business-class travellers can enjoy khandvi on a bed of fruit salsa on a banana leaf as a starter (you’ll get Parma ham too), and beetroot halwa for dessert (along with several others). Economy gets Mysore Masala Dosa and Carrot Green Peas Upma. There’s alsoquinoa kheer, quinoa upma, and beetroot tikki (only for business of course), all catered by the Oberoi Flight Services.
Will’s favourites? They’re not on the menu: the south Indian thali and lassi.

Going all out for fitness
","Keeping the body fit is a passion for some people, and they are willing to go to any extent to achieve their objective.
A few fitness groups in the city have adopted quirky exercise models of their own to keep their enthusiastic members fighting fit.
While gymnastic master A.R. Eashwar’s group troops to the Thiruvanmiyur beach on Sundays to perform gravity-defying stunts, the Oval Crew led by Yohannan John undergoes a rigorous exercise regime during the week at Oval ground in Besant Nagar.
Mr. Eashwar, a martial arts expert in taekwondo, fencing and kung fu, and his group of students practise gymnastics featuring back flips, somersaults and upshot positions on the sands to keep fit, even while enthralling spectators.
Mr. Eashwar trains people from all walks of life, from IT professionals to autorickshaw drivers.
The Oval Crew believes doing arduous physical exercises makes a person fit and independent during his/her old age. Co-founded by fitness experts Yohannan John and Sudhir Rao, the group, mostly comprising IT professionals, takes its name from the ground where they do their exercises.
The group has come out with a fitness module for three groups — junior, intermediate and senior.
*****
Good food has always attracted these youngsters. Now, they share their culinary secrets with customers.
Collegemates Sailesh Mohan, Prem Ravi and Nitesh Nagarajan, who work as engineers in different firms in the city, also run Saintwitches, a sandwich-making service for parties.
“Rather than spend our spare-time watching movies and eating out in restaurants, we wanted to do something useful. We thought we could do something with our passion for food. So we zeroed in upon sandwiches. We came up with eight combinations that we serve at parties,” say the trio, who, until recently, had a stall near the Jai Nagar park in Koyambedu.
Due to some problem with another stall at the spot, all the bunk shops were removed. They are now scouting for other locations where they can sell sandwiches in the evenings during the weekends. “We are thinking of providing complete event management services for parties. Nithesh is a very good photographer,” said Sailesh, who, along with Nithesh, does thecooking. Most times, Prem does the shopping, accounting and other back-end jobs. The group now operates from Sailesh’s kitchen at Arumbakkam.

Feeling so fresh about Sofrehh
"," 

“Feroza, but with a darker blue,” is how Arash Naseeruddin describes the pretty blue of his Sofrehh food truck. You might miss it if you don’t look closely enough because this eatery that’s growing to be the latest talk of the town is in its own little alleyway — but it’s not as seedy as it sounds.
I had first spotted Sofrehh in late March when it had first opened, its first post near the new Conçu in Jubilee Hills. Then it wasn’t there anymore. I had shrugged my shoulders and had assumed it had either moved or gone bust — it was the the former. And boy, what a sweet set-up.




In the small alleyway space by Zasya, Arash and younger brother Abdul Moiz set up streaming lights above a sit-out area by the truck complete with canopy covers for the occasional rainy day. The warm light accentuates the blue of the truck, of the blue accents on the walls and the feroza-coloured cushions set upon the cane furniture for that travel-esque Mediterranean feeling. 
Not just ‘Instagrammable’
Arash and Abdul put their heads together a couple of years ago to bring life to an age-old dream: an eatery that succinctly envelopes the best of Persian sandwiches, inspired by their Iranian mother. Sofrehh is derived from the Persian word sofreh, the cloth spread on the ground upon which diners sit and have meals. It’s a name evocative of a homely and cosy feeling; the extra ‘h’ is to differentiate this establishment from an existing Persian eatery in New York. The logo, which may resemble an herb, is actually the Parsi symbol for the letter ‘s’. Plus, the minimalism of the van’s decor keeps it classy.
The brothers wanted something that wasn’t just pretty for social media, they wanted something that would leave an impression of Persian food we don’t know about, in the best way. And they’ve achieved that with their minimal menu. 




The kubideh sandwiches at Sofrehh are a rite of passage for meat-lovers. Laid with fresh tomatoes and vegetables with a small dash of mayonnaise, the tangy lamb patties really sing. The cutty murgh variety teems with flavour that doesn’t leave an unpleasant aftertaste... quite the opposite actually. 
For vegetarians, the veg falafel is an easy go-to, but the more adventurous lot should try out the penir olivieh, a cold sandwich as per the olivieh suffix filled with various vegetables and fresh cottage cheese. The meatier equivalent is the murgh olivieh, which has chicken potato and egg salad.
And the bread — oh, my! Arash and brother have carefully sourced a baker in Hyderabad after hunting for a very long time. A fresh batch of delightfully light and soft Mediterranean black olive loaves comes in everyday to match the freshness of their ingredients. According to the menu and the brothers, the bread is all-organic and preservative-free. 
To enhance your Sofrehh experience, Arash recommends coming at 10pm when the passing traffic is pretty much non-existent and all you can hear is the jazz music from the portable speaker they keep on hand and the buzzing conversation from other customers. 
While I’m yet to try the homemade marmalades and the Batsam coffees, I’m sure I’ll be back — with an emptier stomach.

A crispy frisbee of a dosa "," What the laddu is to Tirupati, the ‘Azhagarkoil dosa’ is to Madurai. The crsipy fried dosa that is the prasadam of the Perumal temple is something unique and not found elsewhere. And it's also not everyday that one can travel 20 kms across the city to eat the much acclaimed dosa.
But there's one place in town where dosas similar in taste, texture and flavour of the Azhagar temple prasadam are available. It comes from the antique house of 70-year-old T V Viswanathan. The address is 112, Kamarajar Salai, adjacent to the Sourashtra High School. On the wooden door outside hangs an obscure hand-written board saying 'Azhagarkoil dosas' and it has been the only advertisement for over 35 years now, ever since Viswanathan began dishing out his trademark dosas from a small corner of his house. Residents of the area know him and his speciality too well. 
“I worked at the temple kitchen as a storekeeper for two years in the 70's and learnt making dosas from the head cook. I used to watch him prepare the batter carefully and fry dosas on a panchaloha pan every day. The dosa is the evening neivedhyam and popular among devotees and tourists alike,” says Viswanathan. “Once I tried making the dosa at home and everyone in the family was delighted with the result. That's when I started it as a small business. Slowly, the name and fame of my dosas spread in the city and I developed a band of dedicated customers. The taste of the dosas I make speak of my skills as indicated by the growing number of customers over the years.”

The Azhagarkoil dosa is more like a large vadai, with a crispy coat and a soft core. Golden brown in colour, glistening with ghee/oil and the size of a frisbee, it requires no accompaniments like chutney or sambhar. A single dosa can be eaten by two or three people, as it's heavy and filling. “The key is the proportion of raw rice and urad dal in the batter. The samba variety of rice is only traditionally used and hence the dosas are also called 'Samba dosai'. We continue to hand-pound the rice in ural, to achieve the taste. Coarsely ground urad dal is added and mixed to the rice batter and left to ferment for a couple of hours. 
Tempered pepper, cumin, dry ginger, asofoetida and salt is added later. If the consistency is too watery, the dosas may not come out perfectly,” explains Viswanathan, as he pours a bowlful of batter into a pan of hot oil. Within minutes, the dosas spring up like big vadais and once the edges turn crispy brown, he flips the discs for another round of frying. Unlike regular dosas, the delicacy is not cooked on a tawa but in a flat-bottomed pan. “I have been using the same silver kinnam for measurement to get it right every single time. Each dosa weighs around 250 grams and I can make 16 dosas from 1.5 Kilograms of rice.”
“The dosas served in the temple are fried in pure ghee but I use a mix of oil and ghee to make it affordable at Rs.25. I also offer a smaller variant for Rs.15 and Rs.10 for parties and evening meetings,” says Viswanathan. 
“The dosas can stay fresh for a day if packed properly. I let them cool down before wrapping them in papers to be parcelled. Some of my customers carry the dosas to Chennai, Bangalore and other cities.” The place is open 10 am to 8 pm.

Indian Medical Association launches awareness drive on sexual health
"," The Indian Medical Association (IMA) has launched a nationwide movement to eradicate the social taboo associated with sexual health.
Dr. Ravi Wankhedkar, the IMA national president, stressed the importance of the initiative and said that sex still being a taboo, doctors across India needed to break all the barriers and clinical inertias.
This is the first-of-its-kind initiative launched by the IMA for over three-and-a-half lakh doctors to motivate them to dispel the taboo associated with this subject.
Education must be imparted at school to dispel the taboo associated with this subject. Increasing awareness among schools and colleges by various means will also be a part of this agenda.
The plan of action of this initiative is to hold pan-India educational programmes and also adopt schools and colleges to educate one and all -- students, teachers and parents -- by holding lectures, seminars, symposia, conferences and dialogues.
Plans are also afoot to hold fellowship course and national conferences. 
“IMA also proposed a plan of action to increase the awareness amongst the medical fraternity to change their mindset and attitude towards the taboo subject of sexual health, Dr Wankhedkar said.
As a pilot project, a 12-month fellowship programme in clinical sexology has also been started for doctors who are MD and above and proposes to start similar courses for MBBS doctors with at least five years of experience.

Teenager with palsy walks at graduation
","An Ohio teenager, who has cerebral palsy and was never expected to be able to walk, shocked her family and friends by doing just that at her high school graduation. 
Lexi Wright, 19, left her wheelchair and used a walker to cross a stage in her cap and gown to accept her diploma at the Ravenna High School ceremony last week, according to Record-Courier, a newspaper based in Kent. 
Principal Beth Coleman said Ms. Wright had been practicing all year. 
The teen said she simply wanted to surprise her family and was stunned by the crowd’s reaction. She said she plans to keep working on walking.

Omelette for days
","While scouting places for a quick bite during office lunch break, I stumbled upon The Egg Stop and Mexican Chicken Poppers in Seethammadhara. It’s one of the few places in this residential area with spacious indoors and air conditioning. I entered with just an expectation of a decent meal in the AC, but by the time I had walked out of the restaurant I had already recommended the omelette café to friends in the city. The Egg Stop and Mexican Chicken Poppers have different menus but they share the roof and kitchen. The Egg Stop, a Kerala-based franchise has branches in India, UAE, Malaysia and Dubai.The Mexican Chicken Poppers, an exclusive to the Indian market, is an add-on to The Egg Stop. 
Like most fast food restaurants, orders are taken at the counter. But unlike them, here one has to wait for at least 15 minutes and sometimes even half and hour, depending on what you have ordered. Nevertheless, it’s worth the wait. The Egg Stop offers 150 different varieties of omelettes. In the Visakhapatnam franchise, it has about 15 different omelettes in the menu, which keep changing depending on the response of the customers. All omelettes are made of three to four eggs and served with a huge slice of bread. I tried the Indo–Mexican omelette, three sunny side up omelettes placed over an omelet with Mexican sauce base, followed by a fluffy Jamaican cheesy omelette. This omelette was made after beating egg whites with milk and placing stripes of cheese slices on top. They also have meat-based omelettes like the shredded chicken omelette and kebab omelette. The health-conscious folks will enjoy the distinct taste of fresh chicken in former over the frozen meat in the latter.
After four omelettes, I was thirsty. So I ordered an egg soda, one of the trademark egg-based drinks. It was basically a mint mojito blended with egg white. The egg white’s taste doesn’t stand out, so go for the egg soda without any second thoughts, unless you don’t want extra proteins. The Egg Stop has rice meals as well. I had the Japanese omurice, which is tomato rice wrapped inside an omelette crepe. I found it to be a perfect meal for lunch. All rice-based dishes have ample quantity. And their presentation will make you share an update on social media. Chikkam Sandeep, manager, The Egg Stop, said, “We had to increase the rice quantity as per the customers’ expectation. Luckily, we can tweak the menu as per the feedback.” Mexican Chicken Poppers’s menu isn’t innovative but gets points for not using frozen meat (except for nuggets, fish and seekh kabab). I tried the chicken stick, chipotle chicken salad and chipotle dynamite chicken. And if there was a competition, the eggs definitely came first. Currently, the menu has seasonal mango pulp drink, made by blending fresh mango with little milk and no sugar. It’s the closest thing to aam raas in the city. You can also find French toast and egg salads on the menu. The chocolate French toast is a must-have, but don’t expect chocolate to ooze like in choco-lava cake.

Mother Mirra’s Coffee’s 100-year legacy "," “I promise, you will keep coming back for more,” declares Sundar Subramaniam with a confident smile. The executive director of Mother Mirra Group of Companies offers me a fragrant brew, made with coffee powder from Mirra’s Idhu Namma Veetu Kaapi brand. The group recently launched three variants of filter coffee. It’s limited to retail in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry for now, but Sundar is bursting with plans.
“We are marketing Mirra’s Coffee with the line ‘I want you to buy my coffee once’... we plan to give away free brass coffee davara sets with every packet soon. And, there will soon be wet sampling at malls and stores.”
Mother Mirra’s Coffee has a 100-year-old legacy. It comes from the house of the first Asian planter, PPR Subramaniam (Sundar’s great-grandfather) and his Virakesari Plantations. PPR was an entrepreneur and journalist from Avanipatti village, in the Sivagangai district of Tamil Nadu. He also started Virakesari, the first Tamil newspaper in Sri Lanka in the 1930s, to give a voice to the rights of plantation workers.
“Back home, our community was often associated with the money-lending business. My great-grandfather set a new path. He moved to Sri Lanka at a time when plantations were still owned only by the British and the Scottish,” Sundar says with pride.
Later, PPR moved to Malaysia, where he bought more plantations. “My grandfather Sundarakesari continued the tradition and owned plantations in Coorg. My father S Subramanian followed suit,” says Sundar, now settled in Coimbatore.
Today, their plantation AA — or Premium Arabica — variety of beans is exported to countries within Asia and beyond. They also have a line-up of Arabica and Robusta with varying ratios of chicory content in them.
“Our wholesale market is thriving. We also sell online on Amazon, Flipkart, Paytm, and Big Basket, something I introduced after I took over in the last six months. My focus is on digital marketing. We are getting a good response from our active social media pages too.” The group has also branched into budget homes and service apartments.
“I did my masters in business marketing at Cornell University in New Zealand. I wanted to work abroad, but my father had other plans. He met me at Singapore and handed me my return ticket to Coimbatore,” laughs Sundar.
What followed was the launch of the retail brand. They added more German machineries to the factory at Coorg and introduced three new products — pure coffee (100% premium Arabica), premium filter coffee (with 15% chicory) and Gold (with 47% chicory). A network of 350 dealers ensures that the filter coffee reaches stores in Coimbatore, Madurai, Chennai and Puducherry. “In a couple of months, we want to start exporting to Singapore and New Zealand.” They also plan to enter the Sri Lankan market, from where it all began. A particular street in Colombo, from where Virakesari was born, still goes by the name Chettiar Street, to honour his great-grandfather.
Among new products, a green coffee is in the offing. Sundar also plans coffee counters at airports: where one can sow coffee, roast, grind and brew a perfect davara.

Immunotherapy cures late-stage breast cancer
","A woman with an aggressive form of breast cancer which defied chemotherapy and spread to other organs, was cured with an experimental treatment that triggered her immune system, researchers said on Monday.
The woman has been cancer-free for two years, reported the U.S.-based team, presenting their results as “a new immunotherapy approach” for the treatment of patients with a late-stage form of the disease.
 Other experts not involved in the work hailed it as “exciting”. 
So-called “immunotherapy” has already been shown to work in some people with cancer of the lung, cervix, blood cells (leukaemia), skin (melanoma) and bladder. But an immune breakthrough for bowel, breast and ovary cancer has remained elusive.
 The woman was 49 when she signed up for the clinical trial after several attempts at a cure through conventional treatments had failed, said the study published in Nature Medicine. 
The cancer had spread to various parts of her body, including the liver. A person’s immune system is designed to kill invaders, including rogue, cancerous cells. But it can fail, often because it cannot recognise cancer cells containing the patient’s own DNA.
Immunotherapy trains a patient’s own immune cells to recognise and fight cancer. For the new study, researchers took lymphocytes from a tumour in the woman’s body and scanned them for specific types which reacted to mutant, cancerous cells.
Tweaked in lab
These were reactivated or “switched on” in the lab and injected back, along with a so-called “immune checkpoint inhibitor” — another type of immunotherapy that has shown success in other types of cancer.
This resulted in a “highly personalised” anti-cancer therapy that yielded “complete tumour regression,” the researchers wrote.
In a comment also published by Nature Medicine, expert Laszlo Radvanyi from Canada’s Ontario Institute for Cancer Research said the woman’s response to the treatment was “unprecedented” for such advanced breast cancer. This work showed “we are now at the cusp of a major revolution,” he wrote.

Time to give local fish varieties a shot! "," Whether it is the Malayalis’ beloved karimeen, the Konkani love affair with pomfret, or the Bengali hilsa obsession, communities along the coast are avid consumers of fish. 
Traditional fish-eating homes usually cook a variety of fish, but you only find a handful of varieties in restaurants. In Mumbai, for instance, even the popular seafood haunts mostly carry the Famous Five: pomfret, rawas (rohu/rui), surmai (seer fish/king mackerel), bombil (estuarian lizard fish), and bangda (mackerel).




There are two reasons why some fish are popular. They are prized for their flavour, but more importantly, it is their bone structure that makes them a preferred choice. They invariably fillet easily, or when fried whole, the meat can be picked apart easily with hands. Larger fish, like seer fish, when cut against the backbone, give perfect steak-cut pieces for pan-frying with masala, or gently cooking in a curry.




The sad reality is that due to unseasonal and over fishing, the prices of popular fish in demand have skyrocketed, while equally delicious, cheaper varietals are sadly ignored. More importantly, fish stock populations have taken a devastating hit, as has the delicate ecosystem of our coasts. In Mumbai’s fish markets, we spotted several fish that were not only in-season, but also a surprising find. We found three varieties of tuna, including large quantities of the prized yellowfin in Sassoon Docks. Also easily spotted were Indian halibut, wolf herring, sea catfish, mahi-mahi, croaker, grouper, pink emperor, and sole, among others. Being home cooks, it seemed daunting to work with unfamiliar fish. But as long as fish is fresh — which, when sourced from local markets it invariably is — most varieties are forgiving to cook. Here are some suggestions:
Thin-spine sea catfish
East coast: Soldier catfish (June to February)
West coast: Thin-spine sea catfish (August to January). Don’t let the whiskers fool you; this flavour-packed fish is easy to work with. 
Fun fact: The most eaten (and unfortunately tasteless) fish in India today — basa — hails from farms in Vietnam’s Mekong delta and is a catfish. 




But our coasts are home to a variety of others, like the thin-spine sea catfish. It has a strong flavour, in the way salmon or surmai does, but it is its own beast. Filleting is interesting, as the blade needs to manoeuvre around the bulbous ribcage all the way to the rock-hard collarbone. Oily and firm, it works beautifully in braises and curries, grills, tandoors, or simply pan-seared. This distinctive fish forms a wonderful counterpoint in the mustardy Bengali preparation magur maacher jhol. The famous Vietnamese dish cà kho tô of catfish braised in fish sauce caramel is a grand way to highlight it. 
Curing it in gin lends a pleasant and aromatic balance that we think is an easy yet elevated take on this fish. 
Mandeli/Anchovies
Best to consume: September to February




There are plenty of Indian recipes for cooking schooling fish like anchovies and sardines, from pickles to fried fish, and even in curries. Fillets of anchovies develop an intense savouriness when dry-salted and stored in oil, making them a great ingredient to have in your pantry for a variety of preparations. Consider adding some to the mirepoix while making a bolognese. Whole fillets on buttered toast, with a squeeze of lime, makes for a delicious breakfast, or starter plate. The Italians crush some in their intense Puttanesca sauce. Oh, and no Caesar salad is complete without anchovies in the dressing. The best use of it, however, is to mash some with garlic in the celebrated Piedmontese dish bagna càuda, where the sweet, stewed garlic finds equilibrium with the umami-rich anchovies.
Mahi-Mahi
Best to consume: November to February
Also known as dolphin fish, these large surface-dwellers usually follow boats and jump in and out of the water, much like dolphins. They are fast growers and are not overfished on our coasts, making them a more sustainable choice. 
With a firm flesh and mild flavour, these fish can be customised in a variety of ways, like curries and fries. Filleted portions are perfect for the pan. Sear in oil, with skin on, and remove once fish is cooked and skin is crispy. Add some butter, Thai fish sauce and bird’s eye chillies to the hot pan to pick up all the bits. Once off the heat, whisk in some lime juice and pour the hot emulsion over crispy-skinned fillet.

In Sweden, beer was brewed since Iron Age
","Malt was produced for beer brewing as early as the Iron Age in Sweden, say scientists who have found possible evidence indicating a large-scale production of beer, possibly for feasting and trade in the region.
Archaeologists have found carbonised germinated grains in Uppakra in southern Sweden. “We found carbonised malt in an area with low-temperature ovens located in a separate part of the settlement. The findings are from the 400-600s, making them one of the earliest evidence of beer brewing in Sweden,” said Mikael Larsson, from Lund University in Sweden.
Archaeologists have long known that beer was an important product in ancient societies in many parts of the world. Through legal documents and images, it has been found, for example, that beer was produced in Mesopotamia as early as 4,000 BCE. However, as written sources in the Nordic region are absent prior to the Middle Ages , knowledge of earlier beer production is dependent on botanical evidence.

Herpes virus linked to Alzheimer’s
","Scientists have found evidence of a link between herpes infection and Alzheimer’s disease as well as the potential of antivirals in reducing the risk of the neurodegenerative disease.
In the study, when people who suffered with severe herpes infection were treated aggressively with antiviral drugs, the relative risk of dementia was reduced by a factor of 10.
Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) infects most humans in their youth or later and remains in the body for life in dormant form, within the peripheral nervous system. 
A study by Taiwanese epidemiologists shows that herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV1) leads to an increased risk of developing the disease, said researchers from the University of Manchester.
In a commentary, reported in the Journal of Alzheimer’s Disease on the three articles, the team argued that they provide the strongest evidence yet for a causal link between herpes infection and Alzheimer’s. 
“I believe we are the first to realise the implications of these striking data on this devastating condition which principally affects the elderly. No effective treatments are yet available,” said professor Ruth Itzhaki. 
“But we believe that these safe and easily available antivirals may have a strong part to play in combating the disease in these patients.

A crepe fit for the Louvre
","After much meandering, we finally find what we are looking for: Breizh Café, home to a unique Parisian delicacy: crepes.
These are not any roadside crepes. No, these are so much more. Known as ‘galettes,’ these buckwheat delicacies are made even more delectable by the toppings that adorn them. From rich chocolate ganache to buttery caramel, Breizh prides itself on housemade delights.
As my sister and I take our seats, we are directed to the menu projected on the wall; all in French, of course. With my six years of French and my sister’s semester of class, we can piece together the ingredients. She chooses a simply magnificent creation: caramel galette with Chantilly cream. The smoldering heat of the caramel combined with a slight hint of vanilla from the cream is simply irresistible.
One week later, we arrive at the same place. There’s no need for a menu, we know what we want. As my Paris voyage comes to a close, more than the Eiffel Tower and the Louvre, there is one place that I know I must visit during my next journey, for a trip to Paris cannot be complete without an appearance from the classic, Breizh Café.

Karkkidaka kanji on the menu
"," 
An Ayurveda medicine manufacturing unit is busy packaging its Karkkidakam special — Karkkidaka kanji kits. Soothing aroma of an oily mixture of herbs simmering in large bronze vessels fills the air in its sooty ‘kitchen’, where the medicines are prepared at Bhaskara Vilasam Vaidyasala. But an adjacent room in the ‘medicine factory’ in Panayamuttom, Nedumangad, turns a depository for parcelling up the ingredients already wrapped and sealed for the therapeutic porridge. Some of the factory staff carefully, but deftly, pick up little silver packets from steel trays and sort them to be finally put into the kits before they are sent to pharmacies.
“This is an annual ritual here when the Karkkidaka maasam kicks off,” says Pradeep Kumar, the factory manager. “All the ingredients that go into the Karkkidaka kanji are sourced and tested for quality in our laboratory.”
The murmur of rice being winnowed accompany our conversation. “Navara rice, which has many health benefits, is used for the breakfast kanji alongside roasted payar and oushadakkoottu (medicinal mix),” says Pradeep.




He says though the process of preparing the oushadakoottu takes about only two weeks, the work starts much earlier in the peak of summer when the various herbs are sourced. Bhaskara Vilasam sources most of the herbs from places such as Thenkasi and Theni in Tamil Nadu while the rest are bought locally. “Some herbs like Krishna Thulasi, Kurumthotti, Thottavadi or Navara leaf can be easily found in the region. They are normally grown in households or sometimes naturally thrive in the backyards,” points out Pradeep.




Rarer herbs are sourced with the help of distributors from within and outside the state. If they have to get something in bulk, they get in touch with the distributors. However, some common herbs are cultivated in a small farm near the factory itself. The raw herbs, shoots and roots are then culled, cleaned, cut and classified at the ‘unprocessed store’ before tested for quality. Those that pass muster reach the ‘finished store’ before they are crushed or powdered accordingly in a mechanised ‘pulverisation room’. 




“Some of the items that go into the oushadakoottu would require a different preparation method and would be processed separately,” says Pradeep as he leads us to the pulverisation room where judders funnel-mouthed machines. Nearby is a heap of drying Kudangal, or Pennywort, freshly sourced from suburbian bushlands, that will soon go as part of the next batch of oushadakoottu.




In essence
The oushadakoottu in powder form includes aashali, changalamparanda, njavara leaf, jeera, kudungal, erikku, thottavadi (touch-me-not), krishna thulasi, kurunthotti, karuvapatta (cinnamon), chittaratha, karimkurinji, devadaram, aavanakk, karinochi, fenugreek seeds, uzhinjam, thiapplli, bhrahmi, ramacham, mukkutty, poovamkurunthal, muyalcheviyan etc.

India still lags behind in routine immunization programme: WHO-UNICEF report
","In 2017, an estimated 19.9 million infants worldwide were not reached with routine services such as three doses of diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP vaccine). Around 60 per cent of these children live in 10 countries — Afghanistan, Angola, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, India, Indonesia, Iraq, Nigeria, Pakistan and South Africa.


This according to the most recent World Health Organisation and UNICEF immunization estimates released this week.
The report further noted that global vaccination coverage — the proportion of the world’s children who receive recommended vaccines — has remained the same over the past few years. It added that since 2015, the percentage of children who received their full course of three dose diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP3) routine immunizations is sustained at 85 per cent (116.2 million infants).
Although global immunization coverage with DTP3 remains at 85 per cent, it is important to highlight that an additional 4.6 million infants have been vaccinated globally in 2017 compared to 2010, due to global population growth.
The report highlighted that more concerted efforts needed to reach universal immunization coverage.
As per the figures released — an estimated 20 million additional children need to be vaccinated with DTP3; 45 million additional children need to be vaccinated with a second dose of measles vaccine and 76 million more children need to be vaccinated with 3 doses of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine.
“Of the 19.9 million infants who are not fully vaccinated with DTP3, almost 8 million (40 per cent) live in fragile or humanitarian settings, including countries affected by conflict. And about 5.6 million of them live in just three countries — Afghanistan, Nigeria and Pakistan — where access to routine immunization services is critical to achieving and sustaining polio eradication.
Meanwhile, newly available vaccines are being added as part of the life-saving vaccination package — such as those to protect against meningitis, malaria and even Ebola. Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most common viral infection of the reproductive tract, and can cause cervical cancer, other types of cancer, and genital warts in both men and women. In 2017, the HPV vaccine was introduced in 80 countries.
“On the other hand, vaccines to prevent against major killers of children such as rotavirus, a disease that causes severe childhood diarrhoea, and pneumonia have been around for over a decade. But the use of rotavirus and pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV) is lagging behind. In 2017, global coverage was only 28 per cent for rotavirus and 44 per cent for PCV. Vaccination against both these diseases has the potential to substantially reduce deaths of children under 5 years of age, a target of the Sustainable Development Goals,’’ noted the report.

Your fish’s journey from the trawler to the plate
"," S Govindhan is Kasimedu’s dhorai, meaning, big guy. Seated in front of a mammoth sawed-down tree trunk that functions as a cutting table, he rapidly slices tuna into neat fillets. 
The enclosure, a little beyond the wharf at Kasimedu fish market, houses the men who cut big fish. Smaller fish are cut by women who are seated with their aruvamanai in front of the Old Fish Market. 
Govindhan is a star here — he laughs, revealing all his teeth, and jokes with his colleagues as his gloved hands chop fish with surgeon-like precision. It is here that our journey begins.
Ahlauyu S V Naiud, who runs Idly Fish Curry, a take-away food startup that offers an idli and fish curry combo, is waiting to get her mammoth parai fish cut. She just bought it for ₹6,000 from K Arasu, who has a stall at Kasimedu fish market. “This one was caught using a thoondil (hook and line),” the 43-year-old tells us. 
He adds that a group of five fishermen left on a fibre boat at 8 pm the previous night. Our parai arrived with them on the wharf at 4 am. It changed hands twice before it reached us. “I bought it on auction. M Aravalli was the auctioneer,” says Arasu. On a good day, fish sellers can get double or triple the price they pay the fishermen when they sell fish to customers. (Yet, it’s still probably significantly cheaper than what you pay for your cleaned, sliced and home-delivered seafood in the city. Or that grilled fish on your plate in a restaurant.)
Auctions are held by a bastion of bossy women. Tough and gruff-voiced, they call out the price of fish that marathukaaranga (meaning men of the catamaran) deliver to them. These are men who connect the boats and the wharf; they transport catch from the boats to the wharf on their catamarans.


At the cutting area, Govindhan, who’s been here from 6 am (and will stay here till 6 pm) slices the fish into two-inch-long cubes on Naiud’s request. From here, the parai travels to her house in Kottivakkam. 
“They’ll soon go into the curry that’s simmering on the stove,” she says, back at her house. In her kitchen — a wide-mouthed aluminium container is on the stove, and in it, a fragrant concoction of onions, tomatoes, tamarind, and a blend of nine spices, including red chillies, coriander seeds, black pepper, jeera and lentils, ground at a nearby mill.
“For 20 boxes of curry, I use 1.25 kilograms of fish,” she says. A music teacher who runs the 3Bs Western Music Academy in the city, Naiud started her food venture in January this year. She slides the fish slices into the curry. “The fish will be done in ten minutes,” she says. From Naiud’s kitchen, the curry is packed in plastic containers and transported to a kiosk at Spencer’s Daily Store in Thiruvanmiyur; she also sells on Swiggy. “90% of my stock is sold on the platform,” she says.
Meanwhile, some 13 kilometres away at Ente Keralam, a restaurant in Poes Garden, chef V T Jaya Prasad is plating a deep orange curry made with red snapper on a plantain leaf. “We call this Alleppey fish curry,” he says. He bought the fish at the Kasimedu fish market at 3 am. “We have a seller whom we regularly buy from,” he says. Prasad adds that he enjoys the ambience at Kasimedu. “People there are so warm,” he says.
For the curry, Prasad has used a base made of thick coconut milk. “I sautéed green chillies, onion, and curry leaves, added turmeric and chilli powder, before introducing the fish and coconut milk,” he says. It all ends here, on this plantain leaf.
It’s been quite a journey — from the sea, each fish has changed hands an average of five times, travelled hundreds of kilometres, been flopped on the wharf, sized up carefully, bought on auction, victoriously held aloft by the buyer. It’s been de-scaled and sliced, washed, frozen, thawed, bathed in spices, simmered... 
Finally it sits on your plate swathed in curry. A lot of work has gone into that fillet: Eat it with respect.

Woods turns back the clock
","It had been 2,226 days since Tiger Woods had led at the end of a round at a major, but for a short while at the British Open on Saturday it looked like he might do just that going into the final day.
The 42-year-old's much anticipated return to The Open after a two-year hiatus had been a bit of a damp squib on the first two days at Carnoustie.
However, in an event he has won three times, most recently in 2006, the old fire returned on the Scottish links to reward the packed gallery of spectators following him.
The 14-time major winner — plagued in the past eight years by personal issues and back problems — fired in six birdies in a round only marred by a bogey at the 16th as he seeks a first tournament win in five years.
A brilliant par on the ultra-demanding 18th — having benefited from a huge stroke of luck — briefly made him the clubhouse leader on five under par and he was smiling from ear to ear as he strode off the green.
He has not topped the leaderboard at the end of a round in a major since the second round of the US Open in 2012. 
Woods may have struggled to make par on the first but from then on some of his golf resembled that of him at his peak, back when he appeared to be on another level entirely compared to his rivals.
A monster birdie putt on the ninth had him punching the air in celebration and took him to three-under for the day and the tournament. 
Fired up by that, he played even better on the next hole as he turned for home.
His approach shot to the 10th green landed a foot from the cup and he duly tapped in for another birdie, flashing a contented smile.
A massive drive on the following hole almost took him to the green and he duly went on to birdie that as well to pile the pressure on overnight leaders Kevin Kisner and Zach Johnson.
Indian golfer Shubhankar Sharma carded a second successive even-par 71 even as he failed to break into the top-50 spot.
The 22-year-old, who was tied 52nd after the first two rounds, took his three-day total to two-over par. He was tied 56th with many players still yet to complete their round.

Peter Sagan sprints to victory
","Slovakian Peter Sagan underlined his sprint credentials for the third time on the Tour de France Friday after powering to victory in the 13th stage from Bourg d’Oisans to Valence.
Sagan, of the Bora team, is one of the few real sprint specialists still in the race after surviving an Alpine stage trilogy that proved fatal to the hopes of rivals Mark Cavendish, Marcel Kittel, Andre Greipel and Dylan Groenewegen.
All the aforementioned exited the race over two tough days in the Alps, and Sagan — who had won two stages on this edition so far — was quick to capitalise. 
Sagan, wearing the green jersey for the leader of the points competition that he has won five times previously, was given extra work to do after Belgian upstart Philippe Gilbert (Quick Step) brazenly attacked a leading peloton full of ambitious sprinters 930 metres from the line. 
But Sagan, and his rivals didn’t flinch. They kept the pace high and one-day classics specialist Gilbert was caught with 245m remaining. 
The FDJ team of Arnaud Demare had been key in chasing down a relatively tame four-man breakaway in the closing kilometres of the race.
But the Frenchman came up short when it came to payback. He launched his burst first, but, as Norwegian Alexander Kristoff and Sagan came up on his left, Demare ran out of juice.
Britain’s Geraint Thomas, fresh from winning two stages in the Alps, remained in the leader’s yellow jersey.
Welshman Thomas leads Sky teammate Chris Froome by 1min 39secs, with Dutchman Tom Dumoulin (Sunweb) third overall at 1:50.
The 14th stage on Saturday is far more more difficult and technical ride over 188 km between Saint-Paul-Trois-Chateaux to Mende.

The legend is back
","April marked the much-anticipated return to the pool of the world’s most decorated Olympian, Michael Phelps. In his comeback meeting in Mesa, Arizona, Phelps finished second behind Ryan Lochte in the 100m butterfly final.
He then swam butterfly in the 50m freestyle event in order to work on that particular stroke, failing to make the final in the process.
A smiling and more relaxed Phelps, who seems to be having a lot of fun in this second stint, says he is back to competitive swimming merely because he missed it since retiring in 2012.

Khade upstages Schooling, takes gold ","Advait Page broke the men’s 1500m national record by nearly 20 seconds as he won the gold in the 14th Singapore National swimming championships in Singapore on Friday.
The youngster, from Madhya Pradesh, clocked an Indian best time of 15:25.98s which broke the previous record of 15:45.83 set by Kerala’s Sajan Prakash in 2014. 
It also helped him go past the Swimming Federation of India’s qualification standard for the coming Asian Games (15:33.21, sixth place of 2014 Incheon Asiad).
“That was absolutely spectacular, many of the swimmers are coming up with awesome timings,” prominent swimming coach Nihar Ameen, the Dronacharya awardee, told The Hindu from Singapore on Friday evening. 
Advait had broken the 800m national record earlier with a time of 8:10.22s. Meanwhile National record holder Virdhawal Khade won the men’s 100m freestyle gold in 50.26s and in the process defeated the host Singapore’s Joseph Schooling, the Rio Olympics champion. Schooling was third with 50.49s. 
Later, Karnataka’s Arvind Mani bettered the men’s 100m back stroke national record while finishing third with 56.38s (previous 57.95s). However, he narrowly failed to make the cut for the Asiad (qual. time 56.35). 
Sandeep Sejwal, the national record holder, had won the silver in the men’s 100m breast stroke on Thursday in 1:02.33s. Sejwal had won the 50m breast stroke bronze medal at the Incheon Asiad.

Transplanted Vaishnavi takes root
","Talk of Indian badminton and the names of Saina Nehwal and P. V. Sindhu come to mind. Ever wondered who is next on the list?
Even an ardent lover of Indian badminton can’t be faulted for not getting it right. Such is the gulf between the country’s two best players and the rest.
This subject is discussed mostly when India plays a women’s team competition like the Uber Cup. India’s bronze medals in the Uber Cup in 2014 and 2016 drew entirely on the strength of Saina, Sindhu and the effective pair of G. Jwala and Ashwini Ponnappa. Even before the first shuttle was tossed in a tie, India expected nothing from the third singles and the second doubles.
But in recent times, the rise of 16-year-old Vaishnavi Reddy has raised hopes of India finding its next world-class singles player.
After Sindhu and Saina, Vaishnavi is the strongest Indian in the world rankings (No. 53). Fourth in the world junior rankings, she is the only Indian female qualifier in the upcoming Youth Olympic Games. In July, she will join Sindhu and Saina in the 32-player Indonesian Open, one of the elite events of the season.
Against the tide
What makes Vaishnavi’s rise so fascinating is that her success has been earned by swimming against the tide. Following a disillusioning experience at the Gopi Chand Academy three years ago, her father Vinod Reddy decided to move base to Bangkok.
“The kind of attention a child [Vaishnavi] deserved for being India No. 1 in under-13 and again in under-15, both in singles and doubles, was not given,” says a pained Vinod, “I thought this was not the right place for Vaishnavi.”
But why move to Bangkok?
“The year before I left India, I saw Thailand’s Phittayaporn Chaiwan [in the junior Asian Badminton Championship] who was the top-ranked girl in every age-group… even now she holds the No. 1 rank among junior girls,” says Vinod.
“I was very impressed with the way she played and conducted herself in the arena. I also met the daughter of the owner of the Banthongyord Badminton School, where Chaiwan trained. Later, I learnt that Ratchanok Intanon [former world champion, currently No. 4] also trained there.
“I thought Vaishnavi could go there for short stints. Also, it’s just a three-hour flight from India. So when I decided to leave Gopi’s academy, Bangkok was an obvious choice,” he reveals.
The decision proved a blessing for Vaishnavi. Adapting admirably to the new surroundings, the teenager stayed focused and won 15 international medals (mostly in the junior section), seven of them gold, in 2017-2018.
Recently, a place in the Uber Cup squad came on the rebound for Vaishnavi after Sindhu chose to stay away. Like Saina, Vaishnavi also returned with a one-win-two-loss record from the event.
However, walking out of the Gopi Chand Academy has strained the relationship with those who run badminton in the country. She is seen in some sections as a ‘rebel’.
But Vaishnavi has her admirers as well. National selector and four-time National champion Manjusha Kanwar foresees a bright future.
“The fact that she handles the work-load from foreign coaches, who are mostly tough taskmasters, shows that she works extremely hard,” says Manjusha. “She has good height and [a good] wrist. She has all the basic attributes that go into making a strong player. She hits hard and retrieves well. No doubt, given her age, she is likely to lose more than she wins in the seniors. But Vaishnavi surely has what it takes.”
Chief National junior coach Sanjay Mishra is impressed with what he saw in the Dutch Open, “Without doubt, Vaishnavi has the game to be the next big name from India in singles. She has the height and the range of strokes. Strength will be built with time and age. Vaishnavi can be expected to serve the country for long.”

Pacers clip Hawks to force game 7
","David West’s late-game heroics saved the Indiana Pacers’ season - for now.
West scored 24 points, including the go-ahead layup with 46.5 seconds left in a 16-4 closing run, and the top-seeded Pacers forced a decisive game 7 with a 95-88 road victory over the eighth-seeded Atlanta Hawks on Thursday night in their Eastern Conference opening round playoff series.
“We were in desperation mode and had to get this game to go back to our building for a tough game 7,” explained West, who added 12 rebounds and six assists. “We’re trying to advance.”
The Pacers host winner-take-all game 7 on Saturday at Bankers Life FieldHouse, where they had the league’s best regular season home record. But the Hawks have already taken two games in the series in the building.
Paul George also scored 24 points, Lance Stephenson added 21 while George Hill put up 14 for the Pacers, who avoided becoming the sixth team No. 1 seed to lose an opening round series to a No. 8 in history thanks to West.
The Pacers trailed 84-79 with 3 minutes 16 minutes remaining. But West (eight) and George (four) combined for 12 points in the 16-4 finishing kick.
After Hill’s driving layup put Indiana ahead 85-84, Atlanta’s Pero Antic’s free throw tied it with 1:24 remaining for the last time.
The resilient Hawks, however, are confident they can win for a third time at Indiana.

Oklahoma City Thunder 104, Memphis Grizzlies 84

League scoring champion Kevin Durant broke out of slump with 36 points after a combined 41 in the last two contests, and the visiting Thunder shot past the Grizzlies to force a deciding game 7 in their first round Western Conference series. 
Russell Westbook scored 25 points and Reggie Jackson had 16 for Oklahoma, which led 56-41 at halftime. 
The second-seeded Thunder will host the seventh seed in Game 7 on Saturday night. 

Golden State Warriors 100, LA Clippers 99

Stephen Curry had 24 points with nine assists, and the sixth-seeded Warriors forced a decisive game 7 after surviving the visiting third-seeded Clippers. 
The underdog Warriors head back to Los Angeles for the decisive game 7 on Saturday night. 
Andre Iguodala netted 15 points and Draymond Green contributed 14 points and 14 rebounds for the Warriors, who will be playing their first game 7 in 37 years.

First it was the India Open, where Saina Nehwal and Parupalli Kashyap were the last to bow out, in the quarter-finals of the tournament. Next came the Singapore Open, where Kidambi Srikanth put a valiant fight against world no. 1 Lee Chong Wei in the semi-final, but was in the end defeated.
Arvind Bhat was taking part in the New Zealand Open badminton tournament, but he too stumbled in the semi-final.

Mavericks pip United in TT thriller
","On a night that saw the golden point rule the roost, the Karlssons from Sweden — Mattias and Kristian — stole the limelight as RP-SG Mavericks edged out Maharashtra United in a nail-biting CEAT Ultimate Table Tennis contest on Sunday. 
In the first of the four ties that were decided in the last of the 21 games at the Shree Shiv Chhatrapati sports complex, Sabine Winter kept her nerve to pip Madhurika Patkar 3-0 and take the Mavericks to a 11-10 win against the home team.
Spellbound 
So high was the quality of table tennis and so little to differentiate the sides, it left the full house spellbound. 
Nine of the 21 games, including the final game of the tie, were decided through golden point, a UTT innovation. Winter trailed Madhurika 8-10 in the tie-deciding third game but backed her aggressive instincts to win three points in a row.
The UTT format doesn’t allow two Indians to face each other in a singles match. 
As both sides had a top-ranked Swede in their camp, the teams decided to pit them against each other. The Karlssons, friends off the field, enthralled the audience with some breathtaking table tennis. 
United, trailing 6-3, was looking forward to World No. 18 Kristian to put it back on track. 
The southpaw didn’t disappoint, his forehand top-spin helping him dominate the first two games. However, the lanky Mattias fought back to win the third, with some powerful forehand kills. 
United’s Elizabeta Samara then earned three vital points against Doo Hoi Kem before veteran Joao Monteiro turned the tables on Harmeet Desai to put United on the brink of a win as it led 10-8 going into the final match. But, Winter turned the tide in Mavericks’ favour. 
The results: 
RP-SG Mavericks bt Maharashtra United 11-10 (Ayhika Mukherjee bt Lily Zhang 10-11, 11-5, 11-10; Kou Lei bt Anthony Amalraj 10-11, 11-10, 11-5; Harmeet Desai & Doo Hoi Kem bt Anthony Amalraj & Elizabeta Samara 11-5, 11-6, 5-11; Mattias Karlsson lost to Kristian Karlsson 9-11, 6-11, 11-10; Doo Hoi Kem lost to Elizabeta Samara 5-11, 10-11, 8-11; Harmeet Desai lost to Joao Monteiro 11-10, 9-11, 10-11; Sabine Winter bt Madhurika Patkar 11-7, 11-9, 11-10).

Women paddlers fail to cross quarterfinal hurdle
","India’s challenge at the World Table Tennis championships ended after the women paddlers were beaten 1-3 in the quarterfinals by Brazil in Tokyo on Saturday.
After a brilliant performance in group events of Stage 1 in second division, the Indian girls were expected to give some fight in the knockout stage.
But, except for Manika Batra, who is in the best form of her life, none of the other girls could withstand the pressure built by the Brazilians.
The beginning for India was the kind which neither the girls nor their coach Bhawani Mukehrjee would have wanted.
K Shamini, who played well, was unable to come to terms against Gui Lin who made use of most of her rival’s mistakes at crucial junctions.
Shamini, despite taking two games of her opponent of Chinese origin, lost 8-11, 11-7, 5-11, 11-9, 7-11.
But Manika, brushing aside the pressure, restored parity beating Ligia Silva 13-11, 7-11, 11-4, 12-10.
Playing an attacking game Manika kept pushing Silva to the brink. However, Ankita lost her singles to Caroline Kumahara 4-11, 8-11, 11-7, 6-11 without much fight.
Once again, the pressure was back on Manika, who had to play her reverse singles against Brazil’s No. 1 player Gui Lin, and could not sustain the pace generated by Lin and succumbed 12-14, 7-11, 12-10, 5-11.
The coach appreciated Manika’s excellent form in the championships but rued the failure to make further progress in the championships.
“I would have wanted them to make it to the semifinals at least. Though that was not to be, we are in a happy frame of mind. Now we will look ahead to the CWG at Glasgow before working on the Asian Games at Incheon,” said Mukherjee.

Vijay will look to regain form
","Olympic silver medallist Vijay Kumar will attempt to regain his confident trigger in rapid fire pistol when he opens competition in the 18th Kumar Surendra Singh shooting championship here on Wednesday.
It has been a struggle for Vijay, who has been out of the National squad in recent times, as he has not been able to reach even the ‘Minimum Travel Score’ of 579. In fact, Vijay had shot 566 and 567 in the last two trials. His attempt to revive fortunes by competing in the MQS section of the Munich World Cup did not fructify, as his pistol box was misplaced by the airlines when he reached Munich. Anish Bhanwala and Neeraj Kumar will also be in the fray.
That the World Championship team can have only 10 shooters in all for five of men’s pistol events, would make it difficult for the fringe shooters to make the cut.
Along with the 25m rapid fire pistol, competition will open in the men’s 10-metre air rifle, which will feature junior and youth sections. 
There will be about 600 shooters, which has forced the organisers to arrange eight relays of 70-odd participants each, and hold the air rifle finals on Thursday.

Disappointing start for Lahiri, defending champion Spieth
","
Indian golfer Anirban Lahiri carded a 5-over 76, leaving him with a mountain to climb in his bid for a weekend appearance, on the opening day of the 147th Open Championships here on Thursday. 
The Carnoustie Golf Links, which was baked on a warm morning, penalised visits to the fairway bunkers and did not make putting easy either.
Americans, who have won the last five Majors, and 10 of the last 14, dominated the leader-board. Kevin Kisner led the field with a 5-under 66 which included a colourful stretch of bogey-eagle-par-birdie from fifth. 
Hat-trick of birdies
He then he had a hat-trick of birdies from 13th to 15th and survived the famous Carnoustie bite on the 16-18th hole.
“Getting accustomed to links golf is something you have to do where we come from,” Kisner said. “The ball's running 50 to 80 yards on certain shots. I didn't think it was as firm today as it has been, but I also played at 7:50 in the morning.
“I think I only hit four drivers all day, maybe five. I just want the ball on the fairway because it's not an overly long golf course.”
Van Rooyen delights
Erik Van Rooyen of South Africa, who qualified for the Open by finishing second behind Shubhankar Sharma at Joburg Open, was flawless for 17 holes before dropping a shot on 18th for a 4-under 67.
Defending champion Jordan Spieth was not a model of accuracy, and it finally caught up with the Texan as he dropped four shots in the final four holes for a 72.
Lahiri had bogeys on fourth, ninth and 16th and he double-bogeyed the 10th and there were no birdies
“It was not the day I was hoping for. I didn’t get off to a good start and after 2-3 holes in, I started tightening up and had a ‘birdie free’ round. That’s not the phrase I want to be associated with, but that’s what it was,” said Lahiri, who found only 20% of the fairways, hit 50% greens in regulation and needed as many as 31 putts. 
“I missed a lot of shots to the right and that’s not what I do usually. I missed a lot of opportunity early on and didn’t take advantage of the two par-5s and I found too many fairway bunkers.” 
“I got my speeds on the green a little wrong; left a couple in the jaw and a couple lipped out. So, I need to work on the speed and tempo. Still 5-over is not where I should be but I still feel I can make a bunch of birdies tomorrow.”
Niggle in the neck
Lahiri admitted to not having had a good sleep for 2-3 nights here in Carnoustie and the unease led to a niggle in the neck. 
American Tony Finau showed there were a lot of birdies to be had, eight in total, but also dropped four bogeys in his 67. Brandon Stone, who shot 60 on Sunday enroute to winning the Scottish Open and making it to the Open, carded 68. Augusta Masters champion Patrick Reed shot a 75. 
Earlier, veteran Scot Sandy Lyle, the champion way back in 1985, had the honour of hitting the opening tee. He striped an iron down the middle of the fairway on the way to shooting 75.

Seema Punia’s Asiad berth not in danger ","After insisting that all athletes, except Commonwealth Games javelin throw champion Neeraj Chopra, must take part in next week’s National inter-State athletics championships in Guwahati to confirm their berths for the forthcoming Asian Games in Jakarta, the Athletics Federation of India (AFI) appears to have softened its stand for Seema Punia too.
Woman discus thrower Seema, the country’s lone athletics gold medallist at the last Asian Games in Incheon, will not be competing in Guwahati but her place in the Asiad team is not in any danger.
“Seema will not be taking part but she has got permission from the AFI president (Adille Sumariwalla),” Radhakrishnan Nair, the deputy chief national coach, told The Hindu from New Delhi on Saturday. 
“She does not want her training to be disturbed and moreover, she has proved herself in the recent Commonwealth Games (where she won silver),” said Radhakrishnan.
But nobody knows for sure where the Haryana athlete currently is. 
“She is not in the country, I think she is somewhere in Russia but am not sure about it,” Radhakrishnan added.
The coach also said that javelin thrower Vipin Kasana, who finished fifth in the CWG, would miss the inter-State meet with an injury.

Table tennis: Indian women top group, earn direct quarterfinal berth
","The Indian women’s team topped its group to secure a direct entry into the quarterfinals while the men will fight it out in the round of 16 after finishing third in their group in the second division of the World Team Table Tennis Championships on Thursday.
Indian women got past Bulgaria 3-2 in Group G which they topped with five wins in as many matches. Given a bye in the first round of the knock out stage, India faces the winner of the Egypt-Brazil match in the quarterfinals on Saturday.
The men’s team, led by A. Sharath Kamal, finished third in Group F behind Iran and Italy though all three teams had nine points and suffered a loss each. A loss against Italy on Wednesday from a winning position cost India dear. It will take on Egypt on Friday.
“It is a pity the way we lost against Italy. Harmeet lost a close match he should have won,” Indian coach Peter Engel said of the 3-2 loss against Italy. Desai lost the decider 3-1 and was leading 9-1 in the fourth before Niagol Stoyanov turned it around to win the game 24-22 and thus the match.

IOA to not accredit parents at Asiad
","Left with bitter experience after Saina Nehwal’s pull-out threat during the Commonwealth Games in Gold Coast, the Indian Olympic Association (IOA) has decided to strictly follow “no accreditation policy” for the parents of sportspersons during the upcoming Asian Games in Indonesia.
“There is no policy to give accreditation to parents of the players. We made an exception in Gold Coast as the athlete in question (without taking Saina’s name) said she won’t play,” IOA secretary general Rajeev Mehta told mediapersons. 
However, if a particular National Sports Federation (NSF) includes a parent or a spouse or a relative in the support staff, IOA will not be in a position to raise an objection.

C’wealth meet: Indians set to monopolise
"," Over the years, the Commonwealth chess championship has increasingly resembled a miniature version of the Indian National championship. Whether it is the Open section — involving men and women — or the age-group categories, the Indians have hardly missed a medal. 
Though the country’s best have stayed away from this competition it has, in no way, slowed the Indian juggernaut. The continued absence of the elite players from England and Canada means India will once again virtually monopolise the medals when the action begins here on Tuesday. 
The list of 13 Grandmasters — all Indians — is headed by 2014 champion Deep Sengupta, ranked 15th in the country. That is the true reflection on the lack of worthiness of the Commonwealth title for the Indian elite. The field also has 15 IMs and two WGMs. For the record, there are 134 Indians in a field of 166. Among those missing from the field is the four-time winner and defending champion Abhijeet Gupta.
On the brighter side, the organisation of this event has improved dramatically since 2016. This year the competition returns to the Leela Ambience Convention Hotel here. Unlike last year, the main action will be at the spacious ground floor hall. 
In the seven age-groups, where the competition will be held separately for girls, as well, Indian talent is set to come to the fore. 
The top-10 seeds are: 1. Deep Sengupta (2526), 2. Vaibhav Suri (2556), 3. Deepan Chakkravarthy (2531), 4. M. R. Lalit Babu (2529), 5. V.Vishnu Prasanna (2525), 6. Debashis Das (2522), 7. Swapnil Dhopade (2495), 8. M. S. Thej Kumar (2495), 9. Abhijit Kunte (2494), 10. V. Karthik (2475).

Asia Oceania Junior girls tennis: India qualifies
","It was time to enjoy the rewards of hard work. The India girls qualified with ease as they beat Kazakhstan 3-0 in the quarterfinals of the Asia Oceania World Junior under-14 tennis tournament at the DLTA Complex here on Thursday.
Shivani Ingle gave a rousing start for the host as she blanked Darya Detkovskaya in 47 minutes. If the Indian girls thought it would be a walk in the park, they were mistaken as Ainur Suleimenovadis played a much superior game in the second singles to push Sathwika Sama to her wit’s end.
Sathwika shrugged off her tentative game to weave a web around the Kazakh girl on the way to a 4-6, 6-2, 6-1 victory in nearly two hours. The relieved Indian girls returned later to the court to clinch the inconsequential doubles as well, in three sets.
India will play second-seeded Chinese Taipei in the semifinals, while the other match will feature top-seeded Australia and third-seeded China.
Captain Ankita Bhambri praised the girls for keeping a positive attitude and playing to their potential, despite the fluctuating fortunes. She was also relieved that the girls sealed the issue in the singles matches itself.
More than anything else, Ankita was happy that the girls would get six matches in the World Group competition in the Czech Republic in August, that would further pave the way for them to become better.
“The girls are much better players today than what they were when the tournament started. They have been receptive and improved with every match. I have kept a positive outlook and made sure that the pressure did not get to them,” said Ankita, who herself had helped the Indian girls reach the fifth spot in the world in the company of Sania Mirza in the Junior Fed Cup.
Shivani Ingle, who trains with Sandeep Kirtane and Kedar Shah at the Deccan Gymkhana in Pune, said that she was very happy to help the team qualify. “We were focused to give our best,” she said.
Sathwika Sama who was very nervous in the early part of her match and froze with many shots said that she was thrilled to have bounced back into the match, neutralising the strategy of her opponent by running hard to get the drops and turning the match on its head.
A trainee of coaches Narendra Nath and Vasudeva Reddy in Hyderabad, Sathwika said that the team was confident of clinching the tie and qualifying for Czech Republic after the memorable victory over fourth seed Japan in the league.

The results (quarterfinals): Australia bt Japan 2-0 (Baijing Lin bt Yuki Ando 6-0, 6-1; DestaneeAiava bt Ayumi Miyamoto 6-1, 6-2).
China bt New Zealand 2-0 (Tang Qianhui bt Tiana Windbuchler 6-3, 6-2; Nima Zhuoma bt Nina Paripovich 5-4 (retired).
India bt Kazakhstan 3-0 (Shivani Ingle bt Darya Detkovskaya 6-0, 6-0; Sathwika Sama bt Ainur Suleimenova 4-6, 6-3, 6-1; Aarja Chakraborty & Sathwika Sama bt Darya Detkovskaya & Ainur Suleimenova 2-6, 6-2, 6-3).
Chinese Taipei bt Hong Kong 3-0 (Pei-Hsuan Chen bt Hei Ching Ng 6-1,7-5; I-Hsuan Cho bt Hong Yi Wong 6-3, 6-0; Pei-Hsuan Chen & Yang Leebt Hei Ching Ng & Wai Yiu Tsang 6-1, 6-4).

Mavericks keep winning
","Doo Hoi Kem and Mattias Karlsson, the top-ranked singles players in the RP-SP Mavericks camp proved the difference against Dabang Smashers in the 13-8 triumph in a battle involving two previously-undefeated teams in the Ultimate Table Tennis league here on Wednesday. 
Doo, ranked 13th among the women and Mattias, ranked 20th in the men’s world list, raced away to 3-0 victories over Sakura Mori and G. Sathiyan in successive matches to give Mavericks the crucial 11th point in the 21-game tie. 
In the day’s final clash, that pitched the experience of 34-year old Mouma Das against the exuberance of 17-year-old Adriana Diaz, the veteran Indian prevailed over the World No. 38 2-1 to enhance the winning margin. 
Even as Mavericks maintained its all-win record to reach 37 points, Smashers remained atop the points-table by reaching 39. These two teams are almost sure of being among the semifinalists. 
Manika bounces back
Smashers’ Manika Batra continued her undefeated run after accounting for the all-conquering Sabina Winter. Relying increasingly on her backhand blocks and looking to finish with her fast improving forehand drives, Manika made light of the loss of the first game by winning the next two against Sabine who had not dropped a game in two encounters. 
But the joy for Smashers was short-lived as Harmeet Desai, ranked 81, upstaged 27th-ranked Yoshida Masaki. After the duo of G. Sathiyan and a screeching Sakura Mori maintained their unbeaten run, Cendric Nuoytinck kept his slate clean by upsetting 33rd-ranked Kou Lie that helped Smashers stay ahead. However, Doo, Mattias and Mouma won eight of the last nine games to seal Mavericks’ win. 
The results: RP-SG Mavericks bt Debang Smashers 13-8 (Sabine Winter lost to Manika Batra 11-4, 3-11, 7-11; Harmeet Desai bt Yoshida Masaki 8-11, 11-10, 11-9; Harmeet Desai & Doo Hoi Kem lost to G. Sathiyan & Sakura Mori 11-10, 9-11, 2-11; Kou Lie lost to Cedric Nyutinck 7-11, 11-3, 7-11; Doo bt Mori 11-7, 11-5, 11-7; Mattias Karlsson bt Sathiyan 11-7, 11-8, 11-7; Mouma Das bt Adriana Diaz 10-11, 11-8, 11-9).

Prajnesh prevailed over the Canadian 7-6(6), 2-6, 6-3 in an hour and 48 minutes in his maiden ATP World Tour level event to set up a second-round match against Argentina’ Guido Pella on Thursday. A win here could set up a possible match against Roger Federer in the quarterfinals.
“I couldn’t have asked for a better start to the grass court season. In the first set, I was serving well and he was a bit slow which helped me take it,” said Prajnesh.
“In the second set, I played one loose game and he capitalised while I couldn’t convert the breakpoint chances I had. But in the third set, I got my return games going and raced to a 5-0 lead and could have closed it out sooner but still I am very happy with the way it turned out.”
Speaking on the pain of missing out on the French Open, Prajnesh said, “I felt bad for a few days and I did not compete well in that challenger tournament, but I got over it quickly.”

Norway chess tournament: Anand loses to Caruana
","Viswanathan Anand suffered a rare defeat with white pieces after his sense of danger surprisingly deserted him against World No. 2 Fabiano Caruana in the eighth and penultimate round of Norway chess tournament here on Wednesday. 
In the day’s other decisive game, Hikaru Nakamura scored an easy win over Sergey Karjakin. As a result, Nakamura and Caruana joined Magnus Carlsen and Wesley So in the lead at four points. 
A day after scoring his first win and joining the leaders, Anand looked in no serious danger for the better part of this Petroff Defence game that soon appeared like the exchange variation of French Defence. 
Anand began losing ground around the 27th move and soon gave up his rook for an advanced knight and a pawn. While Anand failed to find the right defence, Caruana kept improving his position. 
Just when Anand was expected to bring to the fore his well-known defensive skills, he faltered. On the 49th move, Anand’s decision to advance his king deeper into the enemy territory hastened the end as he went on to resign a move later. 
Eighth round results: Viswanathan Anand (3.5/7) lost to Fabiano Caruana (USA, 4/7); Magnus Carlsen (Nor, 4/7) drew with Shakhriyar Mamedyarov (Aze, 3.5/8); Hikaru Nakamura (USA, 4/7) bt Sergey Karjakin (Rus, 3/7); Wesley So (USA, 4/7) drew with Maxime Vachier-Lagrave (Fra, 2.5/7); Levon Aronian (Arm, 3.5/7) bye. 
Final round pairings: Karjakin-Anand; Lagrave-Carlsen; Caruana-So; Aronian-Nakamura; Mamedyarov bye.

A plus two student of Rathinapuri Corporation HSS, Satish stopped the clock at 15:15.30s for the gold.
He further added the 10,000m silver to make it doubly sweet for his coach S. Vairavanathan of the Genesis Sports Foundation here.
“This is just the beginning. He will come up with even better performances in the years to come,” said Vairavananthan. 
The 10,000m medal was a bonus as his pet events are the 3000m and 5000m,” he added.
Vairavanathan said Satish showed interest in participating in a marathon race a couple of years ago. “I could see the spark in his eyes; so I picked him up and trained him to this level.”
The coach was obviously pleased as Satish overcame some experienced runners in the field. 
“He was able to do that because he was willing to spend long hours in training. He is blessed with a good stride and style, but the big plus is his amazing lung-capacity. So be prepared for many more surprises.”

NBA finals: Golden State Warriors beat Cleveland Cavaliers for third title in four years
","The third time was more than just the charm. It was perfection.
The Golden State Warriors became the NBA's first back-to-back champion since 2013, on Friday night, gradually pulling away from the Cleveland Cavaliers to complete a four-game sweep in the Finals with a 108-85 romp in Game 4 in Cleveland.
Stephen Curry poured in 37 points, including 20 in the first half, during which the Warriors took a commanding lead, helping Golden State capture its third championship in the four-year Steve Kerr coaching era.
“It was definitely the toughest,” Kerr said in comparing the three championships. “I remember sitting in this room three years ago; it seemed like a dream. This feels more like reality.
“I hope that doesn't sound arrogant. It's just that's the talent we have, and that's the experience we've gained. But it's a very different feeling. It's still euphoric, but three years ago was I can't believe this happened, and now it's I can definitely believe this happened. But it was hard.”
All three championships have come against the Cavaliers, with the series clincher coming in Cleveland for the second time.
“I just want to congratulate Cleveland on an amazing season,” Kerr praised. ”You know, I watched that team a lot during the year. We always keep our eye on them, of course, and there have been kind of three different versions of their team. The fact that they got here surprised me, actually, watching them during the regular season. It didn't look like they were going to have enough.
“But what (coach Tyronn Lue) did with his group and obviously what LeBron (James) does night after night is just incredible. They had an amazing run.”
Kevin Durant was named Finals MVP for the second year in a row, the sixth player to accomplish the back-to-back feat. He got seven of the 11 votes cast by the media, with Curry getting the other four.
Durant supplemented Curry's big scoring night with the first Finals triple-double of his career with 20 points, 12 rebounds and a post season-career-high 10 assists.
It was Durant's 28th consecutive playoff game with 20 or more points.
“Steph went out and recruited K.D. with this in mind: Winning titles,” Kerr said. “I was there in the Hamptons (at the Durant recruiting session) when we had that discussion. I don't remember anybody asking who is going to win MVP in the Finals. It was all about let's win championships together, and that's what this is about. You guys can write about MVP. We don't care.”
The sweep was the second in Warriors history, duplicating their 1975 feat, and the first in the NBA since the Cavaliers were beaten in four straight by the San Antonio Spurs in 2007.
James, perhaps playing his final game for the Cavaliers, had his least productive outing of the series, recording 23 points, seven rebounds and eight assists in his eighth consecutive trip to the Finals. He revealed after the game that he had been playing through a significant hand injury suffered after Game 1.
“To be the best player in the world and to give everything you've got in your 15th season, play all 82 games, probably one of the greatest playoff runs that we'll ever see from an individual, to carry this team the way he did all season and leading by example, it's just a testament to his character and who he is as a person and as a player,” Cavaliers coach Tyronn Lue gushed of James.
“He's a bad boy, and I love having him on our team. He fights and competes to the end. Sometimes you can give everything you've got and still come up short.”
A majority of Curry's 37 points came from outside the 3-point arc. He buried 7 of 15, and Golden State connected on 14 of 38, including 9 of 17 en route to a 61-52 halftime advantage.
The Warriors buried the Cavaliers in the third quarter, holding them to 13 points on 4-for-17 shooting. James did not have a field goal in the period, going 0-for-2, as Cleveland saw its nine-point halftime deficit balloon to as many as 21.
“It's tough,” Lue said of the challenge of defending the Warriors. “They move at such a pace, and they have five guys on the floor that can dribble, pass and shoot. They can make plays. So if you make a mistake, they're going to make you pay. That's the beauty of their team.
“Even when you do defend them well, you've still got guys like Steph and K.D. and Klay (Thompson) who can make unbelievable shots, even when you play the best of defense.”
Thompson had all 10 of his points in the third period, during which Golden State outscored the Cavaliers 25-13.
Draymond Green added nine points, nine assists and three blocks in the win, which gave Golden State six all-time championships, tying Chicago for the third-most in NBA history behind Boston (17) and the Los Angeles Lakers (16).
The Warriors blocked 13 shots in the game, with Curry and Durant joining Green with three apiece.
Andre Iguodala, playing for just the second time in the Finals, contributed 11 points to the win off the bench.
James left to a standing ovation after playing 41 of the game's first 44 minutes. The three-time champion, including 2016 when the Cavaliers beat Golden State in seven games, can opt out of his Cleveland contract this offseason.
“I hope he stays. I mean, we all know that,” Lue insisted. “But after a game like that, I'm not in any position to talk about that. I just appreciate what he's done for us this season. That's all I can really speak about.”
Kevin Love had 13 points, while JR Smith and Rodney Hood chipped in with 10 apiece for Cleveland, which shot just 34.5 percent from the field and 8-for-27 from behind the 3-point line.

“This is one Major I have tried to qualify for in the past and failed to do so. So, it was very satisfying to do so this time. I had a good weekend at the Colonial (tied 20th) but was disappointed to miss the cut at the Memorial. In hindsight it made me more determined to do well at the US Open qualifiers in Columbus,” said Shubhankar. 
Talking of the course, Shubhankar said, “I have heard and read a lot about this course and I know it is a tough test but I love such challenges and this is what pro golf is all about. I am looking forward to it and hopefully I will be able to make a mark on the weekend.” 
While Shubhankar is the focus of Indian and Asian fans, the world is waiting with bated breath to witness how Tiger Woods performs at his first US Open appearance since 2015. The US Open is also the event where Woods won his 14th and last Major in 2008. 
Woods has had some good finishes this season, including a close second at the Valspar Championship
Woods, apart, there will be a lot of interest in how the other ‘veteran’ Phil Mickelson does. This is the only Major Mickelson has not won despite coming second numerous times. Dustin Johnson, who reclaimed his World No 1 spot last week, Justin Thomas, Rory McIlroy, Jordan Spieth, Rickie Fowler, Masters champion Patrick Reed and defending champion Brooks Koepka are all raring to go in the ‘peoples’ Major.

Prize money: TTFI to make amends
","While the Table Tennis Federation of India (TTFI) has been increasing the entry fee for a national-ranking table tennis tournament every year recently, it has been stingy when it comes to rewarding the players. 
After a long wait, the players could get more rewards with the federation promising to pass on a chunk of the additional revenue it generates through entry fees. 
Rise of 200%
Since 2011, the entry fee has seen a rise of at least 200%, with the TTFI charging more for at least a bunch of players with every passing year. 
On the other hand, the prize money has been revised only three times in the last eight seasons, including the current year. 
While the total prize money has been raised by 30% since 2011, the largest individual prize purse — that of the men’s singles champion in each of the five national-ranking tournaments every year — has increased only by 17%. 
It is intriguing that despite getting 11Sports as a title sponsor since 2016, the federation has not passed on the additional bucks to the players, let alone reducing the entry fee. 
Displeasure voiced
During the Central Zone National-ranking tournament, which concluded on Wednesday, a plethora of players, coaches and parents voiced their displeasure over the TTFI’s apathy towards players. 
When The Hindu posed this question to M.P. Singh, the TTFI general secretary, he said the issue is being addressed. 
“We have realised that the hike in the entry fee doesn’t translate into increase in the prize money. 
“I agree it is a little unfair to the players and the TTFI executive committee, during its recent meeting, has decided that at least half of the additional entry fee revenue should be passed on to the players as prize money very soon,” Singh said. 
“Since the minutes of the meeting haven’t been ratified, we couldn’t implement it for the Central Zone tournament. 
“We hope to introduce the benefit to players for the remaining season.”

Mansi has to be content with silver
","Being disappointed after losing in the final is understandable but Mansi Ahlawat was stunned into silence. It didn’t matter that she was participating in her maiden international competition at home and ended with a silver. The Rohtak girl had blanked out after the defeat and had no words to express herself at the Junior Asian Wrestling Championships here on Friday.
 It took a while for her to start speaking but had nothing to say about her 57kg title bout against Japan’s Akie Hanai, which she lost by technical superiority 10-0, except that she had never fought against her opponent before and had not seen any videos of her either. She knew nothing of her rival.
A silver medalist at the Cadet Asian Championships in May this year — she had lost to another Japanese, Ozaki Nonoka — this was also Mansi’s maiden international competition in the junior category after winning gold in the national championships in February. Travelling 10km every day to and from Seria village in Jhajjar district to Sir Chotu Ram Stadium in Rohtak, twice a day, Mansi and her younger sister Khushi are first-generation wrestlers in her family.
“I was a gymnast for two years at the same stadium. We used to see girls practice wrestling and liked it, moving to the sport four years ago to train with Mandeep sir,” she said. Up next is the selection trials for the World Junior Championships. And though the girl with few words didn’t say anything, it was the first time she smiled throughout the interaction, making her determination evident.
Mansi was the only bright spot of the day for the host apart from Swati Shinde, who ended her bronze medal bout in double-quick time to win by technical superiority 10-0 in the 53kg. The other three Indians in the fray for a bronze all lost as the Indian women finished with two silvers and three bronze in third place, behind runaway leader Japan — seven golds and one silver — and China, who had five silvers and four bronze.
The standings (Gold, silver, bronze): Women: 53kg: Umi Imai (Jpn), Yuhong Zhong (Chn), Swati Shinde (Ind) and Enkhtsetseg Batbaatar (Mgl); 57kg: Akie Hanai (Jpn), Mansi (Ind), Zhanerke Assanova (Kaz) and Qi Zhang (Chn); 62kg: Irina Kuznetsova (Kaz), Rin Kondo (Jpn), Seeun Choi (Kor) and Xinyuan Sun (Chn); 65kg: Naomi Ruike (Jpn), Yaru Wu (Chn), Delgermaa Enkhsaikhan (Mgl) and Bakhtigul Baltaniyazova (Uzb); 72kg: Mei Shindo (Jpn), Khulan Tsermaa (Mgl), Hui Tsz Chang (Tpe) and Gulnaz Zhapparova (Kaz).

Bundy is an artistic skating coach from Italy. She has been appointed by Fédération Internationale de Roller Sports to coach artistic skaters in India in a ten-day camp at the Visakhapatnam Steel Plant Skating Rink. “Skaters have the right attitude in India but the levels of skating in other countries are much higher. One of the main reasons is because of more coaches to train the athletes,” she says. Bundy continues, “Having an indoor skating rink is an absolute must if India wants to compete at international levels. Roller sports are one of eight sports in consideration for the 2020 Olympics. And hence, the coming two years will be crucial for every professional skater in the world.”
Bunday has been coaching artistic skating since last 18 years in Italy. Her association with roller skating goes back to 1970, under her mother’s guidance when she was just four years old. Skating continued to be her hobby until Bundy realised she would like to be a professional judge. She enrolled in a short-term professional course when she was in first-year of college studying economics. Bundy starting judging skating competitions in 1984 and finally decided to take up coaching in 2000. “In 1997, I took a break for three years after I conceived my first child. It was during these years I decided to become a coach,” she says. Bunday specialises in various types of skating events - artistic (solo and pairs), freestyle and figures. She co-coached the winners of the pairs competition in the 2014 Junior World Championships, Reus, Spain. 
In Visakhapatnam, she is training in two sessions — 5.30 am to 10 am and 5.30 pm to 10 pm. During these sessions, Bunday’s primary objective is to work on basic elements so that the execution is right. She says, “I work on the attitude of the athletes while coaching.” After few minutes of warming-up, the skaters perform drills which test their stance and body posture. Bunday feels, “Going forward the popularity of artistic roller skating will only increase.”

Chitra wins World Women’s Senior Snooker title
","Chitra Magimairaj and Umadevi Nagraj were to lead the Indian challenge at World Ladies Billiards and Snooker Association’s (WLBSA) 13-nation Championship to be held at Leeds, England. After a fine run in the first three days, both of them had to bow out of the ladies snooker event.
Chitra however came up with a strong performance in the senior category, winning the World Women’s Senior Snooker title eventually. Umadevi, former champion in the World Billiards Championship, came agonisingly close once again, losing in the final to local favourite Emma Booney.
Pankaj Advani, meanwhile, feels that snooker needs to move out of the UK if Asian players are to have a level playing field.

World junior squash championship: no stopping the Egyptians ","For those rooting for a non-Egyptian, Lucy Termel was the lone hope in World junior squash championships. But it was not to be as Hania El Hammamy, seeded two, tamed Termel 11-6, 8-11, 11-4, 11-4 in the girls’ semfinals in what was the last match of the day at the Express Avenue Mall here on Sunday.
In the summit clash, Hammamy will take on another Egyptian, top seed Rowan Reda Araby, who was ruthless in her 11-5, 13-11, 11-6 demolition of Jana Shiha.
Shiha, a competent player with excellent control over her shots, came a cropper against the top seed. Araby dominated Shiha from the backcourt for the most part.
It will be an all-Egypt final in the boys’ category as well with Marwan Tarek, the top seed, taking on Mostafa Asal, the second seed.
Tarek had to dig deep to outwit Omar El Torkey 11-9, 6-11, 11-8, 2-11, 11-8 in a tie that lasted an hour and 32 minutes. Asal showed his class in ample measure to defeat Mostafa El Serty 11-3, 11-7, 11-7 in the other semifinal.
Possessing a similar-type of game, the match between Tarek and El Torkey had long rallies. Each played for the other to get tired or commit mistakes.
It was not an engrossing match one bit as the pace was slow and sometimes the rallies tended to be never-ending.
The fifth game and the decider had its interesting moments, though. Leading 3-2, El Torkey took a medical break to treat his ankle. Coming back, he took an 8-4 lead, and was looking like he would sew up the match in no time. 
But Tarek had other ideas. Pushing El Torkey around the court, Tarek had the upper hand in most of the rallies. No wonder, he took the next seven points to win the match.
There was a minor interruption in the first game when lights went off inside the glass court for around 20 minutes. Leading 4-2, when the stoppage happened, the 18-year-old World No.1 didn’t let it affect his rhythm.
Asal will be the favourite going into the final against Tarek. No doubt, Tarek will be no pushover given his patience and shot selection. Given the explosive power of Asal, his energy, resilience and the variety of strokes, it may be difficult for the top seed to retain his title.
The results (Semifinals): Boys: 1-Marwan Tarek (Egy) bt 3/4-Omar El Torkey (Egy) 11-9, 6-11, 11-8, 2-11, 11-8; 2-Mostafa Asal (Egy) bt 3/4-Mostafa El Serty (Egy) 11-3, 11-7, 11-7.
Girls: 1-Rowan Reda Araby (Eng) bt 5/8-Jana Shiha (Egy) 11-5, 13-11, 11-6; 2-Hania El Hammamy (Egy) bt 3/4-Lucy Termel (Eng) 11-6, 8-11, 11-4, 11-4.

Sindhu sails into the final
","Favourite P. V. Sindhu produced a scintillating exhibition of controlled stroke-play to win the opening game 21-13 in 20 minutes against former World champion Ratchanok Intanon in the second semifinal of the $350,000 India Open badminton here Saturday.
Taking the court at 10 p.m. in what was the last fixture of the eight-match card on the TV court, Sindhu lost the first two points but then reeled off 12 points on the trot to lead 13-3. The 10-point lead provided enough cushion for Sindhu to stay in control.
Sindhu’s cross-court smashes and deft touches at the net kept Intanon guessing. Sindhu, who won her previous encounter against the Thai girl last year to bring her head-to-head record to 2-4, showed some exceptional anticipation.
However, owing to the poor scheduling of the semifinals, the exhausted winner of Sindhu-Intanon match will take on a well-rested Beiwen Zhang in Sunday’s final.
Unlike Zhang, who finished her match four hours the start of the second semifinal, Sindhu or Intanon were bound to get far less time to recover.
The 11th-ranked Zhang, seeded five, battled for 63 minutes to overcome sixth seed Cheung Ngan Yi 14-21, 21-12, 21-19. Zhang got her game together in the second game and carried on the momentum to hold four match-points in the decider. But the Hong Kong girl valiantly saved three match-points before she missed a dribble from Zhang.
The men final will offer third seed Chen Tien Chen an opportunity to do one better than he did last year. The Chinese Taipei player, runner-up to Viktor Axelsen here in the last edition, overcame unseeded Chinese Qiao Bin 23-21, 21-16. In the title-match, he faces another fourth seeded Chinese Shi Yuqi.
The 2017 All England runner-up Shi Yuqi needed 69 minutes to end the dream run of World No. 86 Iskandar Zulkarnain 18-21, 21-10, 21-19. The Malaysian, the back-to-back conqueror of second seed B. Srikanth and Sameer Verma, held a 16-12 lead in the decider before the eighth-ranked Shi Yuqi’s relentless attack finally found a way through his defences.
In fact, the point of the match came when Shi Yuqi held two match-poitns at 20-18. In a 42-shot rally, Zulkarnain came out stronger after the Chinese netted a forehand. However, off the next point, the match stood decided when Zulkarnain misjudged the flight of the shuttle that fell ‘in’.
In mixed doubles, the lone Indian pair of eighth seed Pranav Chopra and N. Sikky Reddy lost in straight games to their higher-ranked Danish rivals.
The results: (semifinals, prefix denotes seeding): Men singles: 3-Chen Tien Chen (Tpe) bt Qiao Bin (Chn) 23-21, 21-16; 4-Shi Yuqi (Chn) bt Iskandar Zulkarnain (Mal) 18-21, 21-10, 21-19.
Women singles: 1-P. V. Sindhu leads Ratchanok Intanon (Tha) 21-13, 6-5; 5-Beiwen Zhang (USA) bt 6-Cheung Ngan Yi (Hkg) 14-21, 21-12, 21-19.
Men doubles: 1-Marcus Fernaldi Gideon and Kevin Sanjaya Sukamuljo (Ina) bt Mohammad Ahsan and Hendra Setiawan (Ina) 21-11, 21-16; 4-Kim Astrup and Anders Skaaru Rasmussen (Den) bt Han Chengkai and Zhou Haodong (Chn) 21-19, 21-14.
Women doubles: 3-Greysia Polii and Apriyani Rahayu (Ina) bt 1-Kamilla Rytter Juhl and Christinna Pedersen (Den) 21-14, 19-21, 21-18; 2-Jongkolphan Kititharakul and Rawinda Prajongjai (Tha) bt Du Yue and Li Yinhui (Chn) 21-19, 21-17.
Mixed doubles: Praveen Jordan and Melati Daeva Oktavianti (Ina) bt 6-He Jiting and Du Yue (Chn) 21-19, 24-22; 5-Mathias Christiansen and Christinna Pedersen (Den) bt Pranav Chopra and Sikki Reddy 21-16, 21-19.
