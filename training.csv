Bring on the laughs "," A dash of stand up comedy, lots of improvisation, and a ton of audience interaction. These are what the performers have promised to give Bengaluru tonight at a marquee show, organised as part of Black Dog Easy Evenings. The event brings together the talents of Papa CJ, Cyrus Sahukar, Danish Sait and The Improv, hosted by Saad Khan. 




After shows in Delhi and Hyderabad, the performers are in our city tonight and the act promises much variety, with a stand up set by Papa CJ followed by improv comedy by The Improv, where Sahukar joins Sait, Anil Abraham, Darius Sunawala and Khan for on-the-spot shenanigans with some assistance from the audience. “Beware the front row,” CJ warns light-heartedly. 
For Khan, who is a veteran at Improv, having started The Improv group six years ago and having Sahukar and CJ on board has been good fun. “Cyrus comes from a crazy history of comedy, and he has been at it for the longest time. CJ also joins us for a couple of scenes, and both these guys are naturals. Cyrus, like Danish, is great at characters, and when you have characters the scene is automatically elevated from just punchlines to the journey of a story.”




The mutual camaraderie is something all the performers enjoy. “Stand up can be lonely because you tend to write and perform alone, so it was a refreshing change to work with the others,” says CJ, a sentiment Sahukar echoes, “Improv is not about the individual. If you enjoy making it about yourself then you should not do it. I think as human beings, if you are part of a collective, you just feel better about performing.” 
The unpredictability of Improv is part of what makes if fun, feels Sait. “To be honest, neither us nor the audience know what we are running into. There are many unknowns, but then a magic happens, it all comes together and in the end we have a known. Improv gets better with time, because the craft gets better but the stage remains the same. It is great to be performing with others who are happy in their own space and no one is trying to outdo each other.”




Sahukar mentions that the format of the show lets the performers unwind and be themselves. “I enjoy the feeling of uncertainty and assured failure. You are going to mess up somewhere for sure and that is part of the fun. You never have the same show twice and you and the audience all become apart of one big act.” He confirms that his strength at playing characters has helped in improv. “Not being myself has worked out pretty well,” he laughs.
Performing in Bengaluru, which is essentially home turf for half the team, has the whole act geared up. “Bengaluru is a city I come to a lot,” says Sahukar, “And we have never had an empty show. People here just have an interest in variety and turn up no matter what.”
The Black Dog Easy Evenings marquee show will be held on August 24 at UB City at 8 pm, before heading to Mumbai tomorrow and Kolkata on September 21.

Sensation Rise 2018: Rise for the city and for rhythm
","They say you never forget your first. Tri-city music festival Sensation can apply this concept too. Set to light up Gachibowli and to send the ground throbbing with unbelievable bass courtesy the 30,000 attendees and the line-up of artistes such as Mr White, Robin Schulz, Nicky Romero and more, October 27 is a date for EDM-lovers’ calenders. 
“Sensation is a festival that is deep-rooted in feelings and spirits, which are the very factors that differentiate the spectacle from the others around,” explains AB InBev marketing director Kartikeya Sharma, “[the festival] is celebrated for uniting fans in a surreal manner, creating waves of togetherness and euphoria. At Budweiser, we believe in authenticity and freedom, the two pillars of all our synergies and associations which works to create a memorable experience beyond just the ordinary, for everyone.”
Past themes of Sensation in Hyderabad have included ‘Welcome to the Pleasuredome’, ‘Source of Light’, ‘Innerspace’ and ‘Wicked Wonderland.’ While these all sound and have proven to be incredibly immersive and eye-catching, this year’s theme, ‘Rise’ has more socio-political grounding, but not overly so. Conflict, dissent and other energies of negativity are the antithesis of what Sensation Rise aims to pursue and that’s where Rise comes in. 




“The very foundation of the festival is a celebration of freedom and rebirth, liberating fans to unleash the best of themselves, in a unanimous and harmonious manner. The aura and atmosphere brew a vibe of togetherness, ensuring that the diverse fans feel part of the larger experience, irrespective of their backgrounds and origins... We live in a day and age where every minute, consumers are bombarded with multiple messages through multiple platforms. By the end of it, only the distinct and discerning mediums manage to make a mark in memory, which is especially true for millennials today. Experiences are growing to be an extremely important part of the marketing mix for brands, considering it is the only platform that allows for close and sustained interaction with the consumer.”




Budweiser is on board for their second year (their first being in 2016) with Sensation and the team is all geared up to bring their A-game. “ (Budweiser) always aims to go above and beyond and provide the most differentiated experiences; this year with Sensation Rise it will be no different. We will be offering the best of hospitality to our guests by bringing to the city the signature ‘Bud Hotel’ concept... We are curating a special zone: ‘The Budweiser Maze’ which is an immersive engagement zone wherein festival-goers can also get their hands on customized merchandise. The Sensation experience will then continue at the Bud Hotel, where we are hosting an exclusive after party for the artists and fans.” So clearly, the party never stops — nor should it. 
And of course, one has to keep in mind that safety is a priority. Sensation Rise 2018 is going to take place at Gachibowli stadium, keeping in mind the mammoth size of the event. Predictably, an event of this scale also entails a lot of planning, hard work and security which the collaborative teams are extensively working on, to provide for a great festival experience.

The Beatles in India
"," It was in the year 1968 when the Beatles were spending time away from the limelight, to learn and practice transcendental meditation by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. It was by pure chance that budding photographer and filmmaker Paul Saltzman stumbled upon the Beatles living in an ashram in Rishikesh, when he’d actually arrived there to mend his broken heart through the medium of meditation. 
Speaking to The Hindu, Saltzman recalls, “I stopped thinking of them as The Beatles within 30 seconds of meeting and talking to them. Kind of magically, the Beatles went away and they were just these people I was sitting with. I never even thought of asking for a picture or autographs! For a week, we were buddies. I could’ve taken lots of fun photos, but I asked each of them privately, if they’d mind me taking pictures and they said, “Go right ahead!””
After spending 11 days at the ashram, Saltzman went back to Toronto, published a few photographs of the renowned musicians, wrote an article about meditation and put away the pictures in a cardboard box. Thirty years later, it was his daughter, Devyani, a Beatles’ fan, who made him dig up those old prints, which eventually featured in Saltzman’s book, The Beatles In India. 
Avid Learning Institute, Consulate General of Canada in Mumbai and ICIA Gallery will be hosting an exhibition of the photographs and a conversation on ‘Beatlemania: Capturing Subcultures through the Lens’ between the filmmaker and photographer and art critic and curator Girish Shahane. 
About the talk Shahane said, “It will be about how he came to Rishikesh, his interactions with the Beatles, the life of the photographs after he’d taken them and how India became important in a particular way to the world. The cultural aspect of Indian history became important to the hippie movement and the legacy of that movement in the present time. The major impact of the Beatles on India was through their interest in India, which then became an interest that many of their fans shared. The important thing is what the Beatles did for India in terms of its connection with the rest of the world.”
Saltzman also said, “We will talk very broadly about the concept of photography documenting subcultures. I didn’t set out to document anything [in 1968]. I was not a photographer. I was starting to be a filmmaker but I was at the very beginning of my career. For me, photography and filmmaking has always been about experiencing what I’m in the middle of. My love of taking pictures and making movies is really about human being as opposed to subcultures. ‘Documenting subcultures’ is what somebody can label it, in retrospect. 
Some people do that brilliantly, filmmakers and photographers, who specifically want to do document for a purpose but that’s not my way. My passion is to become more conscious as a photographer and filmmaker, to become more compassionate, to have greater empathy and not just for others, but for myself.”
The Beatles in India will be on exhibition from this evening until September 22 at ICIA Gallery, Kala Ghoda; this evening attend a talk between Paul Saltzman and Girish Shahane at 6 p.m. at the same venue.

Netflix renews Sacred Games for a second season
","Sacred Games, Netflix’s first original Indian show, has been renewed for a second season.
Based on author Vikram Chandra’s best-selling novel, season two of the show, set in Mumbai’s underbelly, will feature more of the characters we fell in love with.
The second season picks up from Sartaj Singh (Saif Ali Khan) pursuing his relentless battle of saving the city and Ganesh Gaitonde (Nawazuddin Siddiqui) facing bigger challenges to retain his position as the legendary kingpin of Mumbai.
The intriguing Guruji (Pankaj Tripathi), introduced in season one as Gaitonde’s ‘third father,’ plays a pivotal role in unfolding a chain of events that shape the next season — which is scheduled to film in India and locations overseas this fall.
Filmmaker Anurag Kashyap will continue directing Ganesh Gaitonde’s track, while Neeraj Ghaywan (of Masaan fame) will take over Sartaj Singh’s plot. Vikramaditya Motwane and Varun Grover will continue their roles of being the showrunner and the lead writer respectively, according to a statement from the entertainment service.

Raj Kapoor’s iconic RK Studio up for sale
"," Actor-filmmaker Raj Kapoor’s RK studio is up for sale — 70 years after it was established — as it is not “economically viable” to rebuild it after it was gutted in a fire last year, says the late actor’s elder son, Randhir Kapoor .
 Founded by Raj Kapoor in 1948 in suburban Chembur, the studio witnessed several films made by the Kapoor family over the decades. 
On September 16 last year, a major fire broke out on the sets of dance reality show ‘Super Dancer’ at the studio in which its ground floor was gutted. No casualty was reported in the mishap.
While actor Rishi Kapoor had earlier expressed a desire to rebuild the studio with “state-of-the-art technology,” his brother Randhir said it was not practical.
“Yes, we have taken the decision to sell RK Studio. It is already up for sale. After the fire, it is not viable to build the studio again,” Randhir said.
 The films made under the RK banner include Aag, Barsaat, Awaara, Shri 420, Jis Desh Mein Ganga Behti Hai, Mera Naam Joker, Bobby, Satyam Shivam Sundaram, Ram Teri Ganga Maili, among others. 
The last film made under the banner was the Rishi Kapoor-directed Aa Ab Laut Chalen.
When Raj Kapoor passed away in 1988, Randhir took over the studio. Later, his younger brother Rajiv Kapoor directed Prem Granth.

The Crown: Netflix releases first look at Olivia Colman as Queen Elizabeth II
","Netflix on Monday unveiled the first image of actor Olivia Colman as Queen Elizabeth II in the third season of the hit series The Crown.
The photo shows Colman at the breakfast table, with a cup of tea.
Colman will play the role of Queen Elizabeth II for the third and fourth seasons of the show, which will showcase the queen’s middle years during Harold Wilson’s time as the British Prime Minister and Princess Margaret’s five-year affair with Roddy Llewellyn, who was nearly two decades younger than her. The show is also set to cover Prince Charles’ marriage to Princess Diana and his subsequent affair with Camilla Parker-Bowles — now the Duchess of Cornwall — and the Margaret Thatcher era.
Colman is replacing actor Claire Foy, who played the queen in her younger years, from coronation through the Suez Canal crisis. Helena Bonham Carter will play Princess Margaret in seasons three and four, replacing Vanessa Kirby.
Colman will be accompanied by Game of Thrones and Outlander alum Tobias Menzies as Prince Phillip, replacing Doctor Who actor Matt Smith. Marvel actor Paul Bettany was earlier slated to play the role, but he bowed out as he was “unable to commit” to the show because of the eight-month-long shooting schedule, according to Vanity Fair.
Season three of The Crown is set to premiere in 2019.

All the President’s men "," When it’s winter in Lutyens’ Delhi, you’ll hear the sound of hooves on Willingdon Crescent. The mist lifts a little to reveal men on horseback in jodhpurs and maroon turrahs slip quietly into the vastness of the Presidential Estate. On Republic Day, these men, in rich ceremonial uniforms and gold braid, lead the parade escorting the Presidential cavalcade, their lanced pennants fluttering in the breeze. Who are these men that make up this elite force protecting the President of India and guarding a 245-year-old legacy that dates back to the early years of the Indian Army?
National Geographic’s The President’s Bodyguard throws the spotlight on the history and workings of the household cavalry regiment, the senior-most in the order of precedence among the units in the Indian Army. Raised in 1773 by Governor-General Warren Hastings, the President’s Bodyguard was, in its early years, composed of Mughal troopers. By the time it took on its present nomenclature in 1950, it had distinguished itself in various battles such as the Burmese wars, Sikh wars and the Java campaign — the last, a battle honour it carries to this day. Today, the unit ethnically composed of men from Haryana, Punjab and Rajasthan has been part of UN peacekeeping missions and risen to the defence of Chushul in the 1962 Sino-Indian War.
Commenting on the documentary, President of India Ram Nath Kovind says, “Ceremonial occasions like the Republic Day parade, oath-taking ceremony of a new President, or receiving a visiting head of state, are watched keenly in India and abroad. The President’s Bodyguard displays the best traditions of discipline and skills of our Armed Forces. These are untiring, dedicated and brave soldiers — as good as the best in the world. I am very proud of them.”
The documentary explores the lives of these men as part of a mounted, ceremonial unit as well as in combat roles — all personnel are trained as paratroopers. It delves into their regimental history, mirrored in their dress uniforms — among the few remaining in the world to wear napoleon boots. Since they escort and protect the President, the unit is based in Rashtrapati Bhavan, its high-vaulted stables home to horses and the vast acres practice grounds for tent-pegging. A farrier is part of the unit and the bay mounts of the PBG are allowed to wear full manes; only the regimental trumpeter has a grey charger. 
All these fascinating facts will be heard in Amitabh Bachchan’s rich baritone, who says, “The film will take viewers a step closer to the history and heritage of one of the oldest cavalry units of our homeland.”
The film premieres on NGC at 9 pm on August 15. The documentary will also be available on Hotstar.
To the last bugle call
When Partition was announced, the most remarkable division of household goods took place in the stables of the Viceroy’s House, now Rashtrapathi Bhavan. The 12-horse-drawn carriages had ornate emblems, glittering harnesses and scarlet cushions that had been put to use every time a Viceroy paraded through the capital. When it was time to divide them, Lord Mountbatten’s ADC, Lieutenant Commander Peter Howes, decided that India and Pakistan would toss for who would get the six formal state carriages in gold and the six semi-formal state carriages in silver. When the coin clattered onto the stable yard, India got to keep the gold carriages. Howes divided the harnesses, whips, boots and uniforms of the Viceroy’s Bodyguards that went with each set of carriages. In the end only one item — the ceremonial horn used by the coachmen — remained. Knowing it was of no use if broken in two, Howes decided to keep it. Howes went on to become a Rear Admiral and the horn found pride of place in his living room.

‘I didn’t expect Soorya to become a movement in itself’: Soorya Krishnamoorthy
"," 
When Nataraja Krishnamoorthy, whom the world knows as Soorya Krishnamoorthy, decided to convert 15 cents of his family property into a performance space for artistes, free of cost, inclusive of facilities such as light and sound equipment, many of his well-wishers objected. But he wasn’t dissuaded. Krishnamoorthy said, he “was giving back to the society that had given him so much”. He was confident that it would succeed. And it did, like many other artistic and cultural initiatives that this cultural activist has introduced in Kerala over the last 42 years under Soorya, said to be the largest cultural society in the world, and in his capacity as the head of many cultural organisations in the State.
Today, ‘Ganesham’, near Thycaud in the capital city, is a unique cultural centre. The venue, more like an extension of his tastefully-done home, Sooryachaithanya, has a 400-seater black box theatre. The space also has two open-air auditoriums, a green room, a dormitory for artistes and a gallery for artists to display their work, all without any fees.
“The kalvilakku at the entrance of Ganesham is lit on days we have programmes. And it has been lit on not less than 90 of the 180-plus days since it was officially opened six months ago. Some events ran to full houses, there were plays that had repeat shows and so on,” says 67-year-old Krishnamoorthy, a former engineer with the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO).
What triggered the concept was his own journey as an artiste and art connoisseur. “I know the challenges and hurdles faced by artistes and those involved in staging shows. This space is for all those talents who need a stage. The shows are ticketed and the artiste(s) can take home the collection. Many drama troupes have recovered their initial expenditure after two presentations. That’s exactly what I wanted. All performances go through a screening process before they are staged because this is a centre for serious artistes and genuine art lovers,” he says.
This was a path he had never envisaged when he formed Soorya as a film society with a handful of like-minded individuals. He was then working in the ISRO along with people such as former president APJ Abdul Kalam and scientists like PN Subramaniam and CR Sathya. “They were art lovers and among the founders of Soorya. After 27 years, I took voluntary retirement from ISRO with the mission of taking art and culture to the common man. Chitralekha Film Society, the first film society in Kerala launched by Adoor Gopalakrishnan, had introduced me to good cinema by then. When it became defunct after Adoor’s resignation, our aim was to take good cinema to the people and ensure participation of women, especially homemakers, through Soorya. But I didn’t expect it to become a movement in itself. We could bring in the best artistes and also give a platform for many budding talents who went on to become established names in their field,” he says.




Cinema, classical dance forms, theatre, Carnatic music, ghazals, painting exhibitions, photography workshops, literature, children’s theatre, folk art, talk festival... Soorya has it all in its 111-day festival held at various venues in Thiruvananthapuram till Ganesham came into the picture. “With chapters in 38 countries, we have at least one programme every day in some part of the world, thus making it a 365-day festival,” he says.
Ask him how he keeps the show going, and Krishnamoorthy says, “It’s by god’s grace and because of my amazing team. Except for three individuals who passed away, those who have been associated with Soorya since its inception are still attached to it. We don’t have an office or paid staff. Instead, there is a 10-member core team who toil hard. I take care of everything, including arranging the artistes, till two days prior to the beginning of the festival. After that, I distribute the work among the team members and give them the authority to take the final decision in case of any crisis. I trust my team and the members have never let me down,” he says.
In between, he is busy scripting and directing plays and conceptualising mega shows. “Because art has always been an outlet for my sorrows. If it was poet Sugathakumari, my foster mother, who instilled in me the love for Malayalam language, I took to art to give vent to my pain. This is why you won’t find entertainment in my productions,” he smiles.
He is now working on his 100th production, ‘Thrayambakam’, a mega stage show to be staged on December 2. Krishnamoorthy says that he has no apprehensions about Soorya’s future. “There are trained youngsters to take it forward. This has to go on. My only prayer is that I don’t end up compromising on my art. I don’t want to sell something that god has gifted me, ” he signs off.
Conditions apply
* All programmes of Soorya start at 6.45 pm. “Our office hours at ISRO, located in Thumba, was till 5.30 pm and by the time we reached the city it was 6.15 pm. So 6.45 pm was fixed as a convenient time to begin the programmes and we didn’t change that.” But Krishnamoorthy doesn’t wear a watch, a habit he picked up from his father, T Nataraja Pillai.
* Soorya’s programmes are not ticketed and follow a membership system. The gate closes by 6.45 pm and will be reopened only at 8 pm or at the end of the programme, depending on the duration of the performance. If you are a non-member, you can enter by 6.40 pm, after the members have been seated.
Memories unplugged
* It was at MS Subbulakshmi’s residence in Chennai that the idea of the Soorya festival was born. In addition to the legend and Krishnamoorthy, the meeting was attended by KJ Yesudas, Padma Subramanyam and mridangam maestro Mavelikkara Krishnankutty Nair. “They all promised to perform every year. Yesudas has not missed a year till now; Padma Subrahmanyam performed for 35 years; Krishnankutty Nair was a regular at Yesudas’ concerts for many years. MS performed only once,” he remembers.
* October 1 is reserved for Yesudas. That had to be changed just once because he had to perform in Australia on that day. “I was moved that he took my permission before he agreed to it.”
Milestones
* A pioneer of light and sound shows, Krishnamoorthy’s first such production was ‘Thamasoma Jyothirgamaya’, based on temples, rituals and temple art forms. He has directed over 40 shows. As a playwright and theatre director, his most notable work is Melvilasam, which has completed 400 stages. His ‘Chayakkadakathakal’ is a series of plays with the same characters
* His house is home to Ganesha, as you find here idols, paintings, curios and sculptures of the deity. Every Vinayaka Chaturthi, the door is open for the public to see the collection.
Personal touch
* Krishnamoorthy always spots a cap, a habit he picked up eight years ago. “As I began losing my hair, I was advised to wear a cap to protect the scalp from the glare of the arclights. I started wearing it during rehearsals and that habit stayed on. Also I wear only black trousers and white shoes.”
* He was first addressed as ‘Soorya Krishnamoorthy’ by his daughter, Seetha. “She was in her primary class then. One day she got so upset with me that she angrily called me, ‘Soorya Krishnamoorthy’. That became official when friends and media started using it.”

Forbes list: Akshay Kumar world’s 7th highest-paid actor, Salman Khan in 9th place "," Akshay Kumar has emerged as the seventh highest-paid actor in the world by earning USD 40.5 million in 2018, according to Forbes magazine.
The “Gold” actor is closely followed by his contemporary Salman Khan in the ninth place, raking in USD 38.5 million.
Kumar and Khan are the only two Bollywood actors to make it to the top 10 highest-paid actors list, compiled by the publication.
 Kumar, who came in 10th last year, upped his game by USD 3 million. Khan stayed at his ninth rank, but with an increase of USD 1.5 million this year. Shah Rukh Khan, who was at the eighth spot on the 2017 list, did not find a place in 2018. 
The list has been topped by Hollywood star George Clooney, who scored a career-high pre-tax paycheque of USD 239 million between June 1, 2017 and June 1, 2018. Clooney was followed by Dwayne Johnson, who banked USD 124 million pretax to rank. 
“Avengers: Infinity War” star Robert Downey Jr, earned USD 81 million to book the third place. His co-star, Chris Hemsworth came in at number four with USD 64.5 million earnings.
 The combined earnings of world’s 10 highest-paid actors come at a total USD 748.5 million between June 1, 2017, and June 1, 2018, before fees and taxes.

Thrilling and moving ","Julia Roberts has been entertaining the movie audiences for three decades now. For the first time in her career, she has stepped into the world of television as part of the main cast for Amazon Prime’s Homecoming. She has previously guest-starred in several shows, but, her role in the new thriller series marks a diametric shift, as leading Hollywood stars are looking to open their doors to let the breeze of the small screen envelope them.
Earlier this year, we saw Amy Adams slip into the shoes of Camille Preaker in HBO’s Sharp Objects; and, in Homecoming, similarly, Roberts stands in the center, with every character designed to move around her. She plays a counselor, named Heidi Bergman, who helps soldiers get back on the plane of civilian life. Her charming smile is used to its fullest extent as she wears it readily during her conversations with her patient-turned-friend Walter Cruz (Stephan James). Cruz also has a smile, which transitions from handsome to playful, and, it’s a delight to watch these two actors talk about road trips that they might take in the future.
Homecoming is divided between two periods – one, in 2018, where Bergman is settling into her job as a counselor at the homecoming facility, and, the second one in 2022, where she’s working as a waitress at a diner. While the 2018 portions are shot in the widescreen aspect ratio, the latter is boxed in a square as a visual metaphor since Bergman can’t remember much about her days as a counsellor. Her incapacitated view of what’s happening around her is presented on-screen in this amusing manner.
In the initial episodes, when Shrier (Jeremy Allen White), a soldier and Cruz’s roommate, argues that the programme is a scam, we don’t believe him. What could a bunch of soft-spoken people do to soldiers, after all? And, in the same way, when a bureaucrat (Shea Whigham as Thomas Carrasco) from the Department of Defense asks Bergman if she knows Cruz, outside the diner, she answers in the negative. At this point, we don’t know, like Shrier and Carrasco, what’s true and what’s not.
These nifty elements add to the intriguing nature of the series. Homecoming is based on the fiction podcast of the same name by Eli Horowitz and Micah Bloomberg, and all the half-hour episodes of the first season are directed by Sam Esmail (the creator of Mr. Robot). The season ends on a hopeful note, albeit with a bleak twist, and I’m waiting to see what the mega heads behind this carefully crafted show are going to bring us in season two.
Carrasco, in particular, as an employee at an organisation that doesn’t recognize his skills, took my heart. He stops by at the diner to follow up on an anonymous complaint that’s lodged against the homecoming facility. From there on, you can see how patient and invisible he acts. Whigham plays him, with a sense of confidence, and not with a sorry face, even though he’s constantly made to feel small by his boss as she brings up his position in the office. In one of the last few episodes, he gets a chance to lose his temper and yell at Colin Belfast (Bobby Cannavale), Bergman’s former boss, as he gets ridicules by him for simply doing his job. But, Carrasco’s hard face doesn’t show any emotion and he stands there as if he’s turning a deaf ear.
Homecoming reminded me of Adrian Lyne’s Jacob's Ladder and Michel Gondry’s Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind for different reasons – Jacob’s Ladder deals with soldiers and their traumas; whereasEternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind digs deeper into what some people want to hold on to, and what they want to let go of. These two brilliantly written films may have inspired the creators of Homecoming, but Horowitz and Bloomberg have their own take on how certain factors of science fiction can scare the living daylights out of us.

Don’t feel defined by ‘The Crown’ role, says Claire Foy "," ACtor Claire Foy says she does not feel that she is defined by the role of Queen Elizabeth II in The Crown.
The 34-year-old actor shot to global fame after playing the monarch in the Netflix royal drama for two seasons.
 She says though the role was an “honour” for her, she was not trying to actively break the mould.
“I don’t feel like I’m defined by playing Queen Elizabeth. It’s a huge honour that people liked that character and therefore see me as that character. So, I’m not trying to actively go against that,” Foy, who will be replaced by Olivia Colman as the Queen in the next two seasons, told People magazine.
 The actor, whose latest release was The Girl in the Spider’s Web, says she is selfish in her career choices.
“My career is only for me, really. I can’t do it for anybody else and so the choices and decisions I make are purely based on what I want to do. That’s it really. It’s a really selfish thing,” she says.

‘Facts of Life’ star Charlotte Rae dies at 92 "," Charlotte Rae, who played a wise and patient housemother to a brood of teenage girls on the long-running sitcom The Facts of Life during a career that encompassed many other TV roles as well as stage and film appearances, died on Sunday. She was 92. 
Rae died at her Los Angeles home with her family at her side, said her publicist, Harlan Boll. The cause of death was not immediately available, but Rae was diagnosed last year with bone cancer after beating pancreatic cancer, Boll said. 
She originated the character of Mrs. Garrett in 1978 during the first season of NBC’s comedy Diff’rent Strokes, then took Mrs. Garrett with her for the spinoff Facts, which premiered the following season. 
Initially set at a girls’ boarding school, that NBC series ran for nine seasons. Rae left after its seventh year, however, explaining later, “I needed some time for the rest of my life.” 
The Facts role came to Rae after years of theater and television performances. She earned an Emmy nomination for the part, and she was a two-time Tony nominee for her work on Broadway. 
Mindy Cohn and Kim Fields, who played members of Mrs. Garrett’s brood, recalled her lovingly. 
“She was my champion, a teacher, a proud example of the tenacity and perseverance needed to live as a creative, along with your talent and gifts. i love you char,” Cohn, who played Natalie, posted on Instagram. 
“Sorry, no words at the moment just love and tears... and yeah, smiles,” tweeted Fields, who portrayed Tootie. 
Tony Award-winning actress Audra McDonald tweeted- “She was so sweet, funny, wise, lovely, and brilliant. She will be so missed. Rest In Peace Sweet Charlotte Rae.” 
Todd Bridges, who was on Diff’rent Strokes, said on Twitter that she was beloved by all her colleagues and that the show “would not have been the same without you.” 
Edna Garrett provided kind if sometimes wry counsel to her Facts of Life charges (which, besides Cohn and Fields, included Lisa Whelchel, Nancy McKeon and Molly Ringwald) on a series that was praised for dealing with such sensitive issues of teenhood as sex, drug use, eating disorders and peer pressure. 
“I wanted to bring in as much humanity as possible, as well as the humor,” Rae told The Associated Press early in the show’s run. “I don’t want her to be Polly Perfect, because she must have human failings and make mistakes.” 
Entry into Broadway
Born Charlotte Rae Lubotsky in Milwaukee, on April 22, 1926, she had studied drama at Northwestern University, then moved to New York where, despite early plans to be a “serious” actress, she quickly found work doing satirical sketches in Greenwich Village clubs. 
It was there that Broadway producers, who frequented such bistros, discovered her, leading to her first Broadway musical, called Three Wishes for Jamie, in 1952. A few years later, she originated the srole of Mammy Yokum in the Broadway musical Li’l Abner. 
Rae made numerous TV appearances in 1950s drama anthologies including The U.S. Steel Hour, Playhouse 90 and Armstrong Circle Theater, sharing the black-and-white screen with such actors as Zero Mostel, Art Carney and Gertrude Berg. 
In 1961 she became a semi-regular on the New York-based cop sitcom Car 54, Where Are You? as the wife of the NYPD officer played by future Munsters grandpa Al Lewis. 
She received Tony nominations in 1966 for Pickwick and in 1969 for Morning, Noon and Night. 
In the early 1970s, Rae moved to Los Angeles with her then-husband, composer and music editor John Strauss, and their sons Andy and Larry. There she was cast in the short-lived Norman Lear sitcom Hot L Baltimore and a similarly unsuccessful variety show hosted by Rich Little before scoring Diff’rent Strokes, on which Mrs. Garrett was the family’s housekeeper. 
Rae stayed busy with film and stage appearances, including 1971’s Bananas from Woody Allen and 1979’s Hair. Other credits included the 2008 comedy You Don’t Mess with the Zohan and the 2012 thriller Love Sick Love. 
In 2005, at age 79, she appeared in a new comedy, Leading Ladies, at Ford’s Theater in Washington. 
In 2013, Rae went public with an account of why her marriage to Strauss had ended in the mid-1970s after a quarter-century. She said he disclosed to her he was bisexual and wanted an open marriage. Strauss died in 2011. 
In addition to son Larry, she is survived by sister Miriam Guten and three grandchildren. 
Services were pending, Boll said.

An ode to creativity and friendship
","Satyajit Ray was recording the background score for Pather Panchali (Song Of The Road) with Pandit Ravi Shankar. The sitar maestro was totally involved in his work when Ray asked him to stop. An astonished Shankar stared at Ray as he asked Shankar to record only as much as required.
Shankar was astonished but never questioned Ray. He did exactly as he was asked too. The result was simply brilliant. The sitar counters during the monsoon rains in Pather Panchali sounded like a flowing rivulet. Restraint was the motto of Ray in every department of filmmaking including music. Shankar understood this very well and his rapport with Ray is legendary.
Way back in the 1940s, Ray saw Neechanagar and Dharti Ke Lal. He was fascinated by Ravi Shankar’s score in both films. The use of the sitar, country drums and flute during the climax of Neechanagar moved him. He made up his mind to work with Shankar if he ever directed a film.
His dream came true with Pather Panchali in 1955. So strong was their association right from their debut film that both worked together again in Aparajito, Apur Sansar and Paras Pathar with resounding success. Shankar read the script of Apu Trilogy a number of times and submitted himself totally to the filmmaker. In Ray, Ravi Shankar discovered a true creator, who understood the language of cinema.
Ray was not the proverbial dictator. His views at work were crystal clear. He never imposed himself on his artists, technicians or composers. Yet he never allowed any of his teammates to go overboard. Be it Ravi Shankar, Vilayat Khan or Ali Akbar Khan, Ray handled them with equal efficiency.
Though Shankar cannot be exactly termed Ray’s musical soul, like Maurice Jarr was of Sir David Lean’s, the Ray-Shankar combination created cinematic wonders acclaimed internationally. The usage of the bamboo flute created emotional waves in Aparajito while the sitar interludes in Paras Pathar had a comic but meaningful touch.
In the late 1950s, Ray decided to shoot a full-length documentary on Ravi Shankar. He prepared the script with the required sketches in his inimitable way. Ray for the first time used water colours for his drawings in the script of this documentary. Sadly, the documentary never went on floors.
Harper Collins, India in association with Satyajit Ray Society is publishing the script in a book form, Ray’s Ravi Shankar that will be released by the iconic actor Naseeruddin Shah at Kolkata on Ray’s birthday today (May 2) as he delivers the Satyajit Ray Memorial Lecture.
The original script and story board are intact making Ray’s Ravi Shankar a delight for readers of all ages. Just as Ravi Shankar was Ray’s, Ray was Ravi Shankar’s to the core.
Ray started composing for his films himself with Teen Kanya (
Three Daughters by Rabindranath Tagore) 1961 onward. Still he maintained his relationship with Shankar till the end of his life. So grieved was Ravi Shankar at Ray’s demise that he composed and created an exclusive album in his memory.

Lure of foreign lands
","The basic characteristics of Kewal Dhaliwal’s theatre are the intensity of emotions, imaginative use of draperies to create visual poetry and a scant décor to be in tune with the leitmotif of the play. The acting style he envisages for his actors is marked by a strong motive and vitality to establish an emotional chord with the audience.
These aspects were very much in evidence in his production of “Gaddi Charan Di Kaahal Bari Si” in Punjabi, a part of the Festival of Performing Arts featuring works of the recipients of Akademi awardees organised by the Sangeet Natak Akademi at Abhimanch in New Delhi recently. Remarkable for its focus on the plight of people who attempt to migrate illegally to make it big in foreign countries, the production has overpowering emotional appeal. At another level, it severely indicts the unscrupulous agents who trade in human miseries.
A graduate of National School of Drama and a committed theatre artist, Kewal has immensely contributed to the professional theatre movement in Punjab. He has received the Sangeet Natak Akademi Award 2013 for his contribution to Indian theatre as director.
Kewal has drawn the title of his play from the poetry of Surjit Patar, the renowned Punjabi poet, to symbolise the disillusioned young people in Punjab attempting to go to foreign countries by resorting to illegal means. In most cases, their quest turns out to be a chimera, culminating in eternal hell. With this central theme, Kewal has dramatised four short stories by significant Punjabi writers. To harmonise these different stories into an artistic whole, he has created the character of Sutradhar and between the changes of scenes Patar’s poetry rendered by a chorus to the accompaniment of beats of drum is used which enrich the emotional power of the production.
The play opens with the dramatic version of the short story “Sukh di Ghari” by Baldev Singh Dhinsa. Rotting in a German jail, the victim writes to his father back home, recounting his torturous journey from India to Germany as an illegal immigrant. He is transported from one place to another in a box to avoid being detected by the Police. He recalls the way a goat in his village is kept in a wide open box. His condition was worse than the goat. In this process, he has lost all his dignity and is worse than an animal — just a lifeless object.
The second story enacted is “Pailan Paunda Sap” by Jaswinder Singh. It depicts the shameless manner a husband is forcing his wife to stage a fake marriage ritual with another man to be able to secure her visit to the country in which he is working. Anguished with the conduct of her husband, the woman retaliates. The husband takes pride in adopting a modus operandi to outsmart immigration authorities. He is happy that his wife can leave the country with her fake husband. Through the encounter between, the husband and the wife, the petty mind of the husband and his shameless act is revealed as well as the dilemma of the wife who hates her husband.
Harpreet Sekha’s short story “Ram Gau” deals with the life of a headmaster in a village in Punjab who is respected by the villages and revered by his students. His voice has great weight in the affairs of the village. His family members are settled in Canada. Now that he has retired from service, he is invited by his kith and kin to stay with them in Canada. As soon as the initial excitement of living with his family members subsides, the headmaster is metamorphosed into a stray cow that nobody looks after, everyone shoos him away. Now the headmaster becomes desperate to leave Canada and return to his roots but nobody listens to him. He has lost his freedom, respect and friends; he is a lonely figure, lifeless.
The condition of women among the illegal immigrants are the worst. This heartbreaking reality is reflected in the dramatised version “Galat Aurat” by Veena Verma. The play revolves round an ambitious and beautiful girl who is educated and has dreams of marrying a well-placed and respected young man. Considering a young man working in a foreign country most suitable bridegroom for her daughter, her father marries her off to a Youngman settled abroad. After the marriage is solemnised, he stays for few days with the bride. During this brief period, the girl gets conceived and later gives birth to a male child. The husband leaves her with the promise that he would soon come back with the essential papers and would take her with him. But years have passed and he doesn’t return. Forced by circumstances, the woman leaves India with her son to meet her husband with forged documents. Facing hardships and indignities that are in store for illegal immigrants, she is subjected to rape by different men at difference places. By the time the brute and rapacious agents manage surreptitiously to arrange a meeting between her husband and herself, she is reduced to a miserable wreak. Her husband refuses to recognize her, leaving her in the lurch and be destroyed by wolves in the form of men.
Pavel Sandhu as the prisoner in a jail in Germany; Gurinder Makna as the headmaster migrated to Canada and Mandeep Kaur as the victim of unscrupulous agents desperate to meet her husband, impart to their portraits emotional depth and truly live their characters with riveting performances to grab the attention of the audience.

In a fantasy zone ","“I wouldn’t worry too much about the consequences. I choose to do whatever makes me happy.” This is Karishma Tanna’s response when asked if artists should alert and mindful of the social consequences of their art. Karishma has just returned to television serial space with Naagin 3 (Colors) and will now be seen in Qayamat Ki Raat on StarPlus. In the horror series, which is about a young couple and the ordeal they have to face because of a tantrik’s curse, Karishma plays the role of Gauri alongside Vivek Dahiya who plays her on screen partner. 
“I didn’t have to think too much before accepting the show because it is produced by Balaji, the place I had begun my journey from. I didn’t want to do a regular daily soap and Qayamat provided just the opportunity. It is a bi-weekly show where you can’t afford to drag the storyline.” 
A huge fan of horror genre, Karishma lists Chucky and The Exorcist amongst her favourites. She feels that after a really long time a good fantasy thriller is being narrated on the small screen and is hopeful about a positive reception. Inspired by the Ramsay style of horror, international make-up artists have been roped in to employ prosthetics.
On Naagin, a show which has been panned by the critics as regressive and perpetuating superstition, Karishma, who showed her opinionated side in Bigg Boss, says, “We are only trying to entertain people. People know that there can’t be a ‘rakshas’ in real life or that a person cannot possibly turn into a snake. People should watch the show, get entertained and not think too much about it.” 
Life is hectic for the young actor who is juggling between two T.V shows but she is not complaining. However, if she were to have a day to while away, watching television is one of her options. And her choice, interestingly, is Netflix. She opines that Indian television has a long way to go before it can hope to be at par with international television shows. Having said that, she adds, “There is only so much you can experiment as after all human emotions remain the same. We try to portray those emotions within different storylines.”

Celebrating abstracts ","While Bengaluru is a haven for realistic painting, according to theatre artist and painter Ranji David, “We need to realise the importance of abstract art.” 
David, founder of the theatre group Organisational Theatre, is on a mission to introduce lesser-known artists. Organisational Theatre has started a documentary series, Geniuses of Bangalore. The 10 minute documentaries depict the life and work of abstract painters. “I thought I could shine a light on abstract painters.” The first video on abstract artist Bharath Rajpal is uploaded on social media where it is doing well. 
“Rajpal’s convex three-point perspective, is worth dwelling upon. My documentary is not a lengthy biography of the artist. It is a peep into their lives to introduce their work. Doing this within a 10-minute framework was a challenge.” 
Most of the abstract painters that Bengaluru is home to, according to David have not been profiled. “We have shied away from showcasing them. The works of these unsung heroes need to brought into the public eye as it would help record their work for posterity. People will then realise the strengths of abstract painting.”
And why is the theatre man dabbling with art, with a concern for paintings? He spent a good 15 years as a trainer in a top corporate and relished the way he ‘engaged’ with people. Instead of getting locked in front of a system in his routine work, his inventive urge made him quit his job for theatre. And while he was seriously directing and acting, his passion to handle the Hungarian-Indian painter Amrita Sher-Gil’s life in his theatrical production made him extend his persona to learn all about ‘abstract art’ by joining a course at Chitrakala Parishath. And his intrinsic love for the abstract soon has him take up a docu-series on these painters!
The theatre practitioner studied Theatre for Change at London School of Performing Arts and Clowning and Mindfulness from the University of Essex. “My all time passion, I realised, is theatre. I wanted to have my path chalked out this way. But what happened while in theatre with respect to Amrita Sher-Gil is incidental. I am happy that I further stretched my bandwidth for knowledge to appreciate abstract art.” David plans more educative sessions to familiarise people with the form. “It will help people figure out what makes up abstract art.” 
Regular jobs have restrictions, David feels. “When you are on your own, there is more to explore and experience.” Some of his adventures come from meeting and collaborating with theatre practitioners across the globe. “The Handlebards, the cycling Shakespeare troupe, were a real find and I’ve been able to get them to tour India.” 
David offers corporate training focusing on theatre-based interventions and conducts theatre-in-education projects. His radical handling of Shakespeare, his favourite playwright, is progressive for this contemporary age. His explorations include an adaptation of Hamlet for children, Macbeth, on corporate politics, Romeo and Juliet for young couples, Othello for married people and King Lear for senior citizens.

The miracle did not happen ","From standing with folded hands with a flower adorning his ears and singing ‘Ammavum Neeye’ as a mere four year old to penning and crooning an ode to his screen mother in ‘Vishwaroopam 2’ Kamal Haasan has come a long way and it’s not just the way his name is spelt or pronounced. First donning grease paint as a four-year-old he’s moved on to wearing various cinematic hats and has excelled in each ‘avtaar’ spanning a career spread over 59 years save a few as a gawky teenager. I realise it’s nearly four decades since I first barged into his Alwarpet office and interviewed him on the eve of the release of ‘Varumayin Niram Sivappu’. He had already appeared in more than 100 films and was the only actor with super-hits in all the four South Indian languages. He still is and you can add Hindi to that. I carried a tape recorder the size of a briefcase and Kamal was worried if the batteries would last. Well the last time I interviewed him I recorded with my mobile phone. Kamal has always embraced technology instead of feeling intimidated or threatened. For a school dropout his English was impeccable. 
He’s the reason I started watching Tamil films: a Telugu speaking neighbour insisted I watch ‘16 Vayadhinile’ and I was hooked enough to revisit his earlier films that were getting re-released. His versatility, even then was striking be it playing a Malayalee ventriloquist in ‘Avargal’, the buck toothed imbecile in ‘Kalyanaraman’ or the married guy with the glad eye in ‘Manmatha Leelai’. He refined Sivaji Ganesan’s style of acting and his exposure to world cinema helped him hone his skills. He admonished me for terming Sivaji’s style as overacting and asked me to watch his earlier films. The cinematic climate was conducive too with talents like Bharathi Rajaa and Balu Mahendra emerging. There was Ilayaiyaraja whose music could elevate mundane emotions and cinematographers like Ashok Kumar. Every director worth his megaphone wanted to work with Kamal and unlike now he was open to talents like Rudhriah who made ‘Aval Appadithan’. He effortlessly shrugged off getting typecast. Even the humungous success of ‘Sakala Kala Vallavan’ could not lure him into commercial complacence. The decade after 1980 saw his acting skills coming to the fore with films ranging from ‘Raja Parvai’ to ‘Pushpaka Vimanam’, ‘Sagar Sangamam’ and ‘Nayakan’ to ‘Apoorva Sahodarargal’. Shahrukh Khan told me Kamal was better than De Niro and Pacino put together. I would add Chaplin and Brando. If he did imitate occasionally it was imperceptible and his way of paying homage and his comic timing is magical. It was also the decade where he wasted his talent in mindless Hindi films. The best thing that happened to his career was the failure of his Hindi films.
Kamal’s most repeated line during interviews is that he was a reluctant actor. Differences with Shantanu Shorey during the Hindi version of ‘Avvai Shanmukhi’ forced Kamal to make his directorial debut though he was accused of being a closet director in most of his projects. “Well it’s my neck on the line and I do it only when I realise the director is inept,” he told me which is true and Mani Ratnam will vouch for that. His decision to give up films for politics has shocked fans especially since he’s always insisted politics was not a natural progression as it is for most Tamil stars. The trauma he underwent to release ‘Vishwaroopam’ was the trigger, I assume. The question probably was who can protect you when the so-called protectors harassed you? Not many are giving him a chance in his new role. In fact diehard fans are wishing he loses and gets back to doing what he does best. 
The reactions to ‘Vishwaroopam 2’’ like most of his works is extreme. His recent films have left a lot to be desired be it the unnecessary ‘Thoongavanam’ or ‘Utthama Villain’ which for a Kamal starrer left you emotionally unmoved. It’s disheartening to see the indifference when the release of a Rajni or Kamal starrer approaches if devoid of controversy or hoopla. Is it generational? Are they committing the same mistakes our generation accused MGR and Sivaji of, playing characters too young for their age? 
Meanwhile a brief review of ‘V2’ would be that it’s way better than a Vijay or Ajith pot-boiler but falls woefully short of the movie miracle that we’ve come to expect each time Kamal appears on-screen.

Sugar, not spice "," Laughter is probably humanity’s greatest weapon against the vicissitudes of life. Ask stand-up veteran Amin Ahmed and he’ll give you a loud, resounding ‘whoop!’. Better known by his stage name, Sugar Daddy, Amin is best known for his candid take on personal experiences and life. 
A proper Bengaluru boy, the veteran comic talks of growing up in the city and how it shaped his sense of humour. “I was born in Bangalore in 1965. You can imagine how beautiful the city was. Everyone knew one another. If someone new came to the neighbourhood, you could ask anyone and you’ll get that person’s entire history. That was the old Bangalore. Frazer Town, Cox Town, Cooke Town; we had Anglo-Indians, Germans, Italians and British – we were surrounded by Western culture. It was also the dawn of the indie era so we had plenty of good music. Those were happy days with jam sessions and stories.”
Insisting that we don't mention his age, he quips: “I’m 18 till I die. I feel like it too and even have a show with the same name. The whole vibe of Frazer Town ebbs in me. I meet a lot of old friends and we notice we talk a little differently compared to the current generation.”




Comedy wasn't his first job though. “I started working at an early age. I went to St. Joseph’s College of Commerce after schooling in St. Germain High School. I did one year in college, and my best friend Gordan and I dropped out. We joined a travel agency. He went in the courier line and I became a travel guy. I became the youngest regional manager at SOTC at 23. That, however, was my last job. I went to the States. I started a company when I returned. All kinds of things happened – Personal life, family life, work life. Life got serious. I had no choice. I went into comedy.”
Life took a turn for the better when another of his friends, Perry Menzies, (who owns Urban Solace) asked him to try a hand at comedy. “What did I have to lose? When I started talking about my problems on stage instead of talking to a psychiatrist, people started clapping. They seemed very happy to hear about my problems. That’s how it all started. Since then, it has been a fantastic journey, lots of shows around the world.”
On whether comedy has helped him cope, Amin says, “Among various darknesses, I had a silver lining from above called comedy. I was not driven by ‘I am funny’ or ‘I want to become a great comedian’. It was more about ‘I have to keep myself positive’, so the funny things actually helped personally. But it also carved out a place for me professionally.” On stage, Amin covers a wide time span. “I talk about what the past was, what life was then and how technology came into situations. We didn’t have any of that back then,” he comments on technology. “We used to climb a tree and scream. There was nothing else to do. Even Arnab Goswami was born during that same time. We used to invent games.”
The journey he hopes, “is taking me to more money,” he laughs. “Money is good. I also hope to do more gigs.”




Commenting on the scene, Amin says: “Whoever came first is sitting on top. Many are talented and others are not. There is plenty of politics when someone new tries to enter. As a result, the scene is breaking up into different factions. I’m connected with my network. They may not be the most famous but they are funny. I get to do a lot with underdogs. I’m also in a position to push them. I don’t want them to go through what I did.” He points out that it is not fair that people don't get the opportunity they deserve. “Within comedians, there is a lot of insecurity. For me, age, mental conditioning and maturity, has helped me surpass all that.”
Of his moniker Sugar Daddy, Amin says: “I make fun of growing old. I don’t want to be a normal old man. I want to be someone special. So I start off with a joke on being called a sugar daddy. I make fun of my name and how it translates into other languages, like chinni papa rasgulla' or 'rasgulappa'. It’s just a spin on life and a great way to start a show.”
Amin says open mics are entry points. “They are difficult to get. Stage time is often just five minutes. There are tons of comics out there and they are all talented. You wonder why they’re not famous. But it is a tough world and I am doing all I can to help.”
Catch Sugar Daddy live at a special show in XU, Leela Palace, on July 1 called ‘18 till I die’ with Suhas Navaratna and Kartekeya Fatwani. Tickets on B"

I am always interested in playing characters with grey shades: Nawazuddin Siddiqui on ‘Sacred Games’
","For actors Nawazuddin Siddiqui and Radhika Apte, bagging roles in Netflix’s Sacred Games, a series adapted from Vikram Chandra’s book of the same nameand helmed by Anurag Kashyap and Vikramaditya Motwane, was a great opportunity. “It is great to get a series released in 190 countries across the world,” they say. 
Radhika Apte, who plays a RAW officer, Anjali Mathur, points out, “My character is different from the version in the book. I did not read the book since I did not want to carry any bias about the manner in which the character would shape up in the series.” She adds that one of the toughest things was to learn about officers in RAW. “Adapting to different characters is part of an actor’s job and I enjoyed essaying this character, grappling with her issues and yearning to be a field officer, like her father.”
Nawazuddin, who plays Ganesh Gaitonde, an underworld don, says, “I am always interested in playing characters with grey shades. I have never enjoyed romantic movies filled with conventional black-and-white characters. Real people have shades of grey and that must be highlighted. I think the new crop of directors in Bollywood are making movies that no longer pander to stereotypes.”
He goes on to explain that Gaitonde becomes a don due to certain circumstances. “He has an unhappy family life in a small town in India and ends up in Mumbai. Since Sacred Games is a series, it allowed us to bring about more facets of the character on screen.” 
Does he fear being typecast with gangster roles? “Not really. I have acted in three gangster movies. One of the greatest actors, Robert De Niro has acted in plenty of movies, where he played gangsters. I look at gangsters as humans and enjoy playing them. There is good and bad in everyone.”
On whether content-driven cinema is finding its voice with the rise of streaming platforms such as Netflix, Nawazuddin says, “There is an audience for all type of content in India, be it masala entertainers, content-driven series or the regular saas-bahu fare.”

Below the ice "," Polar cubs, fantastical auroras, male emperor penguins protecting their eggs from a fierce polar storm, colourful under-ice corals and deadly ice stalactites that freeze creatures to death — this is a taste of what to expect from the Winter episode of the upcoming Frozen Planet series, that focuses on the polar regions. All set to première this month, the fascinating scenes captured in the series are a product of many weeks of behind-the-scenes work in subzero temperatures. 
“Winter is the coldest, darkest time in the region. For the wildlife too, it’s a time of fighting for survival,” recounts Kathryn Jeffs. “We landed in remote McMurdo Sound, Antarctica, on a C-17 plane with 65 heavy bags of kits, including specially adapted tripods. We drilled holes into the 3-feet thick ice, over which we placed dive-huts to capture the under-ice life there,” she says. Divers Doug Anderson and Hugh Miller would go down for 45 minutes at a time, with Hugh carrying the special underwater lights and holding them still while he hovered in water and Doug filmed. “The water was below -2 degrees, so we would pour near boiling water into their gloves just before the dive. The biggest challenge there was to keep warm,” explains Jeff, who has also produced the popular miniseries Planet Earth and Oceans: Our Blue Planet, among others.
During their time in Mc Murdo Sound, the crew filmed a rare phenomenon. “We were lucky to have captured a 8-hour time lapse video of a brinicle forming — this has never, ever been filmed before,” says Jeffs. The brinicle — an icicle formed by the downward flow of saline water that freezes any sea creatures it traps — was filmed using underwater tripods, lighting stands and cables held down with lead weights. “In the first attempt, an inquisitive Weddell seal had tipped over the camera. It was face-down when we came back for it the next morning. But the second time was a success — it was a very emotional moment for us,” she adds. 
Jeffs’ fascination of the natural world started early on. “Since the age of three, I’ve loved animals and nature. As I got older, I began to worry about our impact on the planet, so I wanted to share my love for nature with other people in the hope that they enjoy and do more to protect our precious planet,” adds Jeffs, who has a degree in Biological Imaging and a career spanning over 17 years. Working with Sir David Attenborough on Frozen Planet has been a high point for Jeffs. “He has been my hero my entire life. His fascination for nature is infectious, and his impact on an entire generation’s understanding and love for wildlife is immeasurable,” she says.

Subtle tones
"," “All along the history of arts, artistes have been struggling to liberate themselves. If someone says ‘you have to sing with this many words’, I will make sure I sing with much lesser. I will try and escape from as many words as possible. If I am told ‘you have to stick to this rhythm’, I will move far away from it in an attempt to create something different. Rules and rituals get created. Centuries go by, and they keep changing. The history of arts means a never ending struggle between those make rules and those who seek to break them. It is a relentless battle. How else will one experience the sweetness of creative freedom? Rules are important. They have been devised by great scholars, and nobody intends to abandon them. It is not possible either. Moreover, an artiste cannot achieve anything by violating rules totally. His search for freedom moves in a different route. That is where the new styles blossom.” In one of his lectures on music, the eminent, but less-known Bhaskar Chandavarkar made the above observations. These, are not general observations about a tradition and how an artiste negotiates with it, it is also Chandavarkar’s own, personal negotiations. If there was something very unique to this composer, it was his deep understanding of the various systems of music, and how he, in the most inconspicuous way, found his autonomy without cutting away from it.
Chandavarkar learnt from Pt Ravi Shankar, and one sees in his music the great impact that the legendary figure made on him. He met Ritwik Ghatak fairly early in his life with whom he went to FTII, getting introduced to the best of world cinema. “I then served a longish stint as a teacher at the FTII, also learning the craft of cinema in order to teach my students better. For me, making music transcends the fundamental research demanded by every project and also involves looking at the internal structure of the film itself — the script, camera movement, editing, and so on. I feel this is where my FTII teaching experience comes in handy,” Chandavarkar had said an interview. 
This is indeed true of his music. Though Chandavarkar followed the Western style of making film music – in terms of motifs and the nature of composing – he produced a sound quality that was truly Indian. There are hardly any instances of Bhaskar Chandavarkar using elaborate orchestra, in terms of the number, say 25 violins. His expression was subtle: it always worked complementary to the narrative, never literal as was the case with most background scores. Ondanondu Kaladalli, for which he made music, is remarkable. The extraordinary background score, its perfect folk idiom, the use of the folk drum and flute is mesmerizing. It is said that when Satyajit Ray watched the film, he was struck by its music and when Aparna Sen invited him to compose music for her film Paroma, Ray told her that he had found a “better music director” than him, which was Bhaskar Chandavarkar. 
Listen to his music in Thodasa Roomani Ho Jaaye or Maya Darpan or Kandahar – Chandavarkar paints abstract colours. There is nothing that you can predict in his music: shorn of grandeur and embellishment, it takes a self-reflective route. A composer who was intimately connected to theatre, Bhaskar Chandavarkar believed in constructing a new music theory. “There is that mechanical path where you drag art to fit into the rasa theory. Instead, why can’t we expand rasa theory to suit different expressions of art? When you expand theory it remains contemporary. Similar to expanding the meaning of words to keep a language relevant. The only way for art and the individual to survive is to go on enlarging theoretical meanings.”
In today’s world of hybridity, Chandavarkar may sound insipid. To understand his music, one must be tuned to the silences of one’s culture.

Anupam Kher resigns as chairperson of FTII ","Actor Anupam Kher resigned as chairperson of the Film and Television Institute of India on Wednesday, saying that it would not be possible for him to discharge his responsibilities due to his professional commitments in the U.S.
He is playing former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in a film based on a memoir written by Sanjaya Baru, a former media advisor to Dr. Singh. The film is expected to be released before the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.
In his resignation letter to Information and Broadcasting Minister Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore, Mr. Kher said he will be stationed in the U.S. for “nearly nine months between 2018 and 2019 and then for a similar period for a minimum of three years more” due to his commitment to the NBC series New Amsterdam.
“Given this assignment (the show), it would not be fair to me, the students and management team, for me to hold a position of such responsibility and accountability, without being actively involved in the operations,” he said in his letter.
Mr. Kher, 63, urged Mr. Rathore to accept his resignation and in the notice period scout for someone suitable to take over from him. “I will always be available, if needed, for any guidance or responsibility given to me as an individual,” he wrote.
His resignation letter, dated October 30, has been accepted by Mr. Rathore, who thanked Mr. Kher for his services to the premier institute, the I&B Ministry said in a statement here.
Mr. Kher had replaced Gajendra Chauhan, who had a controversial tenure as the head of the prestigious institute, in October last year.

Cardi B to separate from rapper husband Offset ","Rapper Cardi B announced on December 5 that she is seeking a divorce from her husband Offset after just over a year of marriage, saying “I guess we just grew out of love.”
In an Instagram video, the “Bodak Yellow” singer, one of the biggest names in the music industry this year, said although she and Offset were good friends and business partners, “things just havent been working out between us for a long time.”
Cardi B, 26, and Offset, 26, a member of rap trio Migos, married secretly in September 2017 and had a child in July.
“Its nobody fault. I guess we just grew out of love but we are not together anymore. I dont know. It might take time to get a divorce and I'm going to always have a lot of love for him because he is my daughters father,” she said.
She captioned the video, “There you go ... peace and love.” Offset responded to her Instagram post with the comment, ”Y'all won.”
Cardi B has reached success in the past year with hit singles “I Like It,” “Girls Like You,” with Maroon 5, and the Bruno Mars collaboration “Finesse.”
The singer's brand of female empowerment and sexuality won three American Music Awards and three MTV Video Music awards earlier this year. She is expected to figure highly in Grammy nominations to be announced on December 7.

Will the spectacular new season of 'Daredevil' salvage the fate of Netflix’s Marvel shows? ","Netflix released Season 3 of Daredevil last week, close on the heels of the streaming service axing Iron Fist and Luke Cage in quick succession. It was a brutal decision, which culled The Defenders catalogue by half (not counting spin-off The Punisher). This double pull-out casts a gloomy shadow over Netflix’s Marvel universe, which got off to a pretty rosy start three years ago.
Both Daredevil and Jessica Jones arrived in 2015 to stellar reviews, and with solid opening seasons. Each show had a tone that was refreshingly distinct from Marvel’s big screen extravaganzas, and both went beyond familiar superhero tropes to weave in themes like religion and consent. 
Even though Luke Cage couldn’t live up to the hype created by its predecessors, it at least had some interesting characters, and captured the vibe of New York’s Harlem neighbourhood nicely. Iron Fist, though, was a complete disaster, and intolerable over its 13-episode arc. The count of episodes, in fact, has been a major drawback. Not all dramas can sustain interest over a 13-episode arc, least of all those that either have completely listless characters (as in Iron Fist), or mundane plots (as in Luke Cage).
Daredevil and Jessica Jones have managed to stay afloat because writers of both shows laid a strong foundation for the characters in their first seasons itself, due to which their less-intriguing sophomore seasons delivered. 
Marvel’s TV division has a lot to learn from its film counterpart — each set of movies dedicated to a different character (or characters) in the Marvel Cinematic Universe has been helmed by an eclectic filmmaker, distinguishing one from the other in tone and treatment. Iron Fist and Luke Cage, as characters, seemed unsure of their place in The Defenders universe, their creators either borrowing tropes from Daredevil and Jessica Jones that didn’t fit into their world, or making slight deviations that seemed unconvincing. 
Their premature demise, hence, isn’t shocking, and paves the way for the two characters to appear in either Daredevil or Jessica Jones-led storylines in possibly better-written parts.
The new season of Daredevil, meanwhile, is splendid. The writers go back to the show’s crime-thriller roots — which it deviated from in the second season — and come up with something intense, multi-layered and character-driven. Part of it has to do with the return of Daredevil’s arch-nemesis Wilson Fisk. Vincent D’Onofrio, as the big, bad villain, remains enchanting as ever, even when he resorts to theatrics. 
But what truly makes the show tick is the painstaking attention given to each character. Karen Page (Deborah Ann Woll, excellent) and Foggy Nelson (Elden Henson), probably Netflix-Marvel’s most impactful characters other than the heroes and the villains, get meaty tracks that merge nicely with the central plot. Two new additions — FBI officers Ray Nadeem (Jay Ali) and Benjamin Pointdexter (Wilson Bethel) — are fascinating grey parts that add to the show’s appeal. Charlie Cox’s portrayal of the Devil of Hell’s Kitchen is probably TV’s most underrated performance at the moment (he even loses the spandex this time, as if yearning for more respectability).
Season 3 of the show retains traits that made it so watchable to begin with — an unflinching character study of its central protagonist, and beautifully-orchestrated action sequences. The new season sets a pretty high bar, leaving Netflix and Marvel with an altogether new quandary: how do you improve on something this spectacular?

Take my joke back home: Amit Tandon on weaving hilarious stories on stage ","Amit Tandon has been very busy in the past few months — a new show ‘Not Getting Wiser’, international tour to the US and Australia and his shifting to Mumbai. “That is enough for one year,” laughs Amit. In fact, the US trip was a pleasant surprise; he had planned to do only 15 shows, but ended up doing 50! 
Amit was married with two kids when he entered the comedy circuit. It seemed a natural progression to be the ‘married guy’ in his act and make wisecracks about his marriage. Considering his writings have always revealed different layers of his life, his ‘Not Getting Wiser ...’ goes a step ahead to talk about relationships in general, not just with his wife. “There are other people and it gets a lot closer to my life in terms of my childhood and transforming into a parent,” he shares, adding, that the stories make the audience nostalgic. “A lot of these stories touch them as they have been a child or parent or both. We have been brought up with the same set of threats like ‘Papa agaye.’ It is satisfying to see how they look into each other’s eyes and relate to it.” 
WhatsApp has not just changed the way we chat and share but the way we laugh too. With funny jokes and videos shared on social media, it is a challenge for comedians to create their own niche. Amit’s USP has been his writings which enhance the ‘recall’ factor . “We laugh at the jokes on WhatsApp but forget them the next morning. What I try to bring on board is different. You have to take my joke back home and even recollect it after a week or month. I want to keep the flavour of my jokes identifiable.” 
 His acts are also without the sexual innuendos and cuss words. “I come from a middle class family and with two kids at home, I’m used to controlling my language at home. A lot of comics who use cuss words are part of the younger generation and it is acceptable with this generation. My clean humour became a selling point and a good marketing strategy as well.”
His company The Grand Masters of Comedy is an attempt to bring humour into the corporate world. Having worked in a corporate company, he admits the stress levels are high. “It is not just through comedy shows but we want to bring comedy into their everyday lives.” 
He recalls the jokes that would accompany his emails when he was running a recruitment firm. “The client started noticing it and said it was good to see a joke at the end of the mail. The jokes brought a smile and refreshed them. Also, when an employee is getting married, a group of us would go to his cabin and laugh for two minutes. We would call it ‘Hasya Sabha’ and the whole atmosphere would lighten up.”

(‘Not Getting Wiser’ with Amit Tandon is on at Sri Satya Sai Nigamagamam, Srinagar Colony on November 30, 8 pm onwards. Tickets:www.bookmyshow.com)

Hyderabad Comic Con 2018: A multi-verse of entertainment
","Step into any Comic Con and you’re instantly transported into a whole new world of fun, family and fantastical getaway. This weekend promises no less with Hyderabad Comic Con kicking off. So what can one expect? 
Funnyman Sahil Shah from East India Comedy will be hopping on board, not at all a stranger to the comedic tides of Hyderabad. In fact, Sahil was in the city for last year’s Comic Con too, honing his superpower of entertainment to keep attendees in totally upbeat spirits.
Coming to Hyderabad Comic Con for the first time, animator and comic book artist Rahil Mohsin is ushered in from Bengaluru. Growing up on the stories around TinTin and then falling in love with stories like Johnny the Homicidal Maniac by Jhonen Vasquez, the artist dubbed “chameleon” is now illustrating for Sufi Comics, an indie comic book creator. Sufi Comics went on to be the first Indian publisher to go to San Diego Comic Con.
Now… what to do at Comic Con that hasn’t been around before? Fear not, they have your back. If you’re anticipating the release of Aquaman this December, the Aquaman experience should get you geared up even more. Immerse yourself in a fun underwater-but-not-really-underwater zone and keep your camera at the ready for selfies with The King Of The Seven Seas. 
And, of course, treat yourself to an exclusive peek into the sequel of Fantastic Beasts if the waiting is too much for you. And if you’re having a little Marvel withdrawal, there’s always a place for that to get your quick fix.
Speaking of films and comics colliding, don’t miss out on Matthew Rosenberg’s appearance. Having an integral role in the culmination of Dark Phoenix and The New Mutants comics, it’s fair to assume he knows what we can expect from the respective films to be released soon. Matthew and his partner Patrick Kindlon came together to form Ashcan Press and their success has been huge in the comic book realm. While we won’t be seeing the partners together, be sure to catch Matthew to regale him for spoilers. 
Founder of Comic Con India Jatin Varma observes a huge gaming community in the city which many will see in the form of AMD Gaming and ESL Gaming. In attendance as well will be artist Saumin Suresh Patel, Akshay Dhar of Meta Desi Comics, Vivek Goel of Holy Cow Entertainment and Rajeev Tamhankar of TBS Planet Comics — just to further name drop here.
But now, time to get serious; in light of India’s #MeToo movement, Comic Con India’s Cosplay Is Not Consent campaigns and protection schemes stands at alert.
Jatin gets real, “You do have situations where we need volunteers to keep cosplayers and their costumes safe. You’ll see costumes which are very elaborate and expensive. So, yes, there are one-off incidents — which are rare — where boundaries are crossed and we take action immediately and we have intervention from the police, too. But most of these outfits actually invite a lot of positive engagement and curiosity, which is what we love to see.” 
Do join on this campaign on a citizen level; just because you’re only attending, doesn’t mean you’re simply a by-stander!
Hyderabad Comic Con will be at Hitex Exhibition Centre on October 13 and 14. See hyderabadcomiccon.com for tickets.

Actor Suraj Sharma on life after Pi
","If searching for God on Facebook sounds like a satire of the times we live in, then God Friended Me is a slightly silly and contrived yet heart-warming take on the concept. 
The comedy-drama, which is currently airing on Colors Infinity, explores human connections and our ability to help one another, says actor Suraj Sharma, who plays one of the leads. “Do we need a so-called God or faith in a higher being in order to help each other? Or is faith in one another enough to be kind and compassionate? That is the basic premise of the show,” says the Life of Pi actor.
‘God’ sends a friend request to atheist Miles Finer (played earnestly by Brandon Micheal Hall) on Facebook, providing suggestions of ‘friends’ to him — people whose lives Finer invariably ends up making a difference in, without always intending to. Sharma’s character Rakesh Sehgal — a part-time hacker who ends up “finding meaning and an objective to his life” — is also swept up by the changes in Finer’s life.
Just three episodes in, the show has provided viewers with context about Finer’s family (his father is a reverend who is deeply disappointed with his son’s atheism) and has woven in the issues of the third protagonist, Cara Bloom (Violett Beane). “The point of the TV show is to kind of harness the multiple perspectives on religion, you know? It’s to try and get to a more holistic idea,” shares Sharma, who was most recently seen in the 2017 Bollywood film, Phillauri, where his character is haunted by Anushka Sharma’s ghost. “There’s a whole bunch of different ideas in the show.” 
It is, however, yet to delve deeply into Sehgal’s character. When it does, Hinduism will definitely come up, promises Sharma. “He is definitely agnostic,” says the actor, on a phone call from New York. “He’s all about computers and hacking and science. I think his mom and dad might be religious but he’s definitely not.”
I ask him about his own spiritual beliefs. “Me? According to the bigger picture, I am also agnostic, but I like to think of myself as into the idea of spirituality,” says Sharma. “So no, I don’t believe in God.” 
But he does seem to believe in serendipity. “I had to leave New York to get a job in New York,” says the Delhi-born actor, with a chuckle. “I’d been living in New York for about five or six years and I moved to Los Angeles. But in the first week there, I get a callback to this audition. So I go to CBS and meet the people there and basically, everything went really well. And I ended up coming back here.”




Serendipity might also have had something to do with Sharma bagging the role of Pi in Ang Lee’s critically acclaimed 2012 film, Life of Pi. It was Sharma’s brother who had originally gone to audition for the film. Still in school in Delhi when he was cast, the actor reveals that his life turned “completely upside down” after the film. “It was epic and amazing and I got to learn so much and meet so many different types of people,” he says.
After Life of Pi, he has gone on to do several critically-acclaimed roles, both on television and the big screen. There is his portrayal of Rinku Singh, the first Indian to play professional baseball, in Million Dollar Arm alongside Jon Hamm and Slumdog Millionaire actor Madhur Mittal. He was also seen in the fourth season of Homeland, where he essayed the role of Aayan Ibrahim, a Pakistani medical student.
Talking about his acting career thus far, Sharma sounds just as excited as the 16-year-old version of himself. “Pi gave my life an objective,” he reveals. “Obviously, you know, this is also such a privileged lifestyle — I got to go to film school in New York. I really appreciate how it gave me a way to move forward,” he adds.
But he is in no big hurry. Beyond God Friended Me, Sharma shares that he has not signed on any new project. “For now, I’d just like to concentrate on this,” he says. 
God Friended Me airs every Monday at 10 pm on Colors Infinity.

TV shows that talk about mental health of doctors
","If you think about it, a hospital is the best place for any soap opera: it is where strangers meet everyday, each new patient bringing a new storyline, that is woven into the permanent cast’s (read: the doctors and nurses) lives. Which explains why medical dramas such as ER and Grey’s Anatomy have been some of the longest-running shows in TV history. Even Indian TV took a hint and created the short-lived but popular Sanjivani (cue theme whistle) and its spin off Dil Mil Gaye.
But how many of them go beyond portraying doctors in clacking heels with smoldering good looks, to real characters that experience the stress that comes along with being a doctor?
 The original big daddy of medical soap operas, M*A*S*H’s final episode, ‘Goodbye, Farewell and Amen’ was one of the most watched shows and is still remembered for its handling of main character Hawkeye Pierce’s mental breakdown. Hawkeye, a surgeon at the U.S. Army Medical Corps, was himself being treated at a mental hospital and is forced to bring to the surface repressed memories of having to watch a mother choke her infant during the Korean War. The episode effectively deals with PTSD, and the long lasting effect of war on army doctors.
Another show that talks about PTSD among war veterans, One Day At A Time, sees lead Penelope, a civilian nurse and United States Army Nurse Corps veteran, battle with anxiety and depression, pointing out how the condition raises its head even when everything in your life may seem perfectly fine. Living with her mother who in an old-fashioned Latina way, believes depression is something “you just have to get over”, Penelope stops taking her medicines and going to therapy, believing she has finally outrun it -- only for it to catch up with her when she least expects it.




Ah, yes. The famous Dr House: brilliant, cheeky, brutally sarcastic, irreverent to rules -- the ultimate bad boy of the medical world. But when it comes to handling his own issues, he is less than equipped to do so. Blaming chronic pain in his knees, he regularly relies on painkillers, overdosing to a point that he starts to hallucinate. Though he is shown as trying to overcome his addiction by checking himself into a rehab, he reverts to his habits soon after.
Though the show occasionally touches upon how its doctors, from Christina Yang, to Owen Hunt and Meredith Grey, deal with the stress and depression, most of the show’s drama comes from ridiculous plot points (a bomb lodged in a patient’s chest, can you believe?), invented only to pull the narrative forward. The show has problems with continuity (understandable what with doctors dropping dead like flies, and so many permutations and combinations of couples), one of which is surgeon Bailey’s on-now, off-tomorrow OCD.
Even though the show is supposed to be a parody, or probably because of it, Scrubs has a loyal fan following among actual doctors for getting the stresses that come with the job right. The show which specialises in escapist humour, often surprises us with its sensitivity. We watch as protagonist doctor JD comes to term with the reality of losing patients once in a while, and senior doctor Cox gives a chillingly practical advice to focus only on those who can be helped. The show also talks about how the residents’ busy schedules hardly leaves them with a personal life to date and socialise.

Hannah Gadsby’s ‘Nanette’ leaves you both uncomfortable and exhilarated
","Around a third of the way through, Nanette, the Netflix stand-up comedy special by Australian Hannah Gadsby, transforms. No longer just a carousel of set-up followed by punchline, it takes on a greater meaning. We, the viewers, are forced to take stock. We’re made to look within, to examine the role of women in society and our own flawed worldviews. Nanette resonates with so many people across so many oceans because the things Gadsby says matter. The way she says them makes us both uncomfortable and exhilarated.
It’s a fine line to tread. Personally, the primary purpose of comedy is to make people laugh, even if it’s on the inside. It has to be, in a word, funny. Then come all the accompaniments: whether it makes the viewer think, its social impact (if any), why it exists. Humour is a tool for change because you take something back with you. The uncomfortable laughter can be scrutinised and assessed later, perhaps to understand the world a little better. But if I don’t laugh, I won’t think. 
Gadsby seems to understand that. She starts off with stories about her life both inside and outside the closet. And she takes us across difficult terrain — homophobia, mental health, art history — through her assured delivery. The jokes are elevated thanks to her wry, world-weary, ‘well, what’re you gonna do?’ style of expression. She presents a look of mild, disaffected surprise — perhaps even contempt — at how terrible the world is. But then she flips things. She tells us she’s not going to make any more jokes. That she’s not going to be endearingly self-deprecating any longer.
Male ‘genius’
The first act is merely an appetiser, a way to ease viewers into the material she wants to explore. (Content warning: Gadsby talks extensively about abuse and gendered violence through her set.) The dramatised camerawork reveals her increasing exasperation. She’s getting angrier with each passing sentence. The classic “angry comedian” trope is employed, which she points out has always been the domain of the male comic. She tackles so-called male geniuses, and the way their misogyny gets swept under the rug (Pablo Picasso gets a particularly thrilling takedown). It’s time, she says, for men to pull up their socks. Gadsby pulls no punches while delving into loaded subjects, allowing her personal experiences the space they deserve, articulating her thoughts with biting wit. But, simultaneously, she sprinkles them with throwaway one-liners, finding that perfect counterpoint to her anger.
Stand-up comedy, by its design, requires a certain suspension of disbelief. As the audience, we’re expected to function on the premise that the jokes we’re getting are spontaneous and off the cuff. We’re not supposed to think about the comic standing in front of a mirror night after night, rehearsing her material and fine-tuning it to make it sound even more impulsive and free. How the sausage is made is a secret best left unexplored. This unspoken understanding gets further muddled when the comic attempts pathos and tragedy. The acclaimed Homecoming King from last year, a special by Hasan Minhaj in which he outlines the brown immigrant experience and the racism he faced growing up in the U.S., is one such example. It was a moving story which, I felt, was a little too theatrical, too hammy, too melodramatic in its performance for my tastes. For so many others, that wasn’t the case. 
A vital narrative
Rehearsed anguish or fury is a lot harder to project to an audience than comedy. It can, at times, come across as insincere. Like the comic is playing a “role”, and not actually being who she is. But Gadsby doesn’t appear to be faking it in any way. It’s not a TED Talk; she’s not pontificating. She’s talking to us. Her delivery, practised as it may well be, reveals a side of her she’s brave enough to show. I’m less concerned with the ‘performance’ of it, and more with her personal journey and the message she’s presenting. 
And that’s where she succeeds. The jokes remain, though sporadic, but there’s an underlying thought of forward motion that resonates with the viewer during Nanette. She points a mirror at the oppressor — most prominently in her set, the straight white male — and centres the equally (if not more) vital narrative of the oppressed. Being a privileged, English-speaking, Hindu-born male in India, I understand that my place in society is similar to that of the former. So I won’t do Gadsby the disservice of coopting her message or claiming I found it emotionally relatable. Instead, her force of personality is such that I could appreciate viscerally, truly feel, the catharsis that she — and countless others through her — felt during Nanette. It makes you look inward.

Police rescue Kwan founder Anirban Blah ","Anirban Blah, the co-founder of Kwan Entertainment, one of the biggest celebrity management agencies in India, was rescued in the wee hours of Friday by the Vashi Traffic police after they found him on Vashi old bridge, where he allegedly attempted to take his life. The incident happened at around 12.30 am when traffic police got a tip-off about the alleged suicide.
Mr. Blah is one of the co-founders of celebrity management firm KWAN Entertainment but was recently asked to step down from his role in the firm after some women accused him of sexual harassment.
""We had information about an individual coming towards Vashi bridge to commit suicide. We couldn't take chance and we laid a trap there in dark,"" senior police inspector from Vashi traffic said.
Mr Blah was seen climbing on the barricades of the bridge when the police caught hold of him and made him get down.
""He was crying. He seemed very frustrated and depressed. We took him to the police chowky, offered him water and asked his problem to which he said that he was frustrated with the #Metoo allegations on him. He was depressed due to the defamation he and his family faced. He along with nine other partners had founded KWAN and after four girls alleged him of harrasment in #Metoo campaign, he was asked to resign,"" Mr Gaikwad said.
His wife was informed by traffic police and he was handed over to the Vashi Police thereafter.

Not what it promises to be
","Forever, the new Amazon Prime series that deals with the concept of togetherness through sickness and health, and, even afterlife, tries to overturn the notions of YOLO (You Only Live Once) with the potent lyricism of YODO (You Only Die Once). But in the hope of laying the foundation for a universe populated with the themes of fantasy and rom-com, the creators, Alan Yang and Matt Hubbard (known for their work in Parks and Recreation), have, unfortunately, walked into the territory of morbid mundanity.
It’s an ironic statement to describe the nature of Forever since the writers wanted the series to stray away from the herd and stand tall as a show that people would speak about in philosophy classes. However, I’m not sure if that’s going to happen as it neither throws in all the answers regarding the specialty of life after death, nor does it excite us with its feel-funny moments.
The series opens with a cute montage of June (Maya Rudolph) and Oscar (Fred Armisen) getting to know each other through dates (with no audible dialogues) and ends with June turning sour as a pall of routineness falls into the crevices of their relationship. While Oscar isn’t particularly bothered by the lack of adventure in their marriage, June looks worried. Her face, like a forgotten doll in the shelf, looks unhappy and uninterested in taking the same walks, waving at the same people, and playing the same games day after day. 
Rudolph and Armisen are fine comedic performers, but with the material that’s handed to them in Forever, they appear a little out of place. Rudolph’s reaction when she realizes that she’s going to “live” with her husband, who has been dead for a year, in her afterlife, is not the laugh-out-loud kind of scene that you’d expect in a comedy such as this. It’s more on the lines of an ordinary occurrence. How would the audience receive this piece of vital information at the end of episode two if June herself doesn’t feel alarmed by her situation?
In fact, the supporting characters, Kase (Catherine Keener), the next-door neighbor who inspires June to leave her past behind, and Mark (Noah Robbins), Oscar’s friend in the quiet neighborhood that people move into once they die, are livelier, and, as a result, get sassier lines to deliver; whereas, the married couple has conversations about the best way to sit and the best food to eat on the beach. The quotidian lines aren’t totally devoid of emotion, or charm, but I somehow couldn’t find a hint of pleasure in their banter.
For a show that could have, perhaps, used some of the eccentricities from The last Man on Earth, the dialed-down-normalcy of June and Oscar’s behavior, as they discover the absurdities and rules of the other world one at a time, is a mega dampener. And that’s exactly why the series looks better when it focuses on the sub-stories that are not directly related to the leads.
The most surreal half-hour of this eight-episode hotchpotch is the one about an African American and an Asian American couple (Jason Mitchell and Hong Chau as Andre and Sarah, respectively), who do not take the final step to be together because they’re married to other people. 
The whole episode revolves around their affair in an abandoned house, and it gives June the courage to break away from the monotony she’s become tired of.
Though, Yang and Hubbard bring in awe-inspiring elements (the dead walk on the ocean bed) and various characters to shake things up, Forever fails to rise above the average. 
It’s just a series about a man and a woman in a long-term relationship who are looking out of the windows of commitment from different corners.

In Star Wars virtual reality,you get to be the hero
","Imagine putting on a helmet, lowering the visor and being transported immediately from your humdrum day-to-day existence into your own Star Wars adventure.
The kind of fantasy that could once only be woven into the dreams of the young is coming to a theme park or shopping mall near you — perhaps sooner than you think.
The Void is the latest in a flood of businesses offering whole-body, fully immersive virtual reality experiences for about double the price of a movie ticket.
The company's Star Wars: Secrets of the Empire scenario instructs players that their mission is to recover Imperial intelligence critical to the survival of the Rebellion — yes, that Rebellion, of Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia.
In reality, the players are in a room full of cameras, movement sensors and other gadgetry in the shadow of Disneyland in southern California.
As far as they are concerned, they are rebels disguised as Imperial stormtroopers on the molten planet of Mustafar, battling giant lava monsters and generally taking care of business.
Wearing vests weighed down by high-tech hardware, the players can reach out and touch what they are seeing in their visors, feel the breeze on their faces and hear creatures scuttling around them. 
Designed in partnership with Disney-owned Lucasfilm, which makes the Star Wars movies, the experience involves all the senses, says marketing director John Kirkpatrick. “I really felt like I was in the movie,” says player Sean Oshima, 29, a technology consultant. 
“I was really amazed by this technology. You can really feel the agents shooting you.”
Cusp of a boom 
The experience — typically enjoyed in groups — costs about $30-35 for 10 minutes, and gets about 500 visitors a day in Anaheim. 
There are locations in North America, the Middle East and Europe and the company is still growing, with other scenarios including a narrative tour around the movie “Ghostbusters,” and a haunted house experience.

YouTube to go up against Netflix and Amazon with original content for India and other markets
"," Alphabet Inc's YouTube is creating scripted series and other original programming for international markets including France, Germany, Japan, Mexico and India to try to draw new customers to its paid subscription service, a senior executive said on Friday.
The programming will come in the form of multiple genres such as music documentaries, reality series, talk shows and scripted series, Susanne Daniels, YouTube's global head of original programming, said in an interview. It will be produced in local languages and subtitled or dubbed for other markets.
Some of the programming will appear on YouTube Premium, the monthly subscription service formerly called YouTube Red. Other content will be available on YouTube's free service with advertising.
“We are targeting markets where we believe we have a tremendous upside in potential subscribers,” Ms. Daniels said.
YouTube already has released a handful of original shows in South Korea and one in India, a talk show in Hindi about cricket. Called UnCricket, the show has performed “beyond expectations,” Ms. Daniels said.
Ms. Daniels also said a reality show starring South Korean pop band Big Bang had boosted subscriptions, and that 50% of the new customers came from outside of Korea.
More details about the new international slate will be released in the coming weeks, she said.
YouTube will be competing with companies including Netflix Inc and Amazon.com Inc that are investing in local language programming for online audiences around the world.
The first original shows from YouTube debuted on its premium service in 2016, starting with series from some of the platform's most popular video creators. It added programming from Hollywood stars and also released a batch of children's shows including Emmy-winning Fruit Ninja Frenzy Force.
There are no current plans for more original children's programming, Ms. Daniels said. The YouTube Kids app serves that younger audience, she said, and the company does not believe children's content will drive subscriptions to YouTube Premium at this time.

Mentalist Nipin Niravath’s show ‘Cryptic’ aims to bust myths surrounding occult practices ","
Nipin Niravath started off as a street magician. But, having always been fascinated by investigative stories and movies, he wanted to delve deeper into the workings of the mind and started coming up with “mentalism experiments.” Ever since his first mentalism show in 2008 proved a hit, the 35-year-old has endeavoured to focus his energy on perfecting this “art of reading minds.”
“I’m neither a doctor nor a black magician and I would prefer to be called a psychological entertainer,” says Nipin over phone from Kochi. His upcoming show, ‘Cryptic: Impossible to Imagine’, is aimed at debunking myths about such arcane fields and exposing certain sham practices in the society. 
“There are a lot of fake theories and practices based on astral projection, ouija board, exorcism etc. Through my performance, I attempt to connect them to the real psychological phenomena behind them for a rational understanding,” says the mentalist.
Nipin explains that Cryptic, an audience-immersive show, is presented in an “investigative” format through the story of a serial killer based on a true incident that took place in Sweden in the previous century. “The killer murders nine people but is nabbed by the police while he is plotting his tenth murder. He is put behind the bars where he kills himself. This is, in fact, a popular story among mind-readers. I open the case diary 145 years later...,” he says, choosing to keep the details cryptic.




Nipin points out that Cryptic will be an out-and-out mentalism spectacle and not a magic show. “One key difference is that magic uses a lot of stage props where as in mentalism, the prop is the mind of the audience. It works by manipulation of their thoughts. One cannot keep a script as the entire show depends on the situation and the audience,” he says, describing the performance art as a regaling combination of “psychology, showmanship, the art of influencing and a bit of magic for the wow factor.”
More than verbal communication, what a mentalist taps into is the non-verbal signals during a performance using well-practised mind-reading techniques. “Body language and micro-expressions are more revelatory to a mind-reader than the subject’s words. No matter how much we try to hide, our body language gives it away,” he says.
Over to Nipin and his bag of tricks.
‘Cryptic: Impossible to Imagine’ will be held at Vyloppilli Samskrithi Bhavan on December 9 at 6.30 pm. Contact: 9020333322

Get set to LOL
"," Zee Kannada will telecast the grand finale of its comedy reality show Comedy Khiladigalu Season 2!
This time, the show will be telecast live from Bijapur. The show has garnered enough attention because of its panel of judges — Jaggesh, Yograt Bhat and Rakshita. 
The finalists of the show are Appanna, Manu Madenoor, Mantanna, Sadhanandh, Suraj, Vani Chenaraya Patanna, Surya, Barkath Ali, Chidambar Raunchier and Raghu. The finale will be hosted by Master Anand. 
Jaggesh, who is looking forward to the release of 8mm is thrilled to be a part of this reality show. 




In between shoots, he takes time off to talk to Metroplus over the phone. “This show is a complete family entertainer. It has completed two successful seasons and we have discovered some of the best comedians here. The good news is that they are already acting in films.” The actor then lauds the channel’s effort to create such platforms for budding actors adding, “Comedy is difficult. The dialogues, the punch, the timing and body language, all have be coordinated in a split second. It is easier to hurt people and make them cry rather than make them laugh. Laughter is the best medicine and has positive effects on one’s health, so my message by being a part of this show is to tell people keep laughing and smiling, no matter what life throws at you. The best part of laughter and comedy is that it has no age limit.”
Jaggesh, is now an experimental spree and has landed himself a role in Shruti Naidu’s Premier Padmini, with Bollywood actor Madhoo and Sudha Rani. 
“Yes, I feel like trying out something new at this age and am glad that Comedy Khiladigalu Season 2 has presented me as a comedian to the younger generation,” states the actor.

‘Not just about the bigger cities anymore,’ says Atul Khatri
"," When one of the country’s top 20 comedians (so says CNN-IBN) says, “Stand up comedy is here to stay,” you have to believe it. Atul Khatri, who said that, looks forward to performs at the Headliners show in Hyderabad later this week, ostensibly ‘because this is his first show after Diwali’ as per his social media post. 
His optimism stems from the fact that stand up comedy which is more than a few decades old in the west is proof that this it is here to stay, though it might be in a nascent stage in India. “Like theatre and movies, this form of entertainment will not lose its sheen. With newer and brighter artistes coming up, the audience is getting bigger and bigger. The scene is improving.”
For more proof, Atul cites the success of his recent show in Tinsukia town of Assam. He had no idea of a place called Tinsukia until he signed the show. He shares, “The strong crowd presence there overwhelmed me. Bigger cities and towns are no more the only hotspots to perform.”
Atul says frankly, “This kind of reach is possible only because we are all connected through the internet. There is hardly anyone who doesn’t have a smart phone and net connectivity. Given the forward rate in Whatsapp and the speed at which the share button is used on social media, our reach gets better. Then there is YouTube as well. Audiences come to shows only after they have seen us on YouTube, so it is the first platform that any artiste gets.”
The comedian who makes audience roll in laughter with lines delivered with a straight face, says the content he uploads on video hosting platforms, including YouTube, is different from what he performs on stage. “The upcoming Headliners show in Hyderabad has all new content. It is a fresh concept and each of us will have 25 minutes on stage,” he adds. On video hosting platforms, Atul says, “They are opening new windows to reach out to more audiences. While YouTube needs a lot of filtering, viewing platforms like Netflix, Amazon Prime Video are all about premium content that allows viewers to select.”
Will he be able to make up for his Diwali expenditure with this show’s sales? “Sales look good. I will be performing with three other brilliant artistes Varun Thakur, Aishwarya Mohanraj and Prashasti Singh, so audiences can enjoy themselves.” 
Atul Khatri performs for ‘Headliners’ at Sri Satya Sai Nigamagamam on November 17 at 6:30pm. Tickets: ₹799 on insider.in.

I have seen many Katekars in life, says Jitendra Joshi of ‘Sacred Games’ fame
","Recently, Netflix unleashed its first-ever Indian original series, Sacred Games, starring Nawazuddin Siddiqui, Radhika Apte and Sailf Ali Khan in central roles. One of the characters of this eight-episode soap that has fascinated critics and binge-watchers alike is Katekar - a not-so-ambitious but loyal constable – played by popular Marathi theatre and film actor Jitendra Joshi.

 ‘Sacred Games’, a coming of age for Indian television

The story, adapted from Vikram Chandra's novel of the same name, is the story of a policeman Sartaj Singh (played by Saif Ali Khan) in pursuit of gangster Ganesh Gaitonde (played by Nawazuddin Siddiqui). The character of Katekar, Sartaj’s colleague, is flawed and yet real. His loyalty toward Sartaj is admirable and yet his dislike for a community, which eventually leads to his demise, is more than just a chink in his armour. In a telephonic interview, the actor spoke to The Hindu about his approach to the role and how life has changed post the massive success of the show. Excerpts:
(Laughs) I don’t go seeking work; in fact I am just busy living life to the fullest, and meanwhile circumstances create jobs for me. It’s too early to say. People in the industry might notice my work and more opportunities will come my way (like) just how Sacred Games happened. I took up the project because I was excited about working with Anurag Kashyap and Vikramaditya Motwane. I had no idea about Netflix’s existence until my friend Nikhil Mahajan (an established Marathi filmmaker) made me realise how big a deal this is. It’s (the online streaming site) a beast and I am overwhelmed by the number of messages and wishes I have been receiving from strangers and fellow artistes. But, I have no inhibitions about language or industry; I will take up whatever the best comes my way, doesn’t necessarily has to be Bollywood.
I have seen many Katekars in life. I grew up in Pune where my neighbour was a police constable, so a few of Katekar’s traits come from there. Then I am friends with a few policemen in Mumbai, I have observed them very closely – their belief systems, usage of abusive language and other things. Even in a normal conversation, they use cuss words and especially at home. Katekar isn’t a typical hawaldar, I kept him very human and simple. It shouldn’t look like an act but just another real person in reel scenario.




Motwane is one of the best directors to work with; he knows where to set you free and to tether you down. So there are moments and actions that were improvised, for instance a few curse words were my own addition as I speak the language (Marathi). But again, the writers of the show have done such an excellent job that just scratching the surface of the script gives you the character arc. When you work with actors like Saif (Saif Ali Khan), who has zero insecurity as an artiste, you can take liberties. So, experimenting becomes easy when one is surrounded with a team of ace players.
I love all of them, but you need guts to play Cuckoo. It will be very interesting to take on the role as a male actor, but it’s equally challenging for a female. Kubbra Sait is on top of her game and what a performance. Wow! But main Cukoo ka part karega (I would want to play Cukoo).



In Sacred Games, the apocalypse is near; there is no time to rest


I have a couple of plays to work on. First is a play written by Amir Nizar Zuabi, a Palestinian play writer-director, which is called Mai Hoon Yusuf Aur Ye Hain Mera Bhai. It’s a translated Hindi play to be performed at the Prithvi Theatre in September.
Writing is out of plain interest. I love music so much that I desire to pen down lyrics and it brings joy, but the true satisfaction I receive is through acting - it’s my passion. Having said that, acting is just a by-product of my life, it isn’t my entire life.
A few people wrote to me that they will treat police constables with respect henceforth, which I think is heart warming. There is a deep contentment in touching lives and shaping opinions, even if it’s just one person.

Burt Reynolds, star of film, TV and tabloids, dead at 82 ","Burt Reynolds, whose good looks and charm made him one of Hollywood's most popular actors as he starred in films such as “Deliverance,” “The Longest Yard” and “Smokey and the Bandit” in the 1970s and '80s, has died at age 82.
Reynolds died on Thursday morning at the Jupiter Medical Center in Florida, his manager, Erik Kritzer, said in an email.
“It is with a broken heart that I said goodbye to my uncle today,” Reynolds' niece Nancy Lee Hess said in a statement sent to Reuters by Kritzer.
“My uncle was not just a movie icon; he was a generous, passionate and sensitive man, who was dedicated to his family, friends, fans and acting students,” she added.
Burton Leon Reynolds Jr. was born on February 11, 1936, and grew up in Florida. He was a fine athlete and played football at Florida State University in the 1950s before his professional football hopes were dashed by injuries suffered in a car crash.
He began acting after enrolling in a junior college. He moved to New York and landed minor stage and TV roles before making his film debut in 1961. Reynolds often was cast in Westerns, including the popular “Gunsmoke” television series in the 1960s.
In 1972, the same year “Deliverance” was released, he showed versatility by also starring in Woody Allen's comedy “Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex * But Were Afraid to Ask.”
Reynolds starred in romantic comedies as well, including ”Starting Over” (1979) with Jill Clayburgh and Candice Bergen, and in the musical comedy “The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas” (1982) with Dolly Parton.
His film career stalled in the mid-1980s with several misfires and he was never again a leading movie star.
Reynolds turned to television and had a successful run on the situation comedy “Evening Shade,” co-starring Marilu Henner and Charles Durning. He continued to appear in films in lesser but sometimes noteworthy roles.
He earned his only career Oscar nomination playing a porn director — a role he despised — in director Paul Thomas Anderson's “Boogie Nights” (1997), starring Mark Wahlberg.
Reynolds experienced some health issues later in his life. He underwent quintuple heart bypass surgery in 2010 and was hospitalized in intensive care in 2013 with the flu.
At the peak of his career, Reynolds was one of the most bankable actors in the film industry, reeling off a series of box office smashes until a career downturn in the mid-1980s. He rebounded in 1997 with a nomination for a best supporting actor Academy Award for “Boogie Nights,” and won an Emmy for his role in the 1990-1994 TV series “Evening Shade.”
With his trademark mustache, rugged looks and macho aura, Reynolds was a leading sex symbol of the 1970s. He once appeared naked in a centerfold in the women's magazine Cosmopolitan in 1972.
Reynolds' personal life sometimes overshadowed his movies, including marriages that ended in divorce to actresses Loni Anderson and Judy Carne and romances with Sally Field and Dinah Shore, among others. His financial woes and his struggles with prescription pain medication also generated attention.
Reynolds cited director John Boorman's Oscar-nominated 1972 ”Deliverance” as his best film and said he regretted that the hoopla from his Cosmopolitan appearance detracted from the movie that made him a star. He played tough-guy Lewis Medlock — opposite Jon Voight, Ned Beatty and Ronny Cox — in the chilling tale of a canoe trip gone bad in rural Georgia.
He starred in dozens of films, also including “White Lightning” (1973), “W.W. and the Dixie Dancekings” (1975), ”Hustle” (1975), “Nickelodeon” (1976) and “Semi-Tough” (1977). He was the top money-making star at the box office in an annual poll of movie exhibitors 1978 through 1982.
Many of Reynolds' films were set in the South. He often played a lovable rascal who outwits local authorities, as in director Hal Needham's 1977 crowd-pleasing action comedy “Smokey and the Bandit,” co-starring his girlfriend Field and Jackie Gleason, and its two sequels.
Another of his better roles was that of a former pro quarterback who lands in prison and assembles a team of convicts to play the warden's squad of brutal prison guards in 1974's rollicking “The Longest Yard,” directed by Robert Aldrich. He appeared in a supporting role in 2005's remake with Adam Sandler.
Reynolds also directed several movies in which he starred, including “Gator” (1976), “The End” (1978), “Sharky's Machine” (1981) and “Stick” (1985).
While some of his performances were critically praised, others were ridiculed, particularly in the bloated action comedy ”Cannonball Run II,” a sequel to his financial success “The Cannonball Run” (1981). He also starred in the notorious 1975 musical flop “At Long Last Love,” a film so atrocious that director Peter Bogdanovich publicly apologized for making it.
Reynolds turned down notable roles including Han Solo in ”Star Wars,” which went to Harrison Ford; the title role in a James Bond film; and the astronaut in “Terms of Endearment” that Jack Nicholson turned into an Oscar-winning performance.
His niece said that although he had had health issues in the past, his death was unexpected.
“My uncle was looking forward to working with Quentin Tarantino, and the amazing cast that was assembled,” she said.
He was expected to be in Tarantino's 2019 movie “Once Upon a Time in Hollywood”, according to movie and television information website IMDb.
Reynolds said in 2012 that he regretted some of his film choices. “I took the part that was the most fun — 'Oh, this will be fun.' I didn't take the part that would be the most challenging,” he told television interviewer Piers Morgan.
Asked to come up with his own epitaph, Reynolds said, “He lived a hell of a life, and did his best — his very best — not to hurt anybody.”

Rushes: Carpet Carnival
","Deepika Padukone not only won awards for her acting but also won the nod of the fashionistas when she turned up in a red sheer and appliqué gown designed by Zuhair Murad. The lace work added to the subtle charm. Sridevi was equally graceful in an Oscar de Lenta black gown. Priyanka Chopra looked stylish in a Monique Lhuillier outfit with smoky eyes. Kareena Kapoor turned up in a stunning black Armani gown. The plunging neckline could have created trouble but Kareena carried it off with grace. However, Sonakshi Sinha overdid it in an Aamit Agrawal outfit which accentuated her curves.
The usually dependable Bipasha Basu and Malaika Arora didn’t add anything to their reputation as they played safe with black in Rocky S and Shivam and Naresh creations. Among the second line, Dia Mirza picked the ever reliable Sabyasachi Mukherjee’s full sleeved sequined pink gown that made a loud understatement. Nimrat Kaur impressed with her traditional Vikram Phadnis sari and mang tika, newbie Vaani Kapoor dared to bare in a Rakesh Agrawal gown and Kalki Koechlin looked statuesque in a Gaurav Gupta creation. However, Parineeti Chopra baffled with her outlandish choices. So did Richa Chadda and Monali Thakur.

Modi Effect

The impact of Narendra Modi could be felt in Tampa as well. Anjani Pandey, a local of Indian origin who came to watch the IIFA event, said that Smriti Irani and Tarun Vijay have already visited the county months before the election, and if he is to be believed, they made the participants speak to BJP’s Prime Ministerial candidate as well. Tampa has about 35,000 residents of Indian origin and many of them are Patels from Gujarat. So it was not a slip of tongue when Shatrughan Sinha declared from the stage that India should vote for a candidate who is courageous and a man of conviction. A seasoned Hindi film critic commented that Tampa is also suffering from Modiabind (an alliteration of motiabind which means cataract) and Namonia .

The Young Guns

Siddharth Malhotra turned out to be the best known young male actor at the event. Every time his face was splashed on the big screen, the crowd roared in unison. Besides him, such enthusiasm was shown only for Hrithik Roshan and Ranveer Singh. It came as a surprise for the media because Siddharth is just two films old and his performance at the event lacked energy. One actor who was eager to be seen was Gulshan Grover. He was among the first ones to be on the carpet, irrespective of its colour, and was eager to give sound bytes like “I like to party”, and when nothing worked he delivered his good old ‘bad man’ punch. Trying to be cool, he carried two pairs of sunglasses. One on the eyes and the other in the pocket!

Selfie-obsession

The selfie craze was seen at IIFA as well when co-host Shahid Kapur decided to take a selfie which included Kevin Spacey among others. Now Spacey was part of this year’s Oscar selfie as well which brought Twitter house down, but no such obsession was shown by Bollywood fans. Not to be outdone, before starting her performance with “Ek Do Teen”, Madhuri Dixit, who looked a little overweight, took a selfie with the cheering crowd. Then there was a belfie as well — where Farhan Akhtar, Shahid, Boman Irani and Govinda flaunted their derriere and Bipasha Basu clicked.

‘Bigg Boss’ on Malayalam television
"," 
Sixteen contestants, 100 days, one big house and… all eyes. As Bigg Boss Malayalam, hosted by Mohanlal premières this Sunday (June 24), the Malayali audience will get a look at celebrities going to stay under the same roof for over three months in a show of camaraderie and battle of wits. Cut off from the rest of the world, the “housemates” will be seen and judged only through the eagle eyes of cameras as the ‘Bigg Boss’ acts as the conscience-keeper between the participants and the audience. The show is modelled on the Dutch reality game show Big Brother.
Once in, the house becomes ‘the world’ for the contestants. “They hand over their belongings and every single accessory sealed in a basket before setting foot in the house. All 16 contestants are then safely ‘locked’ in by the host in the opening day. They live together in the same house under the same conditions doing different things and it gets as real as it can. This is a show where you don’t have any retakes,” says Reghu Ramachandran, senior vice-president of Asianet.
With no access to newspaper, cable television, Internet or mobile phones in line with the show’s format, the contestants’ only door to the outside world is through the Bigg Boss. “Their only connect to the outside world will be through the ‘voice’. All the contestants, once they enter the house as the show starts rolling, are supposed to be a family. Everyone only sees each other as they wake up every day. But that’s where the unpredictability comes in. We wait and see how they start regarding each other as the show progresses and how they nominate for a co-participant’s eviction,” says Reghu.
The host “appears” before them, of course only virtually, twice a week for eviction nominations and “confessions”, and unbeknown to the contestants, eliminations are based on “voting” from the audience. “Voting lines through SMS and online voting will be open for the public till the last minute of the eviction on a particular week. Ultimately, it’s the show’s followers who get to decide who goes out on a weekly basis until the last man standing,” says Hafiz Shamsudeen, associate creative head of the show.
At the film city in Mumbai, better known as Dadsaheb Phalke Chitranagri, the stage is set. Purpose-built in about 40 days for an “undisclosed budget”, the fully furnished “isolated house” is tailor-made to host the 16 dwellers. Brainchild of architect Shyam Bhatia, who has previously worked with Bigg Boss Hindi and Bigg Boss Kannada, the house itself is a work of art with a kitschy interior décor and a sophisticated “behind-the-scenes” monitoring system that incorporates a comprehensive network of cameras and microphones to capture each and every movement and sound.
The Bigg Boss house comes with a single large hall in the middle that triples up as living room, dining area and kitchen. Two separate large bedrooms with glass partitions for male and female contestants adjoin. Separately, there’s a pool, a gym area and ‘smoking area’ outside. The highlight is the ‘confession room’, where the housemates get to “speak and confess” to the Bigg Boss. This is also where they put in their nominations for elimination. 
A touch of Kerala
Artworks display a mix of the experimental and the traditional. “We wanted the experiences, the life, the wonder and the pleasures of Kerala on a canvas and we have tried to capture this through the intricate interior artworks and murals, especially on the bedroom walls. We have also represented the traditional art forms of Kerala there. The idea is that the contestants will become conscious of the artwork around and hopefully this will reflect in their behaviour too, though physically they stay miles away from the State,” explains Shyam. The experimental part comes in on the flooring and ceiling. “They are done in a triangular-chequered pattern. There’s a lot of research work that went into their conceptualisation. You’ll know all that one you see the house for yourself on Sunday,” says Shyam with a chuckle.
Keeping round-the-clock watch on the contestants are about 60 cameras, both wall-mounted and hand-held ones fixed on trolleys. Each contestant will also be wearing a lapel microphone, except when sleeping or taking a shower. “The entire house is encircled by a camera gulley on the other side of one-sided mirrors. The housemates cannot see these cameras but we see them all the time. If any member of our technical crew has to enter the camera gulley, we follow a dress code of black to avoid any possibility of detection by the contestants,” says Shounak Ghosh, director of the production control room. Replenishment of provisions are done at a ‘store room’ and contestants are informed of re-fuels via ‘alarm bells.’
However, the biggest surprise will be the contestants, and the makers of the show are keeping the list as a guarded secret until the première. “But rest assured, it’ll be a mixed gang and for the first season of the show, we can expect only Malayali contestants,” says Hafiz, while indicating with a smile that that is all the information he’s ready to provide for the time being.
 Bigg Boss Malayalam season 1 premières this Sunday. The show will be telecast Monday to Friday 9.30 pm and Saturday and Sunday 9 pm on Asianet.

'Unsolved': No light at the end of this tunnel
","Spearheaded by the American Crime Story series, true crime anthology is the latest buzz in the American TV industry, and Unsolved is its newest addition. ‘The only thing more intriguing than the lives of famous people, are their deaths’ seems to be the mantra, and Unsolved dives into the conspiracies and investigations around the murders of 90s’ rappers Tupac Shakur and Christopher ‘Biggie Smalls’ Wallace. Both murders took place a few months apart, and while there was evidence to suggest they may have been related, investigative agencies failed to unearth a link. In fact, both murders remain unsolved to this day.
By its very definition, Unsolved is about botched-up police investigations and failed attempts; you know, at the outset, there will be no light at the end of the tunnel here. Yet, what Unsolved does well is break down the mechanisms of an investigation, twice over. The first, by the Los Angeles Police Department in 1997 after Wallace was shot, and the second in 2007, when the case was reopened by a Special Task Force. Both investigations unfold concurrently, alongside a third track revolving around Shakur and Wallace’s friendship, and eventual parting. 
This is a smart, even if complex, storytelling device, and what makes the show stand apart from its competition. Unsolved has neither the depth of the OJ Simpson story, nor the inherent thrill of Manhunt: Unabomber, but it has an infectious verve that keeps you invested, and actors who commit to their parts with ease. The standout among them is Jimmi Simpson (Westworld), playing the socially-awkward and obsessive detective, Russell Poole, working on the Wallace case in the ’97 chapter, and who speaks at all times — it seems — in a whisper.
What Unsolved also benefits from immensely is the involvement of Anthony Hemingway, who directed the OJ Simpson chapter of the American Crime Story series. Hemingway and the other series directors lend a distinct personality to each of the three timelines, shooting them in different hues and palettes, yet binding them together with consistently smooth transitions and seamless plotting. 
It takes a couple of episodes to fully grasp the various intermingling strands — the East Coast-West Coast rivalry among rappers in the 1990s; the interdepartmental tension between police forces; the several suspects, some of whose names crop up in both murders — but the narrative begins to settle down nicely once the framework is laid out. A sense of repetition creeps in midway through the season (but that may be by design), as characters go sniffing after new leads but end up right where they started. 
The finest police procedurals don’t just obsess over breakthroughs and revelations, but focus on the mundane and dry quality of an investigation before that eureka moment arrives (Bosch, on Amazon, is a shining example). The best moments of Unsolved, too, lie in tired conversations between cops at the end of frustratingly unproductive days, during long lookouts outside suspects’ homes, and at weekend barbecue brunches. Even true crime isn’t always glamorous, and that’s just fine.
The first season of Unsolved is now streaming on Netflix.

Second season of ‘Sacred Games’ will continue with original team: Netflix
"," The second season of Sacred Games will continue on Netflix with the original team at the helm. A statement from Netflix on Tuesday said: “After an independent investigation, the results helped inform Netflix’s decision to continue with Vikramaditya Motwane and Anurag Kashyap on season 2 of Sacred Games. We continue to collaborate with our production partners to ensure and maintain a safe and respectful working environment.” 
The project had been greenlit with Vikramaditya Motwane continuing as the showrunner and Neeraj Ghaywan joining in, directing the Sartaj track to Mr. Kashyap’s Gaitonde strand. The streaming platform had temporarily put the season 2 on hold pending investigation in the light of the sexual harassment allegations against lead writer Varun Grover that Mr. Grover had very strongly and categorically denied. 
Both Mr. Motwane and Mr. Kashyap had also been facing flak for not handling the sexual harassment charges against Phantom partner Vikas Bahl with seriousness and alacrity.

From college to University
","A definite step towards the University social life in Bangalore was taken on March 3, 1930 when University Union was inaugurated by Dr. E P Metcalfe. The University Council entrusted the management of the Union in its initial stages to a provisional Working Committee, and after the first annual elections held on August 13, 1930 Prof. C. R. Narayana Rao was nominated the first President of the Union. The main aim of the Union was to create a necessary atmosphere for fostering in the minds of the rising generation, and the future citizens of our state, the ideals of true and enlightened citizenship. The membership of the union was compulsory for both the teaching staff and the students of the Central and Engineering Colleges and optional for Intermediate College and Medical School. 
The Union provided a well-equipped reading room and amenities to play indoor games like chess, draughts, carom, ping pong and these were very popular among the members. Equally well attended were the literary, drama and musical events. An outstanding event in the history of the Union was the debate held in October 1933 in which the members of the British Universities’ Debating Team participated and appreciated the Union activities. Similarly, a debating team visited from the United Provinces in January 1935. 
University Union had its own independent building to carry out its activities. Even today it exists in its original form to the left, at the beginning of Palace Road which starts from Kempe Gowda Road. Indian Council for Historical Research is located on the first floor of this heritage structure.
It is very interesting to note that Central College had started a hostel for its students more than a hundred years ago, perhaps one of the earliest Government hostels to come up in the city.
After the Plague outbreak in Bangalore in the year 1898, Dr. John Cook, the then Principal desired that all the students who came from the rural areas should live in a healthy locality close to the college, instead of staying in infected parts of the city either in small rented rooms or in friends or relatives houses. He urged the Government to acquire the land attached to the then Kitchetty Choultry and to build two residential buildings with necessary kitchens and out-houses large enough to accommodate ninety-six boarders. The Government sanctioned the proposal and immediately instructed the Department of Public Works to complete the building as early as possible. 
They started the work in the beginning of the 1900 and completed both the buildings by the end of the same year, and handed over the same to the Principal, so that he could allow the students to occupy the new hostel on their return to College after the Christmas holidays. 
Meanwhile, the Principal had prepared the list of the students who were in need of such assistance and the hostel started functioning from February 1, 1901. A small library and reading room and little recreation facilities were also provided. A small dispensary under the care of an assistant surgeon was attached to the hostel for the benefit of the boarders. 
In the beginning, a full time superintendent was appointed. 
Subsequently, Government wanted the Hostels in the state to be self supporting institutions, and consequently, the College Hostel was converted into a grant-in-aid institution in 1908. Since then, the Principal was assisted by a resident Warden who used to be one of the faculty members of the college. Many stalwarts like C.R. Narayana Rao of Zoology, Dr. M.A. Sampat Kumaran of Botony, Prof. B.S. Madhava Rao of Mathematics Departments have served as the resident wardens of the Students Hostel. 
Even after 118 years, the hostel buildings, the identical twin heritage beauties of the city, can be seen in their original form to the left of Palace Road, a building after ICHR. 
Just like in academics, students excelled in literary, cultural and sports too. For over a decade from 1888. The Central College was the despair of all opposing teams, local and moffusil, in both cricket and tennis. Mr. J.G. Tait, a great sports man himself, was coaching the cricket team. This was a great inspiration to the college team to maintain superiority over all other teams in the annual Madras Cricket Tourneys and carry off finally the Brandt Hutchins Trophy by winning it successively for three years in 1893, 1894 and 1895. For several decades, Intermediate College field was the venue for all important cricket matches in the city.
In tennis too, for the first one decade the College remained unbeaten, winning the Girdlestone Trophy in Bangalore and the Travancore Tennis Trophy at Madras. The reputation of the College in hockey and football became popular after 1915 and brought laurels to the College. Even in gymnastics and athletics, the fame of the College had spread far and wide..
In 1920 itself a little attempt was made to begin Scouting. However, in 1923, ‘The University Rovers Corps’ was brought into being and the scouting formally entered the precincts of the Central College. Soon, the Corps were called for service by the Bangalore Session of the Indian National Congress in January 1924. Training in Musketry and first aid formed the principal occupations of the Corps for a number of years. 
Thus, in the first sixty years of its existence and during the subsequent decades, Central College has retained its distinct identity. 
Now, it belongs to the newly formed Bangalore Central University (BCU).

Revenge of the birds ","The wait is over. The most expensive Indian film has hit the theatres. I was reminded of 2007 when I was invited to watch the premiere of ‘No.73, Shanti Nivasa’, a remake of ‘Bawarchi’ directed by Sudeep. The mall where the show was held was teeming with people late in the night, it was surprising. The halls showing films were barely filled, but the box-office was besieged. Fans had thronged the aisles clamouring for tickets to watch ‘Sivaji’ due to hit the screens the next day. That sort of pre-release craze for Rajni’s films has died down post ‘Kabali’, and the fact that it barely delivered what the trailer promised. Even Shankar wielding the megaphone and considering the fact that that his previous collaborations with the superstar set the box-office ablaze failed to fan pre-release fanaticism for ‘2.0’. The advance bookings were just about average. Tickets were easily available for any show on the first day in Bengaluru in most multiplexes. Fans will unleash a Twitter backlash but these are plain facts. The reviews and collection figures from across the country are mixed. There was a freefall in the collections on the second day but things seem to have improved, marginally. The producers, Lyca Productions are claiming that the film is a mega blockbuster and nobody but Subashkaran will be privy to the truth because they’ve distributed the film themselves in most places.
I watched the morning show on Monday, the fifth day following the film’s release at a multiplex and there were eight others beside me. “Don’t go by that,” says Venkatesh Reddy, who owns and controls theatres in the city. “The 2D version is a washout but collections have been encouraging wherever the 3D version is playing. If the producers had invested in helping single screens convert into 3D format instead of asking them to bear the cost the film would have done much better. I think the time taken and the cost just tired them out and made them want to get it over with,” says the veteran distributor also blaming the Government for the number of single screens being razed down. “The producers of ‘My Dear Kuttichathan’ had the foresight and helped theatre owners convert in a phased manner resulting in the film’s success,” says Venkatesh.
A Rajnikanth film does not need or depend on technical wizardry, never has but for Shankar who prescribes puerile placebos for serious social ills spectacular cinematography and opulent sets are a shield for his shallow storytelling abilities. His protagonists have always taken the law into their hands right from ‘Gentleman’ playing vigilante. Of course, the convenient excuse is that the so called protectors are also the perpetrators. Shankar dazzles you with form rather than making you reflect or ponder. He’s good at pointing out problems but the solutions doled out are purely cinematic and violent. The so-called comedy in his films is embarrassing and his handling of romantic sequences leaves you cold. Even Kamal who can make the most insipid of scenes look convincing looked all at sea in the sequences with Urmila and Manisha in ‘Indian’.
Cinema offers solutions that we wish were practical. Capitation fees have skyrocketed since Shankar made his directorial debut in ‘Gentleman’ which dealt with it. Little or nothing has changed. Technology is a necessary evil and in a world where human life has little value how many will give up the mobile phone to save hapless birds? ‘2.0’ is strangely about a robot designed to fight a force that has been wronged and surprisingly only in Tamil Nadu. Mobile phones are sucked into space and a huge container loaded with replenishments is destroyed only after it crosses into Tamil Nadu. Anyway a flashback shows Akshay Kumar -- styled to look like ornithologist Salim Ali -- distressed that the increase in bandwidth has birds disoriented and falling from the skies. As in most Shankar films we have him complaining to apathetic politicians and police officers. He commits suicide, hanging from a cell phone tower and returning in the form of a giant bird to take revenge. Now this is what a hero in a Shankar film would normally do so why do we have the scientist Vaseegaran reviving the robot Chitti to fight him? It’s a moral dilemma that Shankar does not deal with convincingly. The sequences are unnecessarily lengthy and pointless making most of the proceedings tiresome. The scientist sitting in a van being tossed around is embarrassing. Shankar is clueless about where the plot is heading and in desperation introduces various versions of Rajni in different styles and sizes. Rajni is even made to perform a takeoff on a scene from ‘Anniyan’ which evoked applause. In the end Rajni explains that Pakshi Raja the character played by Akshay was a good guy whose modus operandi was all wrong. Isn’t that what all our heroes do on-screen whether it’s stalking the heroine or mercilessly killing the baddies?
Rajni’s fans are already claiming dizzying collection figures worldwide. I hope the producer Subashkaran agrees. Fans also wanted their Thalaiver’s film to beat the box-office collections of ‘Bahubali’ but then the superbly made fantasy had a strong story and a riveting narrative beside the well executed visuals. 
Form can never compensate for lack of content and ‘2.0’ has just Rajni which is no longer enough.

Fawning around the world, Sanju style
"," Since India has welcomed with open wallets a fawning biopic about an erstwhile film star and convicted criminal, let us look around the world at more such examples. Just a couple of months ago, the venerable Cannes Film Festival allotted a slot to Gotti, a hagiographic account of the New York mob boss that whitewashes him and his many crimes. Sound familiar? John Travolta plays Gotti. My chief interest in the film is that Kevin Connolly, the actor who memorably played Eric in Entourage, directs it. Best to watch Entourage reruns instead of Gotti. 




Unlike Laura Poitras’ riveting Oscar and BAFTA winning documentary on American whistleblower Edward Snowden, Citizenfour (2014), renowned filmmaker Oliver Stone’s Snowden (2016) amounts to little more than adulation. Coming from Stone, this is strange, given that he has delivered two masterly biopics, JFK and The Doors (both 1991), but not so much when you consider Nixon (1995), that erred on the side of fawning. While on the subject of US presidents, there are plenty of lionising biopics including PT109 (1963) that looks at JF Kennedy as a war hero; Southside with You (2016), an embarrassingly saccharine look at the young Michelle and Barack Obama; and Primary Colors (1998) that hero-worshipped Bill Clinton.
Actress Barbara Windsor is one of Britain’s national treasures, known for her Carry On movies and the long running television soap EastEnders. Babs (2017), the BBC television film on Windsor, is an enervating, reverential version of her life. At least the Australian television mini-series Olivia Newton-John: Hopelessly Devoted to You (2018) makes its veneration clear in the title itself. 
Or, look at the documentary Chasing Madoff (2010), about how investigator Harry Markopolos spent a decade trying to expose stockbroker Bernie Madoff’s fraudulent dealings. My amazement on why the film ends up deifying Markopolos swiftly vanished when I realised that the documentary is based on his book. 
Thankfully, the number of more-or-less objective biopics far outnumber the fawning ones, exposing some warts at least. It is a long list that includes the likes of Lawrence of Arabia (1962), Malcolm X (1992), The Last Emperor (1987), The Social Network (2010) and Amadeus (1984), to name just a few. In some cases, these can be downright disturbing like Paul Schrader’s Mishima: A Life In Four Chapters (1985), a reimagining of the life and art of Japanese author and playwright Yukio Mishima who publicly committed seppuku in 1970. 




Perhaps what prompts filmmakers to make fawning biopics time and again is that their audience wants to see sanitised versions of their heroines and heroes on screen, in the face of a cruel and uncaring world. If there is money in pabulum, make it, appears to be the mantra. After all, there is no god greater than mammon. Which brings us neatly to the upcoming Freddie Mercury biopic, Bohemian Rhapsody. The trailer promises a greatest hits highlight reel, and millions of Queen fans, including me, will go and watch it as soon as it releases, fawning be damned.

","Pretty Woman star Julia Roberts walked the red carpet on Friday to promote her first television series, Amazon Studios’ Homecoming, at the Toronto International Film Festival.
Ms. Roberts, 50, is the latest major Hollywood star to transition to television, joining the likes of Jane Fonda, Meryl Streep and John Travolta. Many like Roberts have signed on to shows by streaming services like Amazon and Netflix, which are drawing audiences away from traditional television.
Ms. Roberts shrugged off the attention her switch to the small screen has garnered.
The psychological thriller, based on an eponymous podcast, stars Ms. Roberts as Heidi Bergman, a caseworker employed at a secret government facility in a programme called Homecoming that is meant to help veterans returning from war transition into civilian life.

Riding the wave: Neil Bhoopalam and Kalki Koechlin on their latest show 'Smoke' ","When we sit down to chat, actor Neil Bhoopalam jokingly sings a few high notes into the recorder placed in front of him, and later even breaks out into an impromptu impression of Jackie Chan. Whether these are the effects of too many cups of coffee or not is unclear, but in between these moments he seems rather pensive and measured with his words. The actor, along with Smoke co-star Kalki Koechlin, talks to Weekend about the web series that premièred yesterday, the potential of online content, and other works in the pipeline.
What drew Bhoopalam to the crime drama exploring the gritty underbelly of Goa was his character, Savio. “He is a chef, and he is deaf and mute,” he says, adding, “I’ve never worked in the underworld space before. If I like the world that is on paper and my character, [I look at] how I can add value to it. It will only be me who can pull that off as a performer,” says the 35-year-old actor, who was approached by Faisal Malik from Hamari Film Company for Smoke. On the other hand, Koechlin plays a Portuguese DJ, Tara. “Her passion is compromised because she has to do it in this environment — of a mafia world,” he says.
Directed by Neel Guha (That Girl in Yellow Boots), the 11-episode series also stars Jim Sarbh, Mandira Bedi and Gulshan Devaiah. “While the role I’m choosing should be challenging, I also like to see how much fun I can have on set,” Bhoopalam says with a laugh. “At the end of it you are going to spend many hours with these people. They are going to become like your family,” shares the actor, who has worked with Sarbh in Koechlin’s directorial theatrical début, The Living Room.
As Bhoopalam and Koechlin balance working in numerous mediums — theatre, film, and series — they are equally excited with the potential that Indian’s online content holds. The country’s digital game is relatively young, but we have seen a few wins. The most recent being Smoke’s première at MIPCOM (an annual global entertainment market at Cannes) on October 15, and Amazon’s Inside Edge nomination for the International Emmy Awards.
Koechlin believes that the absence of censorship allows for the exploration of complicated adult content. “And with this complexity comes a realism which is important to our cinema [because] we don’t have that culture very much in our commercial [films]” she says on a follow-up phone call, adding, “As an actor, even if you aren’t playing the main lead, you have a much meatier role because of the length [afforded by the medium]. The fact that there might be [more] seasons gives us a sort of permanence. Otherwise it has always been like ‘Okay, abhi kya (now what)?’ after every movie.” Koechlin will soon be seen in the Amazon series Made in Heaven and a film with Rana Daggubati, Haathi Mere Saathi.
Bhoopalam, who was also seen in 24, the Indian television remake of the American political thriller, reveals it was Anurag Kashyap’s 2009 film Dev.D (which featured Koechlin in her first prominent role on screen) that made him want to join films. “It was proof that you don’t have to come from a family of actors,” says the former VJ, who will next be seen in the series Ikigai on MX Player and 4 More Shots Please.
Koechlin is looking forward to her role in Shakespeare’s The Rape of Lucrece that will be staged at NCPA, Mumbai, later next month. “It is especially relevant today given the #MeToo movement. I have supported the movement but refrained from actually commenting on individual cases which I don’t know the details of. But it’s going to make us much more aware of sexual harassment and hopefully result in a cleaner, more equal environment especially at work,” she concludes.
All episodes of Smoke are now streaming on Eros Now

A comedian’s responsibilty is only to stay true to himself, says Aravind SA
","Aravind SA is an expert when it comes to selfies, angling the phone with careful precision to get the best shot. “This side okay va? Light and all?,” he asks one of his interviewers, to a roomfull of laughter. 
SA, who says he has given up on media ever since his first solo show, Madrasi Da, and its ‘controversial’ lungi dance bit was out, requested a quirky interview; something ‘out of the box’. After running through several alternatives, we decided to gather people — who may or may not be his fans — and give them a chance to ask some, hopefully, tough questions.
After multiple phone calls, about seven people gather at newly opened Novotel, Chamiers Road, patiently waiting for SA to walk in. He arrives, fashionably late by 10 minutes — ‘cinema style’, as he likes to call it. 
Shoot!
“For a stand-up comic, I understand that language is the greatest tool for communication. So, does being a comic from Chennai restrict your canvas when you travel elsewhere?” asks Shreya Subramanian, officially initiating our seemingly serious discourse on comedy. SA answers that in his initial days, his shows were well within the boundaries of familiarity, sprinkled with local references. 
“It was easy for people to write off Madrasi Da because the name itself suggested that there are only regional references in it. With I Was Not Ready Da, which I am touring with now, I have made the conscious effort to workshop it in unfamiliar areas like Bombay or Gurgaon,” says SA, adding that the challenge lies in straying away from the established format but sticking to the relatable elements at the same time.
When Anagha Natraj asks about how funny he was as a kid, SA chuckles, “I don’t know about funny but I was definitely dramatic all my life.” Reminiscing about his days at school, he says he believes that drama is the essence from which any form of expression takes shape. 




“I was always in the thick of things everywhere and in retrospect, I realise that I was a big attention-seeker. The funny guys played off my jokes; I was the Senthil to a Goundamani,” he quips much to the delight of the company who nods in appreciation of the fitting allegory.
 SA does not see his journey to being a stand-up comic as one that was born out of sacrifice or great difficulties. To Swetha Girirajan’s question of how he turned his passion into profession and his family’s reaction, he replies, “I did not plan any of this. Truth be told, I just realised that I was bad at pretty much everything else. It took my parents two years to realise that I am doing stand-up comedy for real,” he chuckles. 
“Was filmmaking a planned venture or was it exploratory?” asks Naveen Kumar. SA replies, nodding his head fervently, “I had so much of drama in me that I felt the need to express it somewhere and cinema was that canvas,” says SA, adding that Nayagan is one of the few films that inspired him greatly during his school days. 
“It’s a movie that I cried to. Each time the song ‘Thenpaandi’ played, I would go to my mom crying and ask her if all of us would die someday,” laughs SA. However, he says that cinema is a field that youngsters get easily lured by, not fully understanding the actual task at hand. 
As the conversation steers back to his stand-up comedy, SA reveals that he is often shown contempt by some audiences with high and absurd expectations.
“Some people accuse you of reusing your content. How do you respond to this?,” asks Prasith Babu. “Accusation is a strong word,” quips SA, explaining, “People come to the same show in different months and ask me why I am repeating jokes. That doesn’t make sense at all. Some audiences don’t know how the ecosystem works.” 
Finally, SA, responds to the argument that it is a stand-up comic’s responsibility to question power-structures, “A comedian’s responsibilty is only to stay true to himself. If he thinks that it is an extension of his voice, then great! But if you feel these are all expectations that are projected on to you, it is the comedian’s decision to take it up or not.”

Un Samayal Araiyil: Ilaiyaraaja at his best
","
What it is about…

Prakashraj Productions’ Un Samayal Araiyil is the remake of the Malayalam hit Salt N’ Pepper. The cast includes Prakash Raj, Sneha, Tejus, Samyuktha, Thambi Ramaiah, Oorvasi, Aiswarya and Kumaravel. Preetha is the cinematographer. The music is composed by Ilaiyaraaja and the lyrics are by Pazhani Bharathi. The dances are choreographed by Pony Verma. The audio was released by Ilaiyaraaja and received by the whole unit of the film.

What they say…


Producer, director and hero Prakash Raj: Directing is a creative job and I am happy to do it. As I am directing only one film at a time, I am relaxed. I am blessed to work with maestro Ilaiyaraaja for the second time; our first film together was Dhoni. The maestro has given me some wonderful tunes.

Music director Ilaiyaraaja: Prakash wanted a song that would have all things associated with the kitchen. We sat down to write the lines for it. Usually, when I leave the recording theatre I forget music and try to concentrate on other things. But for the first time, I was thinking only about the song. The very next day, when I was having a bath, the line flashed through my mind. I immediately rushed to the studio, called Prakash and told him about it. He said that was what he needed and used it as the opening line of the song, ‘Intha Porapputhan’.

Music Highlights: There are four songs in the album and one could feel the maestro’s enthusiasm in each. The last one, ‘Kaatru Veliyil’, sung by Ilaiyaraaja, is the best. ‘Intha Porapputhan’ sung by Kailash Kher is an interesting track about what one craves for in life. Pazhani Bharathi’s lines for the song are striking. ‘Eeramai Eeramai’, sung by Ranjit and Vibhavari, is attractive, while ‘TherindhoTheriyamalo’ sung by Karthik and Ramya is another melody that has the distinct stamp of Ilaiyaraaja.

Sip, sipper, blend
","Diva of talk shows Oprah Winfrey’s tea brand, Oprah Chai Tea hits the shelves this week.
“I like things really spicy, I like things chai’d up,” declares Oprah in a YouTube video that details her search for a blend that would reflect her.
Oprah is seen selecting “more enticing” flavours, and rejecting the ones that are “not robust enough”.
“As this process was going on and on (at Starbucks tasting room), I could tell that the tea needed a little more ginger and a little more pepper... I like things that have a little kick to them,” she explains.
Oprah Chai Tea, finally ready, is described as a bold mix of cinnamon, ginger, cardamom and cloves, blended with loose-leaf black tea and rooibos. The operative word here is blended or blending, which is also the topic of this week’s column
Why is tea blended? What is the art of blending?
The obvious reason is to create a totally separate identity for the tea, different from the original.
The most challenging factor in blending is achieving consistency, so that the blend sipped anytime of the year, anywhere, tastes the same. The challenge of consistency arises from the fact that tea crops are influenced by the vagaries of nature.
Now, creating a blend for a personality – Oprah Chai Tea being an example – calls for an approach vastly different from the one required in creating a blend for a particular market.
Bespoke teas address the challenge of matching a brew with a personality.
“It is a fascinating art, one that requires reading the mind of the consumer,” says the blender and speaks about the grammar of tea.
Oprah’s tea should be bold and robust like her. A brand for Beckhman, or closer home, for Amitabh Bachchan, would necessarily be stylish and made using high-grown orthodox leaves. Strong CTC dust or full-bodied Assams would best describe Rajnikanth.
A light flavoury cup made using cold-weather Nilgiris would match mellow, romantic beings.
On the subject of customised blends, here’s a little anecdote about renowned financier J.P. Morgan.
A lover of fine living and tea, his personal blend was dissed by a blender who called it “the worst tea” he had ever tasted.
Morgan replied, irritated, “What do you know about tea? Nothing.”
The blend, still being sold, is a combination of Formosa oolong, black teas and Lapsang Souchong.

Tea Sangria

(Make Tea Sangria to match your personality. Add fruits that best describe you or choose the tea that defines you)
Strong black tea infusion – one litre
Sugar – to taste
One grapefruit or a bunch of green grapes
Pineapple – half
Ripe mango – one
Lemon – one, squeezed for juice
lce cubes
Prepare tea infusion and sweeten with sugar to taste and cut grapefruit, pineapple and mango into bite-sized pieces. Put fruits in a punch bowl with infusion. Add lemon juice, stir and refrigerate for a few hours. Serve with ice cubes.

Cirque on steroids: the circus comes to India
"," Over a period of three decades, Cirque du Soleil has developed more than 42 productions that have toured to approximately 450 cities. They have all premièred in the company’s hometown of Montreal before hitting new territories. In November, the norm changes. For the first time ever, Cirque du Soleil premieres its new show, Bazzar, outside Canada — first in Mumbai and then Delhi — before taking it to other countries. 
Written and directed by Susan Gaudreau, Bazzar pays homage to the founders of Cirque du Soleil, Guy Laliberté and Gilles Ste-Croix, buskers who established the company in 1984. Today, it is worth hundreds of millions of dollars. 
“I wanted to tap into the essence of what makes Cirque du Soleil so unique,” explains Gaudreau, who is hugely inspired by Indian cinema. Naturally, the first show to debut in the country would have to reflect her passion and “the song and dance of Bollywood with its rich colours and drama”. 
“I really wanted to do something that Indians could relate to,” she adds. While the director readily admits the influences of Bazzar, she is quick to clarify that it is not a show specifically for India. 






Full house
With 30 performers on stage, including 22 acrobats, two live musicians and a singer, Bazzar’s plot reflects the workings of a circus company. It is the story of a maestro putting together an ambitious performance, not unlike a Cirque du Soleil production. His troupe of eclectic artists includes the floating woman — a trickster hell bent on sparring with the maestro, and who ends up intentionally botching his plans. “So there’s this dynamic between the two main characters about who’s going to come on top,” explains Gaudreau, adding that Simon Carpentier, Bazzar’s composer, developed a new genre of music — folk electronica with lyrics in English, Spanish and French — for the show. “It’s a type of live music that has [instruments like] the saxophone and banjo and is very roots-based, but its bass is electronica.” 
To reflect the aesthetic of the show, costume designer James Lavoie zeroed in on the works of contemporary 20th century artists, conceptual architectural clothing, and street style. “Our number one priority is to make sure that the artists are comfortable and that they can fully concentrate on their performance,” says the designer. “We also use textiles and materials which are resistant. For example, moleskin is used very often for its comfort, breathability and its resistance.” In spite of its high-level renegade theme, the show also promises classic circus entertainment with dual trapeze acts, acrobatic bikes, contortionists, cord lisse (aerial ropes) and teeter boards. Highlights include the hairceau act, where a woman suspends herself from an aerial hoop knotted using her hair. “Every show that I create, I like to have a twist,” explains Gaudreau. “It’s either something that I never worked with before or Cirque has never worked with before,” she says, adding that the inclusion of mallakhamb — India’s answer to aerial gymastics — was a natural evolution. “It’s very exotic for us.” A first for Cirque du Soleil, two Indian mallakhamb artists, one of whom is Rajesh Mudki, will join the cast and crew from 50 nationalities.




Intimate and immersive
 As with the company’s touring norm, Bazzar comes to India in the Big Top Tent — 62 feet high and 135 feet in diameter, accommodating 1,500 people. With a mere three-day set up time, the portable venue is efficient enough to travel to both luxurious and intimate settings. “We’re packing up everything in road cases in Montreal as we speak,” says Daniel Lamarre, president and CEO of Cirque Du Soleil. 700 tonnes of equipment will then make its way to Mumbai in sea containers. “The Big Top Tent is more intimate and more immersive. It’s almost like Cirque on steroids, meaning that you’re going to be seated so close to the artists that you’ll see the sweat fall off their faces,” he laughs.
***
At home in Mumbai
Bazzar is the first event in Maharashtra to receive a single window clearance from state authorities. V K Gautam, principal secretary, Tourism and Cultural Affairs Department, Government of Maharashtra, has confirmed that the development of an online portal is underway to ensure speedy clearances for future events. With this collaboration, Lamarre expects to create revenue of more than $15 million for the state thanks to the influx of tourists. The partnership with India, he hopes, will be long-lived. He is particularly keen to bring the Cirque du Soleil’s social initiatives to the country (existing programs in other cities include working with at-risk youth ). He has not dismissed the idea of creating a permanent venue (à la Las Vegas) in Mumbai either.
Bazzar premieres on November 15 at MMRDA Grounds, BKC. Tickets, priced at ₹1,250 onwards, are available on bookmyshow.com

Not played to perfection
","Finally getting long-overdue Tony nominations this year, The Glass Menagerie has never been an easy play to start with. Overlaid by a pall of despair and abandonment, the play is based on Tenneesee Williams’ own family and was the work that first catapulted him into fame and has since been a Broadway staple.
Mumbai-based Act One Scene One’s version that played in the city on Thursday was not an ambitious production. It stuck faithfully to the original, propped by a set of solid performances with Shernaz Patel as Amanda, Ira Dubey as Laura, Jim Sarbh as Tom and Cabir Maira as James, the gentleman caller. Williams’ play is a brilliant work, the performance was more than competent, and the English was refreshingly Indian. And yet the evening was strangely unsatisfactory and I spent a long time trying to understand why. The sense of overwhelming loneliness and desolation that infuses the original play was somewhat muted in Rajit Kapur’s version. It felt lighter; more a gentle Micawber-like gloom that one believed would be raised soon, with Micawber-like optimism, until the final scene of desertion seals the nail in irrevocably. This sense of cheeriness came from Amanda, a role that Shernaz played with gusto, and of course from the witty lines themselves. The problem though when someone is as loudly jovial and interfering as Shernaz was, is that you cannot really believe that her character could send someone over the edge, as it does Tom. Or is this the Indian in me speaking? Amanda is over-solicitous, she loves her children, she talks and nags non-stop and comes across like an exaggerated version of one of those busybody aunts that every family is saddled with. There was a lack of edge in Amanda that made Tom’s angst seem rudderless.
But, equally, this could have been a Tom problem. Tom did not come across as a dreamy, idealistic writer forced to deal with the killing mundaneness of everyday survival, but rather as a petulant young man annoyed with his mother’s interfering. This made it difficult to sympathise with his melancholy or to see his ultimate desertion as anything more than lazy dereliction of duty.
Ira Dubey was easily the best as the limping, frail and painfully self-conscious Laura. Her suffering and the effort it took her to utter a single word was almost tangible. And her final blooming under the gentle persuasion of James was beautifully done. In many ways, the last act was easily the best. There was movement, there was tension, and there were some excellent performances. Shernaz as the disappointed mother was heartbreakingly good. Cabir’s brief time on stage was well spent. One of the nicest touches was the violinist on the stage, who provided the music but who also played a sort of simplistic Greek chorus role. I wish Rajit Kapur had pushed the envelope on this one, had experimented, perhaps made it shorter, crisper, and changed the setting. I was haunted by the idea of seeing the play staged in a middle-class Parsi or Bengali family. As it was, it was a fine evening of theatre but not a spectacular one.

The saga of a pioneer
","Before the digital technology enveloped us in India for recorded music, it was gramophone records and cassettes that dominated the audio world gradually making way for the CD and MP3 formats of recording to take over. One of the longest serving and well-known personally in the audio industry is H.M. Mahesh of Sangeetha Cassettes, the man who started the company in 1979 as a 35-year-old.
Tracing the 1944 Kasargod-born Mahesh’s life is essential as this ‘man with a vision’ not just found his way to flag-off the cassette world, but was responsible in sieving the best musical talents of Karnataka to showcase them to a wider audience. Born in Gadinaadu of Kasargod, Mahesh, after his B. Sc. from St. Aloysius College in Mangalore, headed straight to Madras in 1968 to acclimatize himself with the world of recorded music, as “passion to gain knowledge in this art had always been bugging me,” says the die-hard music connoisseur.
Those were the days when all South-Indian films were done in Madras. The Karnataka stars behind the film world too as Rajkumar, lyricist Udayashankar, R.N.Jayagopal, Vijay Narasimha had a stronghold there for their shootings and recordings. “As my father H.M. Narayana Bhat was a journalist in Karnataka, my writing for him regarding the Kannada stars in Madras, proved a win-win situation for both of us. I got to meet all of them and observe not just the making of films but closely absorbed the nuances of the line-of-work required in pre-recorded music too, especially with respect to gramophone records popular in those days ,” says Mahesh.
It was Udayashankar who first introduced Mahesh to Saraswati Stores in Madras, owned by AVM Meiyappa Chettiar, for undertaking labelling work on Kannada records which needed a Kannadiga for getting them perfected. Saraswati Stores (or the Columbia Recording Company) was the leading distributor for the South for the Gramaphone Recording Company in Calcutta who dealt with gramophone records of all kinds.
Mahesh was subsequently offered a job there and his work was extended to improving the collection. He was heart-broken when he discovered the dismal share of recordings available from the Kannada film, light and classical world, barring a few of MLV’s Dasarapada and Kalinga Rao’s recordings. Improving the Kannada collection became one of Mahesh’s passionate occupations, even as he toured Bangalore, Mangalore, Mysore, Hassan, Chitradurga, Shimoga, Hubli-Belgaum-Dharwad and Bellary to find out more from the dealers.
In the early 1970s, he brought out P.B.Srinivas and S.Janaki’s recording with ‘Gajamukhane Ganapathiye,’ that proved an instant hit. Many more first timers gave Karnataka a boost, but what indeed made history in Kannada film song gramophone record sales was Rajkumar’s ‘Sampathige Sawaal’ and his number ‘Yaare Koogadali’ totally recovering the Kannada collection of the Columbia Recording Company. Mahesh says, “Udayashankar again helped me get Rajkumar for a private recording with ‘Mantralayakke Hogona’ in 1972 followed by his LP in Kannada with Raghavendra Swamiji’s ‘Guruvara Bantamma’ which is treasured even today!”
Mahesh’s recordings of Kannada devotional songs from Bhadragiri Keshavadas had the singer advise him to “take up cassette recordings as done in foreign countries” and in 1979, Mahesh started ‘Sangeetha Cassettes’, and he became the first licensed pre-recorded cassette manufacturer in India. “Nothing would have been possible for me without Parvathamma and Rajkumar, for their first contribution for Sangeetha Cassettes was annavaru’s songs on Anjaneya and Raghavendra Swami. After importing machines from Japan for cassette recordings ‘our own Rajanna’ was there for several more of his own hits, followed by recordings of Balamurali Krishna, R.K. Srikantan, R.S. Ramakanth, B.V. Karanth, C. Ashwath’s with Rathnamala Prakash, Ananthaswamy’s ‘Bhava Sangama’ and a whole lot of other classical artistes from Karnataka.
‘Sangeetha Cassettes’ went on to record artistes of repute from all over India, Mandolin Srinivas being one of its earliest one. Mahesh was also the first to approach Congress Member Rajiv Gandhi to have the Excise Duty on Cassettes reduced to 15 per cent from the shocking 25 percent slapped on a cassette costing Rs. 45! “It was Rajkumar and Parvathamma who helped me again and got the excise duty removed totally later,” says an emotional Mahesh, recollecting the innumerable help Rajkumar has rendered to the people of Karnataka. Sangeetha Studios now runs as Vijaya Studios in Chennai, while all Sangeetha’s cassette recordings can be downloaded at sangeethamusic.com.

Tall, dark, handsome and asleep
","With Naan Sigappu Manithan (NSM), Vishal has dozed his way into the box office. Few would have expected a film about a man with a sleeping disorder and zero heroics to strike a chord with people. But it did, and Vishal says he was confident about the script. The film has given him the best exposure after Bala’s Avan Ivan, for which he sported a painful squint through the film.
 “I could not relate to the character of Indran, the timid hero of NSM; but I realised it would be a challenge to be accepted in that role. I did not want to go back to the safe track,” says Vishal, whose film is still running to packed houses. “I decided to do what Indran would do, not what Vishal could do. I had to convey the innocence of a typical middle-class boy and his body language.”
Vishal admits he did wonder if he should experiment or fall back on the commercial mould after the success of Pandiya Naadu, but Thiru’s script bowled him over. “That film gave me the confidence to take up projects with a solid kernel but made in the commercial format,” he shares.
“Gut instinct overrules everything else in my life. Once I take a decision, I don’t listen to even family,” says Vishal. This instinct saw him sign up with hit-maker Hari for his next production, Poojai. Hisco-star in the film is Shruti Haasan. “People will be surprised by this film. It is not a mindless action film, but a nice family entertainer. It’s great to team up with Hari after our successful Thamirabharani.”
After a string of hits and some misses, Vishal admits that one can’t always make the right choice. “We are not astrologists; no one can predict how a project will pan out. But we give every film our best shot.” The actor says that after the producer, the leading man has the biggest responsibility to ensure a film does well.” Vishal, as the lead, had to take that role seriously when Thimiru was not shaping up well; he stepped in to co-direct the film. But for that, this VisCom graduate has always liked to surrender to the director’s vision. “When you are putty in the hand of a director who knows what he’s doing, it’s better for you as an actor. The film also turns out well,” he says.
In all these years, Vishal has played a range of roles — from lover boy and angry young man to an effeminate lead and a man fighting personal demons. But he’s never played the anti-hero. “That’s one thing I hope to see myself doing,” he says.
He’s also done an interesting role in Sunder C’s caper Madha Gaja Raja (
MGR), which has been lying in the cans for a long time now. “The release date is still not clear but I’ve full faith in the product. It’s a film that will stay fresh whether it releases next month or next year,” he says.
The last two years have seen Vishal double as producer. His Vishal Film Factory (VFF) was born when he had to start Pandiya Naadu. “I did not want to take a risk with another project; I was scarred by the experience with Samar and MGR. It was a decision that was forced upon me.”
He straddles both roles effortlessly. “When I shoot, I stay an actor, and as a producer I invest a lot of time in pre-production work. And in the last two weeks preceding a film’s release, I hardly sleep.” Now, VFF is looking to make movies with other heroes. “I’m listening to some scripts,” says Vishal.
Despite some bad experiences, Vishal says every film is a leap of faith, in the script and the director. It is this faith that has seen him star in a slew of multi-starrers. Has he ever felt threatened? “All my friends are non-egoistic actors. We all keep our profession away from our friendship,” he says. Great friends with actors Arya (Jammy), Jiiva, Vikrant, Vishnu, Vinay Rai, Shanthanoo, Jayam Ravi, Siddharth, they hang out together whenever possible, he says, doing things guys their age normally do. “It’s a riot when we meet. It’s lovely that we bond as individuals, not as stars with hang-ups.”
Even now, Vishal smiles thinking of the early rejections he faced. People said he was not ‘hero’ material. It has been some turnaround, as his name is now almost synonymous with ‘tall, dark and handsome’. “I never let rejection affect me. I don’t allow adulation get to me either. I stay myself,” he says.

A date in the dark for Ayushi
"," There are many reasons why Fever FM’s, city-based RJ Ayushi agreed to participate in MTV’s Dating in the dark (DITD). One, she is nictophobic (fear of the dark), afraid of love and wanted to be the first RJ from Hyderabad on a show for MTV. The show, DITD, is a dating reality show that could be a daring adventure to remember or could mean nothing at all to some. Based on the famous international TV show with the same title, DITD gives a chance to three single men and three single women to get to know each other by losing all their inhibitions and trusting their instincts. A group date is set up in the dark, for the singletons to talk to each other, feel each other, smell but certainly not see each other until the time is up.
With the available knowledge and after viewing the international show it wasn’t just Ayushi who was apprehensive. Her team members and family too wanted her to reconsider her decision on entering the show. “I approached the programme heads of the show with my doubts and they assured me that while the idea is the same, the format was planned and designed keeping in mind the Indian sensibilities,” says Ayushi
Assured, Ayushi made up her mind to participate in the show. She was a bundle of nerves and excited at the same time. “I knew I would play my game with words and I wanted to know how and what would my date do to win me. Since we were all in one room and we would require to spend a good amount of time, we were all smelling good,” laughs Ayushi.
On the first day of the show she met the girls in one room and shared a lot of gossip. “Actually that made us look forward to meeting the guys. Falling in love in a day or in a meeting or two is not what I would agree to. Having had not so pleasant experience with love, I had decided to go with my guard on,” says Ayushi.
After the first meet with all the participants, the contestants invite one another for a romantic one-on-one date in the dark. It is all fun and games until it gets real with the contestants finally coming face to face with each other in the revealing process. The participants can touch and feel each other and smell as well, how did Ayushi agree to that, “I touched face and hand. One guy I could tell, works out and had good biceps. The other had a beard and wore beads, so I guessed he was into music. My guess came out right. I was especially impressed with one of the guys who got jelly for me. I also loved the way he spoke, made me feel special,” recollects Ayushi.
Did she allow anyone to feel her, “No, I didn’t let anyone touch my face. I wasn’t ready to ruin my make up and surprisingly the guys were very understanding, “ says Ayushi.
And what happens in the end? “Each episode climaxes with the contestant either meeting their potential partner in the balcony of the house or exiting the house straight through the front doors,” she adds.

The influencer: Why Alyque Padamsee is relevant in our digitally-led world
","Lintas. Home of the creative giant, Alyque Padamsee. Birthplace of innumerable iconic brands and campaigns. Even a rookie like me could feel the creative frisson that powered the agency when I joined it, though the founding father had moved on by then. It did not matter that I never got to meet him; you could not work in Lintas in the ’90s and not know every minutiae about the God of Advertising. The corridors resounded with folklore, the conference room mirrored his brilliance, and every single person walked around with an aura that comes from living in the presence of genius. If I sound a tad over the top, let me put this in perspective: I needed only two words to justify my decision to be a professional copywriter to my irate father. Alyque Padamsee.
Ad guru. Theatre don. Author. Activist. Philanthropist. And most of all, visionary. He constantly loomed one step ahead of the curve; not just in terms of ideas that broke the mould, but all the way down to their brilliant execution. In auditoriums and boardrooms alike, Alyque was ‘lit’. And that says it all — a term coined by today’s 20-somethings that best describes a man old enough to be their great grandfather. Yes, he was pretty darn ‘woke’ too, doing everything he could to erase religious divisiveness, pushing for women’s rights and a corruption-free governance. He is hailed today as ‘the brand-father of Indian advertising’ for transforming inanimate products and services into living brands. The legacy he leaves behind though, might be bigger than the super brands and mega markets he helped create. It can be found in the prescient communication dictums he introduced us to, each one still relevant in these digital times.




Decades before Instagram, Twitter and Facebook introduced us to the phenomenon called followers, Alyque had a loyal tribe of disciples. An influencer par excellence, his approval or lack of it, changed the destinies of people, brands and companies. His carefully-curated public profile drew media, clients, theatre fans and the general public to him. Alyque was the brand ambassador not just for Lintas, the agency he spearheaded, but for the entire advertising industry in the ’80s.
Alyque redefined brand communication. He turned a one-way product monologue into a conversation between the brand and its consumer. He used focus groups to listen to what the consumer had to say, and then created a product experience that engaged them and gave them a legitimate reason to interact. The Liril waterfall film was literally that: a Bollywood-fuelled fantasy of the harrowed Indian housewife, looking for a five-minute respite in her shower. It was iconic for many reasons, mostly because it opened up an interactive relationship between brands and their users. Today, this is the building block of digital marketing, which focusses on people, their problems and needs, and not the product.



Ad man Alyque Padamsee’s alternate world on the stage


If you want to know your brand, get to know its consumer. Lalitajee, the astute Surf lady who became the spokesperson for the ’80s Indian housewife, was based on Alyque’s mother. Which is what made her so real and credible. Cut to today, where instant consumer feedback and reviews literally drive digital marketing. A brand is only as successful as its data analytics.
Alyque knew what women wanted: they wanted to be heard; to be seen in all the roles they played. To fantasise about frolicking like heroines under waterfalls (Liril); for sex to be more than just a housewifely chore (Kamasutra); to be savvy householders who safeguarded the health and nutrition of their families (Dalda, Complan). But most of all, they wanted to be acknowledged as discerning decision makers. Alyque nudged the Indian female consumer out of the shadows, and gave her a strident, unapologetic voice.
Hundreds of sheepish Indian men finally found the nerve to quit sneakily using the fairness cream that belonged to the woman in the house. They went out and bought their own Fair & Handsome, after Alyque convinced Emami that was a market waiting to explode. He didn’t just give them a product they were yearning for, he gave them societal acceptance. The men’s personal care shelves in the supermarkets have been groaning under the weight, ever since.




We all love memes, those memorable captures that go viral and turn something or someone into an overnight phenomenon. Alyque’s compelling storytelling in his ad films created memes literally every time he raised his creative baton. The 80s and 90s resounded with Lalitajee’s temple tapping, (Bhai sahib, Sirf ki kharidari mein hi samajhdari hai.. , the endearing Cherry Charlie’s Chaplinesque tap dance, the Liril water nymph’s la la lala …… and so many other ‘snapshots’ that got locked into the memory banks of viewers and consumers, to be replayed over and over again, creating rock-solid brand recall.
Way before celebrity image consultants or social media managers became a thing, Alyque had been appointed Communication Adviser to then Prime Minister Rajeev Gandhi. He may well have been responsible for introducing the power of branded communication to Indian politics. A staunch supporter of the India Against Corruption movement which later morphed into AAP, he was the man behind their strategic ‘Sweep Them Away’ campaign.
We are all unlikely to forget the ice bucket challenge on Facebook. The world watched hundreds of people across the globe dunk themselves with ice water, to raise $115 million dollars towards research for ALS. Who would have imagined the power wielded by a simple bucket of water? Alyque did, years ago, in an Advertising Review presentation. The video part of his presentation happened to end on an ad film that culminated with a bucket of water being tossed. At that precise moment, the audience watched Alyque take a bucket of water right in the face, on stage. They watched in stunned silence as the showman took off his glasses, wiped them clean and proceeded to continue with his presentation. It was his seamless transition from the screen to the stage where he stood. Almost as seamless as his transition from theatrical genius to brilliant adman.

Of children and wild berries
","“My first inspiration for Kaphal was a friend’s child,” says Mumbai-based filmmaker Batul Mukhtiar. “The child’s father works in another city and visits occasionally. Once, when the father would not allow him to see a particular movie, the child asked his mother when the father would go back!”

Kaphal – Wild Berries has won the National Award for Best Children’s Film, and Batul is a relaxed person today. Working on a script with cinematographer husband Vivek Shah, she says she would like to shoot soon but that the award has not really translated into any pressure to perform. Kaphal won the Golden Elephant for Best Director at the 18th International Children’s Film Festival India and the Swarna Kamal for Best Children’s Film at the 61st National Film Awards India.
On the contrary, she says that the award “feels like a validation of the long struggle to tell the stories I want to tell. And a validation of the extremely difficult shoot that Kaphal was, and all the hard work that every single person in the cast and crew put into the film, for very little money.”
The film tells the story of two boys whose father returns home after living in the city for five years. The boys suddenly have to handle a father — contend with no gifts but abide by all his rules. They hatch a plan to send him back to the city, but who said plans go according to plan?
“The difficulties of a long-distance relationship are compounded in extreme situations like a Garhwal village, which are not easily accessible by phone, where life is hard anyway, and where the absence of livelihoods leaves people with no choice but to leave home,” says Batul.
Why did she pick such a region-specific name for her film? “A lot of people don’t know what kaphal means. So before they see the film, they are curious. But after they see the film, they understand,” she says. Asked how conducive the environment was while filming, Batul says, “I have known some people from the village in which we shot for over 25 years. Also, we made an effort to employ as many villagers as we could during production. So we received a lot of co-operation and support while shooting. Without this, it would have been impossible to work there, given the difficulties of terrain, weather and lack of infrastructure.”
Also, since the children starring in the film are all from the region, the villagers are proud of the acclaim the film and the children have received. In fact, the decision to cast local children in leading roles has created just the right impact. “The location plays a very important role. The terrain is very difficult, and I wanted the children to run all over the hills, like I had seen local children do. I could not risk asking city children to do this.”
Talking about the Children’s Film Society of India, she says, “I think the CFSI is an organisation that we should all be proud of, one of the rare government institutes in the world that makes films for children.” CFSI has the budget to make three to four films a year, and has over 250 films in its archives. Unfortunately, it does not have the infrastructure to market these films. These films are viewed only during festivals, special screenings or on DVD. Says Batul: “It is still very difficult to market children’s films in India, because exhibitors and distributors have a preconceived notion of what children will like. But if you visit the International Children’s Film Festival of India, you’ld see thousands of children with no prior exposure to world cinema enjoying all kinds of films, even those with subtitles. It’s a pity that our children do not get the opportunity to see local content more easily.”

The Amazing Spider-Man 2: Swing low, sweet Spiderman
","The success of the superhero formula—both in comics and on film—rests on the utterly fantastic premise of the hero’s invincibility. Freakishly evil enemies may be plotting to undo them in diabolical ways, but it’s an immutable law of this genre that the hero, untainted by the faintest wisp of self-doubt, always triumphs. Tinker with that elemental simplicity, and you mess with the minds of our caped superheroes and show them up to be all too fallible. Like the rest of us lesser mortals, in fact.
In the latest edition of the Spider-Man franchise, The Amazing Spider-Man 2, director Marc Webb advances that cardinal error—so manifest in a few earlier outings too—and ‘humanises’ the masked do-gooder to the point where, for all his superhero swagger, he effectively stands de-iconised and perhaps in serious need of psychological counselling to redress his existential, schizoid, arachnid angst.
Worse, Webb overreaches himself and packs in way too many sub-plots and villainous characters, so that he becomes hopelessly ensnared in the elaborate web of his own narrative. The plotline, at its simplest, would have sustained sufficient interest. Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) relishes his Spider-Man call of duty, but it’s murder on his relationship with Gwen Stacy (an adorable Emma Stone). Added to which, he’s anxious to unearth the back story of why his parents abandoned him as a child.
These and other strands — including the re-entry into Parker’s life of old friend-turned-foe Harry Osborn (Dane DeHaan) and the advent of new ‘friend’ Max Dillon (a sub-par performance by Jamie Foxx) who, after an encounter with electric eels (I’ll say no more), metamorphoses into the villainous, ‘power-hungry’ Electro — bind Parker fatefully to Oscorp Industries, the evil corporate empire.
But Webb’s treatment of that plotline doesn’t quite have the tautness and tensile strength of, say, Spidey’s web. Perhaps some of this is born of the nature of the medium: whereas comic books lend themselves to episodic treatment where the narrative can (and does oftentimes) stretch for years, Webb has to condense them into two-hours-plus of non-stop action. But because he over-ambitiously appears to have gone all in, the appeal is less than spectacular.
Which is a pity, because The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is in many ways a lavish and technically splendid production. The CGI special effects are so stunningly real that when Spider-Man leans over a skyscraper ledge or swings through Manhattan, you feel vicariously vertiginous. And the scene in which Electro blacks out Times Square is masterful in milking its mayhem quotient. And although Webb occasionally takes permissible liberties with the plotline, he remains faithful to the comic book effect, right down to Spider-Man’s classical bug-eye contours.
But while there’s enough and more in the film to keep confirmed Spidey fanboys gushing with adoration, it is unlikely to net a new following.
In the final analysis, it may not be Spider-Man, torn though he is by searing internal conflicts, who needs counselling. It’s the franchise itself that needs to be put on the couch.

Genre: Superhero action

Director: Marc Webb

Cast: Andrew Garfield, Emma Stone, Jamie Foxx, Dane DeHaan, Sally Field

Storyline: Spider-Man battles the baddies, goes through more existential angst, and proves that even superheroes have limits

Bottomline: By humanising Spidey overmuch, they’re killing his superhero soul

#MeToo in Bollywood: Netflix may not renew ‘Sacred Games’ "," The second season of Sacred Games could be in jeopardy with the #MeToo #TimesUp movement gaining ground in Bollywood. Netflix may not renew the series in the light of the sexual harassment allegations against lead writer Varun Grover that Grover has very strongly and categorically denied. 
The project had been greenlit with great fanfare with director Vikramaditya Motwane continuing as the showrunner and Neeraj Ghaywan joining in, directing the Sartaj track to Kashyap’s Gaitonde strand. Both Motwane and Kashyap have also been facing flak for not handling the sexual harassment charges against Phantom ex-partner and director Vikas Bahl with seriousness. 
When The Hindu reached out to Netflix, the streaming platform came up with the following statement: “At this time we are evaluating options on the path forward.”

‘Nothing has come easy to me’
","Rajkummar Rao and his co-star Patralekha were among the Citylights team that spent a few days in a small hamlet near Sadri in Pali district, 150km from Udaipur in Rajasthan, observing the lifestyles of people in the area. “That’s my job. It’s necessary that I do enough groundwork so that my character, that of a migrant from Rajasthan, looks believable on screen. I observed people, their traits and tried to understand what they do and how they live,” he says.



Citylights is Rajkummar’s first release after he was conferred with the National Award for Best Actor for his portrayal of the slain human rights lawyer Shahid Azmi in Shahid. The mention of the National Award brings a hearty smile but he doesn’t want the award to weigh on his shoulders. “I’ve been choosing films going by scripts I can connect to. That’s how I want it to be. I don’t want to select a film thinking I am a National Award winning actor,” he says.

 People hated me in ‘Queen’, which is great. My character was not supposed to be likeable. 
Rajkummar can play a solo lead, like in Shahid and Citylights, be a part of ensemble casts like in Shaitan, Chittagong and Kai Po Che and quietly shine in supporting roles like he did in Talaash and Queen. His filmography reveals an astute mind at work, trusting his instincts and choosing films that won’t be forgotten easily. “Nothing has come easy to me, since my days in Delhi. There’s a lot of hard work behind what appears like an effortless performance. I like to understand the context of a film and my character, but I don’t rehearse much. I prefer an organic method of work,” he says. The organic method of acting, he feels, makes the character appear spontaneous on screen.
As he basked in all the positive reviews to Shahid, he followed it up with a chauvinistic character in Queen. “The feedback was fabulous. People hated me in the film, which is great. My character was not supposed to be likeable,” he laughs.
Speaking about Citylights, he confesses he hasn’t watched the original British-Filipino film on which it is based. Like Hansal Mehta, he didn’t want to be influenced by the original. “I went by the script given to me and felt it would be better to approach the character from my perspective,” he says.

Citylights was initially to be directed by Ajay Bahl. Once he stepped aside, Rajkummar suggested Hansal Mehta’s name. “It was a co-incidence that the Bhatts had watched Shahid a couple of days ago, were impressed and keen to have Hansal Mehta on board,” says Rajkummar.

Short and impactful

The actor’s repertoire includes a three-minute short film titled Mumbai Mirror, directed by Shlok Sharma. “The film is four years old, but is being discussed in social media now,” he says.

Mumbai Mirror is a forceful short that shows how a secular person can turn communal in minutes. “We shot the film in two to three hours,” says Rajkummar, adding, “Whichever project I take up, I make an effort to relate to the characters. Citylights, for instance, is a story anyone can connect with. We see our cities teeming with lakhs of migrants. The story could happen anywhere.”

Nee Enge En Anbe: Lost in the retelling
","How does one describe atmosphere in the context of cinema? To call it the very air that the movie needs to breathe would not be an exaggeration — but that’s too unspecific. Atmosphere is in the cinematography, which adds tone and texture to the happenings. It’s in the music, which percolates from one scene to the next and glues them together, even if they occur in different locations. It’s sometimes in the staging, the way the shots are set up, the way the interiors and exteriors are brought to life, so that the film feels like an organic whole, from start to finish.
Without atmosphere, a movie is just a collection of scenes that fit oddly, like misshapen jigsaw pieces. We may be able to get a sense of the whole puzzle, but only in our heads. We sense what could have been. What we see, though, is someone labouring to make the pieces fit. It isn’t pretty.
What Nee Enge En Anbe could have been is a solid reimagining of Sujoy Ghosh’s intensely atmospheric Kahaani, rejigged for the Tamil audience (or at least director Sekhar Kammula’s estimation of the sensibilities of the Tamil audience). The story is more or less the same. A young NRI returns to India in search of her missing husband. The major difference is that in the Hindi original, the heroine was pregnant, a development that instantly drew us to her plight and, at the end, resulted in a memorably pulpy twist.
But we cannot have a Tamil film based on a pregnant heroine (her name is Anamika), especially if she’s played by a glamorous star like Nayantara, who can’t even part with her fake eyelashes. (In some close-ups, it appears as if a lavishly plumaged bird has come to roost in the outer reaches of her eyes.) How, now, will she earn our sympathies?
So the director cooks up a series of utterly conventional damsel-in-distress scenarios. When Anamika takes her complaint to the police station, she’s told, rudely, that her husband has probably run away. Later, she is propositioned by a lecherous senior cop.
The peril of being female and alone in India is a terrific subject for a movie — but Nee Enge En Anbe is not that movie. It is a police procedural wrapped in a vigilante thriller, with mysterious hard disks and a soft-spoken assassin on the loose. Kahaani wisely folded its feminist inquiries into the subtext. When these layers are made the text, we get a movie that’s stranded awkwardly between ideas and action.
The revelations are dispensed with in lumps of ugly exposition. The twist ending is not built up to — when we look back at what happened, it doesn’t really add up. The chases are badly staged. There are many unintentional laughs, particularly from the ineptness with which a beehive is written into the script. And when a great tragedy occurs, we are manipulated in the cheapest possible manner, with a little boy placed at the centre.
Still, some of this could have been salvaged had there been an iota of atmosphere, which can sometimes be manifest even in the way the characters are shaped. The assassin in Kahaani was introduced to us as a boring life insurance agent used to being screamed at by a much younger boss. Then, this man, whom we dismissed as a baby-faced loser, surprised us by whipping out a gun and offing a series of innocents.
In Nee Enge En Anbe, the man has no shading, no alternate life. He’s just a killer who comes out of nowhere. It may be difficult to explain atmosphere in the context of cinema, but it’s easy to detect the lack of it. Why go about fixing something that ain’t broke?

Genre: Procedural, plus vigilante thriller

Director: Sekhar Kammula

Cast: Nayantara, Pasupathi, Vaibhav

Storyline: A young NRI returns to India to search for her missing husband

Bottomline: An unsuccessful attempt to transpose a multiplex Hindi hit into a more generic Tamil-audience-friendly movie

Podcast review: Gonads attempts to go back to the birds and bees talk
"," Somewhere over the rainbow is a place where love is love, where simply being is enough to be recognised and counted, where understanding is based on reason, imagination and empathy, and where conversation trumps judgement. 
Even as we celebrate the overturn of Section 377, we know that it’s a long way before social and cultural norms accommodate alternative sexualities, and legal provisions make possible a life of true choice for anyone who doesn’t check the heteronormative box. But as we move into a fuller understanding of what it means to be human, and why binary categorisations just don’t cut it, it could help if we had open, informed, and genuinely curious conversations — about sex, sexuality, gender, and genetics. 
Several initiatives in our own backyard (Agents of Ishq, Tarshi, for instance) are making attempts to get us talking and dealing with our deep discomfort with all things sexual, but it’s a slow process that more often than not evokes embarrassed laughter or shocked silence.
New York-based Radiolab’s six-part mini-series, Gonads, is an attempt to go back to the beginning with that conversation. With what has come to be the group’s characteristic mix of deep reporting, contextualisation and personal history, Gonads explores “the epic journey of reproduction” from its primordial roots to the processes that makes us who we are and how we make more of us.
The series was conceived in 2015, when producer Molly Webster followed the story of a gay Israeli couple and a surrogacy service in Nepal, in the process uncovering the complicated ethical, cultural and emotional dynamics of outsourced baby-making. The resultant episode, ‘Birthstory’, which Radiolab co-host Jab Abumrad describes as “a story about the business of family making, the outsourcing of babies, about exploitation,” but also about “the way cultures cross-fertilize in really unexpected ways, creating a symbiotic benefit even while it’s troubling and maybe unfair.”
The episode, though three years old, is still an engrossing listen, and a great example of collaborative reporting from journalists in Israel, India and Nepal. Armed with a grant from Science Sandbox, Webster then went on to explore the scientific basis of reproduction, and put together her research in this six-part series.




In Episode 1, titled ‘The Primordial Journey’, Webster sets the tone, quirky and inquisitive, with the question: “What do you think of the word ‘gonads’?” and gets a range of responses, from “it’s a crazy question” to “isn’t that ‘nuts’?” More than 90% of her respondents thought that it was a decidedly male word, unaware that both women and men have gonads. She decided it was time to “reclaim that word... as a woman, as a science lover.” All this set to a foot-tapping theme song with a catchy refrain: “go-go-gonads.”
Outside the binary
While the first episode focuses almost entirely on matters of science, each of the subsequent episodes is built around a story that takes us into the wonders of futuristic fertility science, the fluid and fickle matters of biological sex determination (the surprising discovery that X and Y do not always equal female and male), and complications of falling outside the gender binary.
Episodes 4 and 5, originally aired back to back, serve as the real centrepiece of the series, working together to re-examine socially constructed notions of gender alongside the slippery biological processes that can confound any attempt to define difference. 
In ‘Dana’, we encounter Dana Zzyym, whose experience “broke the binary” and forced the inclusion of the term “Intersex” on United States passport applications. And in ‘Dutee’, Webster and reporter Sarah Qari revisit the heartbreak and struggle faced by the young Indian track and field star, Dutee Chand, who was stripped of her medals when she was found to have unacceptably high levels of natural testosterone. 
Webster rounds off the series with the edited version of a live show at New York University that turns the usual sex-ed class on its head, considering, “how do we teach this stuff in the current polarised environment?”
Like all Radiolab productions, Gonads demands careful listening, and while the questions it addresses are scientific, their implications — as we only too well know — are deeply cultural and emotional.

'Alex, Inc.': Beginning of the end ","Scroll through Zach Braff’s Twitter feed, and you will find him joining the ranks of other celebrities like Jim Carrey and Chrissy Teigen, deriding Donald Trump’s hyperbolic tweets. Scroll all the way back to March, and you will find him enthusiastically promoting Alex, Inc., the ABC sitcom that he starred in, directed, and served as executive producer for. Co-starring Indian-American actress Tiya Sircar (The Good Place, The Intern), the show is based on the real-life story of Alex Blumberg, the father of two who left his job in radio to launch his own start-up — a podcast.
Unfortunately for Braff, the show — which premières in India on August 28 — was not renewed for a second season despite the actor’s optimism about its premise. “I thought the original podcast made the basis for a great TV show,” he says. “I never heard anything like it. It was raw — they were so willing to record the embarrassing moments.”
Silicon Valley aura
In the single-camera sitcom, Braff — who returns to network television after eight years (his last role was as Dr John Dorian on the hit show, Scrubs) — chronicles his journey to find venture capital funding for his start-up. At the co-working space that he has recently joined, 20-something tech enthusiasts work on prototypes for their projects (example: a baby rocker that puts your child to sleep). Alex is older, has little experience in the world of start-ups, and faces the pressure of a mortgage and a fast-dwindling budget. “I love that our story is about a guy in his late 30s,” says Sircar. “The idea is that it is never too late to go for it.”




India calling
In real life, Blumberg’s wife Nazanin is of Persian origin, but after Sircar was confirmed as the female lead, her character, Arunima ‘Rooni’ Schuman, was adapted. “The producers really wanted to tailor-make this character for me, which has never happened to me in Hollywood before,” she shares. “Rooni became Indian, more specifically, Bengali-American. I am pretty excited to be portraying a character who’s so close to who I am really in life,” says Sircar, whose own parents were interviewed by the show’s producers to ensure that Rooni’s Indian heritage was accurately portrayed.
For Braff, who has dabbled with more directorial work after Scrubs (projects include the Morgan Freeman-starrer Going in Style and Wish I Was Here), the appeal of Alex, Inc. was its relatability. “It is a very prevalent thing in our country where individuals and families think of being their own boss,” says the actor, who has not announced any new projects since the show’s release.
Alex Inc. will première on August 28 on Comedy Central India

#MeToo: Mukesh Chhabra, Vicky Sidana, Bhushan Kumar and Ashish Patil accused
","Casting directors Mukesh Chhabra and Vicky Sidana, T-series chairman Bhushan Kumar and Yash Raj Films Talent and Business head Ashish Patil have been accused of sexual harassment and asking for sexual favours in a professional setup.
Mr. Kumar denied the allegations in a statement to PTI saying, “I am appalled and anguished to know that my name has been dragged in this #MeToo by some anonymous person(s). The allegations against me are bad on the face of it. I have enjoyed an impeccable reputation and have always maintained professionalism. The tweet has been used as a tool to defame me and malign my reputation."" 
Mr. Kumar has submitted an application at Amboli police station seeking a complaint of defamation and criminal intimidation against an unknown person for posting offending remarks and statements against him on social media and levelling sexual harassment allegations, confirmed senior police inspector Bharat Gaikwad. 
Under #MeTooIndia on Twitter, an anonymous account had accused Mr. Kumar saying, “I was new and very scared. The next day I got to know that I was dropped from the film because I refused to sleep with the ‘boss’.”
Refuting allegations of sexual harassment of aspiring actors during auditions, Mr. Chhabra released a statement saying, “It is very unfortunate that years of hard work and building is been muzzled with a series of unsubstantiated wild anonymous allegations.”
Filmmaker Anurag Kashyap tweeted, “I neither have any #MeToo stories nor evidence about Mukesh Chhabra. I cut off ties with him for lots of reasons related to casting and reasons that I don’t feel the need to put out in public domain.” Mr. Chhabra had worked on the casting of Netflix’s Sacred Games, which was co-directed by Mr. Kashyap.
Mr. Chhabra opted out of a panel discussion at the ongoing India Film Project (October 13-14), an annual content creation festival held in Mumbai. Singer Raghu Dixit, journalist Meghnad Bose, comedian Aditi Mittal and Mr. Patil have also stepped down from participating in the festival after allegations of sexual harassment and assault under #MeTooIndia.
Denying allegations made anonymously on Twitter, Mr. Patil said in a statement, “They are untrue, fabricated, extremely defamatory and agenda driven. Yash Raj Films also tweeted promising to take strictest action if the allegations of sexual harassment are found to be true.

Musical tribute to Ghantasala
","Fans of legendary singer Ghantasala Venkateswara Rao organised a musical night at the C.V.N. Reading room here on Wednesday night and paid him glowing tributes.
The singer, who was gifted with a golden voice and ruled the Telugu film music scenario for decades, continues to rule the hearts of music lovers through his CDs and cassettes.
Pairing with upcoming singer Vishnupriya from Tanuku, Sk. Abbas, an ardent follower of Ghantasala, kept the audience spellbound by rendering his select songs. Ghantasala had ruled the south Indian film music scene with his mesmerising voice that earned him the epithet Gana Gandharva.
The musical night, aptly named Sumadhura Melodies, sent the audience on a journey of nostalgia. The singers, including C. Ramakoteswara Rao, a retired BSNL employee and I. S. Kamalakar, a municipal employee, chipped in with some of the evergreen Ghantasala melodies. Noted singer A. Rathiah played the host of the event.
Mr. Abbas, a tailor by profession and a singer with a strong urge to perpetuate the memory of Ghantasala, was honoured on the occasion, said the Sumadhura Melodies secretary Alla Bhaskar Reddy and programme in-charge Sk. Rafi.

Premchand had a great influence on me: Gulzar
","Poet and film-maker Gulzar on Friday said that famous Hindi litterateur Munshi Premchand had a profound influence on him, and that his film characters would invariably have similarities with the ones etched out by the great writer.
Releasing the televised adaptation of Munshi Premchand’s masterpiece novels Godaan and Nirmala on a DVD produced by the national broadcaster here, Gulzar said he sees Premchand’s characters all around him.
Gulzar said Nirmala’s story was about human relations. “Premchand specialised in this subject. It revolves around an under-18 girl who suddenly becomes a woman when she gets married to a man much older to her.”
Explaining his search for a village which had some similarity with the environment prevailing in Premchand’s novel Nirmala, Gulzar said he travelled extensively and finally found one existing on the Maharashtra-Gujarat border.
“For making Nirmala for the Doordarshan series Tehreer Munshi Premchand Ki, I decided to venture out of the studio. After much scouting, I stumbled upon a village which had the same environment as had been described by Premchand. I was so taken aback that even after 60 years, the condition of the villagers was still the same.”
Speaking about the cast of the serial, the film-maker complimented Marathi actor Amruta Subhash for essaying the character of Nirmala with much conviction. “She is in Delhi today as she would be collecting the National Award for a Marathi film. I should have brought her along for this interaction,” he said.
Gulzar said he first read Premchand’s works Haj-e-Akbar and Idgah while still in school.
“As a child I used to see my mother baking crisp tandoori rotis in a particular way. When I read Premchand I felt he had written about my mother. Later, after entering college I read Premchand’s writing in English and got an insight into the zamindari system and the gap between the rich and the poor. While making films, I could feel that Premchand was extremely observant and even described animal movements and characters in great detail.”

'Motta Maadi Music' to celebrate Kamal's songs ","It’s a breezy summer evening in Chennai and a motley group of people are plonked on a jamakalam spread across a nondescript motta maadi (terrace) in Nanganallur. A nearby temple bell chimes and it looks like the group is prepping for a paatu class. But not really. They whip out their smartphones and search ‘Strawberry Penne’ lyrics.
They are in the middle of a Motta Maadi Music session, the sixth one this year, themed around AR Rahman. The stars are out just in time as everyone sings in chorus, “Vinveli peneee!”
Literally meaning open terrace music, this initiative brings together people for one sole purpose — to sing their hearts out together. “My only aim is to get people to lose inhibitions and sing,” says Badhri Narayanan Seshadri, a sound engineer and an independent musician, who conceptualised Motta Maadi Music and on whose terrace the event takes place. This is perhaps why the event has become so popular across all age groups in just six months. It is only the voice of the collective crowd that is heard: the perfect fix for someone who loves singing but is too embarrassed to attempt anything.
Badhri is also part of Hrudhya, the band which plays at every session, lending support to the audience. 
The first session, conducted in January, saw a little under 25 people milling about on the roof. Ilaiyaraaja night and Rahman night, however, witnessed at least 180 participants. “We did not do any promotion whatsover, except create a Facebook event page,” Badhri says. “The massive attendance was all word-of-mouth.”
On an event night, Badhri is busy shuttling between setting the instruments, giving directions over the phone and trying to pump up the audience. His family helps out too: his mother prepares piping hot filter coffee for the first hundred people, his dad and uncle make sure there are no parking problems for those who attend. Some members of the audience were so completely involved in singing, that they did not notice a plate of biscuits and a tray of soft drinks passed around by Badhri’s family.
He is open to the idea of providing a platform for other bands to showcase their original music during the event. “It is tough for young bands to find a large audience. I’d be happy to have a band performing in the middle of our session.”
But in the end, it is all about celebrating music. Badhri says the audience have now started owning Motta Maadi Music. “From me hosting the event, it has gone on to become their show. They choose the songs, they set the tempo and the tone for the night.”
Entry is free for Motta Maadi Music’s upcoming session, Haasan Night, celebrating songs of Kamal Haasan, scheduled on November 17. The performers for the evening are Pramodh (lead guitar), Kiran (violin), Ramya (keys), Vishwesh and Achyuth (bass), Vignesh (cajon). Visit www.facebook.com/ MottaMaadi Music for details.

Actor-comedian Kevin Hart to host 2019 Oscars "," Comedian and actor Kevin Hart is all set to host the 2019 Academy Awards, a role he says fulfills a longtime dream. 
The announcement came hours after trade publication The Hollywood Reporter posted a story calling the Oscars host position “the least wanted job in Hollywood.” 
“I am blown away simply because this has been a goal on my list for a long time...To be able to join the legendary list of hosts that have graced this stage is unbelievable,” Hart wrote. “I know my mom is smiling from ear to ear right now. I will be sure to make sure this years Oscars a special one,” Hart wrote. 
Those include shortening the broadcast to three hours, and also presenting certain categories during commercial breaks and broadcasting excerpts of those winners’ speeches later in the show. 
The 39-year-old Hart has become a bankable star with films such as Ride Along, Jumanji- Welcome to the Jungle and Night School. 
Celebrities including Martin Lawrence and Chris Rock, who hosted the ceremony in 2005 and 2016, posted congratulatory messages about Hart’s selection on Tuesday night. 
“Damn I’ve lost another job to Kevin Hart,” Rock posted on Instagram, echoing a joke he told during his 2016 opening monologue . “They got the best person for the job.”

Punjab Kesari 1938
","Te. Po. Krishnaswamy Pavalar was a Tamil scholar and playwright of the early decades of the 20th century. He wrote plays about the Indian freedom movement and for the upliftment of Tamil culture. One of his Tamil plays, Khadarin Vetri (Victory of Khadhi Carter), with the Indian freedom movement as its theme was staged with success in faraway London in 1923 and was well received by even Britishers! His other play Pathi Bhakthi was also filmed and its rehash came out as a cult hit film Sathi Leelavathi (1936). It also introduced many new talents to Tamil cinema, such as S.S. Vasan (as writer), Ellis R. Dugan (director), M.K. Radha, T.S. Balaiah, N.S. Krishnan and last but not the least, M.G. Ramachandran in his movie debut as a police inspector.
One of his plays in Tamil was Punjab Kesari (The Lion of Punjab) which was successfully staged all over the Tamil-speaking areas of the old Madras Presidency and also neighbouring nations like Ceylon, Malaya (now Singapore and Malaysia), Burma.
It is a matter of regret that today he has been forgotten. However, for the tricolour portrait of his by the famed artiste and painter K. Madhavan commissioned by MGR, the world would not have known how this great scholar and patriot even looked like! Punjab Kesari also garnered much fame and name during the 1930s. Interestingly the title bears an allegorical reference to one of the forgotten leaders of the Indian Freedom Movement Lala Lajpat Rai, known as “The Lion of Punjab”.
 With the success of the play, Punjab Kesari was made into a Tamil movie in 1938 with K.P. Kesavan who played the title role. An import from Tamil theatre Kesavan was quite popular during the early years of Tamil cinema. A rationalist and an agnostic he did not believe in playing roles in films of Hindu mythology or ones containing superstitious elements and illogical happenings. He opted out of such films which sadly cost him his career and he faded from public memory. Today only old-timers and film and theatre historians remember him. Later, Kesavan acted in a social film Iru Sahotharargal directed by Ellis R. Dungan.
 
Punjab Kesari (1938) had a conventional hero in the film, which was played by the popular stage actor then making his way into Tamil cinema, P.U. Chinnappa who soon rose to become one of the top singing stars of the1940s. The movie was directed by a Bombay-based Parsi filmmaker then active in Tamil Cinema, Frem Sethna. However, the movie met with only limited success.
 The screen story of Punjab Kesari is long, full of twists and turns and somewhat predictable. It is about a freedom loving man named Punjab Kesari (Kesavan), a detective, and his assistant (Kali N. Ratnam) who calls himself by an unusual name ‘Karapaanpoochi’ (cockroach). Sundaranathan (Chinnappa) is a young man in love with a young woman Padmabai (Rajalakshmi), the daughter of a rich man Somanathan Prabhu (H. H. Sarma). The rich man decides to get his daughter married to the young man but there is a villain, (Perumal) who covets her and her wealth, with a gang behind him. They kill the rich man and foist the murder on the hero. He goes to prison, and a kind doctor (Kannan) engages the detective Punjab Kesari to find out the truth. Punjab Kesari and his assistant unmask the killer and the truth. Sundaranathan and Padmabai marry and live happily.
 The film opens with a song, ‘Vande Matharam’  and Tamilians are urged to participate in the freedom struggle. Interestingly there is a Carnatic music composition of Saint Thyagaraja ‘Tholi nenu chesina pooja palamu’ sung by the heroine, Rajalakshmi.
The film was produced at the National Movietone Studio in Kilpauk, Madras, where today the famous Seetha Kingston School is situated. It was produced by Star Films. In spite of the interesting story line and popular actors of the day film, the film was only a reasonable success.

Remembered for: The storyline and impressive performances by the cast.

Fierce like a drag queen
"," We’re all born naked and the rest is drag. Those are lyrics from drag superstar RuPaul’s song ‘Born Naked’ and a line frequently quoted on his show RuPaul’s Drag Race. The words, as per her own declaration, have changed Mumbai-based comedian Supriya Joshi’s life. “It essentially means you can be anybody,” she says right after squealing Miss Vanjie, a famous contestant’s name. “It was like a light bulb moment [when I heard them] and I have never looked back.” The comedian, who was bullied her entire childhood and well into her late teens, accepting her physical appearance took a long journey. It’s one that hasn’t quite ended yet. 
Growing up, Joshi was never exposed to anyone she could relate to in the mainstream. She was constantly bombarded with negativity. “All I heard was that I’m not good, I’m ugly or I’m disgusting,” she reminisces. The message was received and stayed embedded. The constant hammering hasn’t ceded yet. So much so, that there are still days when she doesn’t like how she looks. But thanks to Rupaul’s life lessons, there’s been a shift. “I watched these fat queens [on the show],” she laughs. “All of them are fierce competitors and they love themselves and their bodies.” Joshi will pay it forward this weekend with a talk titled ‘How To Love Yourself When You Are Asked Not To’. As a self-admitted bad planner, there’s no guarantee of Rupaul talk, so you’ll just have to be there to find out. Joshi will, however, talk about her own experiences and engage with the audience. 
As a comedian, she’s often in the spotlight, making her an easy target for Internet trolls. But the barrage of constant insults about her physical appearance though hasn’t dampened her swagger. “I am now at a place where I love my self and I can say it out loud, especially when people like me are expected not to,” she says. “There are so many like me who will hear [that this Sunday] and find strength in that and begin their own journey toward self acceptance and self love.” Reaching out is one of the reasons Joshi, unlike her peers, deliberately makes it a point to document the low moments in her life on social media. 
While her confidence is obvious in our conversation, Joshi’s journey is far from over. The effects of bullying and years of conditioning hardly vanish without a trace. Although her panic attacks have significantly reduced, the social anxiety remains. “I still don’t really like going out that much,” she laughs at how it directly contradicts her chosen profession. “You can be anybody and still feel shitty about yourself.” Nonetheless, she’s hoping to become more approachable as the next step in her journey. And we could all take a leaf out of Joshi’s book parting with words from the very wise RuPaul: 'If you don't love yourself, how in the hell you gonna love somebody else?’ 
Supriya Joshi drops some truth bombs
Start watching Rupaul’s Drag Race, your mind will expand and so will your vocabulary.
Take small steps towards learning who you are and don’t hold yourself back from doing the things you want to do, unless it’s killing somebody. Then you should definitely hold yourself back. 
Who gives a sh** who’s laughing at you? You’ll never see them again. 
Don’t be so hard on yourself. 
If you think ‘I can’t do this because I’m fat and ugly’, then that moment is gone and it will never happen again and you might regret it. 
How To Love Yourself When You Are Asked Not To will take place on Sunday June 10 at Kala Studio, Khar West at 5 p.m. Entry is priced at ₹150; more details at 9892075622

Sacred Games: same soul, different body
"," A mandala is a metaphor for the cosmos, or a city. An intricate geometric pattern, it consists of squares and circles, used in Hinduism and Buddhism to denote a sacred space, one which is representative of an entire microcosm. In Vikram Chandra’s definitive Mumbai novel, Sacred Games (2006), one of the lead characters Sartaj Singh, a middle-aged Sikh inspector in the Mumbai police force, observes some “Tibetan Sadhus” patiently and meticulously and gracefully creating an intricate mandala.
It is heartening to note that Netflix’s first Indian original, Sacred Games adapted from the book, creates the world of Singh, the gangster Ganesh Gaitonde and the city formerly known as Bombay, in much the same manner as the Tibetan monks — patiently, meticulously and indeed very gracefully. As a lover of Sacred Games, I was wary that the book’s inner voices and intricate patterns, didn’t lend themselves with alacrity to be adapted into a filmic medium. But after watching all eight episodes of the first season, I am happy to report that the Netflix show, is inhabited by the same soul as that of the book, but has its own distinct body.
Recreating an epic
 The writers, Varun Grover, Smita Singh and Vasant Nath, take the story of a cop, a gangster and a city set in the late 1990s/early 2000s and retell it in, 2018, with a sense of urgency, impetus and sensitivity. What stands out is the inclusivity with which the writers re-imagine the book. A throwaway character in the book is the bar dancer, “Kukoo” and is no way significant to the plot, yet represents a distinct Bombay personality. The writers have instead elevated Kukoo in their narrative, giving her a share of the spotlight and the audience a beauteous Bombay character in the bargain.
The first season of the show, which roughly covers about one third of the 950-page book, moves briskly, but makes time to include the many back stories and inject atmospherics into the proceedings to make sure that you are watching an authentic Mumbai show. Bollywood, politicians, religion, the underworld, the corrupt, the rich, the high-rises, the slums, the chawls, the dance bars, the dives, the fine-dine, it has it all in its embrace, but more importantly, it’s been rendered in an aesthetic which is authentic. To cite two examples, I’d point to the multilingual nature of the show, where Marathi, Hindi, English Punjabi and Gujarati all co-exist like the many languages a true blue Mumbaikar uses to navigate the city. Or the respect and warmth with which the working class, their dwellings and their lives are shown.
Acting crew
 Of course, Nawazuddin Siddique is a class act. He becomes Ganesh Gaitonde from the time he commits his first murder. This is familiar territory for Siddique, but Chandra’s writing had always brought to mind, a “Nana Patekar in his prime” kind of Gaitonde. Saif Ali Khan as Singh meanwhile executes a tough role — a forty-something overweight cop, he’s the “hero” fighting greys, not just in his beard, but also the bleak moral zones that his job makes him inhabit. He is divorced, on anxiety pills and is one badly executed encounter away from oblivion in the police force. Yet Khan brings alive his character’s midlife crises and the many compromises Singh makes to inhabit a “good cop” zone with skill and dexterity.
The book is about all the smaller characters and their arcs, against which the leads defined themselves. Therefore it’s the finely cast ensemble, which truly defines this show. Jitendra Joshi as Katekar, Singh’s loyal and long-suffering sidekick, Kubra Sait as Kukoo, Shalini Vatsa as Kanta Bai the moonshine-maker-turned-advisor for Gaitonde and Richa Sharma as Singh’s mother, Navneet Kaur. All of whom, add colour and bring alive the myriad plot contours and the city.
Past present
 The show follows two strands, one which is set in the present, focussed on Singh, directed by Vikramaditya Motwane and the other which narrates Gaitonde’s backstory directed by Anurag Kashyap. The Gaitonde narrative seems a tad filmy, but then isn’t every gangster’s story just that? In comparison, Motwane’s narrative is taut yet sensitive — he directs thrills, confrontations, deaths and life with an inherent sense of place and more importantly, innate human dignity.
Aloknanda Dasgupta’s background score is atmospheric and moody, adding to the much needed texture which is created by the supporting crew, whether it’s the turban drapers or the costume designers. There are many Bombays in this city and it is to the crew’s credit that they bring them alive so evocatively. It’s fortunate that Sacred Games, has been created by an international streaming major, this means that life can be depicted as it is lived.
Besides the colourful patois, there are uninhibited and furtive sex scenes, nudity, random and planned violence, as it unfurls everyday in the metropolis. Interestingly the book was written when the NDA government was at the helm, and the Hindu right had entered cultural spaces with their ideologies. In 2018, the scenario is not very different, religion has invaded the popular discourse again and we are constantly made to calibrate individuals and actions against the binaries of religion. There is no better time then, to have this mandala of a show, which accords viewers a grand view of the city, its multifarious ticking parts and the several games which are played out in the name of religion.

Loud & clear: Audible comes to India
","Less than 24 hours after Audible — the audiobook publisher and retailer currently owned by Amazon — is launched in India at a glitzy event at the Royal Opera House in Mumbai, I sit down for a phone call with Donald Katz, Founder and CEO. This week’s launch means that Indian customers now have access to over 2,00,000 English-language audiobooks and original content, including 400 exclusive titles by local authors. And Katz is the high-profile, sneaker-wearing, start-up loving founder behind it all.
“I was most excited to talk to you,” he starts, going on to ask me about my background in theatre. “Are you aware of the things we’re doing with playwrights, and of our theatre fund?” he asks.
I am momentarily stumped, wondering if Katz — named one of America’s Top 25 Disruptive Leaders (by Living Cities) — has come better prepared for this interview than I have. But it is also not a surprise. He credits his past as an “inquisitive journalist” (he has served as a contributing editor for publications like Rolling Stone and Esquire) with giving him sharp observational skills, incredible honesty and a desire to “find the truth”. That, combined with his interest in early-stage start-ups, has helped make his 23-year-old company one of the largest success stories of technology in the creative space.
From Anne Hathaway (The Wonderful Wizard of Oz) to Kate Winslet (Matilda, among others), Audible is replete with celebrity narrators, and the Indian platform is no different. The showstopper at the launch this week was a rendition of Hussain Zaidi and Jane Borges’ Mafia Queens of Mumbai, the 2011 book about the female doyens in Mumbai’s underworld, narrated by actors Radhika Apte, Kalki Koechlin and Rajkummar Rao.
But to call Audible just an audiobook seller would severely limit its vast scope. It has revived plays, commissioned new works and has convinced established authors like Michael Lewis to bypass print and go straight to audio. Above all, the company has helped make audio books cool again.
“I'm just excited about customising the cause of the creative community throughout,” says Katz, about this remarkable journey. “You see how we have branched out into so many realms of the professional creative class.” 
He admits that the rise of Audible is “non-obvious. It’s not a super-fast, interactive, short-form experience”. But he is also able to explain the acceptance of the medium. “As a writer, I realised we’re all pretty much writing to the same, fairly smart, sophisticated person who is precisely the person who doesn’t have a lot of time,” he says. 
The idea with Audible was to give people the opportunity to consume quality content. After the 2008 merger, users were able to login to Audible with their Amazon credentials. Along with the other pioneers of the space (hello, podcasters), it has successfully offered audio as a content solution that fits in with the busy-ness of modern life. Commutes, elliptical machines, laundromats — all perfect settings for a good (audio) book.
Audible’s global expansion is slow and calculated, placing great emphasis on local context. On audible.co.jp, for instance, audiences can listen to anime actors performing dramatic recreations of manga, “which is appropriate because the book culture there is very large”. 
In India, the customisation (which includes a range of exclusive titles by Indian authors, such as Durjoy Datta’s first audio romance, The Last Boy to Fall in Love), also extends to pricing. A subscription to the platform will set you back by ₹199 per month, while American customers typically pay around ₹1,090. 
When I ask Katz about future plans for India, he and Shailesh Sawlani, the country GM for Audible India (ex-Uber), emphasise that an expansion to regional languages is definitely on the cards. “It’s just the beginning,” he concludes.

Lord of the ring "," The Ashok is teeming with sport stars. Young and sprightly, they are all busy. Some are checking in for the official felicitation function. Some are stepping out to catch up on shopping related to the function. Everyone is super busy. But one young man has no moment to himself. He is actually the superstar among the sport stars. Humble and extremely introvert, he hardly comes across the 49kg gold medallist, a champion in the ring at the recent Asian Games held in Jakarta. Hardly. But Amit Panghal, the diminutive dynamite from Maina village in Haryana’s Rohtak district, rides tall amongst the sporting fraternity of the country.
I have a lunch rendezvous with Amit at Frontier, which is known to serve authentic North-West Frontier cuisine. The Ashok, it is said, is well liked for its superb dining facilities. The ambiance is refined and beautiful. At Frontier, you are treated to a visual performance of Chef Anish Kanswal’s tandoori specialities. The most popular dishes such as Pathar Kabab, and Kabab-e-Bannu offer succulent pieces of tender chicken enclosed in an egg wrapping. Dal Dera Ismail Khan, to be had with keema naan and pudina naan, figures among the most delicious dishes.
The staff at the Frontier lines up in silent admiration as Amit, proudly dangling the gold medal, walks in, takes his seat, and then tries soaking in the place. The gold medal bout is fresh. So are his memories of the journey to the podium, beginning from early days spent with brother Ajay, who was a boxer to be feared in the neighbourhood. “I have lived my brother’s dream. He is the reason why I became a boxer. I never thought of becoming a boxer. My coach (Anil Dhankar) pushed me. He had more confidence in me. His support has been invaluable for me. And, of course, Vijender Singh (Olympic boxing medallist). Vijender was the inspiration,” Amit smiles into the camera of my colleague. 
An armyman to the core, Amit saluted the National Flag at Jakarta in a fitting manner after winning the gold. At the presentation ceremony, he could not hold back his tears. “I don’t know what happened. I have heard the National Anthem so many times but I just could not hold myself back. I used to get goosebumps when hearing the National Anthem. The tears were natural. I still get emotional.” 




The gold medal at the 2018 Asian Games is big. “Very big,” Amit corrects me with his infectious smile. “The boxing family was looking for glory. Vikas (Krishan) was sure to get a medal but for the cut he suffered on the eye. This medal means so much for me because 49 kg is to be removed from the schedule and I have to compete in the 52 kg category. It is going to be hard work.”
You have to strain to hear him. Amit is a calm and composed young man, sitting across the table, just the opposite of what he is in the ring – agile and swift, so nimble footed. Is he not docile for a boxer. “Most people have a wrong impression that wrestlers and boxers should be aggressive. I remain calm mostly but sometimes I do get angry, irritated. My game is more defensive and I believe in counter attack. In small weights, speed, and not strength is what matters. Agility is an essential part of boxing. I have worked on it. But I don’t have to be needlessly aggressive and anxious.”
How about lunch? The menu offers a mouth watering variety but his choice narrows down to fruit plate. “Only fruits,” asks Nishtha Chandel, who is facilitating our visit to Frontier. The kababs appear attractive. But Amit wants to avoid heavy food.
“I am not at all fussy about food. I can eat anything. I can survive without vegetarian food. I love chicken and can eat lots of it. I need to develop my strength too. I love daal and rotis as much but nothing to beat the choorma and kheer that comes from my mother’s exceptional cuisine. I can eat anything cooked by her 365 days. She is so good,” Amit pours out his respect and affection for his mother.
When Vijender was winning the Olympic medal, Amit was starting his boxing. “His Olympic medal was a boost to boxing in India. First one in Olympics. Boxers have emerged from all corners of the country thanks to him.” Talking of inspiration, Amit has grown idolising the legendary Muhammad Ali. “He was the ultimate boxer. His punching speed was frightening. For his size, he was lightening quick on his feet. No wonder he is the greatest boxing icon.” 
Amit hails from a small village where wrestling is big. He reflects, “We have lots of wrestlers emerging from Haryana. But boxing is picking up. The state government is also encouraging. Girls are doing pride to the State. Phogat sisters have changed the scenario. Then Mary Kom has inspired women boxers. Now Vinesh Phogat has done the same in wrestling. She is a big wrestler. My grandfather was a wrestler. I was never attracted to it and then my brother took me to boxing.”
The fruit plate arrives. He concentrates on the kiwi fruit and slices of watermelon. He quickly gulps the orange juice. I know there are many waiting to interview Amit, whose life has changed from the time he became an Asian Games gold medallist. “I can see the change (within) yes. The world has changed. I am overwhelmed by the affection that has been bestowed upon me.”
At Jakarta, Manoj Kumar was his room-mate. “He motivated me before every bout. I have learnt a lot from the seniors. I would like aspirants to learn from the coaches and the seniors. Make the most of their experience. I would also like to tell you that sportsmen hardly lose temper. I hardly get angry. Never outside the ring. Never. But I do feel sad when I see the filth around. We should try and stay clean. And rape is a blot on our society. It has to be dealt with firmly.”
Dessert? “Not now. I am full,” Ami raises his arms. “I love sweets. Kheer and choorma is my favourite. My mother makes it the best. To lose 2 ½ kg before the final, I had to eat lots of fruits, juices (watermelon, orange, pineapple). Now there is no weight control. I eat whatever I get. I am physically tough. And I am mentally tough too.”
Amit, a Naib Subedar in Army, will soon travel to Pune, which is close to Mumbai. Meeting film legend Dharmendra is a secret desire for Amit. “I am a huge fan. My father (Vijender Singh) and Dhankar Sir are huge fans of Dharmendra. My father’s DP on Whatsapp has a Dharmendra photo. I love him. I have heard he used to be known as the He Man. I love his son (Sunny Deol). I can see his punches. They must have tremendous power. I have seen many of his movies many times. Wish I could meet Dharmendra ji.”
It is time for Amit, 22, to join a crew filming his appeal for Swachh Bharat. The hotel staff swarms him for selfies. He obliges them all. I have not seen champions so humble. He is indeed a rare commodity!

One, two, three, keep watching: Why autoplay is critical part of our lives
","After reading many rave reviews, I recently decided to watch The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel, available on Amazon Prime. It’s a period show about a hilarious young woman’s self-discovery after her husband leaves her, in the New York of the ’50s. I thought I’d stick to one episode, maybe two, one evening. But it turned, as these things often do, into a marathon session. I literally did not have to move through the four episodes I saw in one sitting — one would finish and, sure as day, the next one would follow without any external input from me. Do I, then, curse the autoplay? Or do I bless it with all my heart for turning me into a bum (a very content one, admittedly)? 
Inbuilt stupidity
The YouTube autoplay feature, when it first came out, was arguably the most annoying thing on all of the Internet. Its inbuilt stupidity was frightening. So, for example, if you’re listening to a classic by the Spice Girls, and the song finishes and you look away for a second, next thing you know, you’re halfway through a cooking video on how to best use Mediterranean spices. And that was on a good day. Like the hot water running out in the middle of a shower, or a raisin in a savoury dish, or a much-loved uncle turning out to be openly bigoted, the autoplay threw up unpleasant surprises in the most unexpected of ways. It was the worst, and everyone hated it. But YouTube persevered with it, for the benefit of seemingly no one. 
There’s a music streaming platform called SoundCloud, mostly used for underground or noncommercial music — it’s useful for artists, as they can upload their music for free. Their autoplay, too, used to be a royal nuisance. The Artificial Intelligence guiding it — the algorithm — had perhaps an IQ in the low double-digit figures. Like, if I heard a random Indian electronic producer’s mid-tempo, ambient, easygoing song, it would invariably be followed by extreme, indecipherable metal from the coldest parts of Europe.
It slowly got better, providing users with better follow-ups. As did the YouTube autoplay, which now throws up loosely related (as opposed to flamboyantly unrelated) hits. In fact, YouTube even allows its users to turn the feature off, some five years after users begged for it. 
User experience
But it doesn’t matter anymore. No one bothers. Because the autoplay is a critical part of our lives today. Streaming videos online — through Netflix, YouTube, Amazon Prime, even Hotstar or ALTBalaji — is pretty much all about ease and effortlessness. The UX, the user experience. If I watch one single episode of one single show from start to finish, the internal algorithms of these platforms will throw a hundred related shows or films that I “might also like because [I] watched that one show that one time.” Their goal is to keep me watching, keep me horizontal and listless and utterly inept, for as long as possible. This increases numbers, you see. 
That little box
The same way, as one episode nears its conclusion and the end credits roll, a little box on the bottom right appears. Within 15 seconds or so, the next episode will start on its own, unless you cancel the command. It’s great for a Sunday afternoon, when the burdens of the week gone by have only just begun to ease off, and all you want to do is lie in bed and stuff your face with junk food. In that sense, it’s most definitely a blessing. 
But, the way I see it, there’s something more diabolical at play here. I recently found myself watching something online, on a platform which didn’t yet have an effective autoplay. And I was complaining about it. I was literally whining about the fact that I had to move my arm 10 inches forward, click a few things on the screen, and then move on to the next episode. Is this what I have become now? 
Quite apart from the laziness it encourages in the name of ‘comfort’, the autoplay also affects my rationing of time. Like how I’ll occasionally open a live video of a band on YouTube. Once it finishes, I’ll gladly move on to the next suggestion that’s offered to me. And then the next. And the next. Next thing I know, the sun is out and the crows and pigeons are at it again. Streaming of videos, by its very existence, allows users to waste time with something familiar running in the background. You’re not doing nothing, but you’re not doing anything particularly meaningful or worthwhile either. An additional feature that makes us do even less is… well, it’s confusing for me. I’m torn between how brilliant and ludicrous it is.

'Succession': The family that plots together
","The TV family drama, once a soap opera template that spawned a thousand episodes, has come of age in the post-digital world. Troubled childhood impacting adult lives (Ray Donovan), the black sheep putting lives of his near-and-dear ones in peril (Bloodline), the household that controls the fate of a nation (Tyrant) - family sagas now walk a tightrope between fraying relationships and darker themes.
The newest entrant to this dysfunctional-relatives-out-to-get-one-another genre is HBO’s Succession, about one of America’s richest business families, the Roys, choking under the stronghold of a ruthless patriarch. Brian Cox plays a Rupert Murdoch-styled media mogul, Logan Roy, who refuses to entrust his children with the family business after earning octogenarian status. The show begins with Logan turning 80, and changing his mind about ceding the CEO position to Kendall, the only offspring who seems worthy of succession.
Adam McKay (The Big Short) directs one of the year’s best pilots, setting the tone with an episode that’s tightly-knit, tense and firing-on-all-cylinders from the get-go. Kendall is in the middle of an acquisition that could accelerate his ascent to the throne even as he’s forced to look over his shoulders, lest his own father snatch away his shot at glory. His siblings Roman and Shiv, and step-brother Connor, have their own idiosyncrasies, each of them hungry for their father’s ever-wavering attention. 
Two other members of the extended family, Shiv’s fiancee Tom, and cousin Greg, compete for oddball status. 
Creator Jesse Armstrong gives you characters that are, at once, fascinating as they are spite-inducing, each of them using their clout to clamp down on less fortunate entities. A particularly uncomfortable moment in the first episode has Roman enticing the gardener’s kid with the possibility of winning a million dollars if he hits a home run in a game of baseball. Roman nonchalantly snatches the bat from the young boy at the end of the challenge, tearing the cheque into pieces and walking away. 
Privilege doesn’t necessarily make you empathetic, and the Roys are a particularly merciless bunch. There is really no character worth rooting for here; only those you hate less. Kendall is the one who comes nearest to ‘protagonist’ tag, and actor Jeremy Strong brings a mix of naked ambition and desperate vulnerability to a character you can never decide is worthy of being rooted for or not. 
After starting on a strong note (the brilliant second episode is set entirely in the confines of a hospital over a single night), Succession meanders for a bit, with greater emphasis on business dealings and Machiavellian one-upmanship. The show, however, settles into a comfortable rhythm around the midway mark, when relationships begin to unravel. Each episode in the latter half of the 10-part season is underlined with a sense of breathless urgency, and intrigue. 
A special mention about the Nicholas Brittel-created theme song, which you can use as an imaginary background score while inventing schemes to outmanoeuvre rivals in the real world.
The first season of Succession is now available for streaming on Hotstar

I was initially uncomfortable in Bigg Boss: Ananth Vaidyanathan
"," Ananth Vaidyanathan is a familiar face on television, having been associated with the Super Singer show on Vijay TV. He’s now in the limelight for participating in the latest season of Bigg Boss, from which he was voted out recently. Excerpts from an interview:
You must be happy that you’re out of the Bigg Boss house. Why did you choose to enter in the first place?
 Initially, I was very reluctant to take it up. It’s such a huge show and you have no control over what would happen. I am frankly not a people’s person. I’m very shy and hyper sensitive, and I look for people I’ll be comfortable with. When I signed up for what is essentially a social situation, I knew I’d be a weak person. I succumbed to it within the first few hours in the house.
So why did you say yes?
 Because I wanted to walk through all that I was afraid of. At 62, I cannot afford to have fears. 
The three weeks inside the house saw you go through an uncomfortable environment. Your discomfort was evident.
 Yes, I was very uncomfortable in the first 72 hours. That also let to my first nomination for elimination. When you’re silent in a crowd, it is interpreted as being arrogant. So, I decided I have to come clean; and I shared with the contestants about how painfully shy I was, and how it was a big challenge for my career growth. Everyone was overwhelmed when I did that. For me, it was the breakthrough moment of self acceptance. 
Who was your confidante, with whom you discussed everything?
 Ponambalam. I used to share a lot with him. The man has a lot of innate wisdom. 
If that’s the case, why did you nominate him for the ‘jail sentence’, something that most viewers didn’t take to kindly?
 I am a very strong champion of women’s rights. It is in this background that I approached the situation. On one of the episodes, he made one statement: “Ava edhuvum yezhakka tayara iruka (She’s ready to let go of anything).” That had serious connotations and it upset me a lot. 
But posts on social media are trolling you for doing that...
 If the Ponambalam issue blows up — and I know there is a serious possibility of that happening — I just don’t care. 
Who would you bet on to become the winner of the show?
 Yashika. She has character... as does Aishwarya. They stand for something. 
So, what are your plans now, now that you’re out of Bigg Boss?
 I’ll surely get back to teaching singing at my academy. Also, I started off as a singer...so whatever years I have left, I’d like to do justice to my classical singing.

Web TV by and about Kannadigas "," Entertainment today come in various avatars. The competition out there has made creators come up with various ideas to capture the market. 
The latest to join the entertainment bandwagon is Sirinadu, a Web TV channel, exclusively by Kannadigas about Kannadigas.
The founders Rajashekar Kambar, Sangam Dev and GN Rajashekara Naidu Gudibande, launched the channel officially. “It can be watched on a smart TV or by downloading the app on your mobiles. I would call it an Infotainment channel as we will have programmes that not only entertain but are also informative,” explains Kambar. 




The channel kickstarts with programmes such as Nivedana (a bhakti programme by well-known scholar Dr Bannanje Govindacharya), Mane mane ruchi (a cookery show), Ruchi Vilasa which will feature chefs sharing their recipes, Book Nodi book (featuring newly published Kannada books each week), Bhale Bhale (showcases the adventurous feats by Kannadigas across the state), Hale ruchi hosa Bage (traditional recipes with a twist). 
“This is the first effort in Kannada. You have Netflix and others in English, but, we wanted a Kannada streaming platform because we want to cover a wide range of topics. It will be a platform to present our culture, heritage along with issues related to farmers and women,” adds Gudibande. 
They assure us that they will telecast original programmes and “not repeat shows from regular TV channels. We will be creating our own content. There will not be daily news, but we sure will cover politics. The idea is to bring dominant issues to your finger tips with short programmes, which will not cross the 12-minute limit,” explains Kambar. 
“Mobile media should be brisk, short and snappy. People don’t want to use up their data. So we as a channel have understood what they want. Hence relevant issues will be to the point,” adds Gudibande. 
The channel will not have celebrities as its face nor will they host any programmes as “we cannot afford to pay them”. Nor will they telecast films but will cover film news. “Especially, those with new ideas and themes. We want to laud young filmmakers for their efforts, and the freshness they are bringing in with their ideas and experimental cinema. Sirinadu will be a platform to promote them too,” says Gudibande.
Kambar adds that in the future they may plan for a few web series too. Sirinadu, which has taken off, is free and can be downloaded as an app from Google playstore. It will be available on Android, IOS and online on www.sirinadu.com

Time to laugh
","Young Jagan Krishnan had rockstar dreams only to realise that music was more than just strumming a guitar. But no, this is not a sob story. “I was pretty cool about it and quite sheepishly open. In fact, I have been laughing off all those supposedly difficult situations in life. That uncanny streak of humour in me made me try stand-up,” says Jagan. 
And so over the past three years, he has been making people laugh their lungs out through his easy-to-digest comedy shows. He does this along with his long-time friend Mervyn Rozaria, a typical carefree Chennai lad known for his spontaneous jokes.
After touring Puducherry and Dindigul, their show Oru Time Pakalam is set to be performed for the first time in Madurai, this weekend. So gear up for 90 minutes of laughter that’s going to be entirely in Tamil.“Our brand of comedy is simple, relatable and from everyday happenings. It’s not difficult to understand,” says Mervyn. “Since stand-up is concentrated only in Chennai, we thought of targeting audience in smaller towns. That way, exposing them to the art form and also tapping in on the market there.”
The show is a breezy comedy on Tamil pop culture, with humourous takes on cinema, music, politics, and current news and trends. “It was only a 15-minute script initially, which we developed after lot of refinement. We usually perform in open mics and gauge response and feedback. We make on-the-spot improvisations, add lines specific to the city we perform in, and make spontaneous jibes,” says Mervyn. 
The duo’s first show Academy awards became a hit and ever since, they started collaborating. “We share the stage equally but since both of us are from different backgrounds, our shows are diverse, thus offering variety. The format is not the usual trolling. We make sure our comedy is effortless and not offensive,” adds Jagan.
The show is jointly presented by Eight-O-Eight and Evam and will be on at JC Residency, Chinna Chokkikulam on November 24 at 7 pm. For tickets, visit bookmyshow.com or call 7373000034, 7200039444

Priyanka Chopra, Nick Jonas announce engagement "," Actor Priyanka Chopra and American singer Nick Jonas have officially announced their engagement after a pooja ceremony held at the her residence here, ending months of speculation about their relationship.
Both Priyanka and her beau declared their love for each other on their Instagram pages after the ceremony.
She shared a photo from the ceremony where she is seen embracing Nick.
“Taken.. With all my heart and soul..” she captioned the photo.
Jonas, 25 also shared the same photo on Instagram and called Priyanka “Future Mrs. Jonas. My heart. My love.” 
However, the couple, who were strictly private about their relationship, have not announced a date for their wedding.
 The priest, who conducted the puja at Priyanka’s residence, said it was for peace and their well-being.
“The puja started a little over 10.30 a.m. and it lasted for about four hours. We performed Grah Shanti, Ganesh Puja, Aarti and havan. It was done for their peace and well-being. They both looked very nice together. We just wish them a long and happy life,” priest 
“Nick is a very humble person. He just followed the rituals. Priyanka used to explain things to him,” Kamal Kumar Mishra, told PTI.
 In the first photos from the ceremony, Priyanka and Nick were seen in traditional Indian attires.
 A photo from the ceremony showed the couple standing in front of background bearing their first initials.
 Priyanka opted for a yellow Abu Jani Sandeep Khosla salwar suit, Nick donned a ivory kurta churidar for the occasion.
 The designer duo also posted a picture from the ceremony.
“LOVE AGLOW! Priyanka Chopra is heavenly in Abu Jani Sandeep Khosla Couture at her Roka Ceremony. Here’s wishing the beautiful couple every Joy,” they captioned the photo on their official Instagram page.
 Nick’s parents, Denise Miller-Jonas and Paul Kevin Jonas, who arrived on Thursday, also opted for Indian wear.
 Priyanka’s cousin Parineeti Chopra, Salman Khan’s sister Arpita Khan Sharma and screenwriter Mushtaq Sheikh were present at the function.
 Preparations for the ceremony were going on in full swing since morning at Priyanka’s Juhu residence.
 Nick arrived here with his parents on Thursday and they were received by Priyanka at the Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport.
 Last night, the couple went for a dinner along with their families at JW Marriott Hotel in Juhu.
 The couple will reportedly be throwing a party for their friends and family at her residence tonight to celebrate their engagement. The bash is expected to be attended by a host of celebrities.
 The singer reportedly proposed to Priyanka on her birthday in July this year. 
Priyanka, who is currently in Mumbai to shoot for Shonali Bose’s film “The Sky is Pink”, was spotted wearing the ring at designer Manish Malhotra’s party recently.
 The duo sparked dating speculations when they were photographed enjoying multiple dates over Memorial Day weekend.
 Nick had met Priyanka’s family in June and even spent quality time with them in Goa. The couple had also posed for the shutterbugs during the the engagement party of Mukesh Ambani’s son Akash.
 But it is for the first time that parents from both the sides are meeting.
 Nick had already introduced the actor to his family members when she had attended the wedding of his cousin in the U.S.

Quest for the unknown ","An animal lover since childhood, Nigel Marven is one of those fortunate ones who manage to turn their passion into their profession. The renowned television presenter, producer and author has anchored several nature-related shows such as Ten Deadliest Snakes with Nigel series, Untamed China, Wild Colombia and Jaguar Adventure. 
He is now back on Animal Planet with Nigel Marven’s Wild Philippines, a three-part series that takes a close look at the flora and fauna of the archipelago. What makes the series special is that some of the species on show have never been captured on camera before. 
In an interaction, Nigel talks about the series, importance of conservation and the need to involve local communities in preserving the environment.
Excerpts:
How did the series come into being?
Earlier I had done a programme for Discovery called Ten Deadliest Snakes which was shot in India and Philippines besides other countries. While making this programme, I realised that there were so many extraordinary animals in Philippines, many of which have not been filmed before. So I decided to bring them in this show. We start with the Luzon island, where the capital Manila is located. We explore corals and the endangered Philippine crocodile there. Next is Palawan, located in the west and close to Borneo, and here we see special animals including a giant pitcher plant – a insect eating plant inside which we found a dead rat. Although there are thousands of islands, we took up the seven largest ones.
The show covers from tarantulas to eagles, amazing coral reefs, tarsier, a nocturnal monkey which eats insects, colourful birds, whale sharks, some of which are 10 metres long and feed on the shrimps, among others. We also shot an amazing procession of buffaloes in the town of Pulilan, in which they are of them are painted and walked through the town to pass by a church for farmers to pay their respect to the shrine. The series has several plants and animals never seen before and that is precisely what is exciting about it.
What new species will the global audience get to see in this show?
I have already mentioned about the tarsier. One will see tarantulas which glows blue in the torch light, a number of birds never shown before, including a colourful peacock. Exploring the coral reefs, we watch some unique underwater life. Among the birds we will showcase the world’s largest eagle, the Philippine eagle which the country’s national bird. It is critically endangered and is being bred in captivity. Interestingly, the eagle grows to become so large and powerful that it is able feed on monkeys. I end the show with an eagle on my hand.
Apart from this we get to see the Philippine sailfin lizard which runs on water making those scenes extraordinary. Then there are some amazing snakes, including a cobra in lovely golden colour. Taking to the waters, I dive with the whale sharks, one of the largest fish in the sea, and handle a sea krait. We also shot a seahorse, pink in colour, and it looks fantastic. One last thing I would like to add, which is extraordinary and would be loved by the audience, are the tamaraw or the Mindoro dwarf buffalo, whose habitat is found in high mountains. 
Share with us the challenges and dangers faced while shooting the series
The main challenge was that of the budget. We had to be very sure that we are going to find the animals at the right place and time and that required intensive research. Filming thresher sharks which have long tails in deep waters was indeed challenging. That was first time in my life I saw a thresher shark.
As regarding dangers, there weren’t too many. Over the years I have learnt to take calculated risks. Having said that, I would like to add that more people die driving four-wheelers on the road than because of attacks by animals.
Tell us about some of your unforgettable moments while making the show
One was the experience with the thresher shark. I was sitting on the edge when this shark came out of the blues towards me. Another was the buffalo festival in Pulilan in which I saw for the first time water buffaloes in such large numbers in a procession. Besides, these, filming mountain buffaloes will always remain etched in my mind. Last but not the least is the truly amazing experience of Philippines eagle sitting on my hand. 
Do you think the series will add to conservation awareness?
I hope it to create awareness both globally and locally amongst people about the rich flora and fauna of the Philippines and how important it is to conserve it. The main issue there is the loss of rain forests since its unchecked destruction will result in loss of their national bird, the eagle. The region is endowed with some of the best coral reefs in the world like the Tubbataha one which we have shown. 
It is well patrolled by the rangers who are very strict with enforcing laws. That is the reason why there are so many fishes there. It is one of the best places I have ever dived.
How can we strike a balance between development and conservation?
That is definitely an important issue to be addressed and one hopes that people realise that there is a need to integrate development and conservation. We need to emphasise that protection of ecology is always beneficial for the present generation and the future one. This is where one needs to replicate the Indian example, where a network of national parks have been created to protect environment. It is not just the laws but their strict implementation that is must. In the Philippines there is a move to save the rain forests and it is bound to pay dividends considering that the logging companies are not as powerful as they used to be. 
How important is the involvement of local communities in conservation?
That is of vital importance and that is what will sustain the conservation in the long run. Protected areas yield revenue as it attracts wildlife enthusiasts, natural life photographers and international and domestic tourists. This boosts the local economy generating employment and business. The crux is that forest and wildlife protection pays in the long run. Also forests yield a lot in terms of food and fuel that can be used by the local communities.

Actor Dileep is no longer a member of A.M.M.A, says Mohanlal
"," Actor Dileep, accused in the abduction and sexual assault of a woman actor, is no longer a member of A.M.M.A (Association of Malayalam Movie Actors), according to Mohanlal, president of the association. 
“Dileep tendered his resignation after we sought it,” Mr. Mohanlal told the media after a meeting of available executive committee members of the actors’ guild here on Friday. Bickering within the association was apparent over the week after the Women in Cinema Collective (WCC), a gathering of women actors in Malayalam cinema, voiced its protest against A.M.M.A for the body’s perceived apathy towards the assaulted woman actor, which according to them was in stark contrast to the protection it granted to the accused actor. 
Mohanlal, who was flayed by the WCC for addressing seasoned women actors part of them with the generic word ‘actresses,’ chose to address them as such even on Friday. Rebutting the accusations, he said it was wrong on the part of some A.M.M.A members [who are also part of the WCC] to level allegations against the association while remaining within it. 
There was a system within the body to address complaints of sexual harassment and the committee comprised K.P.A.C. Lalitha, Kukku Parameswaran and Kaviyoor Ponnamma. He also downplayed the sticking points in the responses to the WCC given separately by actors Siddique and Jagadeesh, saying both were in line with the official position on the issue. 
“The A.M.M.A available executive has resolved that the reinstatement of women actors who have left the body will be considered as and when they approach it with the request. It’s not on top of our priority right now,” he said. “There’s no need to call a general body to discuss this. As for the Dileep issue, we had asked the women actors for sometime to act on the demand for his resignation, but that was not heeded,” he said.

'Black Spot': a potpourri of mystery and mysticism ","Streaming services are really the friends you need right now, for they unearth treasures and bring them to your desktop or mobile screens. Can your real friends do that? I don’t think so.
Until a week ago, I hadn’t heard of the French series Black Spot. I had no clue of its existence. I stumbled on it, quite fortunately if I may say so, on Amazon Prime and binge-watched the eight-hour crime drama with frequent breaks between the episodes. By the end of the show, I was tired and thirsty, but it was worth it.
Black Spot brought several gritty images from another acclaimed European show, The Bridge, before my eyes. The multi-season, no holds barred, gut-puncher of a series set a bar of sorts for solving crimes on television. The cases, like in Black Spot, weren’t the regular ones. They were as dark as the night could get.




The French offering, created by Mathieu Missoffe, charts its own course and emerges as a fitting addition to the growing popularity of the genre. For a show of this nature, there isn’t too much blood, or gore, on-screen. And that’s a willing diversion the makers seemed to have taken. The magical strokes are mostly in the details (in the revelations, to be precise).
Unlike psychopathic killers that populate the landscape of detective-thrillers, the murderers here apologize for their acts – the truck driver who kills his wife and buries her in the garden just outside his house, the rape victim who shoots down her attacker after she’s denied justice through the legal system, and so on. Closer home, Tamil filmmaker Mysskin uses this trope to convey the inability of the characters to do anything else at those particular moments.
The killings are usually tied to emotional reasons rather than monetary gains. This emotion – deprived of cinematic grandiloquence – works excellently as it humanizes the proceedings. If you think Game of Thrones kills characters in every episode, you should devote a minute to the number of heinous deaths that occur in Villefranche (a small fictional town where the entire action takes place).
The huge trees in Villefranche’s forest that cover the land and the sky might remind you of the heavenly escapades in Kerala, but you shouldn’t get fooled by its façade. While the green belts of the Western Ghats hold natural beauty in their long arms, the mystic grey forest in Black Spot resembles a mini version of hell. The forest has secrets nobody has the answers for, and dead bodies nobody knows how they ended up there.




The series, unusually, begins and ends with the case of the disappearance of the Mayor’s daughter. However, it isn’t the only case that Laurène Weiss (Suliane Brahim), the town’s sheriff, is busy looking into as every hour has a mysterious element tucked into it. Laurène acts on her instincts, and relies little on the facts and the accounts of witnesses she’s presented with. Her methods wouldn’t have gotten an A+ by Sherlock Holmes, but that doesn’t matter as her instincts have always pointed toward the right direction.
Black Spot will appear like an anthology, at first, if you don’t pay attention to it. It might also get a bit confusing since the sub-plots and the case of the missing girl aren’t related. It takes some time to get adjusted to the show’s writing. And, though, Brahim stars as the lead, almost every actor has got something important to do. From the District Attorney (Laurent Capelluto), who drops in to collect information about the Mayor and his misdeeds, to the town’s doctor (Naidra Ayadi) who performs autopsies, all the characters are well-defined.
The second season is currently under production, and I hope they take Laurène Weiss’s character to uncharted waters in it.

Stand up for dad
"," Putting a comic spin on Father’s Day, which is tomorrow, Chennai Comedy presents Laugh off at Backyard, a stand-up show featuring a group of comics who want to take a dig at dads. “The main objective of a themed show is to use the subject being performed as a hook to invite audiences. You sell the concept, as opposed to a comic,” explains Sudarshan Ramamurthy, from Chennai Comedy, a platform aimed at promoting stand-up across the city.
Widening the spectrum
The first wave of stand-up comics in India — think Sorabh Pant, Kanan Gill, Aravind SA and Aditi Mittal — made a splash. But for successors, competition is very stiff. While it is the big names that draw large crowds, themed shows help bring in new audiences for emerging artists. 
“When there’s a specific theme, a new crowd comes in,” shares Akshaya Chittybabu, co-founder of Backyard, which has been hosting stand-up comedy for over a year. “We usually see a recurring crowd when the show is marketed based on the artiste performing,” he shares.
“We had a family of three in our last show, and it was clear that the parents hadn’t watched live stand-up comedy before,” says Ramamurthy. “When the comic talked about not being able to understand his wife, the woman of the family spoke up and said, ‘Let me show you a WhatsApp forward I received about this’. They weren’t heckling; they were just being earnest. These are the people we want to bring into the audience spectrum,” he shares.




Performing for parents
City-based comic Manoj Prabakar, presenting the closing performance for the evening, says theme-based shows place some pressure on the comic to write content revolving around a specific subject, like Father's Day. “Most comics taking the stage now are in their 20s. The way they look at comedy is very different from those in our parents’ generation. So it’s often difficult to crack an older crowd,” he shares.
In 2016, Bengaluru-based Arnav Rao quit his career as a lawyer in the Madras High Court to pursue stand-up comedy full time. “Since my father is currently paying my rent, I don’t think I should make jokes about him,” chuckles Rao, who will be hosting the show. “As a host, your job profile shifts a little. You need to break the room to warm up the audience for the performing comics, and if someone doesn’t do well, it’s your job to bring the energy back to the room. As a comedian, one of the skill sets you develop is to gauge the room and improvise accordingly. The beauty of stand-up comedy is that you can lie, embellish and exaggerate for effect,” he adds. 
Laugh off at Backyard starts at 7.30 pm on June 16. Tickets, priced at ₹250, are available on bookmyshow.com

As long as your work is good, they won’t care: Varun Grover
","In Mumbai, your address says a lot about who you are. If you are one of the have-nots, it betrays exactly how much you do not have, and if you are one of those who has a lot, your choice of residence reveals how you see the world and your position in it. Varun Grover chooses to live in the northern suburb of Kandivali, far from the hustle and bustle of Mumbai’s heart, because even after a decade in the city — and a string of successes as a lyricist, screenwriter and stand-up comedian — he sees himself as an outsider. “I want to keep it that way,” he says. “Part of the struggle is reduced if you come with the notion that you don’t want to belong. If you’re okay with the idea of sitting out. If you’re okay with the idea that whatever you’re doing is a fleeting moment.”
By choosing not to belong, Grover gets to save on rent, but more importantly, he gets to be deeply political with his art: Masaan, his first film credit as a writer, dealt with themes like love, sex, and caste in Banaras. Netflix’s first original Indian production, Sacred Games, of which he is the lead writer, would be just another cops-and-robbers thriller without the religious politics embedded in its very core. Aisi Taisi Democracy, the stand-up comedy show that he performs with Rahul Ram and Sanjay Rajoura, is fearless and incessant in its attempts at ridiculing the powerful. As I write this, Aisi Taisi tweets “Lynching is BJP’s NREGA.”
It is Grover’s politics that has dragged me all the way to his living room. One of Grover’s three cats peeks out of another room cautiously, presumably trying to assess if I pose a threat. As Grover calls out to it, all the obvious questions flood my mind: Don’t strong political leanings make it hard for an artist to make it? How do you deal with the cloud of imminent violence that’s hanging over every screening, every performance?
“Many people believe that these things are going to be difficult. But they’ve not tried to be political and to see how people react. Most of the people who actually matter are chasing money and they are okay with compromising on politics if it gets them money and gets the work done. It may backfire someday, but as long as your work is good, they won’t care.”
Privileged space
In a country where a school bus full of children is attacked for a movie about a fictional queen; where artists are frequently kept in line and on-message by the threat of defamation and decapitation, Grover’s explanation for how he managed to carve out a small patch of relatively free space for himself strikes me as incomplete at best. I press further, asking if it is his privilege that allows him to adopt such a position. “Yes, absolutely. People who are privileged can take more risks because of that safety shield that privilege provides. I am Hindu, upper-caste, male, and able-bodied. So everything is on my side. That gives me the extra cushion that Swara Bhaskar won’t get. That is something I understand and acknowledge, which also becomes a reason for me to keep doing it. Because I know I have that privilege.”
Being political
Much as Grover might deny the everyday inconveniences of being political, the vast majority of his colleagues, even the ones with truckloads of privilege, don’t seem to conduct themselves as he does. “I don’t understand why people who have the most power, say people like Amitabh Bachchan, are silent on most issues. It’s probably too much to expect him to stand up for all Indians, or even for his fellow U.P.-wallas... I’m saying at least stand up for your industry. Even that he won’t do. Even on simple issues like censorship. Even with films involving his own family members. I’m not judging him; to judge I need to know why he’s doing that, I just don’t understand.”
Bollywood’s elites may shirk the responsibility, but it is probably fair to say that Grover and his fellow comedians are doing more than their fair share of challenging the status quo of public discourse in recent times. And though their numbers are increasing by the day, stand-up comics in India are an endangered species — their art form requires physical presence, which makes them easy targets for angry audiences.
A matter of time
“Right now, the whole stand-up comedy industry is surviving on pure luck. If you haven’t been dragged to a police station, or somebody hasn’t protested at your show, or if somebody has not cancelled your show, it’s just a matter of time.”
There are situations that can be controlled and others that can’t, he explains. If someone is there specifically to disrupt a show or if the atmosphere in the days preceding a show is particularly charged, there is little they can do to protect themselves. But “it’s always at the back of our minds. That something can happen. Which is why I feel safer doing Aisi Taisi Democracy because there are three of us. There’s a 66% chance of survival compared to when you’re alone and one bullet will be enough.”
Perhaps there was a time when a joke could not possibly have invited a bullet as a response, but this isn’t it. Today, there is a deep cleave in our society — Left and Right, Conservatives and Liberals, Patriots and Anti-Nationals, Hindus and Others — the labels vary depending on the context, but what remains true is that those on opposing sides do not merely disagree, they simply do not engage. In such an environment, does an artist who is political see it as his duty to go beyond milking applause from those who agree with him? To try and talk to the other side? To change people’s minds?
“No, because I don’t think people can change with stand-up comedy. But at the same time, I don’t think we are preaching to the choir. In any show, not everybody is completely with us on all the topics we talk about. We talk about Hindutva, and we talk about the problems with Islam also. If there are Muslims in the audience, laughing at the jokes on Hindutva, they will have to confront the jokes on Islam too.”
It is hard to tell whether this strategy of spreading the ridicule out evenly does anything to bridge the divides reinforced by the daily barrage of hate and distrust on our Facebook timelines and in our WhatsApp forwards. However, there is another subject that, according to Grover, invariably unites a large part of their audiences: patriarchy. “When you talk about that, it becomes personal. We don’t have any motive of changing people. But we like the tension in the room that comes when you talk about, say, how patriarchy leads Indian men to become rapists. There’s absolute silence across all ideologies. We like that tension, we like that moment when everybody’s silent and nobody’s clapping.”
Call-out culture
The flipside of the social media madness that defines our age is that although the democratisation of speech has divided us like never before, it has also led to a scarcely conceivable level of progress in a few isolated bubbles — which fuels further division since the people inside the progressive bubbles are so far removed from the norm. Grover’s own Twitter account, constantly active —and angry and funny and poignant — and ostensibly progressive, is an important part of his public persona as well as a potent platform for his politics. But to many, he doesn’t go far enough. As someone who has called others out and has been called out himself, Grover believes that call-out culture is justified when it is punching up, but ultimately problematic.
“There have been critiques of Masaan from a Dalit perspective and Sacred Games from a feminist perspective. I completely agree with them. In Sacred Games, I was one of the writers, so I didn’t have complete power, but still I am partly responsible for not casting a transgender person for the role of Kukoo, which many people called out. They are right in accusing me or anybody from the team of failing transgender people on that count and we can try harder next time.”
“Coming to the broader culture of calling out, I think it’s problematic just like any mob is problematic. Mobs take your thinking away and put things in a certain perspective. They don’t give you facts. They give you facts with a lens. And then, as a mob, you don’t have the opportunity to remove the lens. So you can never judge something objectively. I’ll probably take it because I know that ultimately my privilege will probably see me through, but I won’t indulge in that kind of thing even if it’s punching up. I’ve done it earlier, but of late I’ve given it a rethink. You may be right eight out of 10 times. But those two times are not really a good cost for those eight times.”

Kalki Koechlin’s Indian life
"," Sometime in 2017, Bollywood actor Kalki Koechlin received an email from Jon Manel of the BBC’s World Service. He asked if she would be interested in hosting a podcast focussed exclusively on Indian stories. Koechlin took more than six months to accept, thanks to her busy schedule. But she is glad she did. The culmination of months of research and hours of recording launches today, with the first episode of Kalki Presents: My Indian Life. With 10 episodes featuring as many guests (each clocking in at over 20 minutes) — Koechlin emphasises that the series is a collection of “compelling, personal stories about being young and Indian”.
In the pilot, we hear the chiming bells of Delhi-based belly dancer Eshan Hilal’s hip chain. Drawn to dancing at a young age, Hilal describes how he was physically beaten by his father even as he continued to practise the art form. There was mounting family pressure to stop. “I felt like a defective piece by God,” he recounts sombrely, going on to speak with Koechlin about how he stood his ground and stayed committed to dance as a profession.
Everyday stories
“These people are very much relevant to the changes that India has faced in the last 20 years,” explains Koechlin, about the podcast’s focus on young subjects. “Forward-thinking people from different fields doing things that we never expected.” Another episode features an ice hockey player from Ladakh, who recounts the story of how she and her team would spend an entire night pouring water into an enclosed space so that they would have an ice rink to practise on the next day. The topics covered in the series range from sexual abuse to caste-based prejudice to family discrimination.




Koechlin, whose own French heritage and upbringing in Auroville makes for a fascinating story about the different shades of India, is grateful for the podcast because it has helped her escape the social media echo chamber. “It really opened up my views. The kind of things I listen to are still very much connected to the people that I know. I am learning a lot,” she introspects.
While she opens with the lines, “If you are young and Indian, this is your podcast,” the actor believes that the stories will find resonance with non-local audiences, too. “These are human emotions that are universal,” she explains. “We have focussed on understanding what’s going on in India, but the problems described are not purely Indian.”
With the backing of a global media house and a spotlight on India’s diversity, My Indian Life stands to provide incredible insight into complex stories, similar to what Rukmini Callimachi’s The Caliphate, or series three of Malcom Gladwell’s Revisionist History, have achieved. Yet, the pilot disappoints. It feels clinical, with Koechlin’s studio voice booming in over live-sound recordings, translating an intimate conversation between Hilal and his mother from Hindustani to English. The host does not feel connected to the subject.
Exploring platforms
Koechlin has a well-established reputation for working across mediums. With a wide list of theatrical productions already under her belt, the actor, who was recently appointed Chevalier de Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, has embraced the podcast because of the anonymity it offers. “A person feels a lot less conscious talking into a recorder than being on video,” she explains. “It can get very intimate because you’re not feeling conscious of yourself. It’s an incredible medium in terms of just being able to listen to a person.” 
There is also the convenience of listening to a podcast, she points out. “I listen to them in the morning when I’m doing other things, and I find that (the information) seeps in without you noticing,” she says. Her current favourites are IVM’s The Pragati Podcast, as well as the occasional French podcast that her mother shares with her.
Koechlin, who recently completed filming for Zoya Akhtar’s upcoming film, Gully Boy, will also be seen in Amazon Prime’s upcoming web series, Made in Heaven. As for season two of My Indian Life, she says pensively, “I hope so.”

When Agumbe turned Malgudi
","A Kannada organization recently demanded that Malgudi Days directed by Shankar Nag be dubbed in Kannada, 32 years after one of India’s finest television serials was made. For those who reported the serial, striking for its native ambience, it was a moment for memories. Shankar Nag, a dreamer of the real sense passed away 28 years ago, leaving a bright and indelible impression on the celluloid world. Though Shankar Nag was known only in Kannada, the making of Malgudi Days catapulted him to the national scene. Had Shankar Nag lived, he would have turned 64 today.
It is difficult to find an answer as to why Shankar Nag made Malgudi Days, (based on R K Narayan's works, which in 1986 became a phenomenon) in Hindi and English rather than in Kannada. He could have offered a convincing reason. According to those, who worked with Shankar in late 80s, Shankar wanted to reach a wider audience and also to showcase Kannada talent across the country. Following the success of first 13 episodes, an elated Shankar had said: “Malgudi Days changed everything. Ordinary people come and chat with me about Malgudi Days even in places such as Delhi and Bombay. This has also helped me to jump airline queues, as they tend to treat me as a VIP,” he had smiled impishly.




Noted actor Ramesh Bhat, associate director of the acclaimed Malgudi Days who also essayed several roles, opposes the move of dubbing the serial in Kannada. 
“As a principle, the all-time classic serial should not be dubbed into Kannada. If needed, it is better to produce the serial with Kannada actors and crew with a fresh approach"". 
Malgudi Days was described as ""a piece of genuine India"" and viewers, especially in old Mysore region found themselves relating to each episode. This, in fact, is the outcome of any sincere cinematic exercise, which treats simple human folk in simple terms. Malgudi Days reached the hearts because of its plain looking characters and incidents, which helped them find latent mysteries of ordinary human existence. With the signature tune and music by L. Vaidyanathan (which is now a popular, ring tone), the heartwarming stories, sketches by R.K. Laxman, and performed by talented actors made Malgudi Days exemplary.




It is important that even Malgudi Days faced problem in the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) for no genuine reason. Some sentences in Mithaiwala episodes were muted by CBFC. Shankar Nag, who was shooting in Agumbe at that time, shot off a protest telegram to Doordarshan objecting to cursory unnotified censorship of certain harmless passages.




It is also sure that, certain things never tire audience. Set in British India, Malgudi, a fictional town, is a dream which viewers would like to see again and again. This idyllic world can never stale. R.K. Narayan, was often asked: ""Where is Malgudi""? To which, he in his introduction to the short story collection Malgudi Days (1942) says: “All I can say is that it is imaginary and not be found on any map (although the University of Chicago Press published a literary atlas with a map of India indicating the location of Malgudi.) If I explain that Malgudi is a small town in South India, I shall only be expressing half-truth, for the characteristics of Malgudi seem to be universal.”
It was a challenge for Shankar Nag and producer T.S. Narasimhan to zero in on Malgudi. Mysore is actually the Malgudi of Narayan, where the writer lived and wrote. As Mysore turning out to be metropolis and lost its old charm because of its urbanisation, producer and director considered Nanjangud town for a while. But, they rejected it, because of its proximity to Mysore. Finally, the one-street Agumbe, in the heart of Malnad found to be the fittest choice, because of its old charm, the sleepiness, the rustic ambience. With a river running quietly, century-old tiled houses and a sedate way of life and where television was just making an appearance with the help of tall boosters, Shankar found his imaginary Malgudi in Agumbe and surrounding areas. Arasalu village with its tiny railway station where just two train passes daily provided the ideal location for the serial.




The credit of transforming Agumbe into Malgudi has to go to the sculptor, art director and town planner John Devaraj. He conceptualised everything that needs to make Agumbe look like the imaginary Malgudi. He created carts, statues, avenues, shops, bus stand, schools, shops everything. According to Jagadish Malnad, who was in control of production, Shankar Nag invested loads of energy and enterprise into imaging the minute details of life in Malgudi. Shankar Nag’s precision for details and authenticity turning Agumbe into Malgudi had become a daunting task. Donkeys were transported from Shimoga to Agumbe and elephants from Bangalore. Austin and Hindustan cars were borrowed from friends. A road-roller had to be transported from Bangalore. Shankar Nag virtually erected a gaiety land replete with dancers, wrestlers, fire eaters, bangle sellers for Talkative Man episode. Crowds were lured from nearby villages by wooing them with lunch and bus fare. Hundred plus actors and crew were lodged in the houses of the village. Almost every house hosted one member of the team recalls Ramesh Bhat. 
After three decades, there are no traces of Malgudi in Agumbe. Time has erased even memories. Some of the properties of Malgudi Days, which Shankar left for the people of Agumbe, is in the premises of a school. But, people of Agumbe still remember Shankar Nag, who gave it more meaning than being known to receive highest rainfall in the Western Ghats.

Taylor Swift cast in film version of Cats
","Pop superstar Taylor Swift will take to the silver screen alongside Jennifer Hudson in a film adaptation of the popular hit musical Cats, reports said on Friday.
The movie is the latest project for British filmmaker Tom Hooper, who brought novel-turned-musical Les Miserables to the big screen and won an Oscar for directing The King's Speech.
Cats, composed by Andrew Lloyd Webber and featuring the classic musical ballad Memory, opened in London in 1981 and originally was staged on Broadway from 1982 to 2000, the fourth-longest run in history.
Based on poems by T.S. Eliot, Cats tells of a feline tribe — in human form on stage — called the Jellicles who decide who among them will make a fateful ascent into a new life.
Cinema industry news site Variety said that Hudson would play Grizabella, a formerly glamorous cat who longs for acceptance.

In tune with the dance of the serpent "," 
 As Sarpatatwam, a 28-minute documentary, premieres today (September 21) in Los Angeles, the short film’s creator, Methil Devika, says it is the realisation of a year of hard work. Focussing on a composition of a 11th century mystic, Devika burrowed into the significance of serpents in ancient civilisations and its symbolical implications. 
A trailer of the film that has gone viral gives tantalising glimpses of the documentary and visuals that are aesthetic and sensuous at the same time. “This is a composition that has been performed by many dancers. But I chose verses from the composition that demanded more exploration into the layers of philosophical thought, the details of which I can’t reveal now,” she says.
That is when serendipity came calling, giving her the opportunity she was seeking. Office-bearers of Nagayakshi temple in Palakkad wanted her to perform at the temple. “I said yes and decided to work on this particular composition. However, I found that a lot of research would be needed to undertake such a work and so, with great regret, I turned it down. However, a few days later, I got a call from Mannarashala temple (dedicated to Nagas) for a recital there. I felt it was too much of a coincidence and decided to take it up,” recalls Devika.




While going through the lyrics of the composition, she found that the second part of the composition was not notated although the first part was. “Although I am not a trained musician, I took up the responsibility of setting it to music. That is when I discovered none of my regular musicians were free at that point of time. By then, I was determined to set the music myself, choreograph the dance and perform it too,” says Devika. 
It was again luck that played a part in choosing the main vocalist. Udupi- based Aparna Sharma rendered the song beautifully and Devika performed it at Mannarashala in October 2017.
That was also around the time the accomplished Mohiniyattam danseuse and academic was planning to get some of her work archived, as she had never taken the trouble to document her choreography or recitals. “Some directors were approaching me with offers for acting in films. One of them was Rajesh Kadamba. I was not all that keen on acting in a film but I invited him to watch my recital at Mannarashala. In course of time, I decided to have him film my work, which would have a narrative that had to be in line with my research and interpretations,” explains Devika.
She got down to work on the script and storyboard before having long discussions with Rajesh. The shooting took only 10 days but it was the preparatory work that ensured that the actual filming got over smoothly.
With Devika as narrator, performer, scenarist and co-director and co-producer, Sarpatatwam showcases her multifaceted creativity. Beginning with a narration and beautiful visuals that explain the significance of Sarpatatwam, the docu moves to the Mohiniyattam performance.
Generous with her praise for the director and film crew, she says she doubts if it would have worked so well with anyone else. “I was insistent that the focus should be on the dance and it should be aesthetic and factual. Rajesh was able to do justice to the theme and cinematographer Vipin Chandran’s frames beautifully enhance every scene,” she gushes.




Watching Devika’s deep involvement in the work, her husband, Mukesh, also decided to join the venture. “I began with a small budget as it was my own production and I, initially, discouraged Mukesh ettan from working with us. He was not happy with my decision. Anyway, later, I changed my mind and we launched our production house ‘Chitrakutam films’. I am lucky Mukesh ettan is the co-producer because as there were international inquiries, the production had to adhere to those standards and needed a bigger budget.
 “I am glad he is also with me in the production. Sarpatatwam is the first in a series of docus I plan to produce on dance and related subjects. Once the screening starts, I will understand the kind of reception the film will get. As it is, a lot of universities and museums have got in touch with me to archive the film,” she adds.




She sees the completion of the film and her involvement in it as a “blessing” and a sign of some “divine intervention”. But she asserts: “This is a first step. Depending on how it goes, more such films are in the making.”
DIRECTOR’S VISION
 “I had always wanted to work with Methil Devika and I first approached her with the script of a film that centred on a dancer. But she was adamant about not working in a feature film then. But I requested her to get in touch with me if she ever changed her mind or even if we could work together on a documentary. That is when she called me to watch her recital at Mannarashala and she followed it up with a suggestion for archiving it,” recalls Rajesh.




A veteran of several award-winning television programmes on Rosebowl and Kappa TV, Rajesh felt that instead of merely documenting the performance, it would have be better if she would enhance it with an explanation of the performance and its significance. “Since Madam was particular about not deviating from the essence of the recital, a narration was introduced as a preface to the dance,” elaborates Rajesh. 
While the main venue was the verdant greenery at Kowdiar Palace in Thiruvananthapuram, it was also shot at Iringole Kavu in Thrissur, the biggest sacred groove, and Mannarashala. “To make it as authentic as possible, we used the real organic powder while drawing the kalam instead of treating it as just a film. We treated it with great reverence,” he says. 
He is effusive in his praise of cinematographer Vipin Chandran, who, he says, remained true to the essence of the film. The trailer has been receiving rave reviews from all over and Rajesh hopes the film will pave the way to more such projects. 
SOARING ON CREATIVITY
 Filmmaker and sculptor Rajiv Anchal’s magnum opus is the Jadayupara project at Chadayamangalam and the sculpture of the bird, which has been eulogised in the Ramayana as the brave eagle that tried to save Sita from the clutches of Ravana. For the inauguration of the project, Rajiv filmed Methil Devika’s original choreography of a poem composed by ONV Kurup and set to music by M. Jayachandran. It has been rendered by Aparna Rajeev and Vidhu Pratap. 
ADOOR’S APPRECIATION
An excerpt from auteur Adoor Gopalakrishnan’s response to the film.
...The documentary based on the.... centuries-old evocative song on the mythical Serpent God is at once a testament to Ms. Devika’s total dedication to the art and her unparalleled achievement. It is natural that she has conceived the treatment of the film and has chosen herself as its sole interpreter and performer...

Rohit Roy enters the world of web series with 'Memories'
"," It isn’t everyday that an actor gets to play someone returning from a near-death experience and by a quirk of fate, has the power to travel through memories of someone else lying in comatose state. In Memories, the web series for Viu directed by Vikram Bhatt, actor Rohit Roy enacts Siddharth Sareen who’s equipped with this power and helps unravel a mystery.
Speaking to us about Memories, Roy remembers suspending his disbelief and listening in to Vikram Bhatt’s narration of the thriller: “The way Vikram Bhatt narrated it, the possibility of getting into others’ minds and tracking their memories seemed believable. It’s a well-etched character and story; when I learnt that there are cases of 37 people who’ve sprung back to life after being taken off life support for a few minutes, I was all ears. Certain things are beyond our understanding, maybe that’s why they are termed supernatural.”
He was required to be in almost every scene of Memories – either as an aggressive head of a television news channel or in spirit, witness to memories that unfold – and the actor says demarcating between the two was the key. Now that the first few episodes are out, he’s glad with the audience response. “A lot of people on twitter have noticed the nuances. When I agreed to work on this series, I instinctively felt it would be a winner,” he says.
Memories was originally designed for 10 episodes but went on to be 13. The series also helped him collaborate with Vikram Bhatt after 20 years. Of late, Bhatt’s cinematic journey has been synonymous with the Hate Story films. “I wouldn’t have minded working in one of them,” laughs Roy.
Bhatt and he have been good friends over the years and that rapport, he says, helped ease the exhaustion of an intensive work schedule. “The good thing about the digital platform is you have the entire script, unlike what happens with television. So that margin of errors is reduced. We’d be working 14 to 16 hours per day and since I am required in every other frame, it was tiring. But I won’t complain, because I knew what was expected of me. On one day I remember having a slanging match with Vikram on the sets. Since we’ve known each other for long, we didn’t make a big deal out of it,” he says.
Incidentally, it’s been 25 years since Rohit Roy was first seen on television, in Swabhimaan. He’s shifted between television, cinema and theatre before testing the web series zone. Cinema has been an unpredictable beast that continues to puzzle him. “I’ve been part of some big hits,” he says, referring to Shootout at Lokhandwala and Kaabil, “but I’ve never been able to follow up on the success with other films. I won’t lie that I got a few scripts, I am reading them and waiting for the right one etc. The truth is, barring a couple of offers that I didn’t like, nothing worthwhile came,” he admits.
The Telugu film industry has been reaching out to him on and off, he says, but he has stayed away so far. “I am scared, I have no knowledge of the language and don’t know how things work. Some truly interesting films are being made in the industry and I won’t rule out acting in a Telugu film sometime. If I set my mind on it, I can learn the language. I’ve acted in five Bengali films and recently completed my first Gujarati film,” says Roy, who will also be seen in an extended cameo in JP Dutta’s Paltan. The war drama is set in 1967 during the face-off between Indian and Chinese military forces at Nathu La and Cho La mountain passes. “I have the greatest regard for JP Dutta and I’ll even do a walk-on part for his film,” is all that Roy will reveal for now.

Rocking to tandanu tandana
","Seven songs with seven different artistes across a variety of genres like blues, jazz, Carnatic, folk, rock and Hindustani — Tandanu, Indian Ocean’s latest album is not just a tribute to music but also a celebration of 25 years of the band.
The band’s seventh studio album, this is a collection of songs that Indian Ocean worked on at different points of time in the last 10 years. “The songs have been put together in collaboration with other artistes, who have lent their own unique touch to the compositions,” says bass guitarist Rahul Ram.
Besides the members of the band, Tandanu features Shankar Mahadevan, Shuba Mudgal, Vishal Dadlani, Pandit Vishwa Mohan Bhatt, Karsh Kale, Selva Ganesh and Kumaresh (of Ganesh-Kumaresh). “All these people said ‘let’s do it!’ when we approached them. There was no talk of what they will get out of this or no questions about how much time they would have to give,” says Rahul. “They are all technically more competent than we are and yet collaborated so beautifully with us.”
The title track of the album, which Indian Ocean and Shankar Mahadevan perform together, is a folk song of Karnataka that Rahul picked up from his aunt. “During the freedom struggle my aunt used to sing folk songs with her sisters. I heard the song first when I was probably three years old and it has stayed in my head all these years,” he adds. The Indian Ocean version of Tandanu, is still only a part of the whole song. “It’s twice as long,” laughs Rahul.
With a new guitarist at the helm, the band feels that their sound, while still retaining its signature style, now has an interesting mix to it. “The album has two songs in collaboration with Carnatic artistes. That apart, Nikhil Rao, our guitarist, has a flair of classical music and it shows in his riffs,” says Rahul.
Indian Ocean launches Tandanu on Pepsi MTV Indies. Every Saturday, one song from the album will be released as a half-hour episode.
Besides the members of the band, Tandanu features Shankar Mahadevan, Shuba Mudgal, Vishal Dadlani, Vishwa Mohan Bhatt, Karsh Kale, Selva Ganesh and Kumaresh

This 'Sarkar', hardly rules
","Films provide instant, though brief gratification. We pay to watch a protagonist wipe out evildoers and correct social wrongs in a jiffy, fully aware of the reality that awaits us when we emerge from the cool confines of a multiplex. Of late there have been a slew of films about an ‘educated abroad’ youth ascending the political throne and cleaning out corruption in a couple of hours. If it’s not the reluctant son, then it’s someone who’s been wronged. Some like ‘Bharath Ane Nenu’ struck a chord while ‘Nota’ failed. Film stars with political ambitions using cinema as a platform is not uncommon in the South. MGR did it tacitly and achieved his goal with tact though it seemed effortless. People loved him for the empathy he exuded, while for Jayalalitha it was the sympathy that worked since she was looked upon as the protégé who was wronged. NT Rama Rao succeeded, but Chiranjeevi faded away. On-screen heroism is just not enough and fans alone cannot push a star to political power. Women voters are also the trump card. Then there was Dr. Raj Kumar who could have swept any poll effortlessly but decided that affection and love should not be used to attain power only to be misused by kin and clan.
 There is a general feeling in Tamil Nadu, not unfounded that politicians and film stars who seemed to suffer from verbal constipation when Jayalalitha was in power have suddenly become vocal. AR Murugadoss or Vijay would not have even dared to conceive leave alone make ‘Sarkar’ if the iron lady had been around. Even if they had managed to it would have rotted in the cans. Jayalalitha had an uneasy equation with Rajni, Kamal and Vijay who was snubbed when he tried to visit her at her summer retreat and request her to clear the hurdles surrounding the release of ‘Thalaivaa’. I’m sure she was not impressed with the title. Her demise has encouraged the three stars to try and fill the huge political vacuum. Vijay of course is still testing the waters, while Rajni is still dithering and Kamal is in the thick of things.
Enemy’s enemy is your friend and so the extremely choosy Vijay green lights a project produced by Sun Pictures and helmed by Murugadoss who’s still being cursed by Mahesh Babu’s fans for spinning a disastrous web called ‘Spyder’. The premise about the importance of a single vote is promising but is used for the hero’s personal propaganda. 
People are accused of accepting a pittance to vote while stars earn in crores just to further personal ambitions. The film brazenly attacks the present ruling government which would have been impossible before the end of 2016! Imagine naming the antagonist Komalavalli which was Jayalalitha’s real name! The film is replete with corporate and political innuendo. The ‘hero introduction’ is strange. He’s called Ghengis Khan, a Casanova and a corporate monster who gobbles up companies and renders thousands jobless and homeless.
 Hero’s name is Sundar supposedly inspired by Sundar Pichai and his company is called GL. When someone says hero is omnipresent on the net another chirps in that it’s because he owns the search engine. That’s not true about Sundar Pichai, but the similarity ends there. This guy looks like a spoilt brat who has inherited rather than built, smokes incessantly, emerges from a limousine and dances with scantily clad girls in a casino in Las Vegas.
 He boards a private jet and lands in India just to cast a vote only to be informed an impersonator has already done it. With the help of his lawyer (by the way he’s called Jethmalani) we’re enlightened about section 49P. He saunters into a private party at a friend’s place and lights up exposing his lack of basic etiquette. Well, a politician’s underling dares him and brat decides to stay back and fight. What follows is a long winding star vehicle of political sermons generously sprinkled with forgettable songs and bones being broken when brains are not being battered. There’s no time for romance so heroine Keerthi Suresh is treated like a junior artiste. I realised subtitles are a good way to overcome verbal censorship. Vajpayee is muted but mentioned in the subtitles! 
Politicians wear huge rings with a picture of their leader and also have a photograph peeping through the pockets of their white shirts. There are references to ‘Jalli Kattu’, farmer suicides, a family immolating themselves due to exorbitant interest rates charged by private lenders and even how tomato growers are taken advantage of. The film is mounted on a massive scale. Big budgets mean populating frames even when not necessary.
Vijay is the focal point so none of the other characters are properly fleshed out. The hero is introduced as extremely intelligent but uses muscle more often than grey matter. A politician who’s been in power for fifty years listens like a puppet to political advice from his young daughter living abroad. The humour feels forced and less said about Rahman’s music the better. If I’d written this script like I would have remained anonymous.
This ‘Sarkar’ is simply not fit to rule.

How to go crazy: a day at the ‘Bigg Boss’ house before season 2 kicks off "," It was a watershed moment for Oviya’s fans when she left the sets of Bigg Boss last season, citing mental health reasons. Her critics, however, claimed it was all an act and that she was being puppeteer-ed by the show’s producers. I spent one day inside that house, and I must say, I side with Oviya. Jump into the pool? Why, I would have climbed the walls.
Let me go back 24 hours to explain why.
It’s five minutes before I enter the Bigg Boss house and I have been blindfolded. So the burst of colour when I first step into the house is disorienting.




At first glance, the set looks much the same as in the previous season from outside — the house with the Bigg Boss hoarding, the swimming pool to the right, the sofas and treadmill to the left and the synthetic grass. It’s like stepping into a gaudy resort. 
However, there’s one addition: on the right of the entrance is a jail with one iron bed and no mattress. It’s a literal prison inside a figurative one. It remains to be seen which of the presumably volatile participants that Vijay TV has roped in will be sent here for flouting rules.
The interior arrangement has been shuffled around a bit to give it a new look, but essentially has the same rooms: two bedrooms (one looks like a pink bubblegum volcano erupted inside it, coughing up butterfly bodies on the walls), with an additional attached bathroom this time, the kitchen area, the living room area, the seating area facing the television screen and of course, the sci-fi-looking confession room. This is going to be the 15 contestants’ world for the next 100 days, starting this Sunday.
Random projections hang on the wall: gear-props to wallflowers. The table in front of the TV is designed like the face of a watch, as if to mock the contestants’ total ignorance of what the time really is. We were looking at the sun for answers. Imagine living in a drab grey-walled house for 100 days.




Even one day in the House throws up material enough for a two-level study: individual psychology and community anthropology. As the hours pass by, one can make out the introverts, the initiative-taking leaders, the loyal followers, and the non-committal loners.
If you thought Season 1 was the depiction of an invasive totalitarian regime, here’s a fun fact. The cameras in the place have been almost doubled from around 30 to 60. Bigg Boss is watching. From more angles this time.
In 1961, a year after the trial of Nazi war criminal Adolf Eichmann, Stanley Milgram began a series of now-famous experiments that demonstrated the ease with which people submitted to higher authority. The contestants of Bigg Boss are living, breathing proof of that.
Bigg Boss’s low, controlling voice booms out of the speakers: Assemble in the living area, Come to the confession room, Sit down on the sofa, Don’t stand, Don’t sleep. When Bigg Boss says something, you comply; no questions asked.
The most interesting of all is what the human mind can come up with when all their toys — phones, laptops, books, pen, paper, and even literal playthings — are taken away from them. It was a digital detox, a futuristic dystopia set in cavemen times. At least cavemen had rocks.




One of us began fiddling with a water bottle for fun. Soon, that turned into a game of flipping the bottle to make it land vertically without toppling. Once we got bored with that, we took to throwing a hairband as a hoop with the bottle as a target.
By lunchtime, we took the game outside, creating a game of bowling, with four bottles as pins and decorative wooden pebbles as our ball. The most popular ones though were the trustworthy games of catch and cricket that we designed with tissue paper balls and tray bats. In one of our quieter moments, we collectively observed a fly. Yes. A fly.
The most challenging part of Bigg Boss is the complete lack of control over your sleep habits. Every so often, one sleep-deprived journalist, lacking stimulation, would nod off to sleep, only to be forcibly woken by the sound of barking dogs over the speaker. Never in my life did I imagine that I would hate an AR Rahman song when Mersal’s ‘Aalaporaan Thamizhan’ blasted over the speakers in the morning to wake us up. I glared at the cameras glaring at me, until we were locked in a stare match which I lost.
As usual, it took the darkness of the night to draw gossip out of people. It was after lights-out that bonding began, secrets spilling out, one hand covering the mike. The elimination rounds once again proved humans are designed to be social animals. It was the introverts, the ones sitting alone that got eliminated the first.
When we stepped out of the house 24 hours later, and were handed our belongings, the notification tings and bings filled up the room — it was a happy reunion of our phones and us. But more importantly, it was then that I scratched my nose red with impunity, with no cameras around.
Bigg Boss airs on Vijay TV from this Sunday evening at 7 pm. The show runs from Monday to Sunday at 9 pm

Fans throng Chamundi Hills to catch a glimpse of Rajinikanth
","Chamundi Hills in Mysore, which is filled with pilgrims from the crack of dawn, had a different crowd on Friday. For, Tamil superstar Rajinikanth, who is camping in the region to shoot for the film Linga, visited the temple.
Mr. Rajinikanth’s fans had been waiting at the temple from 4 a.m. to catch a glimpse of the superstar, who offered prayers to Sri Chamundeshwari and Lord Ganapathi.
Mr. Rajinikanth, clad in silk dhoti and shirt, reached the temple around 4 a.m., accompanied by Kannada film star and Minister for Housing M.H. Ambareesh and his wife, Sumalatha.
After they offered prayers, the ‘muhurat’ shot of the Tamil movie was filmed opposite the temple.
Mr. Ambareesh told presspersons that Mr. Rajinikanth was a popular actor and had fans all over the world and it was a matter of pride that Rockline Venkatesh of Karnataka was producing the film.
The film, being directed by K.S. Ravikumar, will be shot in parts of Mandya and Kerala, according to Mr. Venkatesh.

Refutes reports

Deputy Director of the Palace Board T.S. Subramanyam refuted reports that permission was denied to shoot the film at the Mysore palace. “Nobody has approached us officially, though a director called us about 15 days ago and wanted to know the procedure for seeking permission for shooting at the Bangalore and Mysore palaces and at the Maharaja’s residential palace here. I told him that the Bangalore Palace was a private property while the Mysore palace administration was vested with the government. After this, nobody came forward to seek permission from us,” Mr. Subramanyam said.
He said any decision on granting permission for film shooting had to be taken by the Palace Board comprising the Chief Secretary to the State government and the Deputy Commissioner.

All set for Cannes
","“At the end of the day, I am a film star,” declared Sonam Kapoor. Her declaration came as an endorsement of her favourite look created by L’Oreal Paris for its new L’Or Lumiere collection. The collection was launched by Sonam Kapoor in Mumbai just in time for Cannes Film Festival 2014 this month, where she and the brand’s two other Indian ambassadors — Aishwarya Rai-Bachchan and Freida Pinto — will walk the red carpet.
“The collection focuses on the Indian skin and we should accentuate it,” said Sonam, looking every bit the style diva in a sequined silver flair dress.
Being a star has its own advantages. Like Sonam puts it, the time spent in Cannes will be like a “three-day holiday” that involves representing one’s country and looking beautiful. “When you meet other international actors and models you realise that you are living in a bubble. The world is lot bigger than you think,” she said.
Every year the Raanjhanaa actor makes it a point to take with her to Cannes a bit of Indianness, be it a sari that she wore last year, or jewellery the year before. What’s in the bag this year? “I don’t know. Everyone thinks I plan my look in advance but I don’t. But there will be something Indian this time too.”

Clever puns and sight gags "," The latest addition to Netflix’s ever-bulging originals is Paradise PD. It’s an animated series, with a barrage of hilarious insults that are meant for adults who don’t feel attacked at the drop of a hat. The show couldn’t have been made for television. The script would have either gone through several changes, or the final cut would have looked different to appeal to the sensibilities of the TV audience.
The adult comedy, created by Waco O'Guin and Roger Black, alternates between the dark web of realities and the imaginations of a dynamic duo that’s not afraid to make fun of Joe Biden, Johnny Depp, or Elon Musk. While Depp (of course, the animated version) is thrashed for starring as Willy Wonka, Musk appears in a risqué scene where he’s mocked for the Tesla cars. These bits aren’t, in any way, connected to the main story, and, yet, they are brought into the frames to deliver humor.
The constant urge to stray away from the plot to make absurdity its main focus seems to have helped the creators in coming up with a universe that allows them to make space for talking animals and thinking machines. Some viewers might feel that the jokes are too on the nose, but, let’s face it, there’s nothing else that Paradise PD is running after. It’s not chasing eternal glory; its only intention is to catch the scrolling eyes of the naïve Netflix binger.
The story of a bunch of small town cops who are dumber than the characters in a Harpic commercial couldn’t have relied on the strength of a coherent story anyway. The cops – Kevin, (voiced by David Herman), Gina (Sarah Chalke), Chief (Tom Kenny), Dusty and Hopson (both the characters are voiced by Dana Snyder), and Fitzgerald (Cedric Yarbrough) – are not funny on their own. They don’t run around throwing one-liners. They only react to the things that happen around them. But the police dog, Bullet (Kyle Kinane), is like none of them. He’s intelligent and cunning, and, when the clock strikes the right time, he invites his dog-friends to the station to do drugs (he has a key to the room where all the confiscated drugs are stored).
The quirky characters find different methods to unleash their morbid passivity around banal and inappropriate occasions all the time. Here, let me give you an example of a supporting character that tends to break into puns, for which Fitzgerald is a huge fan, to explain the bizarre nature of the series. Just before dying, the pun master utters, “Talk about heart-stopping action, huh,” and goes on to pull his heart out of his gaping chest. Now, tell me, how can anybody resist a chuckle when such things keep happening? 
And, without sanity interrupting the proceedings, Paradise PD flows over the edges of sight gags (a drug lord’s hideout is named “Terry Two Toes Secret Hideout”) rather nicely. Another recently released Netflix series, Disenchantment, too, uses the flavour of sight gags quite innovatively. But Disenchantment is made for a much younger audience, whereas, in the case of Paradise PD, the average viewer would be a young adult. I can imagine the youth screenshotting vulgar lines and images, containing graphic nudity, to pass them around in the college WhatsApp groups they’re a part of, with cool emojis and hashtags.
Unfortunately, Paradise PD hasn’t been discovered by the thirsty millennials yet as they’re currently busy with another adult animated series, BoJack Horseman. That’s understandable because it’s one of the best shows for people who are looking to find solace in the arms of a non-judgmental sitcom that pokes at the flaws of the human psyche. In that sense, Paradise PD is a low-hanging fruit even though it hits the bull’s-eye with its wordplays.

Rich tributes to the music trinity
","Rich tributes were paid to the musical trinity — Thyagaraja, Muthuswami Dikshitar, and Shyama Sastri — for their outstanding contribution to music by speakers and musicians at the inauguration of Carnatic Sangeetha Mummoorthigal Jayanthi Music Festival here on Wednesday.
The week-long festival is being organised by the Sri Kanchi Kamakoti Peeta Carnatic Sangeetha Seva Trust at Sri Thyagarajaswami Temple here.
Nandini Ramani, member, Expert Committee of the Union Ministry of Culture, inaugurated the festival. The celebration of the jayanthi at the birth place of the trinity was a fitting tribute to the great musicians. She assured all support from the Union Ministry of Culture for promoting music through such programmes.

#MeToo: Anu Malik takes break from ‘Indian Idol’ amid sexual harassment allegations "," Music composer Anu Malik on Sunday said he was taking a break from singing reality show Indian Idol following various sexual harassment allegations against him. In a statement, the music director, who has been attached with the show as a judge since 2004, said he had decided to step away from it as he was not able to “focus on my work”. 
“I, Anu Malik, have decided to take a break from Indian Idol as I am currently unable to focus on my work on the show. The channel has been kind to agree for the same. Thank you,” Malik said.
 The music composer’s response comes after sources claimed that Sony TV, on which the show airs, has asked him to step down as a judge for Indian Idol 10.
Sony Entertainment Television also issued a statement saying the composer would not be part of the show anymore, which includes Vishal Dadlani and Neha Kakkar as the other two judges.
“Anu Malik is no longer a part of the Indian Idol jury panel. The show will continue its planned schedule and we will invite some of the biggest names in Indian music as guests to join Vishal and Neha to judge the extraordinary talent of Indian Idol season 10,” the statement read.
 The decision comes after singers Sona Mohapatra and Shweta Pandit accused Malik of sexual harassment. Two budding singers also levelled similar allegations against him.
 Malik’s lawyer Thursday denied the allegations, saying India’s #MeToo movement is being used for his client’s “character assassination”. 
Malik has repeatedly denied the allegations.

Priyanka Chopra, Nick Jonas engaged: US media reports "," Actor Priyanka Chopra and pop singer Nick Jonas are engaged after two months of dating, the US media reported.
People.com, on Friday, quoted a source saying the couple got engaged a week ago on Priyanka’s 36th birthday on July 18 while the two were in London.
Jonas closed down a Tiffany store in New York City to buy an engagement ring, according to the insider.
“They are so happy,” the source told People.com. A source close to Jonas said the singer is “very, very happy.”
“His friends and family have never seen him like this, and they’re all really excited for him. He’s definitely very serious about her,” the source added.
Priyanka and Jonas had made their relationship public earlier in the month of June, but they are yet to officially comment on it.
Meanwhile, Bollywood director Ali Abbas Zafar on Friday announced Priyanka’s exit from his film Bharat in a cryptic tweet alluding to her beau.
He said the reason for her opting out in the “Nick of time” was “very special”.
Over the last several weeks, Priyanka and 25-year-old Jonas have been spotted on several dates, including a dinner date in New York City and a Beauty and the Beast Live in Concert show in Los Angeles.
Priyanka was also seen celebrating July 4 — the American Independence Day — with Nick’s family. Nick earlier visited India with the “Quantico” actress to meet her friends and family. The couple has been sporting similar gold rings.

'Crazy Rich Asians' fails to click with Chinese audiences ","
Chinese audiences do not seem too concerned about the U.S. box office hit “Crazy Rich Asians,” despite its all-Asian cast and theme of rising Asian prosperity.
Industry data show that the film made just $1.2 million over the three days of its initial release, far behind local productions in the world’s second-largest movie market. That compared with the $24.2 grossed by the Chinese crime drama “A Cool Fish,” according to figures from the consultancy Artisan Gateway cited by Variety, an industry journal. 
According to Chinese film industry veteran Wei Junzi, the romantic comedy’s focus on Southeast Asian culture did not resonate with mainland Chinese, despite the cast’s ethnic makeup. “It’s a good genre movie,” Wei said. “It’s also an interesting comparison with the current China-U.S. relationship. You think you know about China, but in reality you don’t.” 
The film’s poor performance in China contrasts sharply with its near-rapturous reception in the Chinese diaspora, especially in the U.S. where it was hailed as the first all-Asian box office smash. 
Critic Shi Hang commented that since Chinese audiences were used to all-Asian productions, the casting didn’t hold much novelty. “What the public was excited about abroad was all-Asian-faces, but, sorry, we watch all-Asian-faces every day so it is less valuable here,” Shi said. The film’s over-the-top displays of wealth and entitlement may also have been a turn-off for some viewers in a country where the widening gap between rich and poor rankles many. “It is understandable in a comedy atmosphere, but it gets harder for me to get into the story,” he said. 
The Warner Bros.’ breakout romantic comedy earned $173 million in the U.S. and was a box office hit in Singapore, where it is set. Like most comedies, John M. Chu’s film hasn’t been as much of a sensation elsewhere. It took months to secure a China release date, a delay some attributed to its portrayal of extremely wealthy Chinese Singaporeans at a time when China’s ruling Communist Party is cracking down on corruption and displays of crass consumerism. That time lag may also have enabled many Chinese viewers to access pirated versions online or through streaming services. 
The film’s performance in China is potentially worrisome for Warner Bros. Meanwhile, its planned sequel, “China Rich Girlfriend,” is expected to better capitalize in China. 
Another upcoming film targeting Chinese audiences is a live-action version of Disney’s 1998 animated classic “Mulan,” which told the story of a plucky Chinese girl who took her father’s place in battling invaders from the north. That film also boasts an almost entirely Chinese cast, led by popular actress Liu Yifei in the title role. 
“Will this be just another movie about Chinese culture, with you Americans’ own interpretation?” Wei demanded.

Classic comebacks in gaming
"," Legendary game developers Capcom, brought us the Street Fighter 30th Anniversary Collection recently. Plus Okami HD is scheduled for release next month and we have been hearing whispers of a Devil May Cry collection. Now they have brought us a new collection with their classic character Mega Man, bundling all his past games into a two-part legacy collection.
Mega Man X Legacy Collection 1 and 2




What’s it about?


Along with names like Mario and Sonic, has always been Mega Man, a thinking and feeling android created by Dr Light. Mega Man X marked an evolution of the character in 1993, bringing into the spotlight the character design we now know and love, making that iconic blue suit edgier with a gun arm. The X series débuted on the SNES and rose to fame. This is where the Legacy Collection 1 drops you. You start off playing the first four games, which are the best the series has to offer.
Legacy Collection 2 is where the nostalgia sort of peters off, as you play X5 to X8, mostly due to the inclusion of the not-so-good X7. The worst part of the collection though, is the splitting of it into two parts. Street Fighter 30th Anniversary Collection packed in 12 games into one bundle, why couldn’t they do the same with the Legacy Collection?
How does it play?
If you loved Contra in the arcades or on your old home machines, you will love Mega Man X. It’s a side-scrolling platformer, with a lot of bullet hell elements that make this a fantastic game. Playing X1 to X8, you can see the evolution of the series, as they pack in a lot more characters, storylines and gameplay elements into the mix, to make things fresh. Especially the evolution of the art style and the technology of that time, as the bits evolved from 16 to 32 and so forth.
Capcom has included a lot of fun stuff in the package. Mega Man X is a tough game and they have a Rookie Hunter Mode that lets you breeze through and experience the levels and story. This is especially great if you want a hard dose of nostalgia without going through the challenge. Undoubtedly, this is best played on the Nintendo Switch, as the game seems to be perfect for the plucky handheld. Whatever the console, be prepared for a lot of repetitive stress disorder from mashing the fire button in the first few Mega Man X games, which lack rapid fire.
Should you get it?
If you’re a fan of Contra and other side-scrolling games, you can indulge yourself in this collection, though first buy either the individual games or the first part of the collection to see if it’s your cup of tea.
With all the gaming giants showing off the same old, same old, No Man’s Sky stood out because it offered us something so vastly different. After a long and troubled development, No Man’s Sky launched in August 2016, with all the fanfare of a broken record — riddled with bugs, with no multi-player. While it still had the generated worlds, the game was almost unplayable. Fast-forward two years and the developers have kept at it, fixing the game slowly. To mark their launch on the Xbox One, Hello Games released a game-changer of a patch codenamed Next, which completely redefines the game. This is not just a patch, it’s a second-coming.
No Man’s Sky Next




What’s it about? 


Hello Games didn’t just dream a game, they dreamed an entire universe. That wasn’t all; it was a universe that would take you millions of years to discover yourself. They took their procedurally generated dream and wowed us collectively at every E3. The very thought of a program that created entire worlds filled with creatures, flora and fauna that were completely unique. Where you, along with millions of players across the globe, can discover together. That was No Man’s Sky.
That was not all. No Man’s Sky was inspired by the cover artwork of great science-fiction writers Isaac Asimov, Arthur C Clarke and Robert Heinlein. Adding that secret sauce made the game all the more compelling. While the launch did not go well for No Man’s Sky, the vision was there, everything looked beautiful. You could lose yourself in this game. Except, it just was not quite baked as yet. The spirit was and is still undeniably there, as players uncovered secrets and communities built bases and colonised those digital stars, while Sean Murray and his team at Hello Games got things right. Which they did in their next patch.
How does it play? 
“This is an important next step on our journey,” their patch notes open with. If you’ve been disappointed with No Man’s Sky in the past, think of Next as the first step. This is the game they wanted to build, this is the game that dropped our jaws, this is the game I fell in love with. 
In addition to the improvements in the graphics department, there are better base-building options and weekly challenges to keep things fresh. There is better multi-player too, and while you still can’t see players floating about, you can invite your friends over to your freighter to complete missions, dogfights or just discover and colonise new planets together. The feeling of jumping into your spaceship, accelerating towards the stars, each one of them a planet waiting for you to discover, is unparalleled.
Should you get it? 
If you have been turned off by the negative reviews of No Man’s Sky till now, you can ignore it. At this very moment, people are actively changing their Steam ratings to reflect this new patch, giving the game a fighting chance. Everything deserves a second chance and No Man’s Sky is high up on that list.
The writer is a tech and gaming enthusiast who hopes to one day finish his sci-fi novel

Kya Dilli Kya Lahore: Familiar tale of Partition
","Partition is one of those unresolved issues that continues to occupy the mindspace on both sides of the border with creative people looking to find a closure to the wound. This week actor Vijay Raaz takes to direction with the subject. The intention is laudable but the execution leaves much to be desired. It is a verbose attempt to underline the futility of war. It deserved to be mounted on the big stage but the writing is more suitable for theatre than celluloid.
Set in 1948, Samarth (Manu Rishi) is a cook attached to the Indian army. He takes on Rehmat (Vijay Raaz), a Pakistani soldier sent to bring the secret files about a clandestine Indian operation to dig a tunnel between Delhi’s Red Fort and Lahore. The two talk more than fight and gradually discover over a period of time that they have more similarities than differences. It was expected to give goosebumps but after a few thought-provoking lines, the narrative falls into a pattern where the two talk out reams of paper. There is very little space for silence in a setting where the two engage in a verbal spat from a distance. It seems ideal for the stage but the pitch creates predictability on big screen.
With the films based on Partition, establishing a sense of nostalgia and loss is a given, and here when Samarth talks of his childhood in Lahore and Rehmat rewinds to his past in Delhi, we get the point. When they talk of exchanging their moons, one can feel the lyrical presence of Gulzar, who has also presented the film, in the background but somehow the film fails to get to the next level.
The appearance of Raj Zutshi as the Indian postman and Biswajeet Pradhan as the Pakistani Captain on the scene gives hope but once again they flicker only to establish what you already know about such stories. There are no surprises in store. It is easy to get into No Man’s Land but what you do there determines your ability to engage the public. Vijay is honest in his effort as an actor and with Manu manages to hit some right notes but as a director it turns out to be a laboured attempt.

Kya Dilli Kya Lahore


Genre: Drama

Cast: Vijay Raaz, Manu Rishi, Raj Zutshi, Biswajeet Pradhan

Plot: Two soldiers from either side of the border spar only to discover that they have more similarities than differences.

Bottomline: A skit has been stretched to screenplay.

China’s mostexpensive film an epic flop
","With a $113-million budget, the most expensive Chinese film ever made has become a flop of historic proportions, pulled from theatres on its opening weekend after bringing in a paltry $7.3 million.
Alibaba Pictures’ special effects-heavy fantasy film Asura was intended as the first instalment in an epic trilogy inspired by Tibetan Buddhist mythology, part of a drive by authorities to promote works bearing Chinese culture.
The film cost $113.5 million to make, State media said, and opened on Friday, but Chinese ticketing platform Maoyan said it only took in just over $7.3 million at the weekend. 
The estimated loss of $106 million would make it the fifth-biggest flop ever worldwide.

Netflix’s Insatiable slammed for fat-shaming ","Netflix’s new series Insatiable, hitting screens on Friday, was touted by the streaming service as a dark comedy meant to spark debate on society’s ills. 
Instead, critics have slammed it as fat-shaming, homophobic and denigrating to transgender people.
The offbeat show follows the story of overweight teen Patty, who is mocked and bullied incessantly until she has an accident that requires her jaw be wired shut — which causes her to shed significant weight.
Diet culture
With her new svelte figure, she vows to seek revenge on all those who attacked her, notably by participating in beauty contests.
The trailer prompted fierce backlash from critics accusing the show of body-shaming.
It perpetuates “not only the toxicity of diet culture, but the objectification of women’s bodies,” read a petition launched last month.
With the show’s release on Friday, the petition – which calls for the series’ cancellation — had more than 2,29,400 signatures.
Some people also skewered the show for the way it portrayed homosexuality, including apparently making light of Patty’s best friend Nonnie for her repressed desire.
‘Feel proud’
In another scene, a young girl who accidentally releases a nude photo of herself says she initially “figured everyone would think I’m a slut.”
“Now they think I’m a lesbian and that’s way worse,” she says.
“Feel proud”And in another scene, Patty and a transgender woman compare being fat to being transgender, saying they both aspire to change their bodies.
“People bring with them their own emotional history and that’s what makes art amazing and TV entertaining. I’m completely aware that it’s not a show for everybody but we’re really proud of what we did.”
Netflix’s vice president of original series, Cindy Holland, said the series explores issues “satirically, in a very over-the-top way.”
Lauren Gussis, who created the show, called it “a cautionary tale about how damaging it can be to believe the outsides are more important — to judge without going deeper.” “Please give the show a chance,” she said.

Ed Harris’ field of dreams
"," It is ironic that Ed Harris picked a film on a dying technology to make his foray into the world of Netflix. Yet, it is a paradox that best explains the actor: marching into the future with values of the past. His character in the 2017 Netflix drama Kodachrome has a bone to pick with the obsolescence of modern technology. Harris plays Benjamin, a terminally-ill photographer who takes a road trip with his son (Jason Sudeikis) to the last lab still developing Kodachrome film to develop photographs. “I’m glad we shot [Kodachrome] on film,” he says, over a phone conversation from Malibu, California. “The feeling of film — the texture and the way it is shot — I just find it more immediate and more involving with the crew.” While he concedes that digital is more accessible and simpler, allowing young filmmakers to experiment, he is quick to remind me: that “I’m still old-fashioned in that sense.” 
Over four decades in Hollywood, Harris — who plays the “Man in Black” in the dystopian sci-fi television series Westworld — has appeared in over 70 films, earned two Golden Globes and four Academy Award nominations, been part of innumerable stage performances, and even dabbled with producing and screenwriting. “I started out wanting to become the best actor that I could,” recalls the 67-year-old actor about the start of his career in the mid-’70s, where he performed in small Los Angeles theatres and appeared in television shows. His big screen debut came in 1978 with Coma. He has, since then, proved his chameleonic ability to inhabit any character, with memorable roles in films like Nixon (1992), A Beautiful Mind (2001), and Snowpiercer (2013).




Introduced to the life and work of artist Jackson Pollock by his father, Harris carried the story with him for a decade before he made his directorial debut with Pollock (2000), Essaying the titular character, he portrays the tortured, alcoholic artist with a melancholic charm. “The whole directing thing came about mainly because I had worked so hard and long on the project, and the directors I had spoken to had their own ideas, so I didn’t want to hand it over to anyone,” recounts the actor. 
Since then, Harris has only directed one more film: Appaloosa (2008). “I hope to direct [again] this coming August, if I work out the finances, so I am very excited about that possibility,” he shares.
Indie-strong
Harris’œuvre, with its brooding roles and bold choices in indie cinema, has famously earned him the reputation of the “thinking person’s sex symbol”, even as he continues to receive mainstream attention for his role in Westworld, the Anthony Hopkins-starrer set in a futuristic amusement park.




With an enigmatic character, the Internet is, of course, rife with geeky theories and interpretations about Harris’ role in the show. “I know a lot is written about it, and I am glad people are fascinated, but I don’t pay any attention to it, to tell you the truth,” he confesses. What fascinates the actor more is the show’s behind-the-scenes rhythm, where directors keep rotating, and where self-destructing scripts battle spoilers. “By the end of the second season, there were certain days when you had three to four crews shooting different portions, maybe five different episodes [at once],” shares Harris. 
Evergreen acting
Even with the rapid changes that the film industry has experienced during his career, for this veteran, the craft of acting remains the same as it was four decades ago. “I just hope I am getting better at what I do,” he says modestly, adding, “But the nature of film and theatre, — of inhabiting a character, of penetrating material and getting to the deepest place you can with your character — that hasn’t changed at all.” Yet, technology in the age of streaming and binge-watching has certainly evolved, and Harris’ films have periodically commented on the transformation. Take for instance, Peter Weir’s The Truman Show, which analysed the rise of simulated reality and reality television at the fag end of the last century, or even Westworld, which casts an eye on the darker side of artificial intelligence and robots. “The progress happening in the world of technology is unbelievable and so fast that it is outpacing human ability to deal with it. Sometimes it is frustrating,” says Harris.




Looking beyond
In his long career, Harris has worked with a range of acclaimed directors. Some, like Polish director, Agnieszka Holland. have become long-time collaborators. “I’ve done three films with her and I really love [her] as a human being and director,” he says and proceeds to mention Ron Howard and Peter Weir among his favourites. After watching Spike Jonez’s 2009 film, Where the Wild Things Are, Harris wrote a letter to the director saying “I wish to work with you some day”, a hope that he still harbours, given that retirement is not in sight for the actor. He has so much more to do, including working with Martin Scorsese and Steven Spielberg, he insists, reminding me of the scene from Pollock, where, in answer to a question about when a painting is truly complete, the artist says, “How do you know when you're finished making love?”

The second season of ‘The Marvelous Mrs Maisel’ is a winner
","When Miriam “Midge” Maisel glided into our lives last year, we were smitten.
In The Marvelous Mrs Maisel, creator Amy Sherman-Palladino gave us a protagonist who, at the lowest phase of her life, found redemption in comedy. A Jewish housewife in 1950s New York, Midge (Rachel Brosnahan) discovered an innate ability to have a roomful of people in splits. As she took dainty steps into the world of stand-up comedy, we cheered her on. Even as the first season pretty much swept the Comedy category at the Emmys earlier this year (the first streaming series to do so, ever), its real achievement lay in giving us the comfort of discovering a fascinating world.
The sophomore season of the hit Amazon show gives us more of that world. Having dealt with the responsibility of setting up half-a-dozen characters in its first run, The Marvelous Mrs Maisel fires on all cylinders in its new season, which arrived this week. More importantly, it’s moved on from the major plot point of Midge separating from her husband, Joel (Michael Zegen), into more varied, colourful storylines.
A lot of the first season was spent on the aftermath of the big breakup. Midge’s temperamental Jewish father, Abe (Tony Shalhoub), often acted out unreasonably over the separation, while her mother, Rose (Marin Hinkle) oscillated between being in denial and panic-struck about her daughter’s future. Meanwhile, Joel took the familiar “douchebag husband” route, starting off as a heartbreaker who eventually realised his folly and wanted Midge back in his life. All of these tracks chugged along together, throwing up momentary laughs, while we only really cared about Midge’s own journey of discovering her comedic voice at nondescript comedy clubs and her volatile relationship with her manager, Susie (Alex Borstein).
This time around, Sherman-Palladino seems to have realised the true potential of her oddball characters, and breaks the story up into delightful little plot lines that could spin off shows on their own. Abe and Rose, having dealt with the bitter blow of their daughter’s broken marriage, go about fixing their own. Shalhoub and Hinkle are both adorable, and their chemistry is sparkling enough for you to not miss even Midge when they’re on screen together. Joel, meanwhile, has taken on a more mature turn — supporting Midge’s budding career as a stand-up, and trying to turn around his parents’ failing business. Susie and Midge share a warmer relationship now, even though the former struggles to turn Midge’s fortunes around, so she could turn her own.
Tonally, the show seems a lot more settled, with Sherman-Palladino’s unique sense of humour and affinity for repartee coming to the fore (she created the hugely popular Gilmore Girls, which enjoyed similar traits). The laughs come thick and fast, and even though they are functioning in a slightly more disconnected way here than in the first season, the characters’ lives seem to be more seamlessly intertwined.
Meanwhile, Brosnahan remains TV’s shining star of the moment, turning in another winning performance. We were smitten earlier; we’re in love now.
The second season of The Marvelous Mrs Maisel premièred on Amazon Prime on December 5. This column helps you navigate online (and offline) television, a world of endless options.

Baggy's Kungfu Bonda comes to Madurai "," So, sometime early last year, Bhargav Ramakrishnan or Baggy as he’s better known, turned 30 and that’s when he realised adulthood had hit him. “It was significant to feel like an adult, finally. There were myriad emotions running in my mind and I started to write them down,” he says. That’s how Baggy’s first solo special shaped up. “I ended up writing a 100-minute comedy show and started touring with it last July. Titled Kungfu Bonda, it’s sure to make you roll on the floor.”
After nearly 40 shows across cities in India and Malaysia, Singapore and the UK, Kungfu Bonda is coming to town this weekend. Baggy is excited about his first show in Madurai. “I’ve never performed in Madurai before and am curious to know how the market for stand-up comedy is evolving in small towns. Kungfu Bonda has gained popularity over the past year. One reason for the show’s acclaim is that people easily identify themselves with the topic — growing old.”
As a typical Chennai boy, Baggy signed up for Engineering but was always interested in the Arts. “Right from my college days, I was active in theatre. After joining arts company Evam in 2011, I came up with a show that could be easily transported and performed in any given space,” he says. “Unlike a typical play that involves logistic issues like props, sets and a background, my show was minimal in every sense. By that time, stand-up wasn’t popular in India except in maybe Delhi or Mumbai and we called our solo shows as comedy monologue. As I approached it from a theatrical perspective, I used to direct people in comedy monologues.”
Attending ‘The Weird Ass Pyjama Festival’ in Mumbai in 2014, opened up a world of opportunities for Baggy. “I was exposed to the sheer variety in stand-up comedy and met many performers from India and abroad. I was someone who always liked being on stage and that’s when I realised that it’s high time I wrote and acted in a show on my own.” Ever since, Baggy has become one of the popular names in Chennai’s stand-up scene.
“Stand-up is a humble and spontaneous art form and is the opposite of elitist comedy. It comes from the open mike culture and offers an opportunity for anyone who wants to give it a shot. Moreover, stand-up is much about personal funny experiences that one shares and that’s why I love doing it ,” beams Baggy. “The show Kungfu Bonda retires in September, after which there will be no live performances. I will shoot it and release it online.”
The show, organised by Eight-O-Eight, is on at JC Residency, Lady Doak College Road on July 15, 6.30 pm. Tickets are priced at ₹499 and 750 and are available on baggythecomic.com. For more details call 7373000034, 8892750257

Puraani Jeans: Puraane scenes
","The idea was to use Puraani Jeans as a simile but they’ve ended up with a metaphor.
If the makers wanted to say that friendship is like old jeans (the longer it lasts, the more comfortable you get), they have ended up making a film with a worn-out plot, a story full of holes, faded stars at their career worst, treatment that went out of fashion a couple of decades ago and an overall dullness in the way it looks.
How do you establish friendship in a Hindi film? Well, the bunch of friends need to sing a song together that includes all of them jumping into a lake. Rang De Basanti, Rock On, Kai Po Che…
What keeps the gang of friends together? Their love for music, they have to be part of a band, one has to be the poet and the other the showman. Kabhi Haan Kabhi Naa, Rock On, Pyaar Main Kabhi Kabhi…
What leads to a rift and heartbreak? The girl in the triangular love story, of course. Saagar, Kabhi Haan Kabhi Naa, Saajan…
The only thing that can make these worn-out clichés worse is how it plays out — the direction is noteworthy for the fact that it makes not just the new actors but even veterans including Sarika and Rajit Kapur look like amateurs (Both of them play it loud, looking completely uninterested).
While Aditya Seal looks like the love child of Neil Nitin Mukesh and Akshaye Khanna (with the acting chops of the former and the permanent pout-face of the latter), Tanuj Virwani is Ashmit Patel and Suniel Shetty rolled into one (with the looks of the former and the acting chops of the latter). Isabelle Leite looks every bit the Katrina Kaif successor — foreigner with a presence so electric that it doesn’t matter that she cannot act.
Fast music, lines said in a hurry, and energy in screaming ‘Friends Forever’ every few minutes do not translate into pace.
The film takes half its running time to get to the point of the predictable heartbreak. It goes further downhill post-interval, with very little left to find out.
But the only thing we want to know is this: Why would the makers rehash scenes done so many times and way much better before?
And the craft just tells us one thing: Puraani Jeans, your fly is open.

Genre: Drama

Director: Tanushri Chattrji Bassu

Cast: Tanuj Virwani, Aditya Seal, Isabelle Leite, Sarika, Rati Agnihotri, Rajit Kapur

Storyline: A bunch of friends, a love triangle and the inevitable heartbreak

Bottomline: Jeans so low that you can see the crack. Look away.

Not as fiery as its predecessor ","I recently received a WhatsApp forward that said people in the US are either detectives or criminals. I sighed and deleted the message immediately, but when I watched the second season of The Sinner I felt that the joke was somewhat right.
The uncouth statistics may be absolutely ridiculous; however, in The Sinner’s universe, the characters are either involved in committing crimes, or investigating them. I greatly enjoyed the first season, and, I even wrote about it in this column a few months ago. The new season is not related to the Cora Tannetti case from season one, and, it features Detective Harry Ambrose (Bill Pullman) alone from the previous installment.




In season one, Cora (Jessica Biel) stabbed a guy on the beach, and, she was made to shuffle through her memory banks by Ambrose to find out why she did it. The latest season, too, opens in a similar manner – a 13-year-old boy named Julian Walker (Elisha Henig) kills Adam (Adam David Thompson) and Bess (Ellen Adair), his caretakers, by poisoning their tea.
The Sinner is probably the only show that’s making the whydunnit genre popular in the West currently. Now, for a moment, think about this – how could a jolly family trip to the Niagara Falls, as that’s where we’re told they’re headed towards, turn gory? In fact, Julian decorates the dead bodies by placing little rocks on his victims’ eyes. If you think that Julian is settling some kind of a score by doing this, you’re wrong. His motives are entirely different, and it’s quite impossible to guess that in the first episode. 
Also, Julian’s age makes it easy for the viewers to side with him (than with Cora), and, that predominant factor seeps into the storyline naturally. Detective Heather Novack (Natalie Paul), who’s neck-deep in her own solitariness, isn’t sure of her prowess, so, she requests Ambrose to help her out. He doesn’t mind going back to his hometown, Keller (where the murders happened), to work on the case, but, his face shows several forms of uneasiness that tells you he’s worried about something.




These tiny threads that appear in the beginning become a part of the sub-stories in the later episodes. Though, they’re all as good as the initial punch, they don’t stand a chance with the awesomeness of the first season. Since the flow of the narration was already established there, we know everything about the investigative methods employed by Ambrose. When everybody shuts their door, Ambrose is the only person to keep it open, and, offer a helping hand to the accused to understand them better.
And just like how it unfolds in season one, season two is also stacked with red-herrings and diversions. The point that needs to be noted here is the role that parents play in both the seasons. While the debate with regard to the kind of parenting that’s best suited for children is getting hotter day after day, The Sinner shows how kids are misled by their own parents. Cora had strict and religious parents, and, Julian’s mother, Vera Walker (Carrie Coon), lies to him about many things to protect him. But, he falls into a deeper mess because of the baseless lies he’s been fed throughout his childhood. The show subtly points fingers at the parents for the crimes committed by the children. And the writers need to be lauded for bringing this aspect into The Sinner.
Coon, who plays an unreliable character, is my favorite from this season as she perfectly controls her emotions during her conversations with Bill Pullman’s Ambrose. Of course, Pullman does a fine job, too, but Coon certainly walks away with the most fascinating performance. And, as a child who doesn’t know whom to trust, Henig displays vulnerability and confidence, at different points, with ease.




If the second season of The Sinner manages to hold your attention, it’s mainly because of the ingeniousness of the cast members.

Winning tunes
","Two ex-lovers relive their teenage love story during a bus journey through picturesque Sri Lankan countryside. That is the story of the music album Thaen Sindhum Pookal.
It won Best Music Video Album at the recently concluded 5th Norway Tamil Film Festival. And, music director M. Rajesh, who also sang in the album, is elated. “This is the first international recognition for our team,” he says.
“Director T. Piriyanathan worked as a cameraman for weddings before making the album. He has captured stunning visuals of Sri Lanka. The actors, the cinematographer and choreographer, all of them from Sri Lanka, have contributed immensely towards the album’s success,” he says.
Rajesh has been a part of the music industry for six years now. He has composed music for over 15 short films, telefilms and a number of jingles.
He has also composed a folk melody for the yet-to-be released film, Vadakkum Therkkum. The award-winning song is a classical number with Western beats.
“It was originally composed for an audio album Kadhalir Dhinam that was released in Switzerland. Later, a team from Sri Lanka chose to shoot a video, and here we have an international honour,” he smiles.
The album, released on YouTube in January, has been viewed over 16,000 times and garnered many likes.
The lyrics have been penned by award-winning writer S.V.R. Phamini.

Care for some Black magic?
"," He can charm the crowd with a spell, conjure umbrellas from thin air, make things disappear and also dances a fine jig. Magician, illusionist and dancer Alex Black from Russia is a master of all trades. Combining choreography with 3D mapping magic, acrobatics and juggling with comedy and illusions, the magician brings a blend of entertainment in his shows.
Touring the country for the first time with a full-fledged team, Black performed to packed audiences at Sir KP Puttanna Chetty Town Hall over the weekend after which he took time off for a chat with MetroPlus.
Black shows a lot of respect for India and its magical culture. “I do my own version of the rope trick that originated here in India. It is popular abroad. Of course, the original Indian rope magicians used big ropes. Maybe next time I’ll try to use a rope too. India is a great country for magic. People here love it and even fellow magicians from here have seen us and appreciated what we do.”




Black is quick to point out that magic is not like it used to be. Agreeing that pulling a rabbit out of a hat is now child’s play, he says: “Magicians now have to work harder to impress their audience. It’s also important to keep yourself updated on new technology and constantly innovate. Sometimes it is hard to do new things. For me, because this is my life, it comes like second nature. From the time I wake up till I sleep, I’m always trying to create something new magically. I wake up in the morning and think about magic and go to sleep doing the same.”
Black goes on to say that just doing magic is not enough anymore. “Entertainment is the key and you need to bring the full package when you are on stage. If you are not a good performer or you don’t connect with your audience, it can never be a good show. Dance works for me. It is my way of being different.”
He leans in and shares a little secret about his dance act: “Today, just before the show, I think I broke my little toe while practising a stunt. I have it bandaged tight. It hurts, but the show must go on. When you are on stage, what has to happen has to happen.” He continues on how dance became his passion: “I graduated from the Circus University in Saratov, Russia many years ago. That is where we learnt all disciplines from dancing to juggling. That is where dance clicked for me. I’m also a big Michael Jackson fan. He is my inspiration and that is why I do the moonwalk with the iPhone in one of my tricks.”




The 29-year-old says: “When I finished school, my father wanted me to study law since he was a lawyer. However, my calling was magic. I was already doing card tricks and I took my passion to the Circus University. After that, there was no turning back. I got in and put in a lot of hard work for the four-and-a-half years of training there. Soon after, I started my own show that took me across Russia for three years. Then, we took the show abroad, including the US, Germany, Dubai and China. Now I’m happy to be here in India.”
The conjurer points out that he would love to return to India with new tricks. “I’m testing the ground here with a balance of serious stuff and comedy. The blend between entertaining and thought-provoking acts is what makes a show successful. In fact, almost all of our routines have a concept. One thing I strongly propagate is the need for peace and not war.”




Going back to the marriage of technology and magic, Black says he loves to mix and match. “If you are a street magician, you’ll do only street magic. But I try to do everything from street performances to TV shows and close-up sleight-of-hand to dramatic big escapes. It is important for science and magic to work hand-in-hand. One cannot do without the other.”
He adds: “It’s a shame when people open up our secrets. If it’s not your idea, you shouldn’t reveal it. For us this is our livelihood. They are trying to kill the beauty of magic. This, however, pushes us to innovate all the time. It is challenging and we have to change the programme every time someone discloses a secret.”

Stories of man and nation "," The turbulent life and trial of South African athlete Oscar Pistorius, also referred to as the ‘Blade Runner’ for his athletic feats on prosthetic blades, will be the central narrative of Pistorius, a four-part documentary set to stream on Amazon Prime Video. Directed by Vaughan Sivell, also known for his documentary on champion boxer Joe Calzaghe, Pistorius dives into the circumstances surrounding Pistorius’ murder of his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp in 2013, and his drawn-out trial, set against the backdrop of South Africa’s journey as a nation. 
Sivell says that this parallel between Pistorius’ life and South Africa's growth is one of the reasons that drew him to the project. “When I looked into Oscar’s story, something that struck me as poignant was that Oscar and new South Africa were more or less the same age, and that both, because of circumstances, would have had very low expectations. Yet, Oscar managed to achieve so much as an athlete and South Africa became the rainbow nation under Mandela. Then you jump forward to a point in history where Oscar is on trial and somewhere his defence team blames the state of South Africa where crime is so high that a rich, white man hears a bang in the night, grabs his gun and shoots. The history of the country and the history of the man sort of collided at that point.”
Sivell explains that the team behind the documentary went to painstaking lengths to ensure accuracy, including getting the go-ahead from Pistorius to interview his family. 




The second half of the series, Sivell says, focuses on the trial in an attempt to dissect all available evidence. “Even though I am credited as sole director, we really were a team that worked at piecing together thousands of hours of footage and paperwork that the State and the defence dealt with. It took us three years and from day one till the end we were still discussing vital pieces of evidence, going back and forth.” 
Sivell says that the challenge was not to remain impartial, however, “It was more of a task to make sure that we did not miss out on any crucial evidence.”
Sivell goes on to draw more parallels between Pistorius and South Africa. “South Africa is a country of extremes. It is extremely beautiful, with wonderful people, but also deals with extreme poverty and a high rate of violence. In a way, what we learnt during the trial is that Oscar is also a man of extremes. 
“When he had his legs on he was the Oscar we knew, the shining superman, but when he did not have his legs he was a feeble, frightened paranoid individual. To put it another way, if you believe his story, had Oscar gone to sleep that night in Switzerland, London or Paris, Reeva might be alive today, as he would not have had a gun on him. So that parallel comes back.”
He also admits that he finds the stories of sportspersons interesting, provided he can find a good narrative to focus on. “There is no drama in the world, it seems, like the sporting life. I had done this film on the boxer Joe Calzaghe, (Mr. Calzaghe) and I thought I knew him before I did it, but what I did not know were the extremes he had to go through. As a producer, even as I was looking for another sportsperson, I realised that despite their careers, many tend to have boring lives. Oscar’s life was different in the drama that it became. You would not write a fiction as remarkable as Oscar's story, and a story like that will always attract filmmakers like me.”
The four-part series ‘Pistorius’ begins streaming on Amazon Prime worldwide from September 6.

#MeToo: Alok Nath’s wife files complaint in court against Vinta Nanda
","Actor Alok Nath’s wife, Ashu, has registered a complaint in Andheri court against writer-filmmaker Vinta Nanda, asking Amboli police to investigate the allegations of molestation and rape made by Ms. Nanda.
 
“I have heard from the media only that Mr. Alok Nath has filed a defamation suit against me. We, on the other hand, have not received any intimation regarding it as yet. We will respond to the notice once we get it and I assure all of you that we will fight this battle right till the end,” said Ms. Nanda.
 
Ms. Ashu’s lawyer, advocate Ashok Sarogi, clarified that no defamation suit has been filed yet. In the complaint, addressed to Chief Metropolitan Magistrate in Andheri Court, a copy of which is with The Hindu, Ms. Ashu said, “Because of the said defamatory statement published on behalf of [Ms. Nanda] by way of interviews given to various such social medias, our position is such that we are terrorized as even if we move out, the people are looking at us with a different attitude (sic).”
 
In the complaint, Mr. Nath’s wife also accused Ms. Nanda of having grievances against her husband because “it seems that Ms. Nanda has been carrying on an impression that because of my husband, the artists and story line [of the television serial Tara] were required to be changed and the said serial has gone off the air.”

Bridging the past and present
","
Watching a concert by TV Shankaranarayanan at RLV College, Tripunithura, set me thinking about the present scenario in Kathakali. Classical theatre has undergone a major paradigm shift in the recent past. If ‘major set’ Kathakali, usually comprising senior artistes and musicians, was an attraction for connoisseurs in the past, youngsters seem to be crowdpullers today.
 Kathakali artistes in their late fifties and sixties and above feel that nowadays many people want to watch only the youngsters on stage. Sixty was once considered young in Kathakali. Now they find themselves too old to be called young and too young to be considered senior. This is the dilemma faced by many artistes in all departments of Kathakali, whether it be it in acting, music, percussion or costuming (chutti). 
Kathakali artistes, in general, lead an insecure life, because they have left the comforts of worldly life to pursue their passion, which comes with its share of insecurities and setbacks. Not always financially rewarding, Kathakali is a passion for the artistes and what drives them on is the pleasure they derive from the art form. An artiste, even when he/she has a family and financial responsibilities, has to deliver what is expected of him, socially and emotionally, on the stage and also remain on top of his art. Rewards, usually, come in the form of awards much later in life. 
The current crop of ageing artistes have grown up watching their seniors getting all the adulation. Now when they have reached that stage and age, they find that the attention has shifted to the younger lot. This is the fate of people in that age group irrespective of their field of work. 
Coming back to Kathakali, it’s a positive sign that a new set of talented young artistes are coming up. On one hand, organisers opt for them because they are ‘minimum guarantee’ artistes and are cost effective, for there isn’t a lot of money to be spent on a Kathakali performance. It is again interest in the art form that motivates organisers to conduct and sponsor Kathakali festivals and plays. 
When talented youngsters are available at reasonable rates, organisers can’t be blamed for preferring them to expensive artistes. They also might find it easier to deal with the youngsters who may not indulge in artistic tantrums and are eager to impress connoisseurs. 




But, on the other hand, are we not sacrificing experience and masterly performances at the altar of finance and youth? Are we not getting carried away by a populistic approach at the cost of the art? Do we just need to celebrate the 70th and 80th birthdays of the veterans and forget them till their next milestone? Don’t we need them on stage to guide the younger generation and pass on their experienced wisdom that may otherwise be lost to the art form? In the prime of youth, at least some young artistes might want to innovate or deviate from the pattern or rebel against convention. In the absence of the guiding lights of an art form, who will show these youngsters the right path or guide them in the right direction? Wouldn’t they be left to fumble and fall if the veterans are pushed into oblivion? 
As an aswadaka of the old generation and an artiste of the new generation, I sometimes get confused about the right and wrong of the present scenario. Although I am a beneficiary of all the changes that is happening in Kathakali, I sometimes miss the old world charm and joy of watching a Kathakali performance. Though I am a performer and an organiser, I consider myself primarily an aswadaka before anything else. And that comes into play when I watch a performance and that is what set me thinking while listening to the masterly concert. 
Even when there is so much appreciation about the performances of a few artistes, that alone doesn’t make Kathakali what it is. We are discarding a lot of other aspects in Kathakali, which deserves a re-examination before its too late. I remember a performance by Keezhpadam Kumaran Nair as Kuchela when he was in his late eighties. Kumaran Nair, always known for his innovative approach, didn’t disappoint the crowd even then.




 The monologue, ‘Danavari mukundane’ was enacted without using even one mudra. This simply took the art to a different level. That, I feel, is the standard every artist should aspire to reach. 
Another performance that resonates in my memory is that of Lavanasuravadham. This was the second story of a full-night performance. Half the audience had left. Gradually, I got involved in the performance and got so engrossed in it that I remember each and every scene in the play even now. Music was by Sadanam Para Narayanan Namboodiri and Sadanam Sivadas. I was awestruck by the magic happening on stage. Listening to Narayanan Namboodiri for the first time, I realised that this was the Kathakali music I had grown up with. Sivadas was working on the cymbals as it ought to be used, which rarely happens these days. Some musicians get so engrossed in singing that they forget to use the instruments properly. The whole performance stood out as an integrated whole. That, I believe, is the essence of Kathakali; team work where every weft and warp weaves together a beautiful piece of artistry. 
At a time when innovation and change is the trademark, discipline, framework and time management also need to be given due importance. Isn’t it the skill of the artiste to perform within the time limit without compromising on content and nuances of the art? When rasikas seek out only the popular, isn’t it important to realise that it’s only a part of the whole? 
Technology and social media have brought in a new face to the art. Programmes are shared live on Facebook and they reach aswadakas in different parts of the world in real time. A performance is not judged by the immediate audience but people afar. Opinions are shared instantly. That is an advantage. However, the flip side of it is that prejudices also show up with equal vehemence. Nevertheless, a fair exchange of ideas is helpful in grooming upcoming artistes. Visibility also increases, which is important for a performer.
Rather than limiting themselves to the virtual world, Facebook and Whatsapp groups are now promoting the art. A Facebook group devoted to Kathakali conducted two full-night programmes in Kerala on a grand scale and Whatsapp groups are also conducting annual programmes by including amateur artistes as well. This is the bright side of technological development for Kathakali. 
However, it is imperative to start seeing Kathakali as a whole and not as an act of one artiste or musician. It is an integrated whole and that is the magic we want to see on stage. That’s what makes Kathakali stand out, because it is different each day. 
The chemistry among the artistes and between them and the audience decide the day. It’s this unpredictability that takes rasikas to far off places just to watch a show. So let’s respect the old and nurture the young. 
The writer is an academic and Kathakali artiste

CBS' 'The Big Bang Theory' to end in 2019 after 12 seasons "," CBS says the upcoming 12th season of “The Big Bang Theory” will be the last. 
Currently one of the most popular comedies on television, the series began about geeky physicist roommates portrayed by Jim Parsons and Johnny Galecki and expanded to include their friends, girlfriends and then wives. Other stars include Mayim Bialik, Kaley Cuoco, Kunal Nayyar, Simon Helberg and Melissa Rauch.
Parsons’ work on the show has earned him four Emmy awards and a Golden Globe. CBS also airs a prequel about his character called “Young Sheldon.” 
“We are forever grateful to our fans for their support of 'The Big Bang Theory' during the past 12 seasons,” CBS said in a statement released jointly with producers Warner Bros. Television and Chuck Lorre Productions.
“We, along with the cast, writers and crew, are extremely appreciative of the show's success and aim to deliver a final season, and series finale, that will bring 'The Big Bang Theory' to an epic creative close,” the statement added.
“There are many ways to look at the dozen years of 'Big Bang Theory' as we draw to a close, but for me it will be the family that gathered each week to create a true labor of love,” tweeted co-creator Bill Prady. “I will treasure my Big Bang family to the end of my days.”
There’s also a UCLA scholarship created by and named for the series to support undergrad study in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM).
Season 12 of “Big Bang” premieres on September 24.

Summer potpourri
","Lines that highlight the quaintness of the lingo of a particular section of society may add a flavour, but they cannot serve as the foundation of a play.
In Arangan Arangam’s ‘2BHK’ (story, dialogue and direction Srirangam Rangamani), the focus seemed to be on the peculiarities of the Iyengar lingo, with content playing second fiddle. It seemed as if the writer was focussed on what unique Iyengar terms he could include, and had then built a story around it. As a result, food was a major component in the dialogue, perhaps just to include typical Iyengar words such as ‘akkaravadisal’ and ‘satramudhu.’ The story meandered, and it wasn’t clear if it was about a house, or about wedding expenses. It also had regressive observations, for example- “A girl belongs to her husband’s family, head to toe,” and “A middle class man must never have a girl child.”
The process, where the prospective groom and in-laws meet the girl, was portrayed in such an old fashioned way that one wondered which period the story was set in. The idea of a sponsored wedding is old hat. In 2008, Venkat did an entire play centred round that notion and even gave it the title, ‘Sponsored Kalyanam.’ Why did Sangeetha as Vaidehi always call her mother in an annoyingly whining tone? There was nothing to shore up the proceedings, which stretched to 140 minutes.
Stage Creations came up with ‘Appa, Appappa..’, by S.L. Naanu. Sivaraman (Kathadi) is a retired man, who is convinced that his family is disrespectful towards him. Even innocuous statements are seen as slights by this hypersensitive senior citizen. He decides that the only way to get his family to respect him, is for him to ‘disappear’ for some time, the premise being that absence will make their hearts grow fonder. So he runs away from home. The play was billed as a comedy, but it wasn’t all that funny. There was, of course, the ‘Kathadi’ factor in operation, so that every time he appeared on stage, there were laughs and claps. But strip that away for a dispassionate look and you will realise that the comic element was not that strong. ‘Running away’ is not new to Kathadi, something he did in his 1970s play, ‘Runaway Husband.’ That was a hilarious play. The ‘runaway Appa’ of 2014 didn’t quite measure up. Mocking those with Hansen’s disease was insensitive and objectionable.
“Oh! What a tangled web we weave, when first we practise to deceive!” It’s a tangled web indeed, which Raghav (Sriram) weaves in Dummies’ ‘Sugamana Poigal’. Egged on by his friend Mohan (Prasanna Sridharan), Raghav gets Ramasamy (R. Giridharan) to take the place of his father. The deception is necessitated by the threat of suspension, which Raghav faces in his college. Afraid that Raghav’s tomfoolery may jeopardise his career, Ramasamy sets him right. Raghav shows his gratitude to Ramasamy in a unique way. Prema Sadasivam as the college professor was a bit over the top, though it was not entirely her fault. The lines written for her made her sound schoolmarmish. Since there is an impersonation, there are the usual mix ups.
Sreevathson, who has written and directed the play, made good use of the potential for humour in these situations. Comedy based on such mix-ups can be successful only if all the actors in the scene get the timing right and do their roles well, and Giridharan, Prasanna and Sriram didn’t let down the playwright. Prasanna and Sriram were sprightly, but the day belonged to Giridharan as the compulsive drinker Ramasamy, whose heart is in the right place.
Sreevathson said his play was inspired by one of writer Mari Selvaraj’s articles.

Cultural conversations ","This dance form translates the heart, the soul, the body and its core muscle strength of the artist into kinetic movements of emotions and expressions, making it one of the most intense and dynamic Indian dance forms. 
SPIC MACAY Karnataka Chapter sponsored the Mayurbhanj Chhau from Odisha. It is a folk Martial Arts dance, performed by Mayur Arts Centre, Bhuvaneswar at Satish Dhawan Auditorium, Indian Institute of Science.




SPIC MACAY, a non-profit, non-political, voluntary movement formed in 1977 by Dr. Kiran Seth, a professor at IIT- Delhi, strives to bring more awareness about traditional Indian values amongst students through increased exposure to the rich cultural heritage of India and to make education more holistic. With that objective, SPIC MACAY organized more than 7500 programmes in over 1500 schools and colleges in over 817 towns in India and abroad impacting more than two million students. SPIC MACAY Karnataka Chapter has been instrumental in organising performances of several stalwarts. Volunteers play a major role in this important work. 
 The team from the Mayur Art Centre, Pradip Kumar Mishra, Rama Naik, Dibar Naik (Senior), Birabal Mohanta, Aruna Behera, Rabindra Bindhani, Jyotisankar Mohapatra, Dibar Naik (Junior), Bajuram Tudu, Budheswar Munda performed three items, titled ‘The War Dance’, ‘Shiva Tandav’ and ‘Chakravyuh.’ 
The supporting musicians were - Surendra Soren on Dhol, Ashok Baitha on Mohauri (Shehnai like wind instrument), Baidyanath Ghunian on Chad Chadi and Yuvraj Dhada on Dhumsa).




Pradip Kumar Mishra, explained that “Chhau dance is an Indian tribal martial dance which is popular in Seraikella (Bihar), Purulia (West Bengal) and Mayurbhanj (Orissa). Based on the place of their origin and development, the three dance styles are called Seraikella Chhau, Mayurbhanj Chhau and Purulia Chhau. The two styles of Saraikela and Purulia use masks, but Mayurbhanj doesn’t. So, it showcases a distinctive appeal with wide range of movements and dynamic choreography. Technically it is richer than the other two styles. It is also called paika nrutya. The word paika is derived from the Sanskrit word padatika meaning the infantry - hence the name of the dance is paika (battle) nrutya (dance). The primary aim of this dance form is to develop physical strength, excitement and courage in the dancing warriors - the presiding deity of Mayurbhanj Chhau is Lord Bhairab ( Bhairav ).”
Talking about the beginning of his Centre, Pradip Mishra said: “The Mayur Art Centre was founded in 1980 by Late Devendra Naik Pattnaik who was Secretary, Odisha Sangeet Natak Akademi, who authored the books like ‘Abhinaya Darpan’, ‘Bharatiya Kala’. The Centre is devoted to the training, preservation, performance and research of Mayurbhanj Chhau. 
The Centre receives support from Govt of India which offers stipend to the students, but it is not sufficient. He appealed to all the philanthropists and art promoters to support their cause. 
The three dance themes presented :
 ‘The War Dance’ as the very title conveys, opened with loud drum beats and thumping steps of the dancers in their typical war attire holding shields and swords. The war dance was composed in 1912 by Late Ram Chandra Bhanj, the then ruler of Mayurbhanj on the arrival of the King George V, the ruler of England. This is a form of rehearsals of battle through dance movements. Their daredevilry left the audience gasping and that set the mood for the items to follow next. 
Shiv Tandav - In Hindu theology Shiva is the god of dancing. Through dance he creates, preserves and destroys, which is the cyclic process of the world. In dance these three dominant moods are delineated by various yogic postures and vigorous movements. The dancer who performed as Shiva had a certain aura around him, that comes with serious dedication and concentration. His gestures, spiral movements and foot work brought the stage alive. 
The dance depicted an episode from the Mahabharatha, the great epic based on the war between the Kauravas and Pandavas. Chakravyuha is the name for a complicated war strategy by which the enemy forms a circle. It is a challenge to the opponent to penetrate the circle. But only few of the members from either group had the knowledge and the expertise. 
This ‘Chakravyuha’ took the audience to a pinnacle of excitement and involvement. The final scene of Abhimanyu getting killed was so overwhelmingly natural, it left many teary eyed. 
Prof. Ananth Ramaswamy, who coordinates on behalf of IISc with SpicMacay in organizing these Events was exuberant and veracious in his observation. He said: 
In this rapidly changing world, the internet and the glamour world have created a disconnect among the youth with the traditional art forms which have been the inner strength and fabric of India. It is this chasm that is being bridged by the yeoman service being rendered by SPICMACY by reaching out to the youth of this nation.” 
Om Puri Gosain Research Scholar at ICER, IISc ‘The best thing is that we young people get the opportunity to volunteer the programs. The war dance depicted, how war rehearsals were being conducted. The Chakravyuh dance seemed a real one. The live musical instruments were fantastic. I was glad that they didn't use any recordings. The music and dance co-ordination was goose bumping. Depiction of ""Veer rasa"" could be clearly seen. Such programmes should be conducted more often”.

Lost Disney film showing Mickey Mouse's predecessor found in Japan ","When Yasushi Watanabe bought a cartoon film decades ago as a high school student in the Japanese city of Osaka, he had no idea he was purchasing animation history.
But the modest reel he bought for just 500 yen ($4.40 in today's money) has been revealed as a rare lost cartoon produced by Walt Disney featuring a character that led to the creation of Mickey Mouse.
The discovery was reported by Japan's Asahi Shimbun daily, which Watanabe contacted after reading a book about the history of “Oswald the Lucky Rabbit”, the character Disney created in the 1920s.
While Disney created the character, complete with oversized ears and a button nose, he lost the rights to another company, prompting him to develop a new cartoon figure: Mickey Mouse.
The book said seven of the 26 short films featuring Oswald that Walt Disney produced were missing, and Watanabe remembered his childhood reel.
It was labelled in Japanese “Mickey Manga Spide” -- Mickey Cartoon Speedy in English -- and featured a dog policeman on a motorbike chasing Oswald and his girlfriend in a car.
As the trio speed around valleys and along roads, the characters and the vehicles stretched and shrank, the Asahi reported, using a technique that later featured commonly in Disney works.
The newspaper contacted the author of the book and the Walt Disney Archives and confirmed that the reel was indeed one of the missing films, originally titled “Neck 'n' Neck.”
“We're absolutely delighted to learn that a copy of the lost film exists,” Becky Cline, director of the archives, told the newspaper.
“As I've been a Disney fan for many years, I'm happy I was able to play a role (in the discovery,” added Watanabe, an anime history researcher who is now 84.
His childhood purchase is now housed at the Kobe Planet Film Archive, and another film showing 50 seconds of the same cartoon has also been unearthed at the Toy Film Museum in Kyoto, the newspaper said.
In 2014, Norway's National Library announced it had discovered a copy of a Walt Disney cartoon featuring Oswald, which had been thought lost.
The cartoon, titled “Empty Socks,” was the first Christmas film made by the US entertainment giant and was discovered during an inventory at the library's facility near the Arctic Circle.
A year later, another short film featuring Oswald was uncovered in Britain and screened for the first time in 87 years.

Zach King on life as a ‘digipreneur’
","Sitting in his workspace in Rossmoor, California, Zachary King and his team are battling floods and playing with fire. Or at least, they are making it look like they are. 3D printers at their disposal, they are engineering visual illusions that King likes to call ‘practical magic’. 
Out in the digital stratosphere, his weeks-old video on magic tricks for travel (converting a globe into a neck pillow, squishing a suitcase so it fits between your palms) has already amassed over 1,75,000 views. With over three million followers on YouTube and 21 million on Instagram, King has spent 10 years honing the skills that allow him to conjure visuals that look like magic but are actually masterful applications of his editing prowess.
“It was a take on a Steven Spielberg, or the brilliance of George Lucas, really,” he says about his aesthetic and emphasis on special effects. Visuals from Jurassic Park and Indiana Jones pushed King towards film school, a journey that quickly transgressed into the the digital space a decade ago. 
Discovering virality
King forayed into the digital world when he started uploading videomaking and editing tutorials on YouTube, helping his then audience of almost 50,000 master Final Cut Pro (hence the nickname Final Cut King). A stray comment on one of the videos changed his path.
“My audience asked me one question: how can you take these visual effects and apply it to a story?” he recalls. So, he joined hands with college buddy Erin to make his very first viral video in 2011: Jedi Kittens. Featuring two light-sabre wielding, duelling kittens, the video — replete with special effects that showed the cats performing impossible stunts — amassed three million views in 24 hours.
“We couldn’t believe it. Going viral was something we’d seen happen to other people, never us,” he explains. 
The success of that video prompted King to join Vine, where creators only had “six seconds to make an impact”. With growing acclaim in the influencer community, he started receiving offers for brand deals and collaborations.




What is in a medium?
Today, with a team of 20 and a transition from Vine to Instagram (with an active YouTube presence), King believes that the current digital world is “a whole other animal”.
“Each medium is its own learning,” he says. “While YouTube is great because of how much time it allows, that’s even more time to lose the audience’s attention span. On the other hand, mediums like Vine and Instagram have been amazing exercises in creative control and prioritising content — they’ve been like my training grounds.”
How to build a following
 Ask King what the ticket to a viral video is, and you might receive a counterintuitive response.
“It’s simple — don’t try to go viral,” he advises. “Instead, focus on quality content. You can’t get complacent, you have to constantly evolve.”
Inspired by the works of visual effects artist Andrew Kramer and Film Riot (Ryan Connolly’s web show that explores filmmaking), and the continuous innovation by platforms like Disney and Pixar, King cites his follower base as his largest motivator, not the views.
And then there is mentorship. He is passionate about sharing his trade tricks with young, new-age digital influencers. To do that, he has teamed up with Apple’s video training collaboration program, Today at Apple, where he will host sessions on video editing, sharing his knowledge about the same technology that he picked up from the Apple genius bar when he started out.
“Creators nowadays are in their teens, sometimes at an age where they can’t judge what good content is and why they’re creating what they are,” he says. “As people who have experience and seen a bit of success, it’s our job to show the next generation that if you put out good content, you will attract an audience. It’ll take longer, but it’s more sustainable, more rewarding.”
This newfound role as a guide is one of King’s largest passions as he envisions a new-fangled digital world for his two kids to grow up in. But where does the real magic happen?
“In my home, in front of my kids, at the kitchen table, sometimes. I love doing the most basic magic tricks for them, watching them freak out,” he laughs. “After all, that’s where the magic all began.”

Exalted meanings
","For no reason, this Kannada film Anupama (1981), occupied the mind. And how? Totally. The actors, the story, songs – everything. It was a fun film, something similar to the lines of many films of those times. Like Padosan – you fall in love with the girl who is your neighbour. You have friends to aid your love, who are foolish, but loveable. Something like Guru Shishyaru, a bumbling brat pack that has sudden visions of truth. And many other films – tragedy strikes, and till then a fun story, heaves with sadness. Anupama, therefore, brought with it loads of memories – of a time that can never come back. Of the simplicity, of the genuine goodness of things, of tragedy and its inevitability, most of all, the music.




The film has three memorable songs: Anupama Cheluvu, Bartaale-Bartaale and Olume Poojegende. Anupama Cheluvu is a lovely, breezy and vibrant love song. You can see in it shades of Ilaiyaraja (who had made his debut in 1976 with Annaikili), especially on the percussion track. It is composed differently for the main melody and background score, with an illusion of syncopation for the main melody. Bartaale Bartaale is an entertainer – it is full of clownish antics with not much of a melody. But one remembers it for the number of sound textures it creates and how it intelligently blends it into the melodic structure. The highlight is Olume Poojegende, masterpiece of a song. A song that can easily be called among Kannada’s best.
The music for this film is by Ashwath-Vaidi, a pair that came into existence after they met during the recording of the film, Kakana Kote (1976). For the next three decades, the C. Ashwath and L. Vaidyanathan duo composed some of the greatest songs of Kannada film industry. The story about their collaboration is that Ashwath provided the tunes, and Vaidyanathan made the background score, however, it is hard to believe that their extraordinary efforts emerged from such watertight compartments.




C. Ashwath was among the iconic bhavageethe composers of Kannada. His vision, style, repertoire was distinct. L. Vaidyanathan came from a family of great musicians. His father V. Lakshminarayana was a teacher to him and his highly accomplished brothers, L. Shankar and L. Subramaniam. An ace violinist, he worked as G.K. Venkatesh’s assistant and the film industry remembers him as one of the finest arrangers who mixed rare instruments to create a unique and sensitive soundscape. He had a great sense for earthy sounds and timbres, and was also known for his keen understanding of technology. Vaidi, as he is popularly known, composed music for over 170 films, but the most enduring memory for listeners is his unforgettable signature tune for Shankar Nag’s Malgudi Days: Thanana thananana re…..




Olume Poojegende is a masterpiece (sung by S. Janaki and S.P. Balasubramaniam) for the way in which the composition has been conceived. In its imagination, it has the complex manoeuvrings of a piece of classical music, but in its rendering it brings the eternal charm of an intense film song. What merits such an observation? Listen to the song, and you will recognise the rich textures of the Hindustani raga, Yaman Kalyan. Listen to it again, and again, and you will begin to get into a mystery that is embedded in the song. What is it? In an optical illusion what you see depends much on what you focus on: what forms the background and foreground. Similarly, in an auditory illusion, what we hear also depends on what we focus on. In this song, much of what we see and hear depends on what we begin to see as the aadhara shruti (the note from which the entire song progresses). The opening phrase of the song on santoor, which largely uses just three notes, operates from the shadja, but by the end of the opening background score, the entire song moves to madhyama shruti. This creates the effect of tonic shift or graha bedham while actually the entire melody has shifted to another note, a higher note which is the madhyama. While in the normal pa to pa scale, the opening phrase for Yaman Kalyan would have been da ni sa, it becomes ga ma pa in this case. This has been done so intelligently that unless you stay with the song, it is a mystery you cannot decipher. In a masterpiece of a move, Ashwath-Vaidi introduce raga Bhinna Shadaj in a phrase that occurs just once, elevating the dramatic quality of the entire song.
The use of instruments is brilliant, as well as the use of rhythm and intervals between notes. It creates multiple patterns, multiple melodic effects while the emotion of the song remains a constant: slow, and protracted. The whole experience of the song gains in meaning when, at the end, you realise it is a dream that you want to hold on to. To extend it to poetry, Basavanna writes: “Things standing shall fall, but the moving ever shall stay”. Therefore, as long as Yaman Kalyan appears in new forms in every dream, it will remain eternal.

Radhika Apte and Rajkummar Rao on their collaboration with Audible
","After a star-studded launch event at Mumbai’s Royal Opera House this week, Amazon-owned audiobook retailer and publisher Audible has officially entered the Indian market. With over 2,00,000 titles, of which around 400 are exclusive works by Indian authors, the service is priced at ₹199 per month (versus the approximately ₹1,080 fee paid by American customers).
The headliner of the launch event was the audio rendition of investigative journalist Hussain Zaidi’s 2011 book Mafia Queens of Mumbai, which delves into the stories of the lesser known female figures of Mumbai’s underworld. Narrated by actors Radhika Apte, Rajkummar Rao and Kalki Koechlin, it was one of many titles released for an Indian audience. Other titles include Durjoy Datta’s The Last Boy to Fall in Love and Dale Carnegie’s How to Win Friends and Influence People (as narrated by Shernaz Patel).
“It was challenging,” says Rajkummar Rao — the National Award-winning actor whose recent film, Stree, has won both critical and commercial acclaim — about his foray into voice acting. “I thought it would be a chance for me to explain something new, to narrate a story with just my voice.”
Even though Rao, Apte and Koechlin stem from the visual medium, their participation in this venture does not come as a surprise. The women especially have been dabbling in new mediums, leading the cohort of Bollywood actors producing over-the-top (OTT) content such as web series, podcasts and Netflix originals. And they believe that India is well-positioned for the audiobook boom. “With phenomenal actors like Radhika and Kalki, and an average actor like me narrating a story, I think people will get used to the format in India,” says Rao, jokingly.
Radhika Apte, who heard about Audible earlier this year when it was recommended to her by a friend, concurs. “We have a culture of storytelling,” says the actor who has just wrapped up performances in The Wedding Guest and Lydia Pilcher’s untitled project. “And at a time when there is so much bombardment of visual content all the time, I think it’s very therapeutic and meditative to listen to something.”

Put your best face forward
","We all love the red carpet — the gowns, the hairdos and the works. Namrata Soni — L'Oréal Paris’ make-up expert, is one of many who works behind the scenes to ensure the stars get their looks right for the flash bulbs. She even created the looks for the brand’s latest make-up collection — L’Or Lumiere, which its ambassadors will sport at the red carpet in Cannes Film Fesival 2014. Armed with the expertise and experience, Namrata tells us how to make the red carpet glamour work for the Indian skin tone — there are 32 shades of it, I’m told!

Why has L’Oreal chosen to focus on Indian skin this time?

I think it’s high time we did. We are all used to seeing only white faces, so we need to tell people it is okay to look the way you are, be the colour you are.

What are the colours that will work for the Indian skin?

Indian skin ranges from very fair to very dark, so it is important to understand one’s skin colour. My website explains how one can determine their under tone so that they can choose shades accordingly. But personally, I feel that there is a perfect red lipstick for every skin colour.

There are many who are not comfortable sporting bright lip colours.

The trick is understanding make-up. If you feel a colour is too dark, apply it as a stain or just a hue of it. There has to be some colour on the face to make us look brighter and fresh. Indians are too obsessed with maroons, browns and black.

So you suggest experimenting with make up?

Yes. One should not be scared to experiment. It is just make-up, you can wash it off. I always tell people, you need not remove the entire make-up too. Just dab the tip of a cotton bud with make-up remover and wipe off just aspect that does not work for you.

While preparing for the red carpet, what is the one aspect that people generally overlook?

Nails! They are also equally in focus. You see stars posing with their hands on their dress or holding their clutches. They need to be well manicured. And if you’re not the type to change colour to match your outfit everyday then I suggest you go for any neutral colour, or a gold with pearl finish for the red carpet — it goes very well with Indian skin tone.

Some tips…

- First, look after your skin. Also, don’t worry about concealing too many flaws. Instead, focus on highlighting a feature. I hate dark eyes and dark lips. Only either of it should be highlighted, not both.
- If you have no time to get ready, even mascara and a smear of blush will work wonders.
- According to me, the winged liner will always be in vogue. It especially suits the Indian face.

Outtakes: Guy Maddin
","WHO is he?
Canadian artist, filmmaker, writer, scenarist, cinematographer and film editor who has directed 10 feature films and close to 50 short-length films since the mid-eighties. Maddin is among the most celebrated Canadian filmmakers of today alongside David Cronenberg and Atom Egoyan. His recent cinema straddles the realms of installation art and conventional film production.

What are his films about?


Themes


Style


WHY is he of interest?
Maddin’s films are some of the earliest examples of a truly post-modern cinema, not only in the way they rework traditional forms to comment on them, but also forge a new vision out of such cinematic cross-referencing. While purists may object to Maddin’s ironic appropriation of silent cinema aesthetic as being too clever for its own good, the anachronistic elements within these films are a sort of evidence that Maddin intends to mould these appropriated elements into an idiosyncratic novelty.

WHERE to discover him?
Just six minutes in length, the explosive The Heart of the World (2005) comes across as a perfect distillation of the key themes and style of Maddin’s cinema. Cut to a pulsating score, the film follows a scientist, Anna, who saves the world from a certain ‘heart attack’. The Heart of the World is made in the vein of early Soviet propaganda films, with their intense formalism and ideological rigidity intact, while at the same time commenting upon the psycho-sexual bases of those films. Maddin’s film, as it were, is a post-modern commentary on modernism.

Sayantani Ghosh in a mythical avatar ","A popular face in television serials, Sayantani Ghosh is back with a mythological drama. She will be seen as Kunti in Karn Sangini on Star Plus.“We have shown that Kunti realises her mistake of abandoning her son Karna. Because of social norms, she could not bring up Karna as a single mother. She didn’t have the courage then but after so many years she realises her mistake. She keeps on repeating this line, ‘Every time there is a war, one emerges as a winner, but a mother is always a loser.’” This, she says, gives a contemporary ring to it. “Even today, whenever there is a war or a skirmish at the border, it is the mother who is left grief-stricken.” 
An erudite actor, Sayantani says, she could relate to her plight. “I don’t think anyone in today’s time can say that he or she never committed a mistake. We want to rectify our mistakes. Similarly, Kunti too committed a mistake, which she wanted to correct.” 
On the increasing jingoism in society, the Kolkata-born actor remarks, “If I am not breaking traffic rules, not littering on the roads, paying taxes on time, it makes me a better patriot than someone who is just shouting slogans.” 
Reflecting on the look of her character, Sayantani says it is unlike most other mythological serials where characters look like dressed for a wedding. 
“We have used minimalistic jewellery and outfits are soft and light in colour. Usually, Kunti is shown only in whites; here we have added rust and mustard as well.” 
In order to reach out to young generation, the dialogues, she adds, are not Sanskritised. They are neither colloquial nor laced with bombastic words. Prayas would be replaced by koshish, bal ki jagah hum taqat bol sakte hai. This will make it easier for the average TV viewer to understand.” 
Sayantani was last seen in Naagin, a series which is trolled a lot on the social media. “Well, it was a huge success in terms of the TRPs. It only reflects what society is ready to watch. As actors, we want to do diverse roles. However, my personal choice is to do contemporary stories.”

A room, a clue, a key, a lock — an experience
"," 

Peruse any mobile app store and you’ll find hundreds of these games where a few simple taps will clear you of the level. The difference is substantial when actually situating yourself in these rooms, because the pressure is clearly a lot more intense and, well, one can’t just hit ‘exit’ or the home button to leave and come back whenever they wish.
The trend of ‘escape experiences’ started in 2007 courtesy Takao Kato of the famous Real Escape Game — this got the ball rolling and now, globally, there are over 8,000 venues worldwide offering mystery junkies the opportunity to solve puzzles driven by narratives. 




The Hidden Hour on Road Number 36 in Jubilee Hills has a different atmosphere from the horror and tears-inducing themes common to these games. CEO of The Hidden Hour Aman Goel explains the more upbeat themes of the escape-rooms have invited a somewhat different demographic, adding “While we do get various groups of friends and corporate groups who want to build team-work skills, we do also get larger families, mainly across three generations.” The premises opened just three weeks ago and the team is already observing good feedback from participants, especially as they emerge from the rooms after successfully getting out. 
Gamemaster at The Hidden Hour, Prithviraj, just came back from a training at the franchise’s head office in Delhi where he learned about how to keep the sensors in the room at optimal functionality. “While our main team sits in Delhi, we have to be on call here in case something needs to be adjusted between games sessions because we do modify the games according to the variety of levels we offer.”




With over 18 branches across India, Mystery Rooms at SVM Mall in Jubilee Hills is popular for its hair-raising themes such as ‘Cabin In The Woods’ and ‘Hurt Locker.’ Operations manager Saikiran Royal says the venue is frequented by corporates from Deloitte, Microsoft and Google who want to build team-work skills and just get away from their desks for a bit. 
Families and friends also venture to Mystery Rooms, but more so during the weekends where slots get booked extremely quickly. 
“See, our concept is different from other escape experiences. The difficulty level is quite up there and people often underestimate how tough it is to get out of there,” he comments, “and while we do monitor their progress, we tell them during the briefing that they should start at basic level because even that’s pretty hard. We currently have five games here at this branch, and our next branch opening later in the year in Gachibowli will have another five. We like to immerse them completely in the experience; in the Cabin In The Woods one has no lights while the prison-themed one has participants dressing up in overalls that we provide.”




Another place which is a favourite with the corporates is The Great Escape formerly known as The Escape Hunt for two years prior to a fun rebranding the franchise underwent in May, and largely caters to people aged 21 till 40.
Divya Pitla, the onsite manager at The Great Escape in SLN Terminus Mall in Gachibowli, says their USP is that they have two rooms in for each game so they can have two different teams compete against each other.
What’s universal across all these venues is the strict ‘no phones inside’ policy. Aman elaborates, “We want our participants to get away from their phones, and really engage with each other and put on their thinking caps... and have a memorable and fun time, of course!”

Comedy over cash flow for Sonali Thakker
"," Chartered accountancy was not Sonali Thakker’s cup of tea. As she waited for her results, she found a creative outlet in stand-up comedy. Starting off at open mics while working as a freelance writer, the 28-year-old is now a full-time comic. Pursuing a career that was considered “commercial suicide” in her typical Gujarati family, she says that she is the first in her family to be in a creative field. “A comic’s day starts when everyone else’s day ends. It’s a very confusing and different lifestyle, but it’s all worth it to be on stage,” she says.
Bringing her one-hour stand-up special, Almost There, for the first time to Chennai today (and Bengaluru tomorrow), she says the latter is one of her favourite cities to perform in (after Mumbai). Coming up with a one-hour special is a big milestone in any comic’s career. “Since I’ve been in the circuit for a while, people started asking me if my show was ready. And I kept saying that it is ‘almost there’,” she says with a laugh, adding that she will be talking about family, relationships and travelling.
Jokes that count
Thakker has an interesting take on being a woman in the industry. “I feel very special because no man is asked how it feels to be a man in the industry,” she says, deadpan. She had never thought of it as a dynamic until it was pointed out to her. While she feels that the industry itself is indifferent, it is the audience that must change its perception. “If a male comic flops, they are having a bad day. If the same thing happens to a female comic, people go back thinking that all women are not funny.” Yet, she takes this prejudice as a challenge to make herself a better comic. “Laughter is an emotion that you can’t hold back. If someone cracks a funny joke, irrespective of their gender, you will laugh.”
Saying that she is “eternally grateful to Mark Zuckerberg”, Thakker feels that social media has been a saviour for comics. Although she is very active on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter, surprisingly unlike most of the other comics today, she is not on YouTube. “I prefer live performances because it provides a blank slate for me to perform in front of people I don’t know. I like it when they come without any preconceived notions. If they like my performance, then they experience the joy of discovering a new artist,” she says, describing it as one of those unplanned encounters while travelling, that turn into some of the best experiences. “I have never felt the need to upload anything on YouTube and obviously that leads to a lesser turnout, but I prefer that. These are the people who have come out to watch comedy and not just because they’re a fan,” she added.

'Characters are more important than actors’
","For director Nagraj Manjule, winning national awards is nothing new. His first short film Pistulya too won the national award for Best Debut in the short film category. Now, Manjule has won the National Award for Best Debut for Director for Fandry. And not just the national award, Fandry has won the Grand Jury Prize in the Mumbai International Film Festival, The Best Indian Film of Year 2013 awarded by the International Federation of Film Critics, as well as Best Film, Best Film (Audience), Best Director, Best Cinematography, and Best Actor awards at the Pune International Film Festival. Nagraj Manjule talks about his approach to cinema, his childhood, politics, and why caste is the centre point of his creations.

Congratulations on your second national award. How important is this award to you?

Thank you. It’s not just me; Somnath Awaghade has won the Best Child Artist award as well and that makes me happier. I value the National Awards above all and, given the kind of reception the film received, both from critics and viewers, I was hoping to do well. The awards are as important as the people watching your film. After all, we make films for people to watch. And winning a national award makes people realise the importance of that film.

You have been travelling a lot, taking Fandry to different festivals. How was the response overseas?

I had just returned from the U.S. I had to cut the tour short for the National Awards, but the film was appreciated at the Los Angeles Film Festival. I was invited to several universities as well. For them, the Indian cinema is largely about Bollywood, about song and dance. Fandry was a different experience; especially the fact that casteism is still deep-rooted and dominant in today’s India shocked them. We would have detailed discussions on issues ranging from Dr. Ambedkar to Indian cinema. It was a great experience. I also met Karen Tenkhoff, the producer of The Motorcycle Diaries, who loved Fandry and said she would love to work with me.

Is Fandry’s story based on your childhood?

Fandry is a coming-of-age story about Jabya, a boy belonging to the Kaikadi community. His family survives by doing petty jobs in the village and also has the extra responsibility of catching the pigs in the village. I was born in the Wadar community in Solapur’s Karmala area. Our profession was to break stones. Though my father never caught pigs, we were actually expected to do that. As a schoolboy, I was ashamed of this reality. Fandry is the word used for pigs in my village and they used to commonly call us too by the same name. Nobody saw anything wrong in this. It was an insult to me, but I had no idea why it was me who was suffering. As a student, my caste was imprinted on me even in school.

And the girl you fell in love with at school?


How did you turn to cinema?

I have done many jobs. I joined the police after school. I went on to become a watchman, worked in general stores, in a telephone booth. I did all this for money while studying. After my M.A. in Marathi, a friend told me about a Mass Communication course. I love telling stories. One of my friends, a faculty member, asked me to sign up. My main attraction was the possibility of a chance to make a short film and tell my story.
I did that through Pistulya and that gave me my first National award. It reinforced my belief that I could tell stories in a way that people would like. I wanted to express myself; this is one of my needs. Not just films; I write poems and draw pictures too. I have realised that I can’t live without this.

Are you inspired by any particular director?

Not really. My introduction to foreign language films was five years ago. I grew up on typical masala films, which all of us like. Idolising a particular person is like following a big truck blindly. Your chances of landing in a pothole increase a lot. I prefer to tell my stories in my way.

Why did you choose untrained actors for your film?

I did it purposely. People always follow actors; I follow characters. According to me, a film’s characters are more important than the actors. For any film, its characters have to be strong. People like Amitabh Bachchan are great actors, but if the role isn’t strong enough what can they do?

Why did you pick caste as the theme for both your first films?

Caste is the reality of our society. Those who don’t suffer the discrimination feel there is no casteism. Just because the middle class thinks that casteism has vanished doesn’t make it a reality. Take the very simple example of marriage. Does a Brahmin groom voluntarily look for a Dalit bride? Caste has become a part of our routine life. Look around you, check among your friends and close circles. I have not tried to profess anything in the film; I only wanted to show the reality.

In an industry where people are hesitant to take a stand on any issue, don’t you think you will be sidelined for your strong views?

Being an Ambedkarite is an honour and there is nothing wrong in it, nothing to hide. He professed the ideology of equality; and was not for any particular caste. He showed the way that every progressive person would like to follow. What’s wrong in following him? I am really not bothered about being sidelined. I was never on the centre stage so how can I be sidelined?
I don’t have high aspirations of being part of the glamour world or the talk-of-the-town. I want to tell my stories to people in my own way. I have my friends, who will be with me in future. I am happy with them.

Many think that Fandry’s end supports violence. What do you think?

If you think that a small boy throwing stones amounts to violence, how do you evaluate society’s treatment of that boy and his family before that? Wasn’t that violence? As a society, we have the habit of calling any retaliation by the oppressed section as violence. We conveniently ignore the oppression and choose to see it as a way of life.

After two national awards, audiences are expecting a lot from you. Do you feel the pressure?

As a society, we love worshipping. People often tell me that they expect greater work from me in future. I counter them; because I hate it when someone calls me great. I am a human being. I also deserve a chance at committing a mistake.

Priyanka Chopra apologises for ‘Indian nationalists’ terror plot in ‘Quantico’ ","Priyanka Chopra apologised for a recent episode in Quantico, following online backlash for the ‘Indian nationalists’ terror plot line in her show.
The 35-year-old actor took to Twitter to clear the air around the episode, titled ‘The Blood of Romeo’, which received a lot of backlash from Indian fans of the show, who criticised her of being a part of the storyline that showed India in a negative light.
Calling herself a “proud Indian”, Chopra said she is “extremely saddened” and that hurting sentiments of people was never her intention.
 
I’m extremely saddened and sorry that some sentiments have been hurt by a recent episode of Quantico. That was not and would never be my intention. I sincerely apologise. I'm a proud Indian and that will never change.

“I’m extremely saddened and sorry that some sentiments have been hurt by a recent episode of ‘Quantico’ That was not and would never be my intention. I sincerely apologise. I’m a proud Indian and that will never change,” she tweeted.
Chopra’s remarks come a day after ABC’s statement where the network apologised for stepping into a “complex political issue” with the latest episode of Quantico, which showed ‘Indian nationalists’ planning to carry out a terrorist attack in Manhattan and frame Pakistan for it days before a summit on Kashmir.
The producers said the actor was not to be blamed for the episode as she did not have a creative control over it.
Chopra, who became the first Indian actor to play a lead role in an American TV series, portrays FBI agent Alex Parrish on the show, which is currently in its third and final season.

Academy shelves plans for ‘most popular’ Oscar
","The idea to hand out a popular film Oscar has been shelved for now following widespread backlash, but film academy president John Bailey said that the new category was well-intentioned in its efforts to reflect a changing industry and misunderstood by its critics.
The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences said on Thursday that it will further study plans for the category, citing the fact that implementing a new award three quarters of the way into the year would create challenges for films that have already been released.
The academy announced the new category for “outstanding achievement in popular film” last month without parameters, spawning immediate questions about the criteria and how it would impact critically and commercially films such as Black Panther, which has been cited as a possible best picture contender.
Mr. Bailey told The Associated Press he was surprised by the negative reaction to the new category and feels that that people did not understand its goal to give recognition to the kinds of films that are being made today.
“The idea of this award was not about trying to make sure that certain kinds of big mass market pictures get recognized. To my mind, it’s more about the kind of pictures that are so difficult to get made,” Mr. Bailey said, citing films that he worked on like The Big Chill and Ordinary People as the kind of “middle pictures” that major studios don’t make as many of and, when they do, aren’t often recognized with the film industry’s most prestigious award.
While the criteria for the new category are still not defined, Mr. Bailey said both release size and box office are part of the equation and that a film like Black Panther could be submitted and potentially win for both best picture and popular film. The same is true for an animated film.
Oscar viewership is often tied to the box-office muscle of the big nominees. Ratings for the 90th Academy Awards fell to an all-time low of 26.5 million viewers, down 19 per cent from the previous year and the first time the glitzy awards ceremony had fewer than 30 million viewers since 2008. The biggest show audience on record came in 1998, when the blockbuster Titanic was named best picture.
The last three years the best picture Oscar has gone to “smaller” films The Shape of Water, “Moonlight” and Spotlight none of which made more than $100 million at the North American box office or played in more than 3,000 theaters.
The 91st annual Oscars, to be held February 24 in Los Angeles, will undergo some changes this year, with the academy planning to shorten the ceremony to three hours. In order to do so, it plans to hand out Oscars in six to eight categories during commercial breaks. The academy also still plans to shorten the awards season by moving up the 2020 Oscars a few weeks to February 9, 2020.

Sadaa back in the spotlight
"," Every time actress Sadaa has a film up for release, the one thing everyone seems to ask her is: “Where did you go all these days?” By now, the Mumbai-based actor is used to these queries. At one level, she says she understands them. After all, one would have expected the star of hits such as Jayam, Anniyan and Unnale Unnale to keep churning out movies on the trot. But, that never happened. “I did some films without much thought, and would wonder why on earth I signed up for them,” she admits. And so, she took a conscious decision to move away from what was being offered. Her last release was Eli, with Vadivelu.
And then, when she was in Chennai as part of Vijay TV’s Jodi No 1, director Abdul Majith (of Tamizhan fame; the film that saw Priyanka Chopra make her début in films) met her and narrated a story about sex workers. That film is Torchlight, co-starring Riythvika. It releases this Friday after a protracted battle with the Censor Board; the director has effected 87 cuts in the film. Set in the 80s and 90s, it speaks about the plight of women who solicit customers on highways due to family circumstances, and who lead miserable lives.
“I wanted to move away from regular commercial stuff and do something more mature as an actor. I wanted to be part of a film that would have me as a performer, and one in which I enjoyed the process of making it, no matter what the outcome,” she says.
Even before this, she did get offers from many first-time directors and producers, but was wary of signing up for films that might never see the light of day. “I was surprised when he told me that this script had been rejected by many others. There was no way anyone wanting to do a good film could have rejected this! It is bold, has hard-hitting dialogues that might shock people, but is rooted in reality. And, no, contrary to what many think, it has been shot aesthetically. That was among my conditions before getting on board the film. Luckily for me, Majith sir had done his homework and research. I merely had to follow instructions.”
Sadaa says that she is happy people still miss her. And, even after all these years, there is a sense of disappointment at the offers that came her way after she proved she was heroine material. “I think that was probably because some of those films were way ahead of their time. For instance, Unnale Unnale is the kind of film that is still contemporary now.”
One reason, Sadaa says, is that she can’t bring herself to socialise and scout for offers. “Once I complete my work, I move on. I’ve been lucky that filmmakers approached me, and not the other way around,” says the actress, who has two more films coming up. And, in between all of that, she’s busy with her latest passion — veganism, and her long-time work with rescuing animals and encouraging people to adopt and not shop for pets.

Murr in the house
"," Some might argue that James Murray has the best life — he spends all his time with his best friends, and plays pranks on them for a living. He travels the world with them, playing stages like the O2 Arena, Radio City Music Hall and Madison Square Garden. Currently, they are touring the US, and have just wrapped up the filming of season eight of their cult hit show, Impractical Jokers. Somewhere in the middle of all this, he has found time to co-author Awakened, a supernatural novel, with Darren Wearmouth. 
What Murray is looking forward to, however, is his first ever trip to India later this year. “We get more fan mail from India than from America, the UK, Australia and Italy combined. It’s unbelievable,” he exclaims. On the phone, he sounds exactly like he does on the show — hyperactive and always ready to laugh. Yesterday, he was on Comedy Central’s Facebook page for a live session, where hundreds of fans tuned in to ask him questions about his interests, advice on love and how he keeps the friendship with fellow jokers — Joe Gatto, Sal Vulcano and Brian Quinn — ticking. 


He will also be picking the line-up for Sunday’s marathon of the show on TV. Any other person would pick what shows them in a good light. Not Murray, though. “It will be 20 episodes, featuring some of my most embarrassing, and favourite, moments,” he says with his signature chuckle. Although the four comics have sizeable online followings, they have not been creating online content as frequently as they used to when they started out. But their approach to the medium is similar to how they put together their show, he says, explaining, “The show is just my best friends and I being ourselves. We don’t play a persona. And so for the web, we now prefer to do live video interactions over sketches, where our fans can see the real us.”
While tour dates and locations have not been announced yet for his solo visit to the sub-continent, Murray says, “I’ll be throwing a big party for our fans, where I can get to meet and interact with them in an informal setting. It will also be a chance for me to introduce my book to them.”

Do the drums
","His Mohawk makes an impact before his music. Ravi Jakhotia was in demand on the stage and off it at IIFA. The Tampa native, with roots in Rajasthan, composed the event’s theme song “Do Da Tampa” that made the locals dance to his tunes and generated the much needed interest in the four-day event with his livewire performance. “Around 8,000 people turned up for the opening night and out of them 40 per cent were local Americans,” says Ravi, who performed again at IIFA Rocks. “While composing the music, I was conscious about bringing out the Tampa culture on the world stage but at the same time wanted to write something that will appeal to Bollywood fans as well. I am inspired by Hispanic music and there is a similarity between Bollywood music and Brazilian and Spanish beats,” he elaborates. The six-minute song has reggae and salsa beats and it helped in creating the mela atmosphere around the event, which many hard-nosed observers described as Oscars on steroids. Improvisation is the key to the performance of this Chamberlain graduate. .
Ravi comes from a conservative family, says he was always interested in music.. “I was considered an outcast. When I asked my father to buy me a drum he found the hobby expensive. So I saved by doing odd jobs in the neighbourhood. It was only when he realised that I am serious about it that he supported.”
Popularly called DJ Ravidrums, he has performed with the likes of Paula Abdul, Ricky Martin, Britney Spears and Black Eyed Peas and has composed music for American comedy Howie Do It, but he considers the IIFA opportunity bigger as it gave him a chance to showcase his own music. “

Replaced by a Robot
","The problems faced by aging parents, who are left to fend for themselves by their U.S.-settled wards, were highlighted in Chennai Navabharath’s ‘Oru Robovin Diary.’
The play was staged as part of Kartik Fine Arts’ Kodai nataka VIzha.
Veteran actor Koothabiran was the anchor, who lived the role of Nataraja Iyer. He capitalised on his real age to execute his role with ease. The sag at times seemed inevitable.
Natarajan’s son Ramkumar (Vignesh Ratnam), daughter-in-law Charukesi (Anuradha Ganesh) and grandson are about to return to the U.S. after their vacation in Chennai. Nataraja Iyer is unable to bear the separation and pleads with his son to stay back, something he has been doing for the past 22 years.
Ramkumar, a software engineer, designs a robot which is programmed to carry out his father’s every command. And the machine does it --- preparing coffee, administering medicines or playing songs, it does anything and everything. Ramkumar assures his father that it will make good his absence.
The director N. Rathnam’s effort to enact part of the robot, was praiseworthy. Nowhere did he flounder, either in his mannerism or in dialogue delivery. Rathnam, who takes credit for the story and dialogue as well, packed the scenes with a fair amount of melodrama.
Vignesh Ratnam, as somebody torn between the lure of material comforts and the love for his father, exhibited appropriate expressions. For instance, his anguish when he is informed about the pink slip waiting for him in the U.S. Anuradha Ganesh as the nagging wife, was convincing. T.P. Sreeram as the wise family doctor, who advises Ramkumar about relationships, N. Ganesan as the cook and R. Venkatraghavan as Ramkumar’s greedy father-in-law, did justice to their roles.
Incisive dialogue pepped up the play. Background score by Sanjana and Nikhil had a right mix of peppy tunes and melancholic phrases, and helped. However, one felt making use of the veena, flute and the sitar would have lifted the emotional scenes to greater heights.

'Alexa & Katie': For teens and the teenager in you
"," Alexa & Katie is a departure from the crime shows I’ve been devouring of late. This is an absolute teen series, a genre that’s free from the clutches of violence and deceit.
Netflix is producing shows of all kinds for audiences of all ages. This latest multi-camera sitcom is targeted at the generation that is going to school now. The first episode starts off with Alexa (Paris Berelc) getting treated for cancer. She isn’t sober as the atmosphere would like to demand. Had the series been set before this time period, say at the stage of diagnosis, the stories would have been full of misery and concern. I’m not saying concern isn’t a big part of the series as it is, but the halo around the phase of recovery is generally less gloomy compared to the time it takes for the idea of cancer and the related issues to sink in.
Katie (Isabel May), from the other half of the title, is the girl who visits the hospital like she’s always known the place, the nurses, and the other patients there. By now, you might have figured that Alexa and Katie are best friends. The show doesn’t dig into their friendship through flashbacks, or throwback pictures, but grand gestures in grander scenes like Katie shaving off her head to present a face of solidarity – as Alexa loses clumps of her hair due to chemotherapy – are what make this sitcom a truly enjoyable one.
When Friends hit the world of American television twenty four years ago, critics and pop culture trackers pointed out that the all-white cast had robbed the series of tales associated with people of other races and colors. This is 2018, and we’ve sitcoms like Fresh Off the Boat, Master of None, and Alexa & Katie, where Asian-Americans are roped in as the headliners. Doesn’t this mean that the television industry in the West is broadening its scales to tell the stories of non-white people?




Alexa & Katie has a traditional TV structure. Even when the situation calls for a group hug and a loud cheer, it ends with a simple voice-over from Alexa. The ubiquitous laugh track tells you how you should consume the show as it, mostly, stays in the bubbly-zone. Throughout the 13-episode scripted series, the prism of optimism shines bright. This has got to do with how the people around Alexa look after her, and how everything turns out to be alright at the end of the day. Her mom (Tiffani Thiessen as Lori), like every other mother on the planet, constantly checks up on her; and her best friend is literally just a window away (Alexa and Katie are neighbours who go to each other’s houses via a tree that connects their bedrooms).
Though, Alexa doesn’t want to be merely defined as the sick girl, she subtly expects the people around her to be with her through thick and thin. 
And, sometimes, she uses her shaved head (an indicator of her illness), to get out of troubles. These themes are also a major part of another hit television series, Speechless, that stars Micah Fowler (he plays JJ DiMeo) as a high-schooler with cerebral palsy. JJ, too, is a naughty teenager with a tendency to pull pranks on his friends and family members. But Alexa and JJ manage to get away with it because of the empathizing lenses they are put under, and, are, instead, respected for their courage and strength despite the odds that are stacked against them.
Sitcoms like Speechless and Alexa & Katie show how the sun rises even during the darkest of times.

Singing of India
","“It was December 6, 1992. I was sitting with my guru, (late) Hafeez Ahmed Khan. He was teaching but he was very tense and he kept the television on. And on the television we saw that the Babri Masjid was being broken. He was very upset. I was speechless,” recalls classical vocalist and science professor Subhendu Ghosh.
He knew that the shocking event in Ayodhya would have violent consequences that would in turn trigger more violence. “I had heard my parents talking about the communal riots during Partition, but that was before I was born. I myself have witnessed the communal riots of ’84. I walked in the camps at that time, and it was terrible…” Realising that “things have come to this stage”, in the charged days following the Babri Masjid demolition, he resolved with like-minded friends — including Professor P.K. Basant, Minoti Chatterjee (now principal of Kamala Nehru College) and several others — to remind his fellow Indians of the examples of secular traditions, individuals and institutions with which the country’s history abounds.
He had also at around the same time come out with an album of ghazals by poets who wrote on political and secular themes, including Faiz and other writers of the 20th Century. “Some of us friends thought that instead of talking of political discourse we should look back into our cultural history,” he explains. “For example it was always being said those days that the culture of India is Hinduism. I have no objection to that, and I know that Hinduism is a culture that developed around the Indus Valley. But it was not being projected like that.”
It was Basant who suggested that Ghosh being a musician, they should focus on the history of North Indian music. “From the post-Dhrupad period you find the musicians were from different religions and communities. The same is true of the poets. And music and poetry go together,” says Ghosh. The programme that came together was performed by Ghosh along with commentary in many venues and cities for several years till 2004. With professional engagements taking him away from his Delhi base, Ghosh has not been able to continue the routine. Now, some 10 years later, he feels the atmosphere of intolerance, polarisation of communities, extreme casteism and violence has brought the nation to the brink of another period of social catastrophe.
This Saturday, with the commentary of P.K. Basant, Ghosh sings songs from various sources, starting with Amir Khusrau and continuing through Kabir and Nanak, Tansen, Bulle Shah, the Bauls and more contemporary voices such as Nasir Kazmi (whose verses are immortalised in Habib Tanvir’s play Agra Bazar), the poets of the anti-imperialist struggle and Tagore.
“We are in a very adverse situation of communal tension. I am trying to revive this feature.” People may disagree with the views of the musical feature’s creators, but they cannot deny that “this is history. These were people who were loved and who loved India,” says Ghosh.
The format is flexible. Ghosh will be accompanied by young musicians. The languages are many — “I am trying to learn Punjabi, Persian,” he mentions — and in the past he has included poets dear to the different regions where he performed. In Nagpur, for instance, his audience asked for Sant Tukaram.
“We apologise we have not been able to include all the poets who have contributed to the secular fabric, otherwise we would have to spend the whole night.” They all represent people who were “rebels” against the inhuman practices that divide and lead to violence, and they were above caste and religious differences, which is why they were “more human and that’s why they were creative geniuses,” says the vocalist, who has set the verses to musical formats like shabad, qawwali, folk and classical.

The performance, “Secular Traditions in Hindustani Poetry and Music”, takes place May 3, Arpana Caur’s Art Gallery, Academy of Fine Arts & Literature 4/6, Siri Fort Institutional Area, New Delhi, 5 p.m. Phone: 011 2649 8070

Glenn Weiss proposes girlfriend in Emmys acceptance speech "," At the 70th Primetime Emmy Awards Glenn Weiss, a director and producer, won the Outstanding Directing for a Variety Special trophy and used acceptance speech to propose his girlfriend, Jan Svendsen.
 He bagged the trophy for helming the 90th Academy Awards earlier this year.
Weiss asked Svendsen to come up to the stage and he began talking about his mother, who he said tragically passed only two weeks ago. 
Svendsen joined him onstage, and he presented her with a ring. 
“Jan, you’re the love of my life, and my mom was right, never let go of your sunshine. You wonder why I don’t like to call you my girlfriend? Because I want to call you my wife. I want to put this ring on your finger in front of all of these people and in front of my mom and your parents watching from above. Will you marry me?” he said.
 She replied with a “yes”.
Later in the ceremony, when “The Americans” star Matthew Rhys claimed the trophy for Lead Actor in a Drama, he quipped that his girlfriend and fellow nominee Keri Russell said, “’If you propose to me, I will punch you clean in the mouth.’”

Sound of the soil
","Music composer Deva, who is widely known as the ambassador of ‘Gaana paatu’ in Tamil cinema, asks how much time a person would take if he were to walk from Srinivasa Puram to Mayor Ramanathan Chettiar Centre (MRC Nagar) situated along the Chennai’s coast. “Will it take 10 minutes?” Deva asks rhetorically and adds, “Yet, it took me 20 years to make the elite enjoy my songs in their weddings.”
After a brief hiatus of four years during which he mainly stuck to writing devotional music, Deva’s voice was recently being heard everywhere, thanks to composer Anirudh Ravichander, who made him sing ‘Open The Tasmac’ in Maan Karate. “The fact that even young audiences are appreciating my work has re-energised me.”
It was just the breakthrough that he needed to once again get into the thick of the action. Now, he is ready with the album of Dummy Tapasu, which is directed by newcomer, Ravi. 
What made him comeback to mainstream movies again? “Ravi narrated an impressive subject, which is a love story set in the slums of Chennai. The situations that he came up with challenged me intellectually: a mother crooning a lullaby and an 80-year-old man singing about his life-experiences. I couldn’t say no to such challenges,” says Deva.  
When Deva ruled the charts , he specialised in ‘Gaana’. How does he plan to stay relevant in today’s music industry when every other composer includes one ‘Gaana’ song in the album? “The industry is today dominated by tech-savvy youngsters and one needs to be aware of modern sounds. I would like to work with fresh voices and experiment in my second innings.”
Looking back, does he feel that ‘Gaana’ artistes have found acceptance? “This genre was always popular with the people, but nobody wanted to feature it in films. I did it because I have grown up listening to such songs. I felt that they needed a bigger audience. I am especially impressed with the lyrics that people like Gaana Bala are writing today. When I did it, there were many who thought that it was too crass. But, the audiences have embraced it now.”
As a mark of recognition, perhaps for having been instrumental in popularising Gaana, he has recently been appointed the chairman of Iyal, Isai, Nadaka Mandram by the Government of Tamil Nadu.
“My mandate is to popularise the traditional arts of Tamil Nadu. It’s keeping me busy,” he says.
Does he feel confident that he can compete with youngsters who are exposed and plugged into music from around the world?
“I have become tech-savvy. I hope to do a few things differently than before. And I am ready to fight it out.”

‘The perfect shot showcases pure, raw, unfiltered emotion and intensity,’ says Shitabh Pillai
"," Walking into a gig, photographer Shitabh Pillai doesn’t know what to expect. But on recceing the site, he starts to read the atmosphere, the crowd, the performers and the venue’s employees — that alone sets the tone for the next few hours of frenzy.
In his early days in 2013, the Chennaiite tried to establish himself by being a one-man marketing machine, explaining, “I used to play drums so that pull towards the music scene was very natural. I went to my first gig where Retrospect were playing and I can recall the utter chaos. So whatever pictures were good to me, I’d send them directly to the bands on Facebook. Concert photography is oriented around social media; the way I click something, it’s to preserve and provide a memory. Initially, from people and bands, I’d gotten a lot more criticism.” The 24 year-old observes not much of a city-based community of this realm of photography, explaining there aren’t a lot of people who’d work gigs for a living. 
Discovered a year ago by music events manager Mayur Jalan at a show in Fubar, Shitabh who’d long been working the gig scene was finally catapulted into a whole new calibre of photography. His parents have been his biggest supporters, for which he is grateful.




The equipment
As expected, Shitabh’s gear is as adapted for the gig scene as he is. Tight spaces, moving subjects and very low lighting is part of the package. “I’m constantly switching lenses. In the beginning, it was a nightmare where I’d shoot from the front and the back of a venue, very typical shots. Over the years, I realised I can do that with one lens instead of two. Right now I’m using an ultra-wide lens where if I stand even an inch away from you, I can capture the walls around you, the crowds around you, everything. That’s really advantageous in a small space.” The self-proclaimed product junkie stays up-to-date with the latest in the tech realms, exploring his social media feeds for new information and new styles. “I particularly am a fan of Jared Polin, but I also keep in mind to explore other types of photography which inspires what I snap at gigs, mimicking intensity.” 
Expect strong contrasts and pops of colour in Shitabh’s photos, creating an edgy blend of grit and glamour.




All about environment
So, besides the right gadgets, what does it take to prosper in such a niche subculture? “Adaptability,” the 24 year-old says promptly, “You need to bloom where you’re planted: you have to consider the crowd’s attitude, the management’s strategies, and so on. There have been managers who have run up to me, held me and prevented me from taking photos at certain angles because of where I was standing. The Moonshine Project, though, is a great venue for my work because the management is encouraging. One time, I had to stand on a table and while I was clicking away, I saw the owner running up to me and then he held me by the legs and, to my surprise, said ‘take the photo!’ The perfect shot for me, which I have achieved a few times thankfully, is one that showcases pure, raw, unfiltered emotion and intensity. I’ve captured a man lick a band member’s guitar, lots of memorable head-banging, and kids watching their parents play too.”




For the most part, there is a symbiotic relationship between concert photographers and the bands they shoot. Shitabh, through his photographs, never portrays an objective angle; his goal is to capture raw emotion — be it in multitudes or in the singular. “Skrat from Chennai are a band which can really get a crowd going, let me enjoy the show and let me capture great moments. That’s something that never happens to me.”
Crowd perception to concert photography has evolved too. Shitabh says when he would go on stage to snap a couple of shots, he would get heckled by the crowd, but now he is pushed to take pictures by the crowd itself. “I used to get really irritated when I first started, I’d reprimand them for being awful to me. I was young then and later I grew to understand they’re not in their senses.”
A year from now Shitabh hopes to take his shows on the road, and go on tour with a band, capturing the varying lifestyles on and off the stage. He’s got the world’s stages in his lens and is excited to contribute what he can to the music world he loves so unconditionally.

Third coming
","Thank God some people don’t change. When most actors, irrespective of their box office draw, decided to walk on haughty air, Govinda was grounded as ever at IIFA. He turned up in a pink coat to launch the first look of his forthcoming film Agni Chakra smiling from ear to ear.
“I have been told that I have a huge fan following in the U.S., something I didn’t realise all these years. Since I am going to start my third innings in the industry, I have decided to start from this platform,” says Govinda, who has once again signed eight-nine films. “I am again playing a cop in the film after a long time but there is a strong comic element as well, as people expect it from a Govinda film.” Govinda is trying to revive his banner Mangal Tara Films with the film.
He refuses to spill the beans on the offer made by Mira Nair for her next film Bengali Detective but confirms that he is playing a football coach in Pahlaj Nihalani’s much delayed Avatar. Nihalani has played a crucial role in his career right from his first hit Ilzam and this time, he seems to have managed to make him lose weight. “This is my wife’s contribution. She has put a full stop on the rich food,” Govinda makes the face of a wretched husband.
Talking about the turn of events, Govinda says, “In between, I tried to run my career in a planned fashion but it didn’t work. It has always been the case with me. Either I have a lot of work or no work at all,” says the actor whose big banner films Run Bhola Run and Banda Yeh Bindas Hai are lying in the cans. “Who would have thought that films of Ashtvinayak and Ravi Chopra would not see the light of the day,” laments the actor who was christened as No.1 star after a series of titles with the tag. He holds his brush with politics responsible for the lull in his career. “Film financiers also have political leanings, you know.”
Recently, Varun Dhawan was seen copying him in Main Tera Hero. Ranveer Singh, who is working with him in Kill Dill has described Govinda as a school of acting and even touched his feet at the Award ceremony. “I am grateful that he thinks that my style is worth copying. It has been a trend. When we were young, the media used to say that we try to copy Dilip Kumar. These days, young actors are working extra hard. I mean on their bodies,” he bursts into laughter. “Most of them have grown up in well-to-do families from the industry and so their real life experiences are limited but I find Ranbir and Ranveer really talented,” says Govinda who is playing Ranbir’s step father in Anurag Basu’s Jagga Jasoos. “It is a well-etched out character and could not be seen just as a fatherly stereotype. I am 50 and am a father of a grownup daughter in real life. So I have no issues playing a father as long as the role is substantial.”
With Kill Dil, he is making his debut with Yashraj Films. “When I was on top, I used to sign eight-nine films in one go and Yash Raj being a top banner wanted the actors to concentrate only on its films. So we could not get together.” He is playing the villain in the film, which is again a rarity for the actor better known for his comic timing. “I too was surprised when Shaad Ali offered me the role. I said I will try for a couple of days and if he or I feel that I am not fitting in we will part our ways. Thankfully, we managed to strike a chord.”
Critics have often dubbed him as a one-emotion actor and perhaps that is the reason that though he forced most Hindi film award juries to create a category of best actor in a comic role but failed to graduate to best actor category. “I am made by the words that begin with ma. Be it my mother or the masses. So I don’t care about the critics,” Govinda gets emotional.

Netflix topples HBO in Emmy nominations, but ‘Game of Thrones’ still rules
"," HBO’s medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones may have led the nominations for the Emmy Awards on Thursday that spanned satire to the supernatural, but streaming service Netflix knocked HBO off its 17-year pedestal as the network with the most nods.
A slew of first time Emmy contenders included Sandra Oh as the first Asian-American lead comedy actress nominee for her role in quirky spy series Killing Eve, and Rachel Brosnahan’s 1950s housewife turned comedian in The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel.
Female-led shows and stories also did well as television continued to lead the way in reflecting social change, while the likes of Donald Glover, Tracee Ellis-Ross, Penelope Cruz, Antonio Banderas, Issa Rae, Regina King, and John Legend headed a racially diverse acting line-up.
Games of Thrones, a worldwide hit, got 22 nods, including for the top prize of best drama series. It was followed by NBC’s sketch show Saturday Night Live and HBO’s sci-fi series Westworld with 21 nominations each, and Hulu’s dystopian vision The Handmaid’s Tale with 20.
Just five years after the launch of its first original series, House of Cards, Netflix ended HBO’s 17-year streak as the most Emmy-nominated network.
Netflix gathered 112 nods for shows that ranged from supernatural drama Stranger Things and British royal show The Crown to female wrestling comedy GLOW, new Western drama Godless and reality makeover series Queer Eye.
HBO, which was recently acquired by wireless carrier AT&T Inc, had 108 nominations, and noted in a statement that it was the eighth year it had gathered 100 nominations or more. NBC shows earned 78 nods.
Netflix campaigned heavily for the Emmys, the highest honours in television, and says it has budgeted $8 billion for programming in 2018.
Stranger Things executive producer and director Shawn Levy said the streaming service was a joy to work with. “They follow our lead and they don’t make us live inside a box either creatively or financially, and that is almost unheard of among networks and movie studios,” Levy told Reuters on Thursday.
The Emmy awards will be handed out in Los Angeles on September 17 hosted by Saturday Night Live cast members Michael Che and Colin Jost.
Game of Thrones will compete for best drama with last year’s Emmy champion, Hulu’s The Handmaid’s Tale, which also won nods for actresses Elisabeth Moss, Alexis Bledel, Samira Wiley, Ann Dowd and Yvonne Strahovski.
Bruce Miller, executive producer of The Handmaid’s Tale, acknowledged that the show’s vision of a theocracy where women are treated as property was hard to watch.
“You are basically writing a show about the way you pray that the world won’t go, and then it starts going that way. We sit around and pray for irrelevance,” Miller told Reuters.
Other best drama contenders include The Crown, NBC’s family drama This Is Us, Cold War spy series The Americans on FX and Westworld.
Game of Thrones was out of the running in 2017 because the show aired later than usual.

Being Kaikeyi...
","Anjana Chandak sits in quiet contemplation waiting for the audience to settle down. Dressed in rich cream silk and wearing lots of jewellery, she appears very much the queen that she will play shortly, Mai Kaikeyi. Ranjana Singhal of Thats Y Food, along with the Coimbatore Metropolitan Ladies Circle 23, has organised an evening that promises to be different. And it is.
“I am Kaikeyi,” begins Anjana and, for the next 45 minutes, she tells us what it means to be arguably the most reviled and hated woman in Indian mythology. “I am one of those whose name crops up in revulsion, rage and contempt. Do you know of anyone who has named their daughter ‘Kaikeyi’?”
Five minutes into her monologue, it becomes obvious that Kaikeyi is a woman wronged. When Dasharatha asks for her hand in marriage, he is already a much-married man and years older than her. “Was it wrong on the part of my father to ask Dasharatha for an assurance that my offspring would be the crown prince? My husband readily gave his word and then reneged on it. I saved my husband’s life in battle and he granted me two wishes. When I asked him to deliver on them, he went back on his word. My husband waited till Bharat was out of Ayodhya to announce Rama’s coronation. Why?” 
Kaikeyi stands there and speaks her mind. She admits that she did not realise the consequences of her actions but asks why history was so merciless to her that it did not give her a chance to repent. There is remorse perhaps, but anger too. “I was wronged and then I was branded as evil personified and forever maligned,” she says. “When my son rejected me, I thought nothing of going to Chitrakoot and, in the presence of hundreds of people, begging Rama to come back.” That is how much she loved her son, but that fact is glossed over.
Kaikeyi doesn’t raise her voice once. Yet the passion, intensity and anguish is there for everyone to see and hear. There is pin drop silence as she finishes saying what she has to say. She has tears in her eyes, but her head is held high. 
Anjana then speaks to the audience as herself. She asks how often we have been guilty of judging people without giving them a chance to defend themselves. “We are always looking for scapegoats when we want to explain something that has gone wrong. Darkness and light are both in us. Sometimes the darkness takes over and we lose our sense of right or wrong; of justice and decency. But then again there is light and we make amends. But Kaikeyi was not given that chance to redeem herself or repent. She was branded and hanged for being a blot on womanhood. Is that just? Mythili Sharan Gupt’s poem Kaikeyi ka Anutap  (The repentance of Kaikeyi), is what inspired the monologue,” she explains.
An interior designer by profession, Ajnana took a leap of faith into art that reflects her spiritual growth. “I did a series of paintings on Varanasi and have just finished a series on Kabir,” she says.
Despite the fact that Hindi is not widely spoken or understood in Coimbatore, the audience (many of whom did not know Hindi) was moved. Anjana’s expressions, tone of voice and emotional delivery told them everything. One young mother said she was determined to tell the story of Ramayana to her child from Kaikeyi’s perspective too. Many of those present said that Anjana had rendered Kaikeyi into a woman of substance; a powerful one who was not afraid to speak her mind or fight for her rights. A much more empowered human being than the ‘ideal mother and wife’ mould a woman is always cast into, whether or not she wants it. “We would rather be a real woman like Kaikeyi than a Nirupa Roy,” was one of the pithy comments.

Podcast review: In The Dark
"," It’s like a scene out of the Netflix sci-fi thriller series Stranger Things. It’s a warm October night in an idyllic country town; three young boys are cycling home from a video rental store, when they are waylaid by a stranger with a gun. He forces two of them into a ditch, grabs the third and drives away. The two boys run home to raise an alarm. Search parties scour the area in a widening circle all night, and several days after, but there is no sign of the missing boy nor any clues of where — and how — he may have been taken. 
The disappearance of Jacob Wetterling from St. Joseph’s, Minnesota, in 1989 was a turning point in public attitudes and legal provisions relating to sex offenders in the U.S., leading to the establishment of a national registry of sex offenders and crimes against children. It was also a case that remained unsolved for close to three decades, despite unprecedented police attention and resources.
In asking what went wrong, investigative journalist Madeleine Baran of the U.S.-based APM Reports unravels a history of poor crime-solving, a lack of accountability, and the damage this inflicted on so many. It is a story painstakingly documented and told in riveting detail.
In the Dark is a true crime podcast with a difference. It begins with the crime but then goes on to interrogate the larger system of law enforcement. The first season, focused on the Wetterling case, researched the law enforcement machinery in Stearns County, Minnesota, trying to understand how the case had been dealt with and the ways in which it changed the fabric of life in the county. 
Through nine episodes, we journey with Baran through the various layers of the story: the event, the search, the media circus, the movement to establish the registry (a primary advocate of which was Jacob’s mother Patty Wetterling), overlooked clues, missed opportunities, collateral damage and finally, the truth of what happened.




Unlike many true crime stories, the focus is not on the morbid details of the crime, but on the social, legal, and scientific mechanisms that can help or hinder its resolution. The solid investigative reporting draws on data (at one point, Baran invokes the Freedom of Information Act to try to get county-level statistics on crime solving), in-depth interviews, and careful scrutiny of information. The series won a Peabody Award in 2017, for being “deftly incisive in telling the human tale” and “full and unrelenting in its attention to broader policy implications.”
Racial tensions
In season two, Baran and her team turn their attention to the trial of Curtis Flowers, an African-American man who, over the past 21 years, has been tried six times for the same crime, and been sentenced to death each time. He has maintained his innocence over the years, just as the prosecutor has maintained guilt. Baran spent a year in Montgomery County, Mississippi, getting to know Flowers’ family, the community, and the racial tensions that inevitably lie beneath the surface of the American South. 
As in season one, each episode goes into a specific aspect of the investigation and the trials, featuring interviews with witnesses and expert commentary on the forensic evidence (I learned, for instance, that the history of lineup-based identification suggests that it is one of the leading causes of wrongful conviction). One episode has Baran and her team sifting through some 8,000 court records in an abandoned warehouse to understand the county’s pattern of policing (a video of this exercise is on the In the Dark website), while APM reporter Will Craft put together a database from countrywide court records to determine the role of race in jury selection (now publicly available on GitHub). 
Unlike season one, however, Flowers’ story has not ended. He is awaiting another trial (and Baran’s reporting has yielded evidence that the defence hopes will exonerate him), even as the prosecutor continues to press for guilt and the death penalty.
True crime is one of the fastest growing and most popular genres in the podcast universe — which is not a surprise, given the TV success of this genre, a reflection of our fascination with the seamier side of life. But In the Dark moves us beyond this fascination, with an intelligent and searching look at the deep-rooted social and often systemic failures that keep justice from being served. It’s also a call-out to the value of the earnest pursuit of local stories, seemingly small, obscure events that affect people not often in the limelight, stories that give us unexpected insights into ourselves and our times.

Funny one-liners, flimsy plot
","A signboard says, “King’s council in session. Eavesdroppers will be dropped from eaves,” and a one-liner from Bean goes like this, “I drank so much, I can’t remember if I drank anything.”
The creator of the nearly three-decade-long-running animated sitcom The Simpsons, Matt Groening, comes to the house of Netflix with Disenchantment, an animated fantasy series that’s set in the medieval period.
Indians might look at the landscape of Dreamland, a fictional town ruled by King Zog, in Disenchantment, and immediately compare it to the grandeur of Baahubali’s Mahishmati. There’s a river that runs through the towns, lots of houses and tiny shops, and a host of bumbling characters in both of them that it makes me wonder if these writers are drawing their materials from a common pool of imagination.
While Mahishmati doesn’t include elfs, demons, griffins, and 12-feet-giants, Groening’s Netflix offering is generously peppered with these forms of living creatures, and it pokes fun at them at every given opportunity. The dark humour, that the creator and his writers dunk their characters in, is reminiscent of another brilliant animated show, BoJack Horseman, where animals, humans, and birds live in a world that doesn’t discriminate the beings based on their appearances.
For a standard set-up such as this, Disenchantment has humour and suspense in unequal measures. The series opens with a gambling princess (Tiabeanie, also called Bean; and voiced by Abbi Jacobson), and we follow her story for quite some time till she is joined by a demon named Luci (voiced by Eric Andre), who’s kind of modelled on the darker side that we all have inside of us – hence the total blackness of the character – and, an elf named Elfo (voiced by Nat Faxon), who has abandoned the jolly land of Elfwood to understand the miseries of the world because he’s always made to sing happy songs.
Groening’s strength seems to be in developing quirky visual gags. A signboard says, “King’s council in session. Eavesdroppers will be dropped from eaves,” and a one-liner from Bean goes like this, “I drank so much, I can’t remember if I drank anything.” These ingenious images and dialogues drive the show forward, but it’s hard to figure out the larger curve it’s going for. The traces it leaves behind, as, when one looks back, is nothing but a series of hilarious memes. If you’re digging for coherence and light knuckle-punches at pop culture in this scripted show, this may bypass your expectations and give you something you hadn’t signed up for.
The various supporting characters are also present to add an extra edge to the sight-and-sound jokes – a three-eyed minister hides his third-eye below the cap he wears, a groom-to-be turns into a pig, and a scientist tortures Elfo to extract his blood to make the elixir of life. And, even here, all the dialogues don’t sparkle with fire and ecstasy since Luci and Elfo pull strings from different corners and it becomes a game of bad-versus-good soon enough.
But the connection between Disenchantment and life in India isn’t just built over the Baahubali Bridge. Princess Bean is strictly not in the mood to get married, and, yet, she wants to be loved by a person who doesn’t see her as a princess. Likewise, there’s a whole truckload of mother sentiment – Bean is raised by a nanny, and the absence of her real mother is a cause of worry – that’s closer to what the Indian writers produce on a regular basis compared to their counterparts in the West. If not for anything remarkable, at least, for these homegrown elements, the series rings a loud bell. 
Groening may not have reached for the stars altogether, nevertheless, he has, certainly, made spacecrafts for future creators to hop on and explore the area of fantasy universes. In that sense, Groening is to American television, and Netflix, what Hayao Miyazaki is to Japanese anime.

Narcos Mexico: Of men and monsters
","The Mexican drug war has claimed more than 1,20,000 lives since 2006 when the country’s military got involved. Back in 1997 — a decade before the Latin American country’s government stepped in to reduce drug-based violence — American producer Eric Newman had just heard about the Cali cartel in horrifying detail. 
“This was eight years after the Berlin Wall had come down and we had effectively vanquished communism,” he remembers. “We had completely ignored and contributed to allowing drug traffic take route. The level of violence in ’97 hadn’t gotten as bad as it eventually did. The events in [the] 80s and early 90s Mexico have contributed to this [situation]. Opioids have killed so many people and it’s truly scary.”
The vast amount of information he unearthed was too expansive for a feature film which Newman initially wanted. “To do it properly, you have to do it in a longer format. You can’t portray humans doing inhuman things and also [simultaneously] humanise them in two hours.” Cut to 2015, and the launch of Narcos, the show, which has Newman as executive producer and showrunner, was responsible for a hike in Netflix subscriptions all over the world. After dissecting Colombian drug kingpin Pablo Escobar’s life and works in two seasons and the gruesome methods of the Cali cartel in the show’s third season, the scene has shifted to the Guadalajara cartel.
In what is essentially a reset for the show, Narcos Mexico chronicles the rise and fall of drug king Félix Gallardo who single-handedly organised the drug business in Mexico. Newman along with the stars of the new season, Diego Luna and Michael Peña were recently in Mumbai to launch the series. “He managed to seat on the table, people who were trying to kill each other,” says Luna who plays Gallardo. “He managed to get them to protect each other and create a system that was more important than any man. He could be engaging and charming and he was like a politician.”
Hot on Gallardo’s heels is American DEA agent Kiki Camarena (Michael Peña) who, though fiercely motivated to do the right thing, has just about everything against him. Though the show focuses on the often excruciating cat and mouse chase between the two, it transcends being a mere thriller about drugs. “Someone once called [our show] pulp non-fiction and I like that very much,” laughs Newman. “Our goal is to take the signature landmark events and we string together a story and sometimes we have to take liberties. Even a documentary has a fair amount of subjectivity but through the courageous work of journalists we have been able to create a pretty reliable narrative.”
 While Newman deftly gives his audience self-inflicted manicures with the horrors rendered by the drug war, he also breaks down why the law enforcement of both countries has failed its people and allowed the opioid industry to flourish. At the heart of Narcos Mexico, is the callousness of Americans to do their job, the extensive political corruption of the Latin American country and the victims that are a result of an insatiable need for money and power. Through ten one-hour-long episodes, the show dissects the origins of how the opioid war has decimated thousands of lives. “I have always been drawn to the interconnected nature of this world,” says Newman talking about how the cocaine trade in London is the same in Mumbai or even Mexico, coming from the same source. Drug addition, according to the producer, should be treated as a health care crisis instead of a law and order one. Pena reiterates, “The news in America is very one-sided…that the cartels have done all this horrible stuff. I think if we stop the demand, then the drugs too will stop.”
While the trio admit that Narcos Mexico is entertainment, they are hopeful of drawing attention to and maybe starting a discourse on drug wars. “The danger is more prevalent now,” emphasises Newman, adding that while we are so busy looking for monsters, we might oversee those formed by the appetite for drugs in America. “It’s as stupid as thinking that a wall is somehow going to solve our problems. We have an obligation to paint these people, not as we wish they were, but how they actually were. Escobar did evil things for sure, but he’s a man just like anyone else and if we deny that then you miss the next one that comes along.”

CBI files charge sheet in Nido Tania case
","Four of the seven persons accused of assaulting Arunachal Pradesh student Nido Tania at a Lajpat Nagar market in South Delhi on January 29 have been charged by the Central Bureau of Investigation with culpable homicide not amounting to murder.
“Following a thorough probe, we have come to the conclusion that the accused assaulted Nido, which led to his death. However, the investigators did not come across any evidence to suggest that the attack was premeditated with an intention to kill. The assault on the victim was apparently the fallout of a sudden fight between him and the accused persons and only a stick was used as a weapon,” said a CBI official.
Accordingly, the CBI on Friday filed a charge sheet against four of the adult accused persons - Pawan, Sunder, Farman and Sunny Uppal - under Sections 304 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder), 342 (wrongful confinement), 201 (destruction of evidence), 34 (common purpose) and relevant provisions of the SC/ST Prevention of Atrocities Act.
Proceedings against the three other juvenile accused would be initiated in the Juvenile Justice Board.
According to Nido’s family, the incident took place after he approached a shopkeeper for directions to his friend’s house and was mocked by the bystanders over his hair style. In a fit of rage, Nido - son of a Congress MLA - allegedly smashed the glass counter of the shop, which led to a heated exchange and then the accused persons assaulted him. Nido died the next day. The post-mortem report revealed that he died due to internal injuries in the brain and lungs.
The incident triggered a >series of protests by the victim’s friends and members of the North Eastern communities living in the Capital. It also drew sharp reactions from political parties and human rights organisations.
The victim’s relatives alleged that after the police were called in to intervene, they took him to the police station and dropped him again at the scene of crime, following which he was again assaulted. However, the police denied the charges stating that he was not assaulted a second time.
The case was >transferred to the CBI after Nido’s parents met Union Home Minister Sushilkumar Shinde and Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi in February. The Delhi Police had by then arrested the four adult accused and apprehended two of the juveniles for suspected involvement in the case.

TRS confident of near sweep in north ‘T’
","After relaxing at his farmhouse for five days after hectic campaigning, Telangana Rashtra Samithi president K. Chandrasekhar Rao returned to the city on Sunday evening. He is expected to meet party candidates and evaluate their winning chances.
The TRS chief announced that the party’s executive will meet on May 9 wherein all the candidates who contested the polls to the Assembly and Parliament seats will be asked to be present.
Except visiting his native Chintamadaka village near Siddipet to cast his vote on the polling day, Mr. Rao was totally confined to the farmhouse at Gajwel ever since he addressed his last election rally at nearby Wargal village on April 28. Party sources said he did not even carry out his favourite farming activity during the period as he preferred rest because he was too tired having campaigned in 107 out of 119 Assembly constituencies for two weeks.
A TRS contestant said the party is riding on a “tremendous” wave and added that it would be a near sweep in north Telangana. Sources said that KCR has decided to give a serious thought to government formation and other related issues only after declaration of the election results.
The TRS has fancied its chances of forming a government in Telangana as the single largest party, expecting to cross the 60-seat mark in the Assembly. But, inputs from various sources suggest the party could get anywhere between 55 to 60 seats and the Congress up to 35. The TDP–BJP combine could garner 12 seats and the MIM seven to eight. Another four to five seats will be shared by CPI, CPI(M) and YSR Congress. In the Lok Sabha elections , both TRS and Congress could be on an even keel.
An MP aspirant from TRS told The Hindu that the party would win 47 to 50 Assembly seats in the north Telangana districts of Adilabad, Nizamabad, Medak, Karimnagar and Warangal. It is set to come up trumps in eight seats in Mahabubnagar and four apiece in Nalgonda and Hyderabad–Ranga Reddy districts, he pointed out.
He said his party would win Adilabad, Karimnagar, Warangal, Nizamabad, Zaheerabad, Medak, Chevella, Nagarkurnool, Nalgonda and Bhongir Lok Sabha constituencies. It would be a close contest between TRS and BJP in Mahabubnagar where Congress stalwart S. Jaipal Reddy is likely to be relegated to the third spot, he added.

Kerala faces court ire on Bevco facilities
","Even as the Kerala State Beverages Corporation (Bevco) on Friday informed the Kerala High Court that steps were being initiated to provide more facilities at its liquor outlets, Justice Alexander Thomas expressed displeasure over the government failure to respond to the court suggestion for a commission to look into the facilities available at the outlets.
Meanwhile, on another petition seeking to implement the M. Ramachandran Commission report on the liquor policy, the judge directed the State government to file a statement detailing the steps taken to implement the recommendations. The petition was filed by High Court lawyer Basil Attipetty.
Justice Alexander Thomas wondered why the government was meting out step-motherly treatment to public corporations such as Bevco.
It seemed to have turned a blind eye to improving the facilities for consumers at these outlets. The court orally pointed out that just as the government efforts for metro rail for solving transport woes in Kochi, the government could take a cue from the Delhi government policy and emulate the system of distribution of liquor in New Delhi. (In Delhi, four public corporations are engaged in retail trade of liquor. Private entrepreneurs are also allowed to run retail outlets in Delhi. The Delhi government has also granted licence for retail sale of beer and mixed alcoholic beverages through departmental stores).
The court made the oral observations when a petition by Bevco challenging the decision of the Sasthamcotta panchayat directing it to close down an outlet at Bharanikkavu came up for hearing.
Bevco counsel C.S. Ajith Prakash submitted that the corporation had initiated steps to open more outlets depending on the availability of space. In fact, more than one counter was functioning at all outlets which had high sales turnover. It also proposed to run outlets in supermarkets where people could take bottles of their choice. However, sufficient security personnel needed to be provided at these counters. He also submitted that the corporation was running as many as 338 outlets, of which, 331 were functioning from rented buildings. As part of the corporation’s initiative to improve facilities, it would construct shelters over its counters .
Last time, when the petition came up for hearing, the court had observed that long queues were seen in front of the outlets, often causing public nuisance.

T-Congress leaders’ confidence dips after polling
","The confidence levels among Congress leaders in Telangana about forming the first government in the new State on their own has gone down after they made a preliminary analysis of the polling pattern across the region on Thursday.
An indication to that effect was given to AICC general secretary Digvijaya Singh subtly that the party may not be able to come to power on its own strength going by the polling trends.
TPCC president Ponnala Lakshmaiah, who called on Mr. Singh on Thursday, is believed to have given the feedback that the party might cross the 50-seat mark, short by 10 to touch the magic figure of 60 to form the first government in Telangana with simple majority.
Sources said the two leaders have analysed district-wise polling and came to the conclusion that it would be neck and neck race between the Congress and TRS in several constituencies. “After taking feedback from the district Congress leaders, the TPCC chief told Mr. Singh that Congress is confident of winning at least 54 Assembly and eight Lok Sabha seats,” a senior Congress leader told The Hindu.
The Congress chief told Mr. Singh that the TRS tally would not cross 40 with its candidates faring well only in North Telangana. He is also understood to have dismissed the claims of TRS chief K.Chandrasekhar Rao that TRS would sweep the polls.
The TPCC leadership has also analysed that the TDP-BJP combine is set to make some gains in the twin cities, Ranga Reddy and Mahabubnagar districts. Further, the TPCC president informed Mr. Singh that BJP might spring a surprise in Nizamabad, Warangal and Mahabubnagar districts, party sources said.
District-wise information gathered by the TPCC indicate that it may not be easy going for bigwigs such as former Deputy Chief Minister C. Damodar Raj Narasimha, the TPCC chief, working president N. Uttam Kumar Reddy, former Ministers – K. Jana Reddy, D. Sridhar Babu, J.Geetha Reddy, V. Sunitha Laxma Reddy, Baswaraj Saraiah and former PCC president D. Srinivas.
Officials engaged in the polling exercise in a few South Telangana districts also indicated that several big names may have tough time in retaining their seats. “Mood of the electorate on Wednesday was pointing towards such upheavals”, a polling official in Nalgonda district stated.
The Congress would be left with two options if the mandate is fractured. “The party may seek support of MIM and other friendly parties like CPI, if its gets past 50 seats, to form the government. In case its tally is on a par with TRS with 40 to 45 apiece, the post-poll alliance between the two is a certainty”, party sources pointed out.
A senior Congress leader maintained that the TRS would woo MIM and CPI if it manages to win over 50 seats to form the government, instead of banking on Congress.

Radhakrishnan and Pinaki Chandra Misra said, “Forcing a bull and keeping it in the waiting area for hours and subjecting it to the scorching sun is not for the animal’s well-being. Forcing and pulling the bull by a nose rope into the narrow, closed enclosure or ‘vadi vassal’ (entry point), subjecting it to all forms of torture, fear, pain and suffering by forcing it to go the arena and also over-powering it in the arena by bull tamers, are not for the well-being of the animal.”
The Bench said the Animal Welfare Board of India had given details on the manner in which the bull fight was conducted across Tamil Nadu. It said the torture and cruelty meted out to the bulls was unimaginable. “Being dumb and helpless, they suffer in silence. We notice that the situation is the same in Maharashtra too.”

Teaching teachers laws on child protection and rights
","What place do the nuances of law have in the classrooms? With cases of corporal punishment and child abuse being reported in schools, teachers on Monday took stock of the situation beyond the syllabus.
A State-level teachers’ sensitisation programme on child rights and child protection, organised on Monday by the Directorate of School Education and the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) recommended that teachers become conversant with laws that govern rights of the children.
The initiative was to bring teachers and principals of schools up-to-date on two principal laws- the Protection of Children from Sexual Offence (POCSO) 2013 and section 17 of the Right to Free and Compulsory Education Act (RTE) which deals with ‘physical punishment or mental harassment,’ said E. Vallavan, Director, School Education.
The NCPCR, formed in 2007, monitors the implementation of the RTE and POCSO Acts. But teachers have a role in ensuring child rights, according to Asheem Srivastav, member-secretary, NCPCR.
“It is important for every person who is implementing the law at the ground level to be conversant with the nitty-gritty of the Acts,” he said, explaining the need for sensitisation.
The debate on child rights is gaining weight in the international arena. India is a signatory to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.
Noting that the Education Department had issued a “strict circular” to government and private schools on corporal punishment, Mr. Vallavan added that the scenario in schools has changed.
“Two out of three cases are of children being subjected to mental harassment. It is not to say that physical punishment is not upsetting, but mental harassment can have a more severe impact on a child.”
This is more in the case when the children hail from single-parent families or suffering from a disability or disorder including dyslexia and other learning disabilities.
Encouraging teachers to adopt a friendly approach to students, Mr. Vallavan said awareness of laws can create a shift in attitude towards children.
Principals of schools in the Union Territory have received training in psychological handling of children, under the aegis of the Indian School Pyschology Association, he added.
Teachers must realise that the future GDP and prosperity of the country rests with children, noted Mr. Srivastav.
Panel discussions and sessions on child abuse and child rights were part of the event.

Prove my visit, I will quit: Ahmed Patel to Modi
","For the second time this week, Congress president Sonia Gandhi’s political secretary Ahmed Patel offered to resign on Friday, this time if Narendra Modi provided proof of his (Patel) visiting his house or office as the BJP prime ministerial candidate claimed in an >interview to Doordarshan News.
Mr. Modi said he once had a close relationship with Mr. Patel, who used to be known as “Babubhai,” and they even shared meals.
But rubbishing the claims as a “political stunt,” Mr. Patel said these were aimed at creating confusion during the fag end of the elections.
“I will quit public life if he provides proof of my visiting his house, office or taking any favour from him.”
Mr. Patel recalled only one instance, in the early 1980s, of Mr. Modi visiting his house for a meal.
Mr. Modi’s claim was that they used to speak frequently but all that had stopped and Mr. Patel no longer took his calls.
The bits on Mr. Patel were edited out, as were Mr. Modi’s comments on Ms. Gandhi’s daughter, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, of the interview aired on Doordarshan News on Sunday.
Mr. Modi’s office released the full 54-minute interview on Thursday night in a bid to put the lid on the controversy.
In the wake of the controversy, Prasar Bharati Chief Executive Officer Jawahar Sircar has reportedly written to the Board, detailing the circumstances surrounding the interview. He is said to have suggested that such a situation would not have arisen had professionals been brought in at all levels.
Even as the entire interview became available on YouTube, Doordarshan maintained that the portions on Mr. Patel and Ms. Vadra were cut, but not in a bid to be on the right side of the current dispensation.
“The interview was to go in a 30-minute slot and we had about double that duration of recording. Some portions had to be edited and we took out those that did not seem relevant while retaining a lot that was critical of the current government,’’ said Doordarshan News officials.
Meanwhile, Doordarshan anchor Ashok Shrivastav, replying to queries whether his interview was censored on instructions from the top, said he would “answer all questions and queries at the appropriate time.”

Mafia calling the shots in U.P.: Mayawati
","Alleging total collapse of the law and order machinery under Samajwadi Party rule in Uttar Pradesh, BSP supremo Mayawati on Friday said the Akhilesh Yadav government was playing into the hands of the mafia and underworld dons.
“Law and order has touched an all time low in Uttar Pradesh with mafia and underworld dons calling the shots under the SP rule,” she said at a rally here in support of BSP nominee from Haridwar Haji Islam.
Citing spurt in crime against Dalits under the SP rule, she said when she was the Chief Minister the Dalits felt safe and those who committed crimes against them were put behind the bars.
Claiming there was no riot during her rule in the State, she said riots occurred in Uttar Pradesh not long after the SP took over the reigns of power.
The BSP supremo said she distributed tickets in these elections keeping the interest of Sarva Samaj in mind and if the Dalit and Muslim votes went collectively to the BSP candidate “no force can stop him from winning”.
Giving reasons for the recent suspension of Uttarakhand Cabinet Minister Surendra Rakesh and MLA Haridas from the BSP, she said action was taken against them as they could not work in the interest of the Dalits despite holding a position of power.
She also made it clear that they would not be given ticket to contest the next Assembly polls in Uttarakhand.

Reject BJP-TDP alliance, YSRC: Medha
","Social activist Medha Patkar on Saturday termed BJP-TDP alliance ‘unholy’ and YSR Congress as ‘corrupt and criminal’ and appealed to the voters of Seemandhra to reject them.
Speaking to reporters after garlanding the statue of Mahatma Gandhi near GVMC, Ms. Patkar, who is in fray for Mumbai North East Lok Sabha seat, had a dig at the National Democratic Alliance’s prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi and YSRC president Y.S. Jaganmohan Reddy.
She said Mr. Modi’s high-voltage election propaganda was being funded by corporates like Adanis and alleged that even the Ambani brothers were moving close to him. “Mr. Modi stands for crony capitalism,” she said.
Describing TDP president N. Chandrababu Naidu as an ‘opportunist,’ she said he used to be the blue-eyed boy of the World Bank during his nine-year term as the Chief Minister.
Ms. Patkar said Mr. Jaganmohan Reddy was a land-grabber and known for indulging in several corrupt deals when his father late Rajasekhara Reddy was the Chief Minister.
She said AAP had fielded candidates without money and muscle power as it wanted to live up to the expectation of common man. “We want to bring some difference to the country’s polity by cleansing the system,” she said before visiting some slums in the city.
Ms. Patkar promised to regularise slums, scrap Petroleum, Chemical and Petrochemical Investment Region (PCPIR) between Visakhapatnam and Kakinada and take steps to contain industrial pollution in and around the city.

Quarrying, vandalism ruin megalithic site
","Reaching the archaeologically-significant megalithic burial site near Chapparkallu in Devanahalli, about 55 km from Bangalore, is not easy as the area is surrounded by quarries, with the earthmovers throwing up dust. But once there, you see a site, dating back to 8 B.C. to 6 B.C, and protected by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) since 1951, thoroughly vandalised.
The area, better known for supplying granite blocks to Bangalore, is part of an ancient civilisation that existed in the Arkavati basin.
A majority of the subterranean rectangular burial chambers (cists) and Cairn Circle in a eucalyptus grove on a hillock, spread across 6.5 acres of government land, have fallen prey to treasure hunters, while several others have been damaged from quarrying. Pottery and iron fragments of that period are still seen scattered in the opened cists.
The ASI has dashed off letters to the Department of Mines and Geology and the Department of Kannada and Culture to prohibit quarrying and protect the few burial chambers that remain. It has also sent its field officers to assess the damage and take steps to prevent further ruin.
“The destruction of the burial site has been taking place systematically over the years, and now almost all the 50 graves have been vandalised,” said a village resident of Chapparkallu. Quarrying has been under way for over a decade now, he added. “After the ASI realised that the site was being vandalised, they put up boards stating it is protected. But, it hasn’t helped much,” he said, adding that most of the chambers were prised opened in the last five years.
What is even more shocking is that a road has been laid over some burial chambers to enable heavy vehicles to pass through. Meanwhile, an ASI source said: “Some of the burial chambers were vandalised even before it came under ASI protection. The geomorphology of the site, that had remained intact for centuries, started changing suddenly due to urbanisation. However, the site will be fenced to prevent further damage.”

HC rejects Adarsh Society plea opposing MoD title suit
","The Bombay High Court on Friday rejected an application made by scam-tainted Adarsh Housing Society opposing the title suit filed by the Union Ministry of Defence claiming ownership on the land in South Mumbai where the plush building stands.
The Defence Ministry had in December 2012 filed a title suit in the High Court stating that the land in Colaba where the 31—storey Adarsh building is constructed belongs to them (Defence Ministry) and possession should be handed back to them.
The Defence Ministry alleged that the Adarsh building has been constructed “illegally and unlawfully”. It further states that MoD is the sole owner of the land and that the land was transferred to Adarsh Society by fraud, collusion and connivance on the part of the society members, ministers and bureaucrats of the state government.
The Society had, however, filed an application opposing the title suit on the ground that only the Defence Estate Officer (DEO) can file title suits on behalf of the Defence Ministry.
The Society relied on an order passed by the General Governor Council and the Government of India in 1930.
“The Society also relied on the military land manual which says that only the defence estate officer is authorised to file and conduct a title suit in court on behalf of the Ministry of Defence,” Society lawyer Saket Mone from Vidhi law firm argued.
The Defence Ministry refuted this and argued that the Ministry is empowered to file and conduct title suits.
Justice Roshan Dalvi on Friday heard arguments from both sides and rejected the Society’s application.
Meanwhile, in a related development, a division bench of Justices P V Hardas and A S Gadkari refused to hear a public interest litigation filed by former journalist Ketan Tirodkar alleging that the CBI has failed to arraign as accused, the family members of several politicians who own flats in the society under benami names.

BJP has ‘committed suicide’ in Andhra Pradesh: TRS
","Upset with the BJP for forging an electoral alliance with TDP in Telangana and Seemandhra, Telangana Rashtra Samiti on Friday said the saffron party had “committed suicide” in Andhra Pradesh.
“Narendra Modi has shot himself in the foot in Andhra Pradesh by aligning with a man called (N) Chandrababu Naidu, who is a discredited leader. BJP and Narendra Modi have committed suicide in Andhra Pradesh. Only Lord Rama can save them,” TRS party leader and MLA K T Rama Rao said.
On post-poll alliance, Mr Rao, son of TRS supremo K Chandrasekhar Rao, said the choice for it is not essentially limited to NDA and UPA government, indicating that it may sail with the third front.
“We do see the possibility of us winning a significant number of Lok Sabha seats as well which should allow us to play a key role in Delhi (formation of government),” Mr Rao said.
Asked if the TRS would support UPA or NDA, he said he does not think it’s a bipolar country.
“I don’t see through the prism of bipolar political system. I don’t think the choice is essentially between the two coalitions that you mentioned. I don’t think the choice is only between UPA and NDA,” he said.
Realignment and lot of changes would happen post-poll, he said.
“No matter what happens, TRS will play a crucial role (in the formation of the government),” he claimed.
On whether TRS is betting on third front to come to power, KTR said: “I am not betting on third front or fourth front. Anything could happen. We have our options open.
Whatever is in the interest of Telangana, definitely we will do that.”
TRS has fought in all the 119 Assembly and 17 Lok Sabha constituencies in Telangana on its own.

Urging women in the IT sector to ‘take charge’
","“It is important that women are networked. This catharsis of sharing and learning can be a good enabling agent,” said Jayanti Ravi, commissioner, higher education, Government of Gujarat, speaking at the eighth anniversary celebrations of Empowering Women in IT (eWIT) on Monday.
The theme for the afternoon was to encourage more women in the industry to ‘ascend and take charge’. eWIT, run by women IT professionals, was founded in 2006 as a platform to represent, discuss and voice challenges faced by women in the IT industry and to facilitate growth of women in the industry.
They have 20 large companies as members, apart from individual members and smaller companies, according to them.
“Though there are many women in IT companies, not many are found in leadership positions. Good family support and infrastructural support can make a huge difference,” said Rama Sivaraman, president, eWIT, and chief delivery assurance officer, Polaris.
Sujith Kumar, location HR lead, Infosys, Chennai, said that working couples setting goals collectively could solve a lot of problems. He urged women to explore positions that are off the beaten track. “Close to 24 per cent IT companies do not have technology architects who are women,” he said.
C.N. Ram, co-founder, Rural Shores, noted that “male bastions are fast crumbling”, and raised a question on the response to the change.

Congress desperation showing in ‘stoop-gate’: BJP
","Asserting that it had nothing to fear, the BJP on Friday lashed out at the Congress over the 'snoopgate' probe issue, accusing it of “stooping low” in “desperation” and said the next government would be within its rights to review the “malafide” last—minute decision.
As the UPA Government declared that a judicial commission to probe ‘snoopgate’ allegedly involving Narendra Modi will be in place before the Lok Sabha poll process comes to an end on May 16, the BJP accused the Congress of “deliberately” diverting the attention of the people from the real issues of unemployment, price rise and corruption.
“They are trying desperately to get at least one Judge to agree to head the ‘snoopgate’ commission. I doubt very much if any of these moves is likely to succeed. Even if it did, the future government would be well within its legitimate rights to review such a malafide last—minute decision of the UPA,” BJP leader Arun Jaitley said.
BJP leader Ravi Shankar Prasad said, “It is not snoopgate, it is stoop-gate. The Home Minister of India is stooping to this level. I can see the desperation.... No judge is willing to inquire into it, but they are insisting. We don’t fear you.”
He wondered if the ruling party was trying to “pressurise” the judiciary in appointing a judge to the snoopgate commission.
Prasad said while his party had no fear about the snoopgate probe, “I am concerned about the diginity of the office of a judge.”
“Are you going to pressurise the judiciary for your collateral, extraneous purposes. This is utter desperation, nothing else,” he said.
“We are fighting the election on the issue of growth, on the issues of price rise, unemployment, on stinking corruption. They have no response to that and therefore deliberate diversion is being done on the so—called snoopgate. Kapil Sibal and Sushilkumar Shinde are stooping to this level,"".
He said, ""No judge is willing to inquire into it, but they are insisting, when after 10 days a new government is going to be in power led by Narendra Modi. This is desperation, helplessness, irritation of the Congress and I can understand it because the people are not giving them any indulgence during their campaign and Congress is going to have its lowest ever performance,” he said.

“The murderous face of the RSS was seen by the country during the Gujarat riots of 2002 and the demolition of the Babri Masjid,” he said while inaugurating a dharna organised by the DYFI at the Press Club Maidan here on Saturday to protest against the murder of DYFI leader Sreeraj, allegedly by RSS activists, at Nedumankavu last month.
Mr. Achuthanandan said that neither the Congress not the United Democratic Front government was doing anything to counter the “reign of terror being unleashed by the RSS.” The government seemed to be promoting such activities, he said. Hence the police were lax in properly investigating murder cases in which RSS activists were involved.
He said that the RSS had murdered hundreds of CPI(M) and other Left activists in the State since the 1970s. He called upon people to come forward and jointly oppose the RSS.
Addressing mediapersons at the Press Club, DYFI State president T.V. Rajesh and secretary M.

Minister takes BBMP to task over garbage clearance
","Transport Minister Ramalinga Reddy, who is also the district-in-charge Minister for Bangalore, cracked the whip on BBMP officials for mismanagement of solid waste disposal. Chairing a review meeting on Monday, Mr. Reddy gave them a fortnight to clear garbage in the city or face suspension.
Joint Commissioners of eight zones of the BBMP, chief engineers and senior officials participated in the meeting.
Speaking to The Hindu after the meeting, Mr. Reddy said two issues were being dealt with as top priority: roads and garbage. “While road works have been going on, garbage clearance and disposal has not been happening effectively. Bills in the name of waste management are being generated, but no work seems to be happening,” he said.
Mr. Reddy also raised the issue of implementation of the ban on plastic less than 40 microns. “We have observed that plastic forms more than 50 per cent of the garbage. Plastic below 40 microns are still being used. I have directed officials to close the factories of manufacturers, stop the inflow of such plastic from outside Karnataka and cancel licence of malls or shops that are giving out the banned variety of plastic,” he said.
The Minister is also said to have taken to task officials who have been using elections as an excuse to not do their duties. Officials said the Minister also directed the health and engineering departments to coordinate regarding waste segregation.
The matter of BVG, the company entrusted with waste management in Yelahanka zone, cropped up during the meeting. Though the civic agency paid Rs. 24 crore to the company, it later slapped a fine of Rs. 1.25 crore for not doing the work well. However, BVG is said to have got a stay order due to which the civic body cannot call off the contract, officials informed the Minister.

‘Apprehensive’ T-Cong leaders set eyes on CM post
","Notwithstanding the not-so-encouraging feedback from the field about prospects of the Congress in the April 30 polls in Telangana, chief ministerial aspirants began to take stock of the polling trends and garner the support of partymen.
On record, all the top Congress leaders claim that victory over the TRS is a foregone conclusion. But during in-camera meetings, these leaders express fears that the going is not smooth. Information gathered from the 119 Assembly and 17 Lok Sabha constituencies has clearly indicated that it would be a close fight between the Congress and the TRS in several constituencies.
Not sure about their fate, seniors like Telangana PCC president Ponnala Lakshmaiah, former PCC chief D. Srinivas, former Deputy Chief Minister C. Damodar Raj Narasimha and former Minister K. Jana Reddy are busy making their own calculations about the chances of becoming the Chief Minister if the party comes to power.
A series of developments and the statements made by these leaders clearly indicate their keenness to be at the helm of affairs in Telangana State. The TPCC chief while exuding confidence about Congress performance maintains that high command would certainly consider him for the Chief Minister’s post because if the party is able to win a majority of the seats, he would get credit for the same.
Mr. Srinivas on Sunday maintained that he was not in the race for the top post but was quick to add that his experience as PCC president during the 2004 and 2009 elections would stand him in good stead for the Chief Minister’s post. He also brought in the BC angle claiming that high command would back a leader from the weaker sections.
Mr. Jana Reddy, a serious contender for the CM’s post, was closeted with Congress candidates at a meeting on Sunday. Sources said Mr. Reddy tried to take stock of the polling to arrive at the number of seats the party could win. He is believed to have listed out the names of the Congress candidates who stood chances of scraping through.
It is understood that he is slowly but carefully nursing the possible candidates with a fair chance of winning to support him in case there is a race for the top post. Mr. Reddy without talking about his aspirations said the Congress would comfortably form the government. He said the TRS was indulging in mind games to demoralise the Congress workers.
A senior TPCC functionary said that a section of the leaders had worked for the defeat of certain bigwigs and, in turn, chart their own path smoother for the top post.

","The Communist Party of India (Marxist) will hold indefinite protests in Bangalore and Udupi from Monday against the practice of ‘pankti bedha’ (separate seating arrangements for Brahmins and non-Brahmins for meals) at Krishna Math in Udupi.
CPI(M) State secretary G.V. Sriram Reddy told presspersons here on Friday that a 24-hour dharna would be held in all other districts on Monday.
He criticised the government for not taking a firm stand on the “discriminatory practice” and banning it.
Mr. Reddy said they had expected Chief Minister Siddaramaiah to ban practices such as ‘made snana’ and ‘pankti bedha’, but it had not happened.
On the incident at Tanikodu check-post, near Sringeri, where a youth from Mangalore was shot dead allegedly by Anti-Naxal Force (ANF) personnel, Mr. Reddy said the Bharatiya Janata Party’s reaction to the incident “exposes their true colours.”
He said the BJP had sought withdrawal of compensation paid to the family of the youth, Kabir (24), and cases filed against the ANF constable who had allegedly shot him. He said there was a clear design to turn the case against the youth and make him out to be a criminal. The Congress government should not buckle under pressure, he said.

Venkaiah sure of clear majority for NDA
","Emphasising that BJP has always been clear on its stand on Telangana, senior party leader M. Venkaiah Naidu said the other parties have kept quiet in Parliament and only BJP saw to it that the interests of Seemandhra are protected.
Addressing a press conference here on Sunday, he shot off questions to YSRC countering its charge that Congress, BJP and TDP were responsible for bifurcation.
He said in 2004 Congress tied up with TRS, and TRS was a coalition partner in the governments of Congress at the Centre and the State, Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy had sent a delegation of 40 MLAs to the then NDA government to create Telangana and later in the Assembly he had committed himself to the creation of Telangana and YSRC also stated that the State should be divided as per Article 3.
Lambasting YSRC, Mr. Naidu said, “we are not the accused, you’re the accused.”
In the post-election scenario, KCR and Congress would come together in Telangana, the BJP leader said citing the Congress extending support to Aam Aadmi Party in New Delhi. On Y. S. Jagamohan Reddy’s reported statement that he would extend to any government at the Centre, he said, “We are getting clear majority. We do not need anybody’s support.”
Where is the sentiment?” he asked answering a question on why this election would be fought on development plank since all the poll battles since 1983 centred on emotion or welfare measures. However, everybody was concerned about development since it was centred round Hyderabad till now.
He wanted the Election Commission to work better to further check the distribution of money and cheap liquor and to act against the Central Minister who described BJP prime ministerial nominee as “monster.”
Andhra Pradesh BJP president and party Lok Sabha nominee K. Haribabu, party leaders D.V. Subba Rao, Bandaru Ranga Mohana Rao and Avinash Kohli were present.
B. V. Rama Rao joined BJP at the meeting.

Congress will pay heavy price for dividing AP: Jairam
","Union Minister for Rural Development Jairam Ramesh on Sunday said that the expert committee constituted by the Union Ministry of Home Affairs on selection of a location to create capital for Andhra Pradesh would come out with its report on September 30.
Mr. Ramesh said at a media conference here that he had received representations from local Congress activists requesting to locate the State capital somewhere between Vijayawada and Eluru. Party workers favoured any location close to Gannavaram, one of the three airports identified for upgradation with an international status in the residuary State, for building the capital city, he said.
Mr. Ramesh admitted that the Congress party would pay a heavy price in the Seemandhra region for dividing the State. “I agree that our party is passing through a difficult phase and, after all, the difficulty is self-induced,” he told the media. He blamed the party leadership from the region for allegedly failing to take people on board in fulfilment of its commitment of a separate Telangana State.
The Congress might be lying low for the time being. But one could construe that it’s out, he said while replying to a question. In the same breath, he added: “One cannot write off the Congress in Seemandhra as the bifurcation process has to be carried out smoothly and peacefully.” It would be violent in the absence of the Congress because of the ‘trigger-happy’ regional satraps like K. Chandrasekhar Rao, N. Chandrababu Naidu and Y.S. Jaganmohan Reddy, he said.
Mr. Ramesh, however, defended the bifurcation, saying it came as a blessing in disguise for the residuary State in the form of a special development package as mentioned in the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act. Then came the national status for the Indira Sagar Project and the Krishna River Board, an independent authority to provide equal opportunity to both Telangana and Seemandhra regions in distribution of river waters, as part of the package, he said.

Bar licence: UDF in for a long haul
","It is going to be a long haul for the United Democratic Front (UDF) leadership to arrive at a fair decision on the issue of renewing liquor bar licences mainly because most of the leaders of the constituent parties are reluctant to get involved in the process.
After reaching nowhere in their attempts to resolve their differences, Chief Minister Oommen Chandy, Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee president V.M. Sudheeran and Home Minister Ramesh Chennithala had decided to elevate the status of their dialogues to the UDF level by getting the leaders of constituent parties involved.
However, several senior leaders would prefer to leave it to the Congress to sort out the issue since the party was handling the Excise portfolio.
Mr. Sudheeran has reiterated his stand against the renewal of bar licences without a proper evaluation.

Main issue

The main issue, according to him, is the proliferation of liquor dens and the easy availability of liquor, which is a major social evil in Kerala. Instead of merely talking tall about prohibition, he has been goading his party workers to take a proactive stance towards the issue.
On his part, he promptly issued notices to all functionaries of the Congress, especially in the local bodies ruled by the Congress-led UDF, not to give ‘no objection certificates’ for opening new bars.
He has also got the KPCC executive to agree to an anti-liquor campaign, beginning with a drive within the government by getting various departments come on a common platform for this purpose.
His take on the issue is that the Congress should take an affirmative stand and take the initiative against proliferation of liquor outlets.

CM’s concerns

As far as the Chief Minister and Excise Minister K. Babu are concerned, they fully share the concerns of Mr. Sudheeran, but their perspectives are conditioned by their official positions.
Mr. Chandy even went to the extent of stating that the government would not hesitate to forgo revenue from liquor. At the same time, he made it clear that since he was the head of administration, he would have to consider several legal and administrative aspects before taking a decision.

UDF policy

Ever since returning to office in 2011, the UDF’s liquor policy has been aimed at restricting bar licences to higher categories, with the result that only five-star hotels are now eligible for licence in the third year of UDF reign.
The legal issues apart, the government would also have to ensure availability of good quality liquor, without letting the grey market to get the upper hand from the gaps in the trade.
Through discussions, the Congress leaders were able to defuse the air of confrontation that had been gradually emerging on the bar licence issue.
As it turned out, they appeared to be in agreement in belling the cat, but seemed not sure about how to go about it.
Mr. Sudheeran said the first of the consultations with the UDF leaders would be held most probably on Wednesday.
The IUML’s stand on liquor is well known, with its religious connotation. The Kerala Congress (M) would go along with whatever decision the Congress might take, but party leaders said that it would be only fair to give a chance for these bars to improve their standards within a stipulated time, as suggested by the Ramachandaran committee.

Will appoint judge to probe ‘snoopgate’ by May 16: Shinde
","Union Home Minister Sushilkumar Shinde sparked a controversy on Friday when he announced that the government would appoint a judge before May 16, the day counting of votes in the Lok Sabha polls is taken up, to head the judicial commission set up to investigate the “snoopgate.”
In December, the UPA government had announced that a panel would be set up to investigate the charges of snooping on a woman by government agencies in Gujarat, allegedly at the behest of their political masters. But the name of the judge to head the panel has not been announced to date.
Now, soon after Mr. Shinde’s announcement at a press conference in Shimla, the BJP asserted that the government had no right to appoint a judge in the middle of elections and said the new government would be well within its rights to “review such a mala fide decision.”
The Home Minister maintained that the decision to appoint a commission of inquiry was taken well before the announcement of the general elections on March 5.
“We will soon appoint the judge....before May 16,” he said adding that “the way the Gujarat Chief Minister has snooped on a woman, I am really worried what will happen to women of the country if he becomes the PM.”
BJP leader Arun Jaitley said the UPA was getting “desperate” as it had no plank to fight the election.
He pointed out that a commission of inquiry, headed by a woman High Court judge, was already in place in Gujarat and the Centre did not have the right to form another commission at this juncture when the Model Code of Conduct is in place.
Mr. Jaitley claimed that the UPA had made three unsuccessful attempts against Mr. Modi so far.
“First they tried to appoint two new information commissioners, second they tried to fill up the quorum of the Search Committee for appointment of the Lokpal, and third they are trying desperately to get at least one judge to agree to head the ‘snoopgate’ commission. “I doubt very much if any of these moves is likely to succeed. Even if it does, a future government would be well within its legitimate rights to review such a mala fide last-minute decision of the UPA,” he said.

Modi saddened to see DD ‘struggling to maintain professional freedom’
","With Prasar Bharati Corporation chief executive officer Jawahar Sircar kicking up a storm over the autonomy of the public broadcaster, Bharatiya Janata Party’s prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi on Saturday kept the controversy alive by tweeting that he was saddened “to see our national TV channel struggling to maintain its professional freedom”.
Using Twitter to greet “journalist friends” on World Press Freedom Day, Mr. Modi said: “Free press is a democracy’s cornerstone & must be preserved in letter & spirit. On days such as this, I feel very sad to see our National TV channel struggling to maintain its professional freedom. We have witnessed the horrors of Emergency when freedom of press & freedom of expression were suppressed. It is a blot on our democracy.”
His tweets on free press stoked the long-standing debate over the autonomy of the public broadcaster which has not died down even after the enactment of the Prasar Bharati Act with a view to unshackling Doordarshan and All India Radio from government control. The issue was prised open yet again this week after it became apparent that Doordarshan News had edited out portions of its interview with Mr. Modi though the broadcaster insists it was done to fit a 54-minute interview into a half-hour time slot.
The controversy further snowballed after Mr. Sircar blamed Minister of State for Information & Broadcasting Manish Tewari of blocking “more operational autonomy” to Prasar Bharati. The two have had differences in the past even as Mr. Sircar is being accused by his detractors of speaking out this time in the hope of currying favour with a BJP dispensation which is widely expected to form the next government.
Reacting to this, a former Shiv Sena member of the Rajya Sabha Pritish Nandy tweeted: “For those who don’t know, CEO Prasar Bharati is a statutory post, five years fixed. So Mr. Sircar need not curry favours with any sarkar.” Mr. Nandy was also member of the Consultative Committee for the I&B Ministry when he was Rajya Sabha member.
Though Prasar Bharati autonomy has been advocated by all political parties when out of power, a flashback into the 16-and-a-half years of the Act’s implementation is testimony to the way successive governments including the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance have sought to use it to their advantage.
The current government had set up an expert committee in 2013 under Sam Pitroda, Advisor to the Prime Minister on Public Information Infrastructure and Innovations, to review the institutional framework of Prasar Bharati including its relationship with the government and funding. The committee submitted its report in January this year in which it recommended amendments to the Act to “impart genuine and effective autonomy” to Prasar Bharati.

Re-poll in two booths in Salem and Namakkal tomorrow
","The Election Commission has ordered re-polling in two booths — one each in Salem and Namakkal — for May 8.
This followed a snag in the Electronic Voting Machines in the booths when polling for the Lok Sabha elections drew to a close on April 24.
A snag was reported at booth number 213 in the Salem City Municipal Corporation Elementary School on Sengal Anai Road. The presiding officer noticed the EVM displaying the message ‘factory mode’ when he pressed the ‘close’ button at 6 p.m.
The issue was reported to Collector Hanish Chhabra, who brought it to the notice of Chief Electoral Officer Praveen Kumar.
The booth saw 77.61 per cent polling.
A total of 579 electors (268 men and 311 women) cast their votes, as against the total of 746 voters.
In Namakkal, a similar snag was reported in booth number 37 at the Panchayat Union Middle School at Kotapalayam in the Tiruchengode Assembly segment. The booth has a total of 897 voters (439 men and 458 women).
The booth witnessed 81.16 per cent polling.
Election officials said booth slips would be issued by 10 teams to all voters in that booth on Wednesday. Police teams, flying squads and video surveillance teams were deployed on Tuesday.
“Announcements will be made though loudspeakers and local television channels, urging the voters to exercise their franchise from 7 a.m. to 6 p.m. on May 8,” the Returning Officer for Namakkal, V. Dakshinamoorthy, said.

TDP cadres buoyant
","The mood in the TDP district unit appears to be upbeat with the grand success of the NDA Vijaya Sankharavam meetings organised at Tirupati and Madanapalle in the last two days.
Spearheaded by BJP’s prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi, TDP chief N. Chandrababu Naidu and actor Pawan Kalyan, the district cadres believe the meetings have given the required boost to party candidates. Talking to The Hindu, senior TDP leader Gali Muddukrishnama Naidu, contesting from Nagari Assembly constituency, said that the overwhelming response to the meetings reflects the strong desire of the people to have good governance both at the State as well as the Centre. Exasperated with corruption, people now want visionary leaders such as Modi and Chandrababu Naidu, he said.
When contacted, another senior leader, Bojjala Gopalakrishna Reddy, from Sri Kalahasti, said that the meeting had contributed to the consolidation of party votes. In addition to this, Naidu’s proclamation that he would prefer taking an oath in Seemandhra and would not mind administering the State from under the tree’s shade has kindled the sentiments of people, who are said to be deeply hurt by the bifurcation. Further, Modi’s assertions with regard to Naidu’s competence have also provided the required fillip to the party’s image.
Meanwhile, buoyant cadres also drew parallels between Naidu, who upped his diatribes against the Congress and the YSRC, and the then Chief Minister Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy, who adopted a hard-line approach at the Nandhyala public meeting during the 2009 elections.
Above all, the catch phrase ‘YSRC Hatao – Seemandhra Bachao’ conceived by Pawan Kalyan at the Tirupati meeting has gone down well with voters.

Poor show led to Sinha exit: Chidambaram
","In a sharp reaction to former Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha’s accusation, in a recent newspaper interview, that he was “trying to fool the country” with a “fiscal fraud,” Union Finance Minister P. Chidambaram has said the BJP leader’s performance in the same office “was such that he had to demit office on July 1, 2002.”
“I may point out that 2000-01 and 2002-03 were the worst years since liberalisation in terms of growth and Prime Minister Vajpayee was forced to replace the Finance Minister,” Mr. Chidambaram said on Thursday. “I thought Mr. Sinha would be happy to remain a distant memory for the people of India. However, he seems determined to remain relevant in his party.”
Mr. Sinha had accused Mr. Chidambaram of reducing fiscal deficit by “savagely” cutting planned expenditure, milking PSUs of dividends, and postponing subsidy expenditure incurred this year to the next fiscal.
Mr. Chidambaram cited official figures to show that the Gross Domestic Product growth rate in the two years were 4.3 per cent and 4.0 per cent. Despite the economic slowdown, the growth rate during the UPA’s tenure did not fall below 4.5 per cent. “The allegation that government has postponed the payment of subsidies is either born out of ignorance or is mischievous.” Rollovers had been the practice for many years and nothing unusual happened in 2013-14, he added.
On Mr. Sinha’s accusation that the UPA government had not done its homework on implementing the Goods & Services Tax (GST) and the Direct Tax Code (DTC), the Minister said that when consensus had nearly been reached, the State “governments of Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat stalled further progress … Issues that had been settled were reopened.”

NHAI drops two road projects
","The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) has ‘omitted’ the 172-km Kazhakuttam-Cherthala and 111.73-km Edappally-Kuttipuram NH stretches from the National Highway Development Project (NHDP). The roads were to be developed into four-lane carriageways.
The government was aware of the notification issued by ‘omitting’ the stretches, though the official letter was yet to be received from the Union Ministry of Road Transport and Highways, official sources told The Hindu.
Uncertainty prevailed over the development of the 318-km Thalapady-Kuttipuram NH stretch which the NHAI had proposed to develop in three reaches.
The delay in acquiring and handing over the land needed, opposition from people, and a lack of consensus on the width of the carriageway were the reasons for the NHAI decision, sources said.
The NHAI had been demanding the handing over of the entire land in these stretches for taking up the work.
The authority had also hinted that it would withdraw from the project if the width of the carriageway was reduced to 30 metre in the State. With the omission, the NHDP works in the State would now be confined to the development of the stretches, namely, Walayar-Wadakkancherry (55 km), Wadakkancherry-Mannuthy (22 km), and Kazhakuttam-Inchivila (43 km). Of these, work had started on the first two stretches. The NHAI had tendered work on the four-laning of the Kazhakuttom-Inchivila bypass up to Mukkola.
Minister for Works V.K. Ebrahim Kunju told The Hindu that the government would not go back on the development of the NH stretches and was committed to decongesting the roads. A meeting, to be chaired by Chief Minister Oommen Chandy and attended by his Cabinet colleagues and top officials, would be held on May 14 to discuss the issue, Mr. Kunju said.
The PWD had worked out a strategy to take up the development of the NH and it would be tabled at the meeting, sources said.
The Kazhakuttam-Cherthala and Edappally-Kuttipuram stretches respectively came under the 669-km NH-66 from Thalapady to Kaliyikkavila and the 160-km NH-544 from Walayar to Edappally.

Parties don’t reward MPs for performance
","Do political parties and voters care about the parliamentary performance of elected representatives? The data indicates that they don’t.

The Hindu’s analysis of parliamentary performance data and electoral data shows that there is a weak positive and statistically significant correlation between attendance rates of members of Parliament in the 15th Lok Sabha and their likelihood of being re-nominated by their party in the current election. For other attributes of parliamentary performance, like the number of debates participated in, the number of questions asked and the number of Private Member Bills introduced, there was a very weak, statistically insignificant positive correlation.
This indicates that political parties are not very likely to reward MPs who perform well in Parliament with re-nomination, which is more likely determined by other factors.
Moreover, voters appear to care even less about parliamentary performance. For the 14th Lok Sabha, The Hindu found a weak negative, statistically significant, correlation between attendance rates and the likelihood of re-election, as well as that between the number of debates participated in and the likelihood of re-election.
In other words, MPs with higher attendance rates and better debate participation were slightly less likely to be voted back. The correlation between number of questions asked and number of Private Member Bills introduced was, as with the 15th Lok Sabha, a very weak positive one and statistically insignificant.
For this analysis, The Hindu used parliamentary performance data for the 14th and 15th Lok Sabhas compiled by PRS Legislative Research, and excluded ministers, speakers and leaders of the Opposition, who do not mark their attendance. For data on candidates who contested the 2009 and 2014 elections, The Hindu used data from the Association for Democratic Reforms, which scrutinises election affidavits, data from the Election Commission of India, and news archives.
“Sadly, this is not surprising,” said M.R. Madhavan, co-founder and president of PRS Legislative Research. “Party nominations are based on winnability and electability. What parties think of as winnability is for them to answer,” he said. As for voters, part of the problem was that they did not have information about their MPs, Mr. Madhavan said. “But while they may care if the person is of their caste, they may not care about parliamentary performance. I wish they did,” he added.
Jagdish Chhokar, founder-member of ADR, is equally unsurprised. “For parliamentary performance to matter to parties and voters, first of all Parliament has to matter, but it has become irrelevant to political parties,” Mr. Chhokar said. A host of other factors determined party nominations, Mr. Chhokar said, looking in parliamentary statistics for clues would be missing the wood for the trees.
Nirmala Sitharaman, national spokesperson of the BJP disagrees. “Parliamentary performance is something the party pays close attention to not only at the time of candidate selection, but all through the MP’s term,” she said, adding that it helped build goodwill and respect in the eyes of party peers. Voters were increasingly paying attention to participation in televised debates and presence in the house, she added.

Government seeks EC nod on appointment of new Army chief
","Amid questions raised by the BJP on the competence of the UPA government to choose the next Army Chief in the middle of election process, the Defence Minister A.K. Antony has said that the matter has been referred to the Election Commission for its advice.
For some days now the principal opposition party has been questioning the propriety of the government to make new appointments including that of the new Army Chief on the plea that it would be against the letter and spirit of the Election Commission’s Model Code of Conduct (MCC) in operation since the announcement of the General Election scheduled on March 5.
However in a communication to the Defence Secretary on March 27 the Commission had said that the Code is not applicable to any matter pertaining directly to the defence forces, be it the recruitments/promotions for defence forces, all service matters pertaining to them, defence purchases of all kinds, tenders relating to the matter of the defence forces and consequently no reference need be sent to the Commission pertaining to model code in these matters.
“These instructions shall be treated as standing instructions of the Commission and will be applicable for all elections in future. This may be brought to the notice of all concerned for future guidance”.
Despite the EC communication, on April 19 the BJP Legal Affairs Cell wrote a letter to the Election Commission asking the poll body to direct the government to refrain from making `major appointments’ including those related to armed forces.
“This is to seek your intervention in the tendency that seems to be on the increase in the government to make major appointments during the election process itself. You are aware of the undue haste with which the naval Chief was appointed. We learn that something similar is cooking in respect of the Army Chief where the present incumbent is due to superannuate in July 2014. We also hear that there is some hurried activity in hastening the selection process of the Lok Pal. It may be recalled the process of selection got aborted by the exit of the eminent jurists and as such the whole selection process currently stands vitiated”, the BJP letter had said.
The Defence Minister suggested that the government had sought counsel of the Commission as it wanted to strictly follow all the procedures before taking any final decision on the issue.
The present Army Chief Gen. Bikram Singh is due to retire on July 31 after the retirement of present Army chief Gen Bikram Singh. Traditionally, the appointment of chief of services has been made two months before the retirement of the incumbent.
However, in the case of Gen Bikram Singh, the appointment was done three months before the retirement of Gen V K Singh, who was engaged in a

Naidu to make appearance in Kuppam after two decades
","Telugu Desam Party (TDP) president N. Chandrababu Naidu is scheduled to campaign in Kuppam Assembly constituency on May 4, the day prior to the penultimate day of the campaign, according to Manohar, the personal secretary of Mr. Naidu. The tentative itinerary goes that Mr. Naidu would take part in a road show in Kuppam town, followed by a public meeting.
Though there were reports that Mr. Naidu would be accompanied by Jana Sena Party president Pawan Kalyan during his Kuppam visit, Mr. Manohar maintained that the actor’s participation was not confirmed.
If Mr. Naidu takes up campaigning in his constituency, he would be breaking a long tradition. The last time he undertook poll campaign in Kuppam was in 1994. In the past two decades, during nomination filing in 1999, 2004, 2009 and 2014, Mr. Naidu stayed away from making personal appearance, prompting his spouse and son to file on his behalf. He also strictly stayed away from campaigning in the constituency, though he campaigned in other constituencies in the home district.
Meanwhile, Nara Lokesh, Mr. Naidu’s son, is scheduled to campaign in Ramakuppam and Shantipuram mandals of Kuppam constituency on Saturday.

Falling in line
","This refers to the report, “
>Voters ensure Chiranjeevi falls in line,” (May 1). I appreciate the way Mr. Raja Karthik Ganta and Union Minister K. Chiranjeevi handled the situation. Mr. Chiranjeevi in particular needs to be really complimented for acknowledging the “error” in a very polite and humble manner and apologising. How many politicians would do that?

Kolluru Raju,


Kakinada

One needs to appreciate the courage of voters led by Mr. Ganta in stopping Mr. Chiranjeevi. The Minister should understand that when he comes to cast his vote, he is only a voter and that his superstar antics should be confined to reel life. Special treatment is reserved only for senior citizens and those who have disabilities. Throughout India, politicians have been portraying themselves as paragons of virtue. It is good that voters bring them down to earth with a thud when they cross the line.

T. Anand Raj,


Chennai

The reason that these “popular” people mock rules and regulations is that they are elevated to the level of god by laymen. Mr. Ganta in particular deserves our appreciation and has shown that citizens can change the fortunes of this country if they can stand up as one.

SC allows TN to increase Mullaperiyar water level
","In a major victory for Tamil Nadu, the Supreme Court on Wednesday declared as unconstitutional the law passed by Kerala in 2006, constituting the Dam Safety Authority to prevent the State from >raising the water level in the >Mullaperiyar dam from 136 ft to 142 ft.
A five-judge Constitution Bench of Chief Justice R.M. Lodha and Justices H.L. Dattu, C.K. Prasad, Madan B. Lokur and M.Y. Eqbal, allowing the suit filed by TN permanently restrained Kerala from interfering with the rights of Tamil Nadu from raising the water level in the dam from 136 ft to 142 ft.
Justice Lodha, who wrote the judgment, also restrained >Kerala from enforcing its law on Tamil Nadu. By enacting the law and fixing the storage height of the dam at 136 ft, Kerala had nullified the 2006 judgment and usurped judicial power and thus interfered with the judicial functioning.
The Bench said the Constitution envisaged separation of powers among the Executive, Judiciary and Legislature and one should not encroach into the domain of the other. Independence of the judiciary and courts alone would ensure rule of law, the Bench said.
The Bench said a legislation could be invalidated on the ground that there was a >breach of separation of powers in enacting the law, though the Legislature might have the competence to do so. The Bench said “If the court finds that there was transgression of constitutional principles in separation of powers the court can declared the law void.”
The Bench said the Legislature could only amend the law but could not invalidate a judgment or a decree passed by the court. The law enacted by Kerala legislature was an attempt to interfere with the judicial functioning, the Bench said and struck the law as unconstitutional and void.
The Bench appointed a three-member committee with chairman of the Central Water Commission as the chairperson and representatives from the States of Kerala and Tamil Nadu to supervise and ensure that the water level in the Mullaperiyar dam was raised up to 142 ft.

Eight-year wait ends

To allay the apprehensions of Kerala, though none exists, the Bench said the committee should make periodic inspection of the dam, before the monsoon and during the monsoon and take all steps necessary for the safety of the dam. The Kerala government was directed to allow Tamil Nadu to carry out all repairs and take all other steps for the >safety of the dam. On a suit filed by Tamil Nadu, the apex court in 2006 permitted the State to raise the water level from 136 ft to 142 ft. Within 15 days of the verdict, Kerala enacted a law and constituted Dam Safety Authority to prevent Tamil Nadu from raising the water level beyond 136 ft. In April 2006, Tamil Nadu filed a fresh suit to declare the law as unconstitutional. On Wednesday, after eight years the apex court decreed the suit in favour of Tamil Nadu.

NIA team going to Chennai to collect blast data
","The Centre has asked the National Investigation Agency (NIA) to collect data about the twin blasts in a train at Chennai Central railway station on Thursday that left one woman dead and 14 injured.
The Centre's decision to rush a NIA team was taken after the Tamil Nadu Government was assured that the central probe agency would be only collecting data about the blasts as it was probing several cases pertaining to terrorism in that region.
Union Home Minister Sushilkumar Shinde said a team of NIA was being sent to the spot for collecting data.
“We wanted to send the NIA team but the State government told us that CB—CID will probe the matter. Until the State government allows us for a NIA probe, we can’t take the matter in our hands. But we are sending the NIA team for data collection,” Shinde said.
The comments of Shinde come a day after the Tamil Nadu Government had refused any help from the Centre and made it clear that the case would be handled by the CB—CID of the State police.
In the meantime, security agencies were examining the CCTV footage at the Bangalore railway station and also examining those present in the S—4 and S—5 coaches of Bangalore—Guwahati Express to get some lead about the person who planted the explosive material under the seat.
The explosive material was strong but the brunt of its impact was neutralised by the iron seats as well as the flooring of the coaches that were examined by NIA as well as Bomb Data Centre of NSG.

Rs. 70-crore loss in summer rain
","Kerala will seek urgent financial assistance from the Centre to extend relief to people affected by heavy summer rain.
Minister for Revenue Adoor Prakash told reporters here on Tuesday that the estimated total loss during April and May was Rs. 70 crore, according to preliminary estimates.
The Minister said he along with the Principal Secretary (Revenue) would submit a memorandum to the Centre in Delhi on Wednesday seeking funds to compensate the losses.
The Minister said 20 persons had died in natural calamities since April 1. The majority of them had died after being struck by lightning. As many as 280 houses had been destroyed, while about 1,000 houses had suffered major damages. Four-thousand houses had suffered minor damages.

Excess rainfall

The State had so far received 367 per cent excess rainfall this summer. The worst damage was reported in Thiruvananthapuram, followed by Thrissur. Loss of agriculture crops amounted to Rs. 12 crore.
Mr. Prakash said the Centre had so far declined to provide funds to compensate deaths from lightning despite repeated requests by the State in the past. However, it had agreed to consider damages from sea erosion for assistance.

Control rooms

He said heavy rain was continuing in south Kerala and the losses were mounting. The government had opened a control room to coordinate relief work. The control room can be reached on phone: (471) 2331639. District Collectors had been told to coordinate relief activities and ensure that hospitals were prepared to handle emergencies.
Revenue officials had been instructed to keep buildings and other arrangements ready for opening relief camps, if necessary.
He said people living in hilly areas should be alert to the possibility of landslips.
Tourists visiting hilly areas should take special care. The weather bureau had warned that rain would occur in Northern Kerala also on Wednesday.

Priyanka alleges vilification campaign
","Accusing the BJP of resorting to vilification, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, daughter of Congress president Sonia Gandhi, on Friday alleged that booklets containing “dirty material” about her family were being dumped in Amethi right before her public meetings. “Some booklets are thrown at places where my public meetings are scheduled . Dirty and false things are written about my family. If they have to say something, they should come out and talk openly. Why do it like cowards,” Ms. Vadra said in Amethi, where she is campaigning for her brother and Congress president Rahul Gandhi. Contending that the election was an ideological war, Ms. Vadra said it should be fought on principles. But the level of political campaigning had stooped down to a new low, she said.
At least two booklets are in circulation in Amethi containing highly defamatory allegations in insulting language made against Ms. Gandhi and Mr. Gandhi. One of these booklets contains articles written by BJP leader Subramniam Swamy. While one booklet is titled “Sonia ki barbarta va sajish” (Sonia's cruelty and conspiracy), the other targets Mr. Gandhi with the label “Rahul ki Ravanleela” (Rahul's Ravanleela).
BJP spokesperson Vijay Bahadur Pathak denied that his party had any role in distributing the booklets. “We don't believe in character assassination. We don't favour it,” he said. Akhilesh Pratap Singh, Congress MLA and spokesperson, however, said the booklets contained “articles written by BJP leaders and other dirty material.” Responding to this Mr. Pathak said: “If the Congress has any complaints they can take the right route through constitutional methods. Our targeting of the Congress has only been on political issues.”
The Congress did not lodge a complaint till Friday evening. During her address, Ms. Vadra also attacked the BJP prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi for his craving for power. “ (Modi) He wants to give you strength. He also wants to give you power. There is a leader in the country, who wants power for himself. He keeps on demanding to strengthen him,” Ms. Vadra said.

Ganababu, Ratnakar racing neck and neck
","Visakhapatnam West Assembly segment has gained a lot of attention with P.V.G.R. Naidu (Ganababu), former MLA and son of former MP and Telugu Desam leader P. Appala Narasimham and Dadi Ratnakar, youngest son of YSR Congress leader Dadi Veerbhadra Rao, who till recently was an important leader of the Telugu Desam, being locked in the contest.
Though there are 12 candidates in the fray, including Pedada Ramani Kumari of Congress, two-time corporator Botta Eswaramma of CPI (M), candidates from Lok Satta, AAP, BSP, Jai Samaikyandhra Party, and only two independents, the contest is mainly between TD-BJP combined candidate Mr. Ganababu and Mr. Ratnakar. Both belong to the Gavara community. Mr. Ganababu lays stress on the point that he is the local and can serve people well.
Mr. Ganababu was elected on the TDP ticket in 1999 from the Pendurthi segment and contested again on the Praja Rajyam ticket from Visakha West, which was one of the segments formed out of Pendurthi in 2009 after delimitation of constituencies but lost by a narrow margin to Malla Vijaya Prasad of the Congress. He returned to the Telugu Desam during late 2011.
Mr. Ratnakar was rural in-charge of TDP before his father, former TD MLA of Anakapalle decided to join the YSR Congress last year. Mr. Vijaya Prasad, YSR Congress city unit president, is working for the success of Mr. Ratnakar.
Interestingly the two contesting candidates are closely related. Ratnakar’s mother is first cousin of Ganababu and the YSRC candidate is asserting his status as local saying that he was born in Visakhapatnam and his family has properties here and has a lot of relatives in the area.
This constituency has a rare mix of poor, affluent and people speaking different languages, thanks to the residential quarters of the Navy personnel, employees of various major public and private sector industries. One part is Gopalapatnam, Kancharapalem, Gnanapuram and others areas and the far-away Sriharipuram and industrial area, Nausena Baugh and other Naval areas including the residential quarters atop Dolphin’s Nose hill. Mr. Ganababu terms this segment as a mini-India and pinned a lot of hopes on the non-Telugu speaking voters who support BJP prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi. Contacts with every area of the constituency and his sports activities (he was also international volleyball player and chairman of the District Volleyball Association) would fetch him votes, Mr. Ganababu feels.
Mr. Ratnakar, on the other hand, is confident of getting support from the slum voters who constitute 40 per cent of the 2.26 lakh voters, the 4,000 Christians, SCs and Muslims. His father has positioned himself in Sriharipuram area and is conducting a vigorous campaign.
The constituency has many issues pending for long. Hundreds have constructed houses on the Simhachalam Devasthanam lands and the houses are not regularised. With the NAD junction to Pendurthi road choked with traffic, a parallel road was laid but it was not connected to the National Highway due to NSTL not allowing it to run through its premises. House pattas are not given to those living on the hill slopes. A flyover at NAD junction is needed and another over the rail track on the Gopalapatnam-Kothapalem road. Pollution, particularly in the industrial area, is a major problem and drinking water is in short supply.

Officials love a good drought in Trivandrum
","Do officials, those in local governing bodies and the regional setups of the Kerala Water Authority, in Thiruvananthapuram love a good drought?
As the district slowly begins to feel the heat of an impending drought this year, indications from government files of last year, when Thiruvananthapuram was among the worst-hit districts, are that officials had actually loved the drought, focussing and coming out with a plethora of projects that were termed anti-drought measures, but which in turn barely got implemented or ensured that the impact of the drought was minimised.
The government’s anti-drought preparations had begun as early as January last year, and as time went by, the project reports called for as part of the preparations revealed widespread instances of utter mismanagement of water, supply systems and precious water bodies in the State capital. The response of the local bodies to the situation was enough indication of how things were – with less than 50 of 73 panchayats submitting projects within the deadline – and how things could be this year since the ground situation that “inspired” the projects has hardly changed.
Last year, there were more defunct hand pumps in the district than working ones – a situation that is more or less the same this year as well; a majority of its public open wells and ponds were polluted, again something that is yet to change; and more disturbingly, little was done to address these despite the situation being the same for several years.
According to District Collector Biju Prabhakar, the administration had arranged for enough water tankers to cater to needy areas this year and the decision was that local bodies would not be allowed to use drought relief funds as per their whims and fancies, but only for making provisions for drinking water.
“It is not when the drought is at your doorstep that you think of water supply schemes and projects that can be taken up much earlier. There are instances from last year, when Rs.32 lakh was spent on a water supply scheme, with water yet to reach that place. We won’t allow that this year, with the funds to be given only for drinking water supply,” he told The Hindu, adding that an audit of what was done last year would be done with efforts on to collect data on last year’s project implementation.
Reports suggest that almost all panchayats in the district are in for a tough summer, something that could have been avoided with a little bit of foresight, since it is not water that is absent, but the ways and the will to distribute it efficiently. Project reports submitted last year revealed that panchayats like Vellarada, which had 37 hand pumps, had only five of them operational. In Amboori, just three out of 36 were working while in Vilappilsala, only seven of 25 were functional.
The condition of ponds in every panchayat was pathetic, and remains to be so. Chirayinkeezhu had reported 78 polluted ponds, while Kuttichal had 50 polluted ponds and Kilimanoor 46 ponds that were polluted beyond use. Panavoor had 46 while Vellanadu panchayat had 71 polluted ponds. While some measures were initiated to revive a few of these, the larger picture remains the same, a district panchayat official said.
The condition of overhead water tanks was stated to be satisfactory in most panchayats, but the condition of water pipelines was replete with complaints. According to Mr. Prabhakar, the government and the district administration have decided not to allow repair works of the KWA to be done with drought funds. “Those are works that should be taken up and completed much before the drought. So we will not be allowing drought funds for such works wherever possible,” he said.

Snacking contributes to fatty liver, abdominal obesity
","Snacking on high-fat and high-sugar foods is linked to abdominal fat and fatty liver disease, according to a new study.
The study found that a hypercaloric diet with frequent meals increases intrahepatic triglyceride content and fat around the waist, but increasing meal size did not.
Studies have linked obesity to the accumulation of abdominal fat and fat in the liver, making non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) one of the most prevalent diseases of the liver.
“American children consume up to 27 per cent of calories from high-fat and high-sugar snacks,” said lead author Dr. Mireille Serlie with the Academic Medical Centre Amsterdam in The Netherlands.
“Our study examines if high meal frequency, with snacking, compared to large meal consumption contributes to increased intrahepatic and abdominal fat,” Dr. Serlie said.
For the study, 36 lean men were randomised to a hypercaloric diet or a eucaloric control diet (balanced diet) for six weeks.
Researchers measured IHTG and abdominal fat using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and insulin sensitivity before and after the diet.
Those subjects on the hypercaloric diet ate 3 main meals along with additional calories from high fat and/or high sugar drinks, with or in between meals, to increase meal size or meal frequency.
Results show that high calorie diets increased BMI.
Eating more frequent meals significantly increased IHTG, while larger sized meals did not.
Researchers found that belly fat increased in the high fat/high sugar frequency group and in the high sugar-frequency group. A decrease in liver insulin sensitivity was found in the high fat/high sugar-frequency group.
“Our study provides the first evidence that eating more often, rather than consuming large meals, contributes to fatty liver independent of body weight gain,” said Dr. Serlie.
“These findings suggest that by cutting down on snacking and encouraging three balanced meals each day over the long term may reduce the prevalence of NAFLD,” Serlie added.

Jagan-rivals' war of words gets shrill
",": The YSR Congress (YSRC) and its president Y.S. Jaganmohan Reddy has become the common target of all other political parties in the fray in Seemandhra as the campaign peaked with only three more days left to woo the electorate.
With the mercury levels soaring in Coastal Andhra, Jagan’s rivals have sharpened and intensified their criticism of Mr. Reddy. In particular, TDP-BJP combine including the newly-floated Jana Sena Party, Congress, and other fringe parties went overboard in attacking the YSRC chief by linking the cases of corruption.
TDP chief N. Chandrababu Naidu and Jana Sena founder Pawan Kalyan are leaving no stone unturned in targeting Mr. Reddy while BJP’s prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi resorted to a veiled attack on the YSR Congress as he tried to build an opinion by repeatedly asking people: “Whether you want a State with scams or the one with golden opportunities”.
Mr. Naidu and Mr. Pawan Kalyan, however, have been going harsh and personal against Mr. Reddy by digging into how the latter built his business empire when his father the late Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy was the Chief Minister. The two have been targeting Mr. Reddy as being responsible for the bifurcation of the State too.
The Congress too has been ‘unsparing’ in its criticism of Mr. Reddy with Union Ministers Jairam Ramesh and K. Chiranjeevi being the star campaigners till AICC president Sonia Gandhi addressed an election rally in Guntur on Friday.
On its part, the YSRC and its chief Mr. Reddy have been effectively countering the rivals’ attack by explaining to the people how they lacked “credibility” by making it one of his poll planks in addition to “values in politics and welfare schemes of YSR”. Claiming that his was a family that had not gone back on the word given to people, he has been telling people how the Congress with the help of TDP have been victimising him for not abandoning his “odarpu yatra”.
“The BJP-TDP combo is unleashing a barrage of lies and promising to bring heavens down without talking about resources,” Mr. Reddy shot back during his election campaign in Krishna district on Friday. He charged the two parties as the prime culprits along with the Congress for dividing Telugu people. “How can the same set of people come to Seemandhra and tell people that Jagan is responsible for the division,” he asked.
Criticising Mr. Naidu for making “impossible promises”, Mr. Reddy said: “I can’t do that as I want to be in public life and people’s hearts for the next 30 years.”

It’s all about family fight in Jaggampeta
","Family politics has been the hallmark of the Assembly constituency, with the Thotas and Jyothulas, who are also close relatives, vying with each other to wrest this segment since 1989. Jaggampeta is presently represented by former Minister Thota Narasimham, who switched loyalty to the Telugu Desam Party. But, he is contesting from the Kakinada Parliamentary constituency this time, leaving his home turf from where he won twice in 2004 and 2009.
In this present election, a triangular fight between the TDP, YSRC and Congress is expected in East Godavari district. After emerging victorious in 1994 and 1999, Thotha Subbarao’s nephew Jyothula Venkata Apparao popularly known as Jyouthula Nehru lost in 2004 as a TDP candidate and in 2009 as a PRP nominee. But, after the PRP-Congress merger, he joined the YSR Congress to try his luck.
Jyothula Chantibabu, who is the TDP in-charge of Jaggampeta, stood third in 2009 elections by securing 33,000 votes and Mr. Narasimham won the seat. Now, Mr. Chantibabu is getting support from Mr. Thota Narasimham’s family and his own Jyothula family.
Mr. Narasimham’s relative Thota Suryanaryana Murthy alias Thota Ravi is contesting from the segment this time as a Congress candidate at the behest of Union Minister M. M. Pallam Raju. Despite him being a known face in this segment, the rising dissent among the voters against the Congress over bifurcation issue may spell trouble for him. Jaggampeta comprises Gandepalli, Gokavaram, Jaggampeta and Kirlampudi mandals. In 2004 elections, 1,26,225 votes were polled here against the total electorate of 1,56,696. Similarly in 2009, 1,47,301 voters of the total 1,86,347 exercised their franchise.
Amid this political hubbub, lack of adequate irrigation facilities for the upland farmers has remained a major issue as they largely rely on rain water to cater to their agricultural needs. All the major political parties have made the modernisation of Yeleru canal the main poll agenda. YSRC candidate Jyothula Venkata Apparao had led many agitations over this issue in the past. The TDP leaders also organised several dharnas, rasta rokos demanding solutions to the farmers’ woes.

Anantha Venkatarami Reddy promises water for all under HNSS
","The incumbent Anantapur MP and YSRC candidate Anantha Venkatarami Reddy said that he would initiate the supply of water from the Krishna through the HNSS project, if he is elected again.
Speaking to The Hindu, Mr. Venkatarami Reddy said that the second phase of the Handri Neeva Sujala Sravanthi (HNSS) project would be completed within two to three years to ensure that all parts of the district are provided water.
“The endeavour shall be to fill as many tanks as possible with water from the project so as to solve drinking water and irrigation water problems to an extent. Special care will be taken to ensure sufficient drinking water to all municipalities and villages alike,” Mr. Venkatarami Reddy said.
On the dismal state of employment statistics in the district, he said concentration would be on industries which can harness mineral deposits in the district and those industries which require less water.
“A mini-airport is already in the sanction list of the Union government and its construction will start within the next five years. This will go a long way in furthering industrialisation in the district,” Mr Venkatarami Reddy said.
He said that one of his top priorities would be to ensure that either a Central university is established in the district or the existing university upgraded in a way that it becomes a centre of excellence.
“Funds and grants will be given to the university while stressing on the need for effective faculty to promote excellence in education and research,” Mr. Reddy promised even as he said that the quality and commitment of doctors was to be improved in the government general hospital while developing medical infrastructure.
He sought to remind people that he had sanctioned Rs. 1 crore for the purchase of medical equipment for the general hospital at one time, a first ever move of this sort in the State.
On the other hand, he said that there was a need for an agricultural university, specific to the district, which could look into the problems of the district and provide solutions and direction to development packages like ‘Project Anantha’. This would enable the uplift of the poor from the vicious circle of droughts and debts.

A. Raja, Kanimozhi, Dayalu issued summons in 2G case
","Taking cognisance of an Enforcement Directorate complaint in connection with a money-laundering case related to the 2G spectrum allocation scam, a Delhi court issued summons on Friday to the former Union Telecom Minister A. Raja, Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam chief M. Karunanidhi’s wife Dayalu Ammal and his daughter Kanimozhi, and 17 others to appear before it on May 26.
Mr. Karunanidhi’s daughter Selvi is one of the 30 witnesses.
In filing the case, the ED traced the trail of a sum of Rs. 200 crore that reached Kalignar TV from other accused companies, and concluded that it was illegal gratification for, and on behalf of, A. Raja and his associates for illegal favours given to Swan Telecom. “Raja was actively involved in receiving and refunding the proceeds of crime,” it said.
“On a perusal of the material on record, I am satisfied that there is enough incriminating material to proceed against the accused,” Special CBI judge O.P. Saini said.
The ED said in its complaint that Kalaignar TV director P. Amirtham and managing director and chief executive officer Sharad Kumar, “in association with Dayalu Ammal and Kanimozhi, were involved in parking Rs. 200-crore illegal gratification and its refund.”
Shahid Usman Balwa, Swan Telecom promoter; Vinod Goenka, managing director of DB Realty; Asif Balwa and Rajiv Agarwal, promoters of Kusegaon Fruits and Vegetables Pvt. Ltd.; and Karim Morani, director of Cineyug Films are among others summoned.
“An amount of Rs. 200 crore was paid by promoters of Swan Telecom using their group entity Dynamix Realty to Kalaignar TV through Kusegaon Fruits and Cineyug Films in the garb of legitimate financial transactions as loan/share application money ... In the garb of loan, it was the illegal gratification, which was apparently projected as untainted money ... The reverse flow of such amount further establishes the projection of the proceeds of crime as untainted money and is nothing but the process of money laundering,” the ED said.

Tamil Nadu rejects NIA probe, takes NSG help
","The Tamil Nadu government on Thursday rejected the Centre’s offer to order a National Investigation Agency (NIA) probe into the twin blasts in the Bangalore-Guwahati Express at the Chennai Central station, making the Centre “stand-down” a team of detectives preparing to leave for Chennai, the Home Affairs Ministry said.
Director-General of Police (in charge of Elections), Tamil Nadu, Anoop Jaiswal said there was no Centre-State confrontation on the issue, wondering how two agencies could investigate one case. The CB-CID was confident of achieving a breakthrough soon.
Ministry sources expressed the apprehension that the decision could make other State governments also resist Central intervention in terrorism-related cases, opening the way for a damaging Centre-State row.
Mr. Jaiswal said National Security Guard (NSG) experts would assist the Tamil Nadu Police. An NSG team from New Delhi would arrive in Chennai on Friday.

T.N. ‘no’ to NIA help may derail anti-terror efforts

Union Home Ministry sources said here on Thursday that acts such as Tamil Nadu’s refusal to allow a National Investigation Agency probe into the train blasts at the Chennai Central railway station could lead to a confrontation between the Centre and the States.
Union Finance Minister P. Chidambaram, meanwhile, said: “It is an uncoordinated action of State governments which is creating gaps in the fight against terrorism.” The setting up of the National Counter-Terrorism Centre, blocked by State governments, could have plugged key “loopholes in intelligence.”
Earlier, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said no efforts should be spared to bring the perpetrators of the train blasts to justice, and added that the Centre would provide the Tamil Nadu government all assistance. Union Home Minister Sushilkumar Shinde told presspersons that the Centre had offered Tamil Nadu full assistance.
Mr. Jaiswal, said: “It is not a clueless case ... we are following some leads. We will be able to crack the case on our own.” Investigators would develop computer-aided portraits of the accused based on the account of eyewitnesses and CCTV footage, he said.
In 2012, Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Jayalalithaa opposed the creation of the NIA, saying it was “clearly a case of the Centre usurping the powers of the States.” She wanted the agency, set up after the 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks, wound up, saying it would lead to “an autocracy consisting of a government of the Centre, by the Centre, for the Centre.”
Intelligence Bureau sources told The Hindu that no intelligence advice was there on a possible attack, but noted that Tamil Nadu had seen increased activity by Islamist groups in recent years. Earlier this week, the Chennai Police arrested an alleged Inter Service Intelligence operative, Mohammad Sakir Hussain, on charges of plotting to attack diplomatic missions in the region.
Top Indian Mujahideen commander Muhammad Ahmad Zarar Siddibapa is reported to have stayed in Chennai as a fugitive, and two men linked to the group were arrested from the city in 2011.

BJP says Rahul made provocative statement
","The BJP on Saturday approached the Election Commission to seek action against Rahul Gandhi, claiming he had made a “highly provocative” statement that 22,000 people will be killed in the country if Narendra Modi becomes the Prime Minister.
“We brought to the EC notice the statement of Rahul Gandhi yesterday in Solan (Himachal Pradesh) that if Modi becomes Prime Minister there would be massacre of 22,000 people. This is a highly provocative statement by the Congress vice president,” BJP leader Ananth Kumar said.
Mr Kumar, who was talking to reporters after leading a party delegation to Chief Election Commissioner V S Sampath, said the alleged remark was “uncalled for and breach of model code of conduct”.
The BJP “urged the CEC to take serious note of it and take action to restrain Rahul Gandhi from giving such statements,” he said.
Asked about the EC response, Mr Kumar said “CEC assured us that appropriate action will be taken after looking into it.”
The BJP delegation, which also included Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi and Chandan Mitra, also alleged that rigging, booth capturing had taken place along with violence in West Bengal during polls on April 30 and demanded increased arrangements during the remaining two phases of polling.
“We brought to his (CEC’s) notice that in most of the booths in West Bengal there were no CCTVs nor central forces,” Mr Kumar said, adding the delegation had submitted a memorandum giving details of rigging and booth capturing on April 30.
The party demanded repolling in those booths where voting was very high.
“We urged the CEC that he should ensure increased arrangements with CCTVs in all the sensitive booths in the ensuing two phases on May 7 and 12,” he said.

Gogoi seeks NIA probe into Assam violence
","Assam Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi on Saturday asked for a probe by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) into the violence by Bodo militant group NDFB(S) in the state and vowed to apprehend those responsible for the killings.
“We have decided to recommend a probe by the NIA. Nobody responsible for the killings of so many innocent people will be spared,” Mr Gogoi told reporters here after NDFB(S) militants went on the rampage since Friday killing 32 people and torching scores of houses.
“We have reports that the NDFB(S) group is responsible for these attacks. We have directed the security forces to take the strongest possible action against them,” he said.
Mr Gogoi asked BJP not to politicise the situation and said his track record in maintaining law and order was better than BJP-ruled Gujarat.
“I had called the army in the past to assist the local administration to restore peace. Tell me how many times they called the army to control the riots in Gujarat in 2002,” he said.
At least 32 people were killed in the violence unleashed by NDFB—Songbijit militants in Bodoland Territorial Administration Districts (BTADC) area in Assam since Thursday night.
BJP alleged the Gogoi-led Congress government has failed to maintain law and order and safety of innocent people in Assam.

Awareness drives come to nought
","Despite the hype around spreading awareness among IT professionals, youth and urban middle-class about exercising their franchise, the effect on the ground in Ranga Reddy district leaves a lot to be desired.
The district administration and the Labour Department had worked overtime trying to build awareness among the public, especially IT professionals, by organising meetings with IT companies and industry bodies through whom they hoped to reach their target audience.
They also convinced the companies to declare April 30 as a paid holiday, with many of them actually acquiescing to it.
However, it is now apparent that the professionals merely enjoyed the holiday and stayed home, instead of taking the pains to go to the polling station.
While it was expected that the district would clock a polling percentage of 70 per cent, as against the 54 per cent recorded in the 2009 elections, actual polling remained only at around 60 per cent. Even this rise owes itself to the considerable increase of polling in Uppal constituency.
As per information provided by the district administration, the constituencies of Serilingampally, Kukatpally and Quthbullapur, the hubs of IT professionals, hardly registered growth in voting percentage.
On the contrary, the numbers fell in comparison with the previous elections.
In Serilingampally, polling plummeted to 48 per cent from 53.3 per cent in 2009, while Kukatpally, at 50.36, clocked a negative growth of over three per cent. Quthbullapur recorded a drop of nearly two per cent.
L.B. Nagar, another urban constituency housing mostly government and public sector employees, registered a slight drop too.
Uppal, however grew respectably from 42.38 per cent to almost 50 per cent, while Malkajgiri, the most sought-after constituency by VIPs, registered nearly three percent decline in polling percentage. Against the 54.61 per cent in the last elections, this year registered a mere 51.74 per cent.
Voting in Medchal more or less remained the same.
Surprisingly, polling percentage dropped in semi-urban constituencies such as Maheshwaram, and Rajendranagar too, even while increasing in their rural counterparts.
Chevella witnessed the highest polling in the district at 78.72 per cent, followed by Ibrahimpatnam at 78.14 per cent.

Seemandhra stoic as Sonia speaks
","Low turnout greeted Congress president Sonia Gandhi at the Andhra Muslim College grounds on the Ponnuru road here when she arrived to address a campaign rally Friday, apparently reflecting the anger of the people of >Seemandhra region over state’s bifurcation. It was Ms Gandhi’s first visit to Seemandhra post bifurcation.
Around 7,000 people turned up for the rally, the only one she was addressing in Seemandhra ahead of the May 7 elections.
The crowd remained indifferent and not once did it cheer during her 30-minute address.
“I don’t grudge your criticism or anger,” the Congress chief said, while taking pains to explain the reason for the state’s bifurcation, and asking the people to “look forward”.
“The state re-organisation was done in a manner that protects the interests of Seemandhra. It is done in full fairness to Seemandhra,” she stressed, and listed out the various provisions in the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act-2014 that would address the needs of the region.

Mullaperiyar: Kerala government to file review petition
","Kerala government will file a review petition against the
> verdict of the Supreme Court in the Mullaperiyar case, Chief Minister Oommen Chandy said here on Wednesday.
The Chief Minister told the media after a discussion on the verdict in the Cabinet that Supreme Court did not give due consideration to the issues raised by the State regarding the safety of the dam.
Mr. Chandy said that Kerala had enacted the Irrigation and Water Conservation (Amendment) Act, 2006, which was struck down by the Court, not to deny water to Tamil Nadu; but to address concerns about failure of the 119-year-old dam.
He said that the government had done all that was required to argue the case well before the Court in consultation with all political parties. It also had the support of all. It would be convening another all-party meet to discuss the defeat and chart out future course of action.
Referring the call for hartal in protest against the verdict, the Chief Minister urged all to show restraint. Steps would be taken to address the concerns of the people.
He said that the Cabinet had finalised the action plan for the remaining term of the government. This would be announced on Thursday. The proposal for hiking bus fares were not taken up because it had to discuss the Mullaperiyar verdict and the action plan.
Replying to a question, Mr. Chandy said that attempts were on to scuttle the plan for development of port at Vizhinjam by some quarters. However, the project would be realised and the government was confident about that.

Small, medium towns in Karnataka may get 24x7 water
","The 24x7 drinking water supply scheme may be extended to small and medium towns in the State this year, utilising assistance provided by the Union government under the Urban Infrastructure Development Scheme for Small and Medium Towns (UIDSSMT).
The scheme, introduced on a pilot basis in a few wards in Hubli-Dharwad, Belgaum and Gulbarga city corporation limits, will be extended to all the wards in the three cities at a cost of Rs. 1,760 crore, with 50 per cent assistance from the World Bank, as it has become a success.
The State government has now decided to experiment the scheme in Sedam and Chincholi towns in Gulbarga district.
Executive Engineer of the Karnataka Urban Water Supply and Drainage Board (KUWSDB) Ashok Madyal told The Hindu here on Thursday that the Union government had given its approval for implementing the scheme in Sedam at a cost of Rs. 26.1 crore. It would be funded under the UIDSSMT and implemented by the KUWSDB. The State government had given its administrative approval and tenders had been invited for bulk supply of water, he said.
Mr. Madyal said another proposal for implementing the scheme in Chincholi town at a cost of Rs. 50.01 crore had been submitted to the State government for administrative approval. A proposal had also been placed before the Union government seeking assistance.
The KUWSDB also proposes to take up the scheme in Aland town in Gulbarga district under the UIDSSMT. A survey had been completed in the town, and design and estimates were being prepared.
Mr. Madyal said that a Rs. 99-crore proposal under the UIDSSMT had been submitted to the Union government for taking up Phase I of the 4th stage of the underground drainage project in Gulbarga city. A detailed project report had been submitted to the Union government and technical appraisal completed. Apart from this, the UGD project for the industrial township of Wadi in Chittapur taluk and Aland town at a cost of Rs. 60.43 crore and Rs. 39.8 crore, respectively, had been approved under the UIDSSMT. The State government has given its administrative approval.
He said the Union government had also accorded its sanction for taking up the UGD project in Sedam and Chittapur towns at a cost of Rs. 22 crore and Rs. 18 crore respectively. Estimates were also being prepared for taking up the UGD project in Chincholi and Afzalpur towns in Gulbarga district.

Deogarh court rejects Giriraj’s anticipatory bail plea
","The anticipatory bail application of Bihar BJP leader Giriraj Singh, who is facing charges for his alleged hate speeches, was rejected on Saturday by a court in Deogarh.

Earlier, a Bokaro court had also rejected Mr. Giriraj’s anticipatory bail on similar charges but Jharkhand High Court quashed it on Friday.
The warrants were issued after an FIR was filed against the BJP leader for his alleged inflammatory speech on April 18 saying those who opposed BJP’s prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi would have to find a place in Pakistan.
On April 25, Mr. Giriraj got an anticipatory bail from Patna District and Sessions Judge Birendra Kumar on an FIR on the same charge.

Karnataka AAP teams head out to Varanasi
","Venkateswar Raju and four of his friends set out for a drive of about 1,800 km from here to Varanasi by car on Saturday morning.
The techies, based in Bangalore and volunteers of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), will be campaigning for the next eight days for their leader Arvind Kejriwal, who is locked in an electoral battle with Bharatiya Janata Party’s prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi.
The five friends, who decided to drive because they did not get train tickets, will be joining about 100 AAP volunteers from Bangalore and rest of Karnataka who are already there. “We have all taken leave from work for this campaign,” said Mr. Raju, who co-ordinated campaign in Bommanahalli area ahead of the April 17 polling for the Lok Sabha elections here.
At SewapuriKundan Singh, a bank employee in Bangalore who has taken a two-year break from work, is already campaigning in the Sewapuri Assembly segment in the Varanasi Lok Sabha constituency.
“We are 22 people in my group. We do door-to-door campaign in the morning in this largely rural pocket and do group activities in the evening,” he told The Hindu, and added that most Karnataka volunteers were working in the segment.
Interestingly, some of the candidates who contested in the polls in Karnataka are now campaigning in Varanasi. While writer and former Minister B.T. Lalitha Naik (who contested from Gulbarga) is already there, the former chief financial officer of Infosys V. Balakrishnan (who contested from Bangalore Central) is set to join her in the coming week, said Prithvi Reddy, national executive member of the AAP.
“We expect about 400 to 600 people from Karnataka to be here by May 6,” AAP State convener Siddharth Sharma told The Hindu from Varanasi. Three to four batches had already reached and more were on the way, he added.
‘Calling campaign’Apart from those who are present in Varanasi, a large number of volunteers from Karnataka are pitching in with ‘Calling Campaign’ where supporters contact voters in Varanasi over phone to canvass for the party nominees through toll-free numbers, Mr. Sharma said.

Ahads plans Japan-aided project in Wayanad
","The Attappady Hill Area Development Society (Ahads), which has been converted as the Centre for Comprehensive Participatory Resource Management (CCPRM) by the government recently, will implement a Japan-aided ‘comprehensive environmental conservation and community development project’ in Wayanad from January next year.
Project director of the CCPRM N.C. Induchoodan told The Hindu here on Tuesday that of the project estimate of Rs.690 crore, Rs.225 crore had been earmarked for agrarian relief projects. Farmers in Wayanad were in dire straits and suicide by farmers had been reported from the district, he said.
Mr. Induchoodan said the project had got sanction from the Central and State governments. The Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), which funded the Rs.219-crore Attappady Wasteland Comprehensive Environment Conservation Project implemented by Ahads, had offered financial assistance for the project.
He said Wayanad was a developmental paradox in the sense that it remained the most backward district in Kerala with respect to several human development indices, especially among the BPL communities.
The project’s aim was to enhance livelihood security of the tribal communities and the Below Poverty Line (BPL) sections. These sections would capacitate and organise in planning, implementation, and monitoring of a participatory and integrated area development programme, leading to improved human development indices in an ecologically sustainable, socially enabling, and culturally vibrant environment, Mr. Induchoodan said.
Mr. Induchoodan said Wayanad was a complex but veritable landscape unique in geophysical, biological, socio-economic, and cultural attributes. Ecologically, it was unparalleled in the world and known for globally significant biodiversity.
“It provides immense ecosystem goods and services, particularly being the catchment of the Cauvery that is crucial for the drinking and irrigation water supply for about six crore people in few districts of Kerala and Karnataka. This region has strong eco-cultural affinities, being the abode of several aboriginal communities that have developed strong cultural and livelihood adaptation strategies based on natural resources,” he said.
He said the project would be implemented in 10 years.
An amount of Rs.105.80 crore would be spent for eco-restoration, augmentation of natural resources, and protection of river basins; Rs.65 crore for housing development; Rs.96 crore for roads, bridges, drinking water, and energy conservation; Rs.92 crore for heath care, sanitation, education, and infrastructure development; and Rs.47 crore for human resources development.

‘Modi vs. all’ shows up insecurities of rival camp: Amit Shah
","
On Wednesday, as the seventh phase of polling was under way, Amit Shah, closest confidant of the Bharatiya Janata Party’s prime ministerial candidate, Narendra Modi, and party general secretary, seemed relaxed and hopeful. He had just cast his vote and was watching television with his wife, Sonal, and son, Jayant, at home in a quiet neighbourhood of Ahmedabad. Mr. Shah opened up to Poornima Joshi on the sudden bitterness in the election campaign, the prospects of finding future allies for the BJP in such an atmosphere and his relationship with party president Rajnath Singh. Excerpts
:

The Hindu: The BJP started off with the development plank, but now the campaign seems to have degenerated into personal attacks and bitterness. What has changed? It seems to have suddenly become “Modi versus all” …


Amit Shah: Development is still the main plank of our election campaign. On the whole, I don’t think even two per cent of the volume of the campaign contains
> personal attacks or slights. But the media picks up only on that two per cent in its eagerness to create the illusion that the campaign has somehow been debased. I watch every political leader’s speeches very carefully; I don’t think they are interested only in attacking each other. That is not true. So far as “Modi versus all” is concerned, that has been the case right from the beginning. They [rival leaders] are becoming more voluble as the campaign focusses on their respective States; their insecurities are now coming to the surface.

But tell us, why is Mr. Modi focussing his attacks more on the >Gandhis than on the regional players, who, whether it is Mamata Banerjee or Lalu Prasad, are far more militant in their attacks on him and the BJP.

This is because the UPA [United Progressive Alliance] is the ruling coalition at the Centre. But it is not as if he is not attacking the SP [Samajwadi Party] and the BSP [Bahujan Samaj Party] in Uttar Pradesh and Mamata in West Bengal. The frontal attack would naturally be more focussed on the Centre. These things happen in elections. What is so new about them?

 The BJP is a democratic party. We are not a family-run business. We try and evolve a consensus on everything. 

But the regional leaders seem far more vocal in their attacks on Mr. Modi than he is on them. So is it a deliberate attempt to soften up the regional players for post-election tie-ups?

That is not true. He is highlighting the lack of development in every State and targeting everyone responsible. Our target is 272+ for the NDA [National Democratic Alliance]. We are working towards that. There is no other strategy.

What about Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Jayalalithaa? She has suddenly become >very vocal. We would have thought she and Modi had a good relationship …

You will find the answer to this question in the election results, even in Tamil Nadu where the BJP’s vote share is rising. I don’t want to say anything else.

We would like you to elaborate on it. Do you mean she is raising her pitch because she feels threatened by Mr. Modi?

I told you I would not say anything more than what I had already said. Let the results come out.

You don’t think this pre-election posturing will continue after the elections?

Every party presents its side in the campaign. But everyone respects the mandate. Let the mandate come. That has been my experience. Once a party gets the mandate, every other party respects that.

You have been handling >Uttar Pradesh affairs for the BJP, and one could see what has happened in the western region of the State. The BJP seems to be benefiting from the communal polarisation in the region. But in the eastern parts, the party’s campaign doesn’t seem to have picked up. So unless there is Hindu-Muslim discord, your party does not do well … is that so?

In the eastern parts, I am sure you went there when the campaign had not even begun. But I would ask you to make a trip now; the atmospherics are completely different. It is a one-sided election, there is a wave. This Hindu-Muslim issue that you are raising, I would say your perspective is warped. It is not about Hindus and Mussalmans. It is about administrative collapse and absolute mishandling of the situation. The people are angry with the State government for allowing the situation to go out of control …

But the >BJP’s involvement …

Again, I would ask you to examine the situation not on communal lines but from the people’s perspective. The people are voting in a certain way because there is anger against the government, among both Muslims and Hindus. The riots happened because the government did not respond to the situation. The police action was driven by vote-bank politics. They did not handle the situation properly.

 The BJP is a democratic party. We are not a family-run business. We try and evolve a consensus on everything. 

Okay, let us forget western Uttar Pradesh for a while. Let me ask you about whether people are responding to the BJP because of Mr. Modi’s personality or his development agenda? Tell me specifically about Uttar Pradesh, whether caste and communal polarisation are the only factors in the election?

We will get the maximum number of seats from U.P. this time. I can promise you that. It is a one-sided election in the BJP’s favour.

What are the problem States for the BJP?

In the southern and the eastern parts, we traditionally suffer from organisational weaknesses. This problem does exist.

In the southern parts, what are you expecting from the alliances that have been forged, especially in >Tamil Nadu?

I am hopeful. I think we will do well. I think our vote share will increase exponentially. There is a possibility of getting a good number of seats.

How many seats are you expecting?

Let me not start counting seats because I haven’t really travelled in southern India. My information is not based on primary sources. I am only telling you what I have learnt from the people who are working on the ground. I can’t cite a figure based on telephonic conversations.

Mr. Rajnath Singh says Mr. Modi had nothing to do with your >assignment as election in-charge of Uttar Pradesh. We find it difficult to believe, especially given your proximity to Mr. Modi …

He is absolutely right. Narendra Modi and Amit Shah are loyal soldiers of the Bharatiya Janata Party. We do what the party has assigned us to do. I am a general secretary of the BJP and the party president asked me to manage elections in U.P. It was his decision. Who goes where, who takes charge of different States is an organisational matter. It is purely the prerogative of the party president. Narendra Modi has nothing to do with it.

Tell us something about this newfound proximity between Mr. Rajnath Singh and Mr. Modi.

Look, Modi
ji is our PM candidate and Rajnath
ji our party president. There is harmony and good coordination between them. It is a good thing for the party. I believe this coordination is the reason for our campaign to have picked up so well.

On the national scene, do you think people still look at you with distrust? Do you think it is necessary to win over the liberal intelligentsia who are suspicious of you?

I have never done anything in my life to win over anyone. I do my job with the honesty and integrity that I have and leave judgment to others. I think this impression that you talk about, it has been created without knowing me. I believe once people get to know me, my work, they will begin to see things in a different light.

A section of the media believes you will be the second-most powerful man if Mr. Modi becomes Prime Minister. You must be happy about it?

This impression is not correct. Mein zamini star ka karyakarta hoon [I am a ground-level worker]. I am a general secretary of the BJP like so many others. There are so many leaders in our party. What I mean is, forget number two, I am nowhere in the pecking order. Frankly, I am embarrassed about it.

But how do you feel about your position in the party hierarchy? What is the basis for this impression?

They say these things because I am in charge of U.P. It is a critical State. That is why some hype has been created.

You are from outside Uttar Pradesh. Did that pose a problem?

I never had any problem. I hail from the organisation. So I know how common functionaries work. I am an RSS [Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh] Swayamsevak [volunteer], I have been with the ABVP [Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad] and I draw inspiration from these roots. They have shaped my functioning and my entire life. It is not just me and Narendra Modi who come from the RSS. Rajnath
ji also comes from the RSS. We all belong to the same family.

Is there a division in the party’s ideological agenda and the development plank of the party? The Ram Mandir is mentioned very late in your manifesto?

The >manifesto reflects our agenda. There is no difference between the ideological line and development agenda. And what is the problem in mentioning Ram temple in the last pages? If we had mentioned it in the front page, the media would have made an issue about that as well. You might be suffering from a perception problem. We have no such confusion.

 The BJP is a democratic party. We are not a family-run business. We try and evolve a consensus on everything. 

But you can’t deny differences in the party over the articulation of your agenda. That is why the manifesto was delayed so much that you released it on a day when polling was going on in some States?

The BJP is a democratic party. We are not a family-run business. We try and evolve a consensus on everything. This time too, we evolved a consensus, everyone voiced their opinion. That should not be construed as a difference of opinion. Yes, the manifesto was delayed. I wish it wasn’t, but when we did release it, everyone had endorsed it. Everyone was on the dais when it was released.

You claim everyone is satisfied and everything resolved. Why is BJP leader Sushma Swaraj not campaigning then? Have you succeeded in placating her?

What do you mean by that? What is the problem? Sushma
ji is contesting an election. She will campaign after her own election has concluded. Even before that, she has been campaigning in various States. Just because you people choose to portray some trumped-up reality, it doesn’t mean there is no truth. Sushma
ji is campaigning and she will campaign. There is no problem.

What about veteran party leader L.K. Advani? What role would he have if Mr. Modi becomes Prime Minister? It is difficult to imagine him working under Mr. Modi …

I am a small fry. How can I comment on Advani
ji’s role? Advani
ji’s role will be decided by Advani
ji himself. The parliamentary board will decide. How can I comment on that?

What about you? If the NDA comes to power, >will you join the government or work in the party or organisation?

About my own prospects, all I can say is that the party has taken every decision that was ever taken in my professional life. But if you ask me, or more important, if the party asks me, my priority will be to work for the party.

So you are against joining the government if it is formed?

I am not against anything. All I am saying is that my personal priority is to work for the party.

Naidu best bet for residuary AP, say pensioners
","The residuary Andhra Pradesh, which starts with a whopping Rs. 13,500 crore deficit, very much needed the administrative acumen of TDP president N.Chandrababu Naidu to rebuild the State from scratch. A delegation of pensioners led by APNGOs Association former president G. Poornachandra Rao articulated the view while talking to reporters here.
Mr Poornachandra Rao feared that ''without the over Rs 45,000 crore revenue generated in Hyderabad, Seemandhra will face serious economic problem to start with. A leader of Mr Naidu's stature is the need of the hour to put it on the path of progress,” he added.
AP Secretariat Employees Association former president P. Guravaiah said while the YSRC turned down their plea to increase retiring age of employees to 60 years, Mr Naidu had acceded to the demand.
The TDP in its manifesto had also promised five-day week, ensuring three promotions to employees during their service, issuing cashless health card and increasing pension by 10 per cent after 65 years and 20 and 30 per cent after 75 and 80 years respectively, they added.

U.P. seeks legal opinion on parole to QED founder
","The Uttar Pradesh government has sought legal opinion on parole granted to Mukhtar Ansari, the Quami Ekta Dal candidate from Ghosi in Uttar Pradesh, by a Delhi court. Mr. Ansari has been granted parole for ten days from May 1.
Ghosi, along with 17 other parliamentary constituencies in Purvanchal, goes to polls in the last phase of the Lok Sabha elections in Uttar Pradesh on May 12. Mr. Ansari is presently in Agra jail.
“The government is getting it legally examined as parole has been granted to Mr. Ansari by a special court in Delhi in a particular case [even though] a total of 12 cases are pending against him,” State Home Secretary, Kamal Saksena told journalists here on Friday, adding that the legal opinion was expected to be conveyed soon.
The alleged mafia don-turned-politician, an Independent MLA from Mau in Purvanchal (eastern Uttar Pradesh), had contested the 2009 Lok Sabha elections from Varanasi on a Bahujan Samaj Party ticket and lost to the Bharatiya Janata Party’s Murli Manohar Joshi by a relatively small margin of 17,211 votes. BSP president Mayawati subsequently expelled Mr. Ansari from the party. Before the 2012 Assembly polls, he formed the Quami Ekta Dal with his brother, Afzal Ansari, as its president.
In the run-up to the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, Mr. Ansari was expected to contest from both Varanasi and Ghosi before the QED decided to field him from Ghosi alone. Last week, QED chief Mr. Afzal Ansari announced in Varanasi that the “Quami Manch” (comprised of the QED and small parties like the Bharatiya Samaj Party) would support the Congress candidate from Varanasi (Ajay Rai). The decision surprised many keen watchers of the forthcoming electoral battle in Varanasi as it was largely speculated that the QED would, given its Muslim base, support the Aam Aadmi Party’s Arvind Kejriwal as against the BJP’s prime ministerial candidate, Narendra Modi.
Ajay Rai and Mukhtar Ansari are considered rivals in the badlands of Purvanchal. Informed sources in the Congress said the QED leadership was roped in to support Mr. Rai by two senior Congress leaders who had visited Varanasi last fortnight.

I feel free, won’t go back to BJP: Jaswant
","Expelled BJP leader Jaswant Singh says he feels swatantra (free) outside the party fold and is not likely to bury the hatchet.
Speaking to the media here on Friday, Mr. Singh, said it was the BJP which compelled him to leave the party. “I will not return to the BJP. I have been expelled twice,” he said, blaming Rajasthan Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje and party president Rajnath Singh for denial of ticket to him.
“Murli Manohar Joshi said this decision [denying a ticket] was wrong and it was taken by the Chief Minister and party president.” Mr. Singh said he was not thinking of floating a new party.
He denied the existence of any wave in favour of the BJP prime ministerial candidate. “There is only heatwave in Barmer [in Rajasthan, where Mr. Singh is in the fray as Independent], no Modi wave.”
Drawing a comparison between the former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee’s leadership and the present BJP leadership, Mr. Singh said: “I had the honour of working with a team led by Mr. Vajpayee who enjoyed the confidence of his Cabinet. I don’t see that happening in the renewed National Democratic Alliance. I am happier to remain swatantra.”
Targeting Mr. Modi, he said the BJP had now become a “one man party” but during Mr. Vajpayee’s time there was no “coterie” chosen by one person.
“The BJP has not had, even in Vajpayee’s time, a single man leadership. Currently, there is either one-man leadership or it is confined to a small coterie chosen by one personality. That is a choice which the BJP has made for itself.”
On the ongoing general election, Mr. Singh said it “is more about political rhetoric, there is no discussion on ideas and issues which will have an impact on our country. Rhetoric is replacing logic and the level of discussion is very low.”
He described as “grossly unjust” the BJP’s action against his son, Manvendra Singh, for campaigning for him during the elections. Manvendra was sacked from the BJP’s National Executive on April 10.

Nine borewells, 22 mini power pumps to augment water supply
","Pudukottai municipality has taken up a series of measures to augment drinking water supply in the wards by tapping into old tanks and other sources in the town that were catering to the drinking water needs of the people during the Pudukottai Samasthanam era.
Setting up of nine mega borewells and 22 mini power pumps have been taken up at an expenditure of Rs.1.14 crore sanctioned under the State Disaster Response Fund.
One of the bore wells, 800 feet in depth, set up at Mappillaiyarkulam, at an expenditure of Rs.5 lakh, will augment supply for about 500 households in wards 9,10,11, and parts of ward 3. Maiden tests for water supply were conducted on Friday evening. Municipal sources said that this was the first of the nine borewells that was being put to use.
The source at Mappillaiyarkulam is a good source of potable water and it would eventually be linked to the drinking water lines.
“It has been planned to supply water during the forenoon session. Based on technical details, it would be extended to evening session too,” sources said.
The civil works for setting up borewells one each at Kamarajapuram, Kakkachi Oorani, Sengaithoppe, and Samathuvapuram and three wells at Ammaiapatti were in progress.
“While the source at Ammaiapatti is fit for human consumption, water from other sources need to be analysed,” sources said.
In case the source does not meet human consumption norms, it would be supplied for other domestic use, sources added.

Tainted leaders in Fifth Phase in UP
","Last December, weeks after he was restored into the Samajwadi Party and declared its candidate in Sultanpur, Atiq Ahmed, the politician from Allahabad, stormed into the constituency with a cavalcade consisting of hundreds of vehicles. He was allegedly accompanied by gun-toting supporters, a claim he later dismissed. While the residents of Sultanpur were left shocked, the incident did not come as a surprise for many. Mr. Ahmed, 51, the alleged-mafia don-turned politician, faces 42 criminal cases, including charges like criminal intimidation, murder, attempt to murder, kidnapping and extortion and has been out on bail since February 2012 after spending four years in prison.
He has the distinction of being the first person to be booked under the State's notorious Gangster Act and stands trial in the murder of BSP MLA Raju Pal in 2005. Talking to The Hindu on his way to campaigning in Shrawasti, where he is now fielded, Mr. Ahmed hopes to convert that “negative publicity” into a winning formula backed by favourable Muslim-Yadav caste equation in the constituency. By his own admission he has been successful. “The media's publicity of me as a mafia don has helped increase my popularity. Badnaam hi sahi, popular toh ban rahe hai,” says Mr. Ahmed.
Ridden with poor infrastructure, Shrawasti is a backward constituency bordering with Nepal. Mr. Ahmed, who won the Phulpur Lok Sabha seat in 2004, has promised voters that he would convert the constituency in a tourist hub. In a recent public meeting in Balrampur, SP chief Mulayam Singh promised to provide a “special package” to the constituency. “Development is a key issue but my priority is to make Mulayam Singh the PM,” says Mr. Ahmed. “So every seat is precious.”
Mr. Ahmed faces sitting Congress MP Vinay Kumar Pandey, who has five declared criminal cases against him. Along with Mr. Ahmed, the fifth phase of the elections in UP on May 7 will decide the fate of many tainted leaders, most of them belonging to the Samajwadi Party. In Faizabad, SP MLA from Bikapur, Mitrasen Yadav, who has 15 criminal cases and a long history of criminal background and convictions against him will challenge sitting Congress MP and UPCC president Nirmal Khatri.
The BJP has fielded Lallu Singh, an accused in the Babri Masjid demolition while the BSP's candidate Jitendra Kumar Singh has 16 cases against him. In Kaiserganj, the BJP candidate and sitting MP Brij Bushan Sharan recently joined the party after quitting the SP also has a long criminal history and is also an accused in the Babri Masjid demolition. So is Pawan Pandey, the BSP candidate in Sultanpur, who has 32 criminal cases against him including murder and rioting. He will look to turn the Dalit-Brahmin equation in his favour to challenge BJP general secretary Varun Gandhi. In Sant Kabir Nagar, the SP has fielded Bal Chandra Yadav, who has 10 criminal cases against him, including attempt to murder. The party's sitting MPs and candidates in Fatehpur and Kaushambi, Rakesh Sachan and Shailendra Kumar also have criminal cases (8 and 4) against them.
In Phulpur, the sitting BSP MP Kapil Muni Karwariya has 4 criminal cases against him while the BJP candidate and MLA Keshav Prasad Maurya has 11, including murder and creating enmity between groups. The SP's candidate and former MP Dharamraj Patel also faces two criminal cases while the Congress candidate in Allahabad Nand Gupta Gopal Nandi faces seven.

Snoopgate probe: Amit Shah questions UPA’s moral authority
","Slamming UPA government’s move on snoopgate probe, Narendra Modi’s close aide Amit Shah on Saturday said it had no “moral or constitutional authority” to take decision on it at the fag-end of its tenure.
He blamed Congress’ “dirty tricks department” for the government’s move to appoint a judge to probe allegation of snooping of a young woman in Gujarat before the Lok Sabha poll process comes to an end on May 16.
The illegal surveillance was allegedly done at the behest of Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi and Shah was the Home Minister of the state during that period. There have been allegations that Shah himself was in regular touch with the officials involved in the alleged snooping.
“It is the Congress dirty tricks department which is behind the move to appoint the judge at the fag-end of the government’s tenure,” he said at a press conference here.
Mr Shah alleged that the Manmohan Singh dispensation has “lost constitutional and moral authority” to appoint a judge to conduct the probe “as the government is going”.
“The moral authority of the UPA government has ended. It has no constitutional authority either. Still, if they are doing this, they do not know why their government is going.”
Yesterday, the government had said a judicial commission to probe ‘snoopgate’ allegedly involving Mr Modi will be in place before the Lok Sabha poll process comes to an end on May 16.
The government had decided four months back to set up the inquiry commission but the process got delayed reportedly because of its inability to find a judge, who was ready to take the task.
The government had announced that the Commission, to be headed by a retired Supreme Court judge or a retired Chief Justice of a high court, will also look into charges of snooping on Himachal Pradesh Chief Minister Virbhadra Singh by the previous BJP government when he was in the opposition as well as the leaking of the call data records (CDR) of Jaitley in Delhi.

Seemandhra will join big league: Sonia
","Admitting that the decision to bifurcate Andhra Pradesh has caused much pain and heartburn to the people of Seemandhra, Congress president Sonia Gandhi said on Friday that the new State would develop into a powerful economic house, setting an example for other states in the country.
“I empathise with the people of Seemandhra and admit that the formation of the new State has caused great pain to the people, but I have no doubt that the hard working and intelligent people here will develop the new State as a model one,’’ Ms. Sonia Gandhi said at an election meeting on Andhra Muslim College campus here.
The turnout for Ms Gandhi’s maiden public meeting in Seemandhra after the State bifurcation was not to the satisfaction of the leadership despite the best efforts by Congress leaders to mobilise crowds. Only two days ago, party vice-president Rahul Gandhi had addressed a rally in Hindupur in Anantapur district.
Admitting that Hyderabad has been a bone of contention, Ms. Gandhi assured that Hyderabad would remain a common capital for 10 years and all procedures relating to admissions into educational institutions and quotas would continue for 10 years.
“This is my commitment to the people here. All educational opportunities will continue for 10 years, ‘’ she said.
Ms. Gandhi, who spoke in English reached out to the people by assuring that special development package which has been made part of A.P Reorganisation Bill-2013 would ensure comprehensive development of the region as 90 per cent of funding would be in the form of grants. Polavaram irrigation project has been given the national project status and two separate river boards would be set up for Krishna and Godavari river basins.
Later, Sonia Gandhi promised to enact laws bringing health security, shelter and pensions in unorganised sector under fundamental rights. Ms. Gandhi said that the right to health security, shelter and pension have been included in the party’s poll manifesto.
“Every eligible person would be given free medicine and free health care under the right to healthcare and would be provided a roof over his head under the right to shelter,’’ Ms. Gandhi said.
Earlier, Ms. Gandhi took pot shots at the TDP and BJP and said that both the parties were two sides of the same coin. “Why did the TDP not walk away from the NDA government after the Godhra riots in 2002? “A vote for TDP is a vote for communal forces,’’ Ms. Gandhi said.
Listing out the achievements of the Congress-led UPA governments, Ms. Gandhi said that several landmark legislations including the right to education, right to information and right to food have been passed by successive governments of UPA-1 and UPA-2.
“We take our promises seriously and implement them,’’ Ms. Gandhi said winding up her campaign in Seemandhra which goes to polls on May 7.
AICC in-charge of AP affairs Digvijaya Singh, Union Ministers K. Chiranjeevi, Panabaka Lakshmi, J.D Seelam, PCC president N. Raghuveera Reddy and former minister Kanna Lakshminarayana were present.

Centre fast-tracks process of devolution of funds
","With the appointed day, just a month away, the Union Government has expedited the process for apportioning the funds due under the 13th Finance Commission for the current financial year between Telangana and the successor State of Andhra Pradesh on the basis of population and other parameters.
The Finance Commission award would be in force till March 31, 2015, and thereafter the financial award of the 14th Finance Commission would come into effect from April 1 and be in force for five years, till March 31, 2020.
The 14th Finance Commission was constituted in January this year and it would submit its report and recommendations by October 31 for approval. However, when the terms of reference were notified for the new Finance Commission headed by Dr.Y.V. Reddy, Andhra Pradesh was a united State.
The Union Cabinet which met on Thursday therefore approved the proposal for insertion of additional term of reference in the notified terms of reference of the 14th Finance Commission. The Cabinet resolved that the Commission would also take into account the resources available to the two States post appointed day and make separate awards for Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. The Cabinet approved proposal would be sent to the President for his nod. The proposal was earlier vetted by the Ministry of Law and Justice.
The Finance Commission would make recommendations for the devolution of tax revenue from the Centre to the States and grants, basically to the panchayats and municipalities. Under the 13th Finance Commission, the united Andhra Pradesh had been allocated about Rs.20,000 crore under the tax devolution and another Rs.5,000 crore through grants for the current fiscal. This amount which has not been released will be released to the successor States after the appointed day.
While tax devolution to the two States will be on the basis of population, the grants would be based on different parameters, sources said.

Priyanka has pushed Rahul ‘out of the frame’, says Jaitley
","BJP leader Arun Jaitley on Friday said Priyanka Gandhi-Vadra had succeeded in “robbing the brother from being in the limelight” and pushed him “out of the frame”.
“Ostensibly intended to attack Narender Modi daily in somewhat impolite language, the sister has succeeded in robbing the brother from being in the limelight. Attack Modi was the strategy but ‘dilute Rahul’ is the consequence...
“Having pushed the brother out of the frame, the sister has to realise that there is much more in politics and the country than only ‘our family’,” Mr. Jaitley said in an article.
The BJP leader also charged the Congress with showing desperation, saying the likelihood of a BJP-NDA government at the Centre headed by Mr. Modi has resulted in courtesies and rationality slipping out of the Congress’ campaign.
Mr. Jaitley also urged his own partymen and supporters to concentrate only on three issues — development, leadership and stability.
“Visibly losing the vote of India the Congress created an impression that the heart and idea of India are still a Congress property. The argument did not cut much ice.
“The eclipse of Rahul Gandhi as the de facto prime ministerial candidate of Congress is virtually complete. When he was not seen as being able to deliver, the mother stepped in. The focus has now shifted to the sister,” he said.
Mr. Jaitley said there is a streak of “misguided aggression” in the Congress, as it was trying to leave the voters more and more confused.

Study charts a path for pedestrian facilities
","Any city to be called a developed city should not only have better road infrastructure for vehicles but should also be well-designed with accessible footpaths for pedestrians.
As the city’s vehicular population is burgeoning, the focus of the Chennai Corporation seems to have been on easing the traffic flow by increasing the width of roads. However, this development has meant that pedestrian space is compromised: the city’s footpaths seem to suffer from deficiencies in terms of design.
The Institute for Transportation and Development Policy (ITDP) has come out with an updated reference guide for footpath design standards, complimenting the IRC Guidelines.
The study, prepared by Advait Jani and Christopher Kost, has prepared a model footpath divided into frontage, pedestrian and furniture zones with different paths marked out for three different zones: residential, commercial and high-intensity commercial. The study prescribes that footpaths have a minimum width of 1.8 metres in residential areas and 2.5 metres in commercial areas.
The study, while describing the height and surface that need to be maintained for the footpath in each zone, has recommended that guide tiles be installed to assist persons with vision impairments. The footpath design shows that pedestrians, hawkers and commercial establishments could co-exist without any conflict by accommodating the hawkers in the pedestrian zone and earmarking structures that prove to be footpath impediments, including utility boxes, streetlights, manholes and trees, in the furniture zone.
The research on street design was done as part of ITDP’s ‘Better Streets, Better Cities: A Guide to Street Design in Urban India’, and is available at www.itdp.org/betterstreets.

Have you ever raised your hand to catch the railing on an MTC bus and found it broken, or jumped up from your seat as a nail poked you?
Many MTC passengers have for years raised complaints about poorly maintained MTC buses, but their woes have fallen on deaf ears.
There are nearly 3,500 MTC buses plying the city, serving lakhs of commuters. There are over 700 express buses, over 1,000 deluxe buses and nearly 100 Volvo buses. These have been purchased at a huge cost. But sadly, their maintenance has been found lacking.
“In most buses the handles on the railing are broken, the seats rickety and the buses dirty. It is with utmost care that we have to stand on the steps as many of them have developed cracks,” says M. Vijayakumar, a commuter.
Many who commute by the air-conditioned buses say there are cracks in the flooring. “This is because the chassis is low and gets damaged frequently. The maintenance of these buses has to be regular. Many passengers have complained that the cooling effect is poor,” a conductor of an MTC Volvo bus points out.
Many passengers point out that in many buses the driver’s seat is rickety. “This can lead to accidents. Besides, there is a lot of garbage in the bus and the MTC seems to be least bothered,” a retired MTC senior official says.

Doordarshan struggling to maintain freedom: Modi
","BJP’s prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi on Saturday expressed concern that public broadcaster >Doordarshan was struggling to maintain its professional freedom.

SC continues ban on green clearances to U’khand power projects
","The Supreme Court, on Wednesday, continued the ban on issuance of environmental and forest clearances to power projects in Uttarakhand.
The Supreme Court order dated August 13, 2013 said the Union Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) and the State government must “not grant any further environmental clearance or forest clearance for any hydroelectric power project (HEP) in the State of Uttarakhand, until further orders.”
The same order directed the MoEF to constitute an Expert Body to “assess whether the existing and ongoing/under-construction HEPs have contributed to the environmental degradation and, if so, to what extent.”
The Expert Body submitted its report on which the second hearing was held in the Supreme Court on Wednesday.
The Expert Body, in its report, had elucidated the catastrophic role played by the HEPs during the June, 2013 deluge in the State.
The Expert Body, in its recommendations in the report, rejected 23 HEPs with an installed capacity of 2,870 MW, out of the 24 HEPs that were proposed for reconsideration by the Dehradun-based Wildlife Institute of India (WII). Only one project – 195-MW Kotlibhel 1A – out of the 24 proposed projects was recommended for implementation by the Expert Body, but, with some modifications.
Taking cognizance of the recommendations of the report, the Supreme Court, on Wednesday, ordered that no construction work should proceed on the 24 projects.
Former IIM Bangalore Professor Bharat Jhunjhunwala, who is the petitioner in the case, said, “Since the Ravi Chopra report [the Expert Body report] recommended that Kotlibhel 1A could be only implemented after modifications, the Supreme Court, for now, has said that no construction work must be carried out in the 24 projects.”
In the fifth meeting of the Expert Body, which was held in the first week of March, two Central Water Commission (CWC) and Central Electricity Authority (CEA) representatives withdrew from the Export Body after entering into a heated conversation with the rest of the Expert Body members.
The CWC and the CEA, then, submitted a separate report based on the ‘Terms of Reference’ mentioned under the Supreme Court order of August 2013.
Sources in the Expert Body said that in the Supreme Court the MoEF tagged the Expert Body report as an ‘activists’ report.’ However, Mr Jhunjhunwala pointed out that nine out of the 11 members in the Expert Body held PhD degrees, and that the body had experts in rock mechanics, glaciology, among others, so that the report could not be termed as an ‘‘activists’ report.’
On Wednesday, the MoEF requested the Supreme Court for the permission to form another Committee to review the Expert Body report. However, sources said that the Supreme Court has asked the MoEF to give reasons for the same.

Given the fact that in most states the elections were only being held for the Lok Sabha, the voters were thinking clearly about the national picture and were keen on making Narendra Modi as Prime Minister, he said.

Uddhav backtracks after Saamna’s attack on Mumbai’s Gujaratis
","Barely a week after polling ended in Maharashtra, the strain within the Shiv Sena-BJP alliance has resurfaced.
On Thursday, the Shiv Sena’s newspaper Saamna carried a searing editorial on the occasion of Maharashtra Day against the Gujarati community in Mumbai, which has traditionally supported the BJP and now backs its prime ministerial candidate, Narendra Modi.
Twenty-four hours later, Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray has back-tracked. He appealed to the Gujarati community on Friday to be united with the local Marathi community for the forthcoming assembly elections as well.
But Mr Thackeray’s attempt at damage control does little to take the sting out of the strongly-worded editorial.
The piece criticised Gujarati traders in the city for not participating in the Maharashtra Day celebrations on May 1, and accused them of exploiting the city for personal gain. “The trading community used to say they had no connection with politics. But they rallied together to support the prime ministerial candidate from their community. But how many of them came down from their tall buildings to participate in Maharashtra Day celebrations?” it asked. The editorial asked if members of the trading community had paid tribute to the 105 martyrs of the Samyukta Maharashta movement.
The editorial then went on to issue a veiled threat. “Maharashtra has nurtured and given opportunities to many. But those who have no affection or respect for it should remember that the Martyrs’ Memorial at Hutatma Chowk shows a labourer with a flaming torch.” It ends by stating, “Gujaratis and other traders who came together with pride for Modi should do the same for Chhatrapati Shivaji’s Maharashtra.”
The editorial caused a ripple in political circles, leading to Mr Thackeray press statement on Friday. “In this election, the Gujarati and Marathi community came together strongly and this upset many others. Their attempts to divide us should be ignored. This unity will never be divided and there will be miraculous results,” he said.
BJP sources feel that the Shiv Sena’s editorial is a reaction to possible moves from Uddhav’s cousin and rival Raj Thackeray’s Maharashtra Navnirman Sena to play the Marathi card ahead of the assembly polls.
The BJP also played down the rift. “The Gujarati and Marathi community in Mumbai have always stood united in the name of Hindutva. Shiv Sena candidates have also been elected from Gujarati-dominated constituencies. Some people are trying to cause a divide between the Gujarati and Marathi people. The Shiv Sena should not fall for this game,” said senior BJP leader Vinod Tawde.
Meanwhile, the city’s powerful Gujarati community is upset. “It’s not true that Gujaratis have exploited Mumbai. We have lived here for generations and given a lot back to the city. Political parties woo us before elections but say such things later,” said Shantilal Maru, former leader of a Mumbai-based Kutchi organisation.
The president of the Bruhad Mumbai Gujarati Samaj Hemraj Shah said, “The martyrs for the Samyukta Maharashtra movement include Gujaratis as well. Our organisation paid tribute at the martyrs’ memorial. Why has the Shiv Sena suddenly raked up this issue?”

From diamonds to grain: Gujaratis in Mumbai

Mumbai is home to approximately 30 lakh Gujaratis, of whom around 22 lakh are registered voters according to the Bruhad Mumbai Gujarati Samaj. Maharashtra has around 60 lakh members of the community. Outside of Gujarat, Maharashtra is home to perhaps the largest population of Gujaratis.
The two states have strong historical links and were once part of the Bombay Presidency. The Samyukta Maharashtra movement later led to the formation of the Maharashtra state, with Mumbai as its capital.
The Gujarati community has a strong presence in business and trading. “ Ninety per cent of the diamond merchants in the city are Gujaratis. But we also employ a large number of Maharashtrians,” says Kirit Bhansali, convenor of the Bharat Diamond Bourse.
The community also dominates the metal, paper, textile and grain trade. It also has a significant presence in the stock market.

It’s a tough going for Buddha Prasad in Avanigadda
","The Mandali clan has been synonymous with the Congress for many decades and especially the family has been sailing with the party both in the good and bad times in Avanigadda – a place known for agriculture and aquaculture.
However, Congress-initiated bifurcation of Andhra Pradesh has changed political equation here, forcing veteran Congressman and former Minister Mandali Budda Prasad to call it quits and join hands with the Telugu Desam Party. He even managed to get the ticket to contest from the Avanigadda Assembly constituency. But Mr. Buddha Prasad is fighting this electoral battle with his back to the wall for many voters are yet to digest his betrayal to the Congress and most of his followers have left him in lurch and joined the YSR Congress.
For both seasoned politicians and chroniclers of politics, his joining the yellow brigade was unpalatable for he was known for his uprightness and values. “As a die-hard integrationist, he should have joined the Jai Smaikyandhra Party, which was floated to fight for the unified Andhra Pradesh with former Chief Minister N. Kiran Kumar Reddy at the helm of affairs. He (Mr. Buddha Prasad) knows that by joining the Jai Samaikyandhra Party he can’t prosper as a politician. He is power conscious politician and can’t live it,” opined Avala Maruti, a former Congress leader.
Mr. Buddha Prasad joined the TDP when there was a wave in favour of the party during the municipal and panchayat elections. However, post TDP-BJP alliance, the YSRC has gained the edge. With his followers and vote bank drifting to YSRC, the 57-year-old Kapu leader now is on the back foot for he has also alienated the Muslim votes.
The TDP cadre is also not happy at the party high command’s decision to ignore sitting MLA Ambati Srihari Prasad, son of late Telugu Desam leader Ambati Brahmanaiah, who contested and won the by-election after his father’s death. The followers of Mr. Ambati are apparently seething with anger and in no mood to support Mr. Budda Prasad, who is considered an outsider. He is also having tough time in cooling the TDP dissident, Kantamaneni Ravishankar, who filed nomination as a rebel candidate before opting out of the race. He is also facing the heat from YSRCP candidate Simhadri Ramesh and also giving him nightmares is the Congress candidate Mathi Srinivasa Rao.

BJP playing communal card: Sibal
","The Congress on Saturday accused the Bharatiya Janata Party of vitiating the environment by playing the “communal card,” even as Prime Minister Manmohan Singh condemned violence in Assam.Addressing a press conference here, Congress leader Kapil Sibal said “the credit for the present communal environment goes to Narendra Modi,” who, he added, “stands for Model of Dividing India.”
“I don’t blame anyone baselessly and without any proof,” Mr. Sibal said when asked whether he blamed Mr. Modi for the Assam riots.
“Creating a national divide by polarising the polity for political dividends has been the strategy of the BJP. Whenever they find that their chances of acceptability are at their nadir, they play the communal card. Mr. Advani did this by launching the Rath Yatra [in 1990] and the BJP played the communal card by being instrumental in demolishing the Babri Masjid. Mr. Modi did this by polarising the polity in Gujarat,” Mr. Sibal charged.
Releasing photographs allegedly taken from Twitter accounts of BJP leaders, Mr. Sibal said the pictures of events in Pakistan, Palestine and Bangladesh were being shown on these Twitter handles as occurring in India to communalise the atmosphere.
One such picture was from Bangladesh but the caption said Bangladeshi Muslims were burning the tricolour in Assam. The Congress also highlighted purported speeches of senior BJP leaders with strong communal overtones.
Meanwhile, Prime Minister, who is keeping a close watch on the Assam situation, spoke to Home Minister Sushilkumar Shinde and Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi and directed them to take urgent steps to restore normalcy in the disturbed areas.
Expressing “shock and grief” over the killings, a PMO statement said “such attacks are cowardly attempts to spread fear and terror among our citizens.” Dr. Singh asked the people to remain calm and ignore rumours as the Centre and the State Government would take all measures to maintain law and order and restore normality.
Condemning the violence, BJP spokesperson Ravi Shankar Prasad blamed the State government for not taking timely action. While demanding the arrest of the guilty, he blamed the tension in Assam on vote-bank politics.
“We have some questions for Manmohan Singh, who has been a member of the Rajya Sabha from Assam for 24 years and Premier for 10 years. Tarun Gogoi has been Chief Minister for 14 years. This is the third clash between Bodos and Bangladeshi immigrants,” Mr. Prasad said.
On Mr. Sibal’s charge that the riots were caused by Mr. Modi’s remark that Bangladeshi immigrants should pack their bags and be prepared to leave after May 16, Mr. Prasad said: “He (Sibal) will be back to practising law in a fortnight.”
Communist Party of India (Marxist) general secretary Prakash Karat, too, attributed the attacks to the constant propaganda that all Muslims in Assam were Bangladeshis, especially, if they were Bengali Muslims.

Modi claim of friendship a complete lie: Ahmed Patel
","The controversy over Narendra Modi’s interview to Doordarshan intensified on Friday with Sonia Gandhi’s political aide Ahmed Patel refuting the BJP prime ministerial candidate’s claims of closeness between them, saying the remarks were “baseless” and “a complete lie.“
He said Modi’s “ridiculous” claims of their meeting or the two sharing friendship were a “political stunt” to create “confusion” in the midst of election and offered to quit public life if there was any proof that he had taken favours from the Gujarat Chief Minister.
“This is a political stunt to create confusion and create a cloud of doubt in the midst of elections. How can Modi be able to make friendship with me when he has never been able to strike friendship within his own party?”, he said.
Insisting that he never had any meeting with Modi either in his office or at his residence, Patel insisted that he had not taken any favour from the Gujarat Chief Minister. He said that Modi did come to his place for lunch when he was BJP general secretary in the eighties.
Besides that, “I never had any one—to—one meeting with Modi before or after the communal riots in Gujarat in 2002.”
Modi, in an
> interview to Doordarshan, had said: “Ahmedbhai has been one of my very good friends in Congress. He is not so now. Perhaps he is having some difficulty now and he avoids me as he does not take even my phone calls.
“I used to go to his residence to dine with him. It was a good friendship and I believe that personal friendship should remain,” he said.
“We never used to call him Ahmedbhai. For years, we used to call him Babubhai. This is not known outside. For us Ahmedbhai was Babubhai. But in public life he has to be given respect. It will not look good if I call him Babubhai. Calling him Mian Sahab is very honourable and I use this honourable word,” he said responding to questions, including as to why he used to call Patel ‘Mianbhai’
Responding to this, Patel said: “I do not know who are and who are not his friends in Congress, but if somebody is saying that I was very close to him or is very close friend....It is all to create doubts in the midst of elections. It is all baseless and ridiculous, a complete lie. If he proves that I ever visited his house or his office or taken any favour, I will quit public life”.

“Explosives control bureau need of the hour""
","The Union government should allow the State governments to enact their own laws to deal with manufacture, possession, transport and use of explosives, and set up an explosives control bureau with an intelligence wing on a par with the Narcotics Control Bureau, noted forensic expert P. Chandrasekaran has said, reacting to the bomb blasts on a train in the Chennai Central.
The scientist,  Mr. Chandrasekaran, former director of the Forensic Department in the State, wanted the police to use explosive detectors instead of metal detectors.
 He said that even in the laws dealing with procurement of explosives, there were lacunae, as tracking the procurement of explosives rested with the Controller of Explosives in Nagpur. The Controller is governed by rules of the Explosive Substances Act, 1908. This law largely looked into factors pertaining to the prevention of crimes, unlawful and malicious act.
“The controller has very meagre staff and is suffering from lack of intelligence inputs. He comes into the picture only after an incident takes place,” explained Dr Chandrasekaran, who had made many investigative breakthroughs, including those in the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case.
 He said even the Explosives Act, 1884 had became obsolete. “In countries such as the U.S., mayors of cities were entitled to chalking out their own laws with regard to explosives. Records of each individual transporting explosive material are maintained and even his fingerprints are kept,” he said.
 If a person involved in ordinary quarrying had procured explosives more than his regular requirement, the information should be collected for reference.

Omar blames Modi for ‘inciting violence’ in Assam
","Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah on Saturday blamed Narendra Modi for inciting violence in Assam that left 32 Muslims dead.
“In Assam, 30 Muslims were murdered. Why? Because BJP prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi made a speech there and tried to incite people against Muslims. This is a fact. This truth cannot be denied,” Omar told an election rally at Tangmarg in Baramulla Lok Sabha constituency.
Omar said that Modi, in his election rally in Assam three days earlier, had branded all Muslims living in that State as “Bangladeshis”, which resulted in the attacks on them, he claimed.
“Three days earlier, he (Modi) went there and branded all Muslims as Bangladeshis and today 30 Muslims have been put to sleep in the grave,” he alleged.
Referring to Modi’s statement holding National Conference leaders responsible for exodus of Kashmiri Pandits, Omar said the BJP leader had set out to insult all Kashmiris in the country.
Omar also accused the BJP of wanting to divide Jammu and Kashmir into three parts.
Baramulla Lok Sabha constituency along with Ladakh Lok Sabha constituency in Jammu and Kashmir will go to the polls on May 7.

Hope Island voters feel let down
","At a time when the Election Commission is keen on setting up polling stations within a radius of 2 km of the voter’s residence, people residing in Hope Island, an island situated off the coast of Kakinada, are forced to undertake a tedious journey to exercise their franchise. Of the total population of 343 in the fishermen hamlet located on the island, there are 101 male voters and 115 female voters, who have to reach their polling station at Chinna Boddu Venkatayapalem village, near Tallarevu.
From their hamlet, the voters, including the aged and pregnant, have to reach Kakinada by boat. This journey takes nearly two hours. From Kakinada, all of them have to depend on private transport to reach the polling station, as public transport is not available from Kakinada shore to Chinna Boddu Venkatayapalem village. All these voters belong to Mummidivaram Legislative Assembly constituency, which is a part of the Amalapuram Parliamentary constituency.
According to a resident of Hope Island, a polling station was set up on the island only once when the late N.T. Rama Rao contested the elections for the first time (in 1983). Since then, voters have been casting their vote somewhere in Tallarevu. Despite several requests, there is no response from the officials concerned to arrange for polling facility in the hamlet. Interestingly, district officials have arranged for polling stations in hamlets like Kondamodalu, Manturu and Talluru in Devipatnam mandal, where polling staff can reach only by boat.

Delhi Metro to construct underpass
","The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation has now been asked by the Delhi Government’s Public Works Department to construct an underpass for traffic on Benito Juarez Marg that will enable a right turn towards Ring Road and also towards San Martin Marg on the other side of Ring Road.
“The design is being worked out. Since the Delhi Metro has already constructed overground and laid the foundation, we will ask them to construct the underpass as well,” said a senior PWD official.
The tendering for the project will commence after May 16 when the model code of conduct will no longer be in force.
The underpass will cross the entire stretch of the road with two ramps on both sides, said the official, one leading towards Jesus & Mary College and one towards the Ring Road. The proposal for the underpass was put forward to decongest the Rao Tula Ram Marg and Dhaula Kuan and to fully utilise the Benito Juarez Marg for traffic coming from the airport and National Highway-8. So far a right turn was not provided to go towards Moti Bagh and New Delhi.
The proposal for the underpass has been previously screened and passed by both the Unified Traffic and Transportation (Planning and Engineering) Centre (UTTIPEC) and the Delhi Urban Arts Commission. The last governing body of the UTTIPEC also saw representatives from the PWD, the Traffic Police and the Delhi Metro participate.
The proposed underpass is part of a long term measure to improve traffic flow on RTR Marg that also includes construction of a three-lane flyover parallel to the RTR flyover that will extend the existing Munirka flyover by a kilometre.
In March this year, the Delhi Government had granted the sanction for the project.

Insulation from ideological assault
","India is in the midst of a high voltage election, which commentators and politicians alike have described as the battle for the idea of India. And yet, there is nothing remarkable about the face-off between the ideas of secularism and Hindu nationalism. Ideological polarisation is a staple of most democracies across the world. Still, we continue to witness fear and concern at the prospect of Narendra Modi becoming the next Prime Minister.
The fact that this fear persists, in spite of India’s proud record of holding regular elections, reveals something deeply disturbing about the Indian state; a state that is governed, first and foremost, by a Constitution. Built into that Constitution are checks and balances and they are backed by an independent judiciary, the president, the opposition, a free press, and civil society. Meanwhile, public institutions like the civil services and the armed forces have their own institutional norms and gatekeepers tasked with the responsibility of protecting these institutions from political pressure. If we think Mr. Modi will be able to ride roughshod over these institutions and bend them according to his whims, then something very significant has gone wrong already.
It is still in the public’s collective memory that India’s institutions were trampled over by the will of a few powerful individuals during the Emergency period of 1975 to 1977. Some fear that if it could have happened once, it could happen again. But it should not, not if a proper inquiry is conducted and policy recommendations are implemented.
In the case of the Emergency, the inquiry was conducted by the Shah Commission, which found that former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and a list of individuals, whose careers seemingly did not suffer after the Commission’s publication, subverted both the Maintenance of Internal Security Act and the Defence of India Act in order to damage political opponents. It also found that numerous officers from the Indian Administrative Service accepted orders from above even though they believed these orders were made on improper political motives. Still, the Shah Commission report was, by most accounts, stillborn, and very little was done after the Emergency to ensure that India’s institutions prevail, regardless of the leadership.
The pogroms against Sikhs in Delhi in 1984 and against Muslims in Gujarat in 2002 also remain in the public’s collective memory, reminding us that similar incidents could happen again. The police and civil bureaucracy could look the other way as citizens are butchered for days before the Army is called out to put a halt to the violence.
If institutions like the intelligence services (currently without legislative oversight), the police, civil bureaucracy, and the courts are protected from capture, citizens know that they can turn to them when a governing party transgresses their rights. In other words, when institutions rule, citizens enjoy protections, irrespective of the party or individuals in power. India rightfully takes pride in her longstanding record of peaceful transfer of power after every election. But this transfer should also be free of fear for all her citizens.
So why has so little been done in response to the Shah Commission and similar reports? The answer may lie in the fact that elections are often viewed as the means to institutional capture in India. It is understood that the party in government can bend institutional rules to fulfil its agenda. This is partly a design problem, with some of the public institutions not enjoying the kind of autonomy that would protect them from the ideological changes that often accompany electoral swings in democratic countries. But it is also an erosion problem whereby normal institutional behaviour has gradually been subverted to meet political objectives. Today, if the worry is indeed that India’s critical institutions do not have the strength to withstand an ideological assault on their norms, then Mr. Modi is just a symptom of a much larger problem: weak institutional design in need of fire-walling from political pressures. Moreover, the blame for undermining the autonomy of these institutions and the failure to bolster their design is shared by all major political parties.
Even as some worry that a coalition government led by Mr. Modi will threaten the idea of India, we must remember that India’s state institutions are the premier embodiment of this idea, and therefore, we must ask why that idea is so defenceless in the first place.

‘PM prefers Vizag as capital’
","Prime Minister Manmohan Singh prefers Visakhapatnam as capital of the residual Andhra Pradesh, Vice-Chairman of the National Disaster Management Authority Marri Shashidhar Reddy revealed here on Friday.
He and Tribal Welfare Minister V. Kishore Chandra Deo were discussing the issue some time ago (it may be recalled that Mr. Deo strongly advocates Visakhapatnam as capital) along with the Prime Minister and when Dr. Manmohan Singh was asked what city would be the best suited as capital of AP, he felt Visakhapatnam must be made capital, Mr. Shashidhar Reddy said. He and BJP national spokesman Prakash Javadekar were addressing members of the Vizagapatam Chamber of Commerce and Industry after the organisation held a meeting with contestants to Lok Sabha from Visakhapatnam constituency.
Mr. Reddy wanted the chamber and locals to make proper representation on Visakhapatnam as capital to the five-member expert committee formed by the Union Government with former Union Minister K. Sivaramakrishnan to decide on the capital for the residual AP. He also wanted all the concerned to ensure peaceful atmosphere of the city prevailed.
“AP has a great future and its long coastline will be of great help,” he said. He also noted that land prices in AP region have gone up and in Telangana it was showing a downward trend.
Mr. Shashidhar Reddy, whose son was born here, recalled his several visits to the city as Minister for Environment and its status as the most polluted city. If proper care was taken, Visakhapatnam would become a world class city, he felt.
Mr. Javadekar also expressed his appreciation for the city. “It is a pleasant city and looks completely different from other cities,” he said.
As many as one crore people registering themselves as new voters on March 9 indicated the great awareness among people about the elections and it was also a great boost to the democracy and indicative of progress of the nation, Mr. Javadekar said.

Snoopgate

Referring to Union Home Minister Sushil Kumar Shinde’s comment that a judge would be appointed to head the Commission of Inquiry into the snoopgate issue, Mr. Naidu accused the Congress of acting “shamelessly” and displaying mean mentality. Questioning the propriety of appointing a commission by a government which was “on its way out”, he said it only showed the frustration and desperation of the ruling party.

Doordarshan interview

Taking exception to Doordarshan editing portions of the interview given by BJP Prime Ministerial candidate, Narendra Modi, he demanded the government to come out with a white paper on the time allotted to each political party and its leaders during the last 100 days. He alleged that Prasar Bharathi was given clear instructions that Mr. Modi should be “blocked” and the focus should be Congress president Sonia Gandhi and its vice-president Rahul Gandhi.

Lok Sabha polls

He claimed that BJP and its NDA allies would cross the 300 mark in Lok Sabha elections, while the Congress would get its lowest number of seats. He said the Third Front was a “tried and failed experiment”. Patchwork would not do for the country.
Mr. Naidu predicted that BJP-TDP alliance would get clear majority in the Assembly seats in Seemandhra region. “It is one-way in Seemandhra… that is Modi-way and for Congress, it is no-way,” he added. People in Seemandhra were appreciative of the role by BJP in Parliament in extracting assurances for the region during the passage AP Reorganisation Bill.
He said he was expecting good results for the alliance in Telangana too.

BJP’s track record in Seemandhra poor
","The brand image of prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi may give the much needed push to the BJP in the general elections in Seemandhra, but the track record of the party is not on its side going by its dismal show in Parliamentary elections since the heady days of its parent organisation Bharatiya Jana Sangh (BJS).
BJS has fielded candidates in 1971, which was 20 years after it came into existence as the political arm of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), for only three Parliamentary constituencies – Kakinada (P.V.N. Raju), Guntur (Jupudi Yagnya Narayana Rao) and Nellore (SC) (B. Lakshman) and all of them stood second.
There was not even a single candidate of BJS in the fray in what is today called Seemandhra in elections held in 1952, 1962, 1967 and in 1977 when it ceased to exist.
M. Venkaiah Naidu was the only BJP candidate in entire Seemandhra, from Bapatla in 1989 and he lost to S. Benjamin of Indian National Congress (INC) by 43,620 votes.
The BJP had fielded candidates for 26 out of 27 constituencies in 1991 and it had to be content with the third slot in 25 constituencies.
Similar was the party’s performance in 1996 when most of the candidates fielded in 25 constituencies stood fourth.
Candidates of NTR-TDP (LP) fared better than those of BJP.
Out of 24 candidates in 27 constituencies, only two won – U.V. Krishnam Raju from Kakinada and G. Venkata Swamy Naidu from Rajahmundry in 1998. They defeated Thota Gopalakrishna (INC) and M.V.V.S. Murthy (TDP) respectively by impressive margins.
In 1999, BJP’s S.P.P.B.K. Satyanarayana Rao won from Rajahmundry, U.V. Krishnam Raju from Narasapuram and N. Venkata Swamy from Tirupati.
They defeated Chitturi Ravindra, Kanumuri Bapiraju and Chinta Mohan who were all Congress candidates.

BJP, EC headed for showdown
","The BJP and the Election Commission appeared headed for a showdown after the Varanasi district administration on Wednesday denied permission to the party’s prime ministerial candidate, Narendra Modi, to hold an election meeting in the city on Thursday.
The refusal angered the BJP, which shot off letters to the commission alleging “partisan behaviour” by Returning Officer Pranjal Yadav and declared that senior leaders Arun Jaitley, Amit Shah and Laxmikant Bajpai would stage a sit-in at the Lanka Gate of Banaras Hindu University.
But the Election Commission rejected the BJP’s charge of bias. “Local authorities, the district administration there, who are directly in charge of law and order, have their assessment in the matter,” Deputy Election Commissioner Vinod Zutshi told presspersons in New Delhi. “The commission does not accept the insinuation of inaction or bias.”
Mr. Modi, who is the BJP’s candidate from Varanasi, was to address two rallies in the constituency, in Beniabagh, a minority-dominated area in the heart of the city, and at Jagat Inter College Ground at Rohaniya on the Banaras-Allahabad road.
While the district authorities gave the go-ahead for the Rohaniya meeting, they denied him permission to address the rally in Beniabagh, citing security concerns.
Mr. Modi’s proposed meeting with some intellectuals in the city and a puja on the banks of the Ganga were also at first disallowed. But late in the evening, the district administration gave permission for them.
Mr. Jaitley alleged that the Returning Officer was interfering in the conduct of free and fair elections.

In Uttarakhand, Modi comes first, not the Ganga
","Ashrams line the banks of the Ganga in Uttarkashi, Rishikesh and Hardwar. While sadhus believe they have a close connect with ‘Ganga maa’ (mother), so do many Bharatiya Janata Party stalwarts. However, the electorate seems more attracted to the ‘Modi factor’ than the cause of the Ganga.
Gaumukh, which is the source of the Ganga, is located in Uttarkashi district. Vikas Kalura, a resident of Uttarkashi’s Joshiyara area, said, “The BJP takes up the >issue of the Ganga so that the media picks it up and a wave is generated in favour of the BJP.”
“I will be voting for the BJP this time but not because they would do something for the Ganga. They haven’t done much for the river except raising their voices for it,” Mr. Kalura said, adding the anti-incumbency against the Congress was working in favour of the BJP.
BJP leader Uma Bharti, who is the election in-charge for Uttarakhand, in all her recent media addresses in State capital Dehradun, has spoken about “conservation of the Ganga.”
Mukul Sharma, in his paper, ‘Passages from Nature to Nationalism: Sunderlal Bahuguna and Tehri Dam Opposition in Garhwal’, published in the Economic and Political Weekly, states: ‘…. often making partnership with Hindutva politics. Ganga becomes holier and holiest. The ecological reasoning is blurred and goes beyond logic, eliciting Hindu patriotism and xenophobia.’
“Big dams or small dams, this debate will happen later. We want the flow of the Ganga to remain uninterrupted and the holy water to remain clean,” Ms. Bharti said at Ganga Samvad, a seminar on methods and reasons to conserve the flow of the Ganga which was held in Dehradun in January this year.
‘Sparsh Ganga Abhiyan’ — a campaign for cleaning up the Ganga — was launched in 2010 when BJP leader Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank, who is the BJP’s Lok Sabha candidate from the Hardwar seat, was chief minister.
According to Mr. Nishank, 40,000 youngsters were connected to the Sparsh Ganga Board, but with the end of the BJP government in the State, the ‘Sparsh Ganga Abhiyan’ also took a back seat.
However, BJP leaders often proclaim that they are not anti-development, and by “conservation of the Ganga” they do not mean they are anti-dams.
Addressing a rally in Tehri constituency’s Vikas Nagar area on Tuesday, the BJP’s prime ministerial candidate, Narendra Modi, said, “The Ganga maiya [mother] gives life to the countrymen …. why should we not ponder upon the ways in which Ganga maiya can transform the lives of the people of this region.”
At a rally in Dehradun in December last year, Mr. Modi had pointed out the water potential of the State while stating that the country should not be without electricity with the State’s immense hydropower resources. Many people in the Chadeti village, in Uttarkashi district’s Bhatwari Block, have still not received their compensation after the June disaster last year. Rajesh Rawat, a resident of the village, said: ""We don’t support the BJP because it takes up the issue of the Ganga. We support it because we believe it will work for the development of our area.”

KWA pins hopes on a check-dam
","In spite of the brief spell of summer rain in north Kerala, the water supply situation in Kasaragod town is grim. Residents predominantly depend on the saline water supplied by the Kerala Water Authority (KWA).
Some of the 14 rivers in the district are already going dry. Subsequently, the district is faced with the depletion of groundwater level. Bore-wells are fast replacing conventional wells. Farmers are at the mercy of the rain to protect the standing crops.
The town relies on the KWA to meet its drinking water requirements. Various organisations and citizens’ groups had protested against the supply of saline water by the KWA from a makeshift check-dam at Bavikara. The KWA cited tidal action during the month as reason for the saline infusion.
The KWA water had 1,250-mg salinity, as per studies, and various organisations had staged demonstration in front of the KWA office here accusing the government machinery of failing to complete the Rs.8.20-crore check-dam at Bavikara. The project was conceived over three decades ago.
The work got stuck midway due to technical reasons and the Minor Irrigation Department, tasked with the construction, submitted a fresh proposal to the Water Resources Department on April 25. The cost was put at Rs.11.05 crore and it was awaiting nod, KWA Executive Engineer K.R. Venugopalan told The Hindu.
If sanctioned, the department would be able to complete the work by June next, he said. The stalled work could have been completed before this monsoon had the department received timely direction from the higher authorities, he said.
A senior official of the Groundwater Department disagreed with the idea of constructing a check-dam as a solution to drinking water problems.
Long-term plans, including curbs on crusher-stone units, were required. Bore-wells should not be allowed as it allows no time for replenishment of the water table, he said. The water table was now down by over a metre, the highest ever recorded in the district, he said.
There was an urgent need to accord top priority to groundwater replenishment activities. Rainwater harvesting units should be set up on the premises of houses, government offices, parks, playgrounds, and schools, he said.
The building bylaw of the Kasargod municipality mandates the setting up of such units in all houses, he added.

Why am I being singled out by Jayalalithaa, asks DMK chief
","DMK president M. Karunanidhi on Saturday wondered why he was being singled out by Chief Minister Jayalalithaa for the remarks he expressed on the May Day twin blasts on a train at Chennai Central when leaders of various other political parties had also spoken out on the issue.
On Friday, the AIADMK chief accused Mr. Karunanidhi of indulging in “armchair” criticism that the police had failed to take proper steps to avert the blasts. Citing the bomb blasts in the State which occurred during the DMK regime in 1997 and 1998, she had stated that Mr. Karunanidhi criticising the May Day train blasts was like “devil quoting the scripture.”
In a statement here on Saturday, Mr. Karunanidhi recalled that immediately after the explosions on February 14, 1998, in Coimbatore, he informed the then Prime Minister, I.K. Gujaral, who assured him of all assistance.
The very next day, he visited the place, along with Tamil Maanila Congress founder G.K. Moopanar and a host of officials, to console the injured.
“When the blasts in Coimbatore occurred, I…went there and consoled the injured. Should not Ms. Jayalalithaa have come to Chennai and consoled those hurt in the blasts [on a train at Chennai Central]?” he asked.

Bent on maintaining accuracy before declaring poll results: CEO
","The Chief Electoral Officer Praveen Kumar on Wednesday said that the Election Commission was bent on ensuring accuracy and the satisfaction of the stake holders before announcing the poll results.
Noting that extra time would be taken to announce the results this time, Mr. Praveen Kumar said this was due to increase in polling stations, more contesting candidates and extra rounds.
Making a comparison between 2009 and 2014 Parliamentary elections, Mr. Kumar said the number of polling stations in Tamil Nadu had increased from 52,000 to 60,000.
We are not in a race to announce the results as accuracy and satisfaction of the stake holders are important to the Election Commission, Mr. Kumar told reporters in Tiruchi. He was in the city to conduct a regional level training class for Returning Officers, District Election Officers, Assistant Returning Officers and nodal officers of eight districts in respect of counting of votes.
The second round would begin only after the completion of the first round and result displayed on the board and copies handed out to the agents, he said.
Mr. Kumar said the police had been asked to bring maximum poll-related cases to the court before May 16 when counting of votes is slated.
Over 3,600 election cases had been registered across the State in the run up to the Parliamentary polls, of which 1,500 cases were in various courts.
Conviction had been given in 200 cases, he said adding that the Election Commission was obtaining a daily report on the progress of these cases.
Replying to a query, Mr. Kumar said maximum efforts had been taken by the Election Commission to check distribution of cash in the run up to the elections.
Imposition of Section 144 in Tamil Nadu on the eve of polling had also helped to a large extent in checking it.
However, he said the officials had seized Rs. 55 lakhs from April 22 night to April 23rd night across the State notwithstanding the imposition of Section 144.
The Election Commission had put in place a set of regulations for the counting centres where multiple-layers of security would be in vogue.
The central para-military force personnel would be deployed at the counting hall, he added.

AAP gathers strength in Varanasi
","In the shadow of a statue of revolutionary Chandrashekhar Azad, at a busy intersection at Lahurabir, a mahila panchayat is in full swing. It is around 5 pm on Thursday, and the street play mimics the manner in which politicians of various hues make their pitch, from the musclemen to those use allurements such as alcohol. But the chief target is the BJP’s prime ministerial candidate, Narendra Modi, who is contesting from >Varanasi.
Women’s groups from across the State have gathered in Varanasi to conscientise women on the significance of their vote and to urge them to use the ballot to defeat Mr. Modi. While there is some soul searching on whether to name the candidate who people should vote for, Padma Singh, one of the organizers says, “If we don’t name one person, the votes will get divided – so we are pitching for AAP.”
As election day draws near, across Varanasi, all those who want to defeat or at least, ensure that the margin of Mr. Modi’s victory is reduced, are gradually veering towards >the Aam Aadmi Party’s Arvind Kejriwal again, after a brief hiatus in which it had seemed as though the Congress’s Ajay Rai, a Bhoomihar strongman who has the backing of his one lakh strong community might pose a greater challenge, especially after the Quami Ekta Party (QED) withdrew its candidate, Mukthar Ansari, declaring it would back the Congress.
The Janata Dal-United has declared support for AAP here, and Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar as well as senior party leader Sharad Yadav are expected here shortly to campaign for Mr. Kejriwal.
But it’s evident that while the three-lakh strong Muslim community is working to ensure that its votes don’t get divided, there is little enthusiasm amongst its members for the Congress candidate nor has the QED’s endorsement worked.
It’s late evening in Madanpura, a Muslim -dominated locality, home to many of the city’s famous trade in Banarasi saris. “The people have seen the Congress, it has done little except increase prices; worse, its candidate is a muscleman. And we wont’ vote for Modi,” says HM Sagheer, who has a dry fruits business, “maybe we should try AAP…but we haven’t yet made up our minds.” Akram Burari who is in the Banarasi sari trade, says, “Kejriwal could pose a challenge and no, the QED’s endorsement is worthless.” Indeed, most >Muslims appeared to be veering towards Mr. Kejriwal, even though they all maintained that they would wait till closer to Election Day to take a final decision.
At the office of the Momin Conference that has lent its support – and precincts in Sigra - to the AAP, Sanjeev Singh, a young lawyer and AAP activist – the original party candidate - is full of enthusiasm for the Kejriwal campaign that now has 55,000 volunteers registered manually, and another 17, 000 online. “We are fighting two people who have broken the law, one on a large scale, and the other on a smaller,” Mr. Singh says, stressing that apart from its national pitch of bringing in a new kind of politics marked by integrity and concern for the common man, the party has taken up local issues – from the concerns of the weavers’ community, to opposition in one of the rural segments against a Coca Cola factory that has depleted the ground water.
The energy visible at the AAP office is missing at the Congress headquarters: though packed with workers, there is an air of lethargy. A spat breaks out between two workers here, with one accusing the other of lounging around instead of getting out into the heat and dust to campaign: the response: “I can’t leave –I’m on protocol duty, waiting to receive senior leaders from Delhi.”
In sharp contrast, even though most people here believe that Mr. Modi is a shoo-in, the BJP is taking no chances, shipping in people from across the country to its expensively appointed hi-tech office here. Former IAS officer KJ Alphons, for instance, has come from Kerala, as has Dr. Jaychandran, an Ayurvedic doctor now based in Ahmedabad – the latter describes himself as part of Mr. Modi’s core team. Their task? To mobilize the South Indian vote in the city.
If the BJP is working towards ensuring Mr. Modi wins by three lakh votes, the AAP and its growing band of well-wishers are working to close that gap. Varanasi has become more than just another VIP electoral contest – it has become the site of a battle to preserve the city’s boast of being a symbol of India’s syncretic culture.

Complaint against Minister for ‘threatening’ journalist
","Minister of State for Youth Services, Sports and Fisheries K. Abhayachandra Jain is reported to have threatened a reporter of a regional newspaper here on Thursday, resulting in the latter filing a complaint against the Minister in the jurisdictional Moodbidri police station.
Police Commissioner R. Hithendra said the Moodbidri police had received a complaint from Yashodhar Kotian, the reporter, alleging that the Minister had threatened that Congress workers would attack him for publishing a report. The police have since initiated an investigation into the complaint.
The reporter alleged that he was threatened when he called the Minister to seek his reaction about a report on a power project.
The report pertained to a letter written by Chief Minister Siddaramaiah to the Union government stating that the State government was interested in going ahead with the thermal power project at Niddodi while the Minister is opposed to it.
The former Deputy Chief Minister K.S. Eshwarappa has criticised Mr. Jain for his alleged conduct with the journalist. “Mr. Jain should apologise for his conduct and resign from the Ministry. If he does not do so, the Chief Minister should remove him,” he said.
The Dakshina Kannada Working Journalists Association has also criticised Mr. Jain. By threatening a journalist, Mr. Jain had created a sense of fear among people, Harish Rai, president of the association, said.
A protest has been planned outside the office of the Deputy Commissioner here on Saturday.

Modi takes jibe at Mamata over ‘paper tiger’ comment
","Taking a jibe at >Mamata Banerjee over her “paper tiger” comment, BJP prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi on Sunday said that a real tiger is one who jails those involved in the Sharada chit fund scam and gets back money of the poor.
Mr. Modi also said that Ms. >Banerjee’s attack on him would not deter him in helping Bengal if BJP comes to power at the Centre and a strong BJP government would also ensure that the West Bengal Chief Minister does her job seriously.
“A tiger is the one who sends those involved in Sharada chit fund scam to jail, investigate the matter and get back the money of the poor.
“I am surprised. Didi, why are you afraid of a paper tiger. If a paper tiger has proved this costly for her, then what will happen if a real tiger comes before you,” Mr. Modi said while addressing a rally in Bankura.
The BJP’s prime ministerial candidate said the real tigers of Bengal were its youth.
Three days back, Ms. >Banerjee had taken swipe at Mr. Modi, saying there was a difference between a ‘paper tiger’ and a Royal Bengal Tiger.
Mr. Modi said that “Didi’s” attack on him will not be an impediment for Bengal and its development, if BJP comes to power.”
The Gujarat Chief Minister said that he does not believe in politics of “revenge” (badla), but politics of “badlav (change).
“Didi has bad-mouthed me, launched attacks and levelled false charges. But let me assure you that I will serve people of Bengal and work for them. I believe in politics of change and not revenge,” he said, adding that Bengal had suffered injustice for 60 years because of the central government.
The West Bengal Chief Minister and Mr. Modi have engaged in verbal slugfest over several issues and have launched vitriolic attacks on each other.
Appealing to the voters, Mr. Modi said that if BJP is elected to power, it will be a double profit for the people of Bengal.
“I am giving you a formula. If a strong BJP government comes to power at the Centre then Didi also has to stop her drama and show some seriousness in running the government.
“If I make 100 kms of roads, then she has to at least make 10 kms of road. If I build 1 lakh houses then she has to build 10,000 houses,” he said.

TRS leader holds meeting with Trinamool leaders
","Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) leader Kancherla Keshava Rao met senior leaders of Trinamool Congress (TMC) here on Saturday.
According to sources, the Rajya Sabha MP and other leaders met Trinamool general Mukul Roy, also a Rajya Sabha MP, at a five-star hotel.
While both sides are tight-lipped on the meeting, informed sources told The Hindu that Mr. Rao landed in Kolkata around mid-day “exclusively for his meeting with the second-in-command” of the TMC, Mukul Roy.
Reportedly, the meeting went of well but it was not clear whether the leaders discussed a possible alliance after the election. “We can confirm the meeting but not the content,” said the source, who was present at the meeting.
Keshava Rao, a former APCC chief, resigned from the Congress to join the TRS about a year ago alleging that the Central government was “not too keen” on acceding to the demand for a separate Telangana State.
He became the national secretary of the TRS and was sent to the Rajya Sabha earlier this year.
Mr. Rao is considered extremely close to TRS chief K. Chandrasekar Rao, and his visit to Kolkata is monitored by the political bigwigs of the city with interest.
“That is because Telangana has 17 Lok Sabha seats and according to our information, the TRS is going to bag at least half the seats,” said a senior Congress leader.

Government failed to tackle drought, says Kumaraswamy
","The former Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy on Thursday charged the State government with “failure” to tackle drought and respond to drinking water crisis.
He was speaking to reporters after May Day celebrations at the party office here. Mr. Kumaraswamy said Chief Minister Siddaramaiah should have convened an all-party meeting to discuss the ways and means to tackle drought. It was not too late; he should convene a meeting immediately to get feedback from all political parties, Mr. Kumaraswamy demanded.
The former Chief Minister said many parts of the State had been facing severe water scarcity. Let alone for crops, water was not available even for drinking and people were forced to tread long distances to fetch water, he said. He alleged that the government was not responding to the woes of people.
Mr. Kumaraswamy took exception to Public Works Minister H.C. Mahadevappa getting his official residence renovated at a cost of Rs. 75 lakh. Public money should not be wasted for individual fancy, that too at a time when the State was facing severe drought, he said.
Party leaders Abdul Azeem, Narayana Rao and R.V. Harish were among those present.

Maharashtra govt mulls over a campaign to curb atrocities against Dalits
","Following reports of increasing atrocities against Dalits in Maharashtra, the state government is considering a proposal to initiate a campaign at village level to curb violence against Dalits.
At least three cases of alleged caste violence have been reported in last one week alone from different parts of the state. The ruling Congress-NCP alliance has come under severe criticism not only from the opposition but also from its own workers to initiate strict action to check increasing >crimes against Dalits.
On Wednesday, the issue was discussed in the state cabinet meeting. According to a minister who was present, Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan asked the home, rural development and social justice ministries to formulate a comprehensive proposal for a state wide campaign against such atrocities.
“We already have a ‘Tanta Mukti Abhiyan (Alternative Dispute Resolution campaign) at the village level. This campaign will be on the same lines,” said the minister.
Many Congress leaders termed it as an important step, especially at a time when state assembly elections are few months away.
The opposition too has demanded stern action from the government. BJP leader Gopinath Munde, who visited the village of Nitin Aage, a 17-year-old Dalit boy who was allegedly killed by upper caste men for speaking with a girl, demanded the resignation of Home Minister R R Patil. Shiv Sena leader Neelam Gorhe too has accused the government of inaction.
Nitin Raut, the Congress leader and cabinet minister of Employment Guarantee and Water Conservation, on Tuesday had demanded a special cabinet meeting on the issue.
“The increasing number of atrocities against Dalits is a matter of concern for the government which is in power for last 13 years. The cases have increase in last three years. This sensitive issue needs to be handled well-in-time,” said the letter sent by the minister to Mr. Chavan.

Tripura HC cancels school teachers recruitment
","In a significant judgement with serious ramification, the High Court of Tripura on Wednesday cancelled recruitment of all school teachers from March 2010. Total 10,323 under graduate, graduate and post graduate teachers would be axed following the order that termed the appointments illegal.
A division bench comprising Chief Justice Deepak Gupta and Justice S.C. Das who heard 58 petitions from aggrieved unemployed youths over past four months, delivered the judgement with certain directives to the government. Senior counsel Arun Chandra Bhowmik who represented several petitioners termed the verdict historic and victory for suffering youths who were deprived of job despite having requisite qualification.
The plaintiffs complained all appointment procedures and norms were violated in recruitment of 10,323 teachers. State government had in March 2010 appointed 4,617 graduate teachers, 1,100 post graduate teachers in August of same year and 4,606 under-graduate teachers in December 2013.
The judgement mentioned that despite cancellation of appointments, the recruited teachers can continue service till December 31 next. It directed the state government to ensure transparent recruitment of teachers as per procedure and made a point to consider age limit of bonafide candidates who were denied job in earlier recruitment exercises.
State’s school education minister Tapan Chakraborty said the government would take next course of action like moving the apex court only after reviewing High Court judgement. All opposition parties hailed the judgment and criticized CPI(M) led left front government for ‘political appointments in government organisations flouting set rules’.
When contacted, CPI(M) state secretary Bijan Dhar said he would not make any political comment in haste without knowing exact content of the judgement. Sources said the state government is likely to move the Supreme Court seeking a stay on the high court order.

Centre can order NIA probe
","The Union government, under the National Investigation Agency (NIA) Act, 2008, is empowered to suo motu direct the agency to investigate any scheduled offence such as an act of terror.
Under Section 6 (5) of the Act, the Centre is empowered to order an NIA investigation on its own. The provision says: “Notwithstanding anything contained in this section, if the Central government is of the opinion that a scheduled offence has been committed which is required to be investigated under this Act, it may, suo motu, direct the agency to investigate the said offence.”
Home Ministry sources said the government was considering the Chennai blasts as an act of terror as defined in Section 15 of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967, a scheduled offence under the NIA Act. The provision defines a terrorist act as “Whoever does any act with intent to threaten or likely to threaten the unity, integrity, security or sovereignty of India or with intent to strike terror or likely to strike terror in the people or any section of the people in India or in any foreign country, commits a terrorist act.”
NIA officials pointed out that a State government may request the Centre to hand over the investigation of a case to the agency, provided the case had been registered as per the schedule to the NIA Act. The agency could also seek the assistance of the State Police during investigation of cases, and in that situation, it was incumbent on the State police to assist it. The State government could also investigate cases under the scheduled offences.

YSRC seeks more forces at ‘hypersensitive’ polling booths
","The YSR Congress has requested the Chief Electoral Officer of the State to deploy additional central forces and install closed circuit cameras in the hyper-sensitive areas of Kadapa district.
In a representation given to CEO Bhanwarlal on Thursday, general secretary of the party K. Shiva Kumar said their party had identified some hyper-sensitive polling stations in the district and stressed for deployment of adequate central forces keeping in view the poll-related incidents in the past.
The party explained to the CEO that 97 polling stations in Badvel, Rajampet, Railway Kodur, Pulivendula, Kamalapuram, Jammalamadugu, Proddatur, Mydukur and Rayachoti assembly constituencies were under the influence of TDP leaders, some of whom were former legislators and contestants now with criminal antecedents.
Leaders of the TDP there were openly threatening to capture those polling stations which were located in the areas under their control, Mr. Shiva Kumar alleged.
Past experience in those areas make it amply clear that those TDP leaders would never allow the presence of polling agents of other parties in those polling stations.
Such anti-social elements would not allow the polling process to take place as prescribed by the Election Commission and it would become mockery of the electoral system and democracy, the YSR Congress leader said.
The party requested the CEO to permit the YSRC candidates to appoint people of neighbouring villages as their polling agents to ensure free and fair polling.

Row between Sudheeran, Shanimol Usman snowballs
",": The row between Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) president V.M. Sudheeran and the former All India Congress Committee (AICC) secretary Shanimol Usman appeared to have snowballed with several party leaders expressing divergent opinions on Tuesday.
The opinions ranged from advisory by senior party leaders to shun controversies to clear positions supporting either Mr. Sudheeran or Ms. Shanimol Usman.
Minister for Home Ramesh Chennithala was the first to urge party leaders to keep off controversies and avoid hurting the sentiments of ordinary workers who were eagerly awaiting a positive result for the United Democratic Front (UDF) in the Lok Sabha polls. UDF convener P P Thankachan said the leaders had every right to raise issues within reasonable limits in party forums, but he was opposed to deliberate media leaks of discussions in such forums.
Besides, each member could approach the party high command for redressal of their grievances, he said.
The former KPCC president K Muraleedharan batted in favour of Mr. Sudheeran, stating that attempts to destabilise the KPCC president would not be taken lightly. He said the members should be under no delusion that they could raise any kind of issue in party forums.
Allegations against leaders should be substantiated by evidence, he said.
Alappuzha District Congress Committee president A A Shukoor continued to oppose Ms. Shanimol Usman in more harsh tones.
He said she had become a tool in the hands of the liquor lobby.
The main point of debate among senior leaders was whether a party leader could be prevented from expressing opinions in a party forum. There is also a section that feels that Mr. Sudheeran had overacted to the entire issue. Had he chosen to ignore Ms. Shanimol Usman’s statements, the matter would have ended there.
However, the KPCC president chose to link the entire episode to his opposition to the proliferation of liquor dens and criticism against him from what he called “unexpected quarters” for the stand.

Government control over Sosale Vyasaraja Math pays dividends
","The 13th century Sosale Sri Vyasaraja Math is now firmly under the control of the Karnataka government, and pilferage from the temples and other infrastructure of the math has been checked even as efforts are on to recover some of the immoveable assets which are said to be in the possession of some people.
The government-appointed administrator of the math, K. Jairaj, told The Hindu that while all the properties of the math in Karnataka had been identified, there were still vast properties in Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh and efforts were on to take control of them even as identification of the properties and their valuation was in progress.
The State government appointed an administrator for the math, for a two-year term, in May 2012 after a series of complaints over misappropriation and misuse of the math’s properties. Given the fact that the task is incomplete, there is the likelihood that the term of the administrator will be extended. The former Chief Justice of India M.N. Venkatachaliah is the chairman of the advisory committee which has been constituted to guide the administrator.
Mr. Jairaj said the math had received huge donations for several centuries, including gold jewellery dating back to the Vijayanagara rulers. Some of its prime properties had either been alienated or even rented out for a paltry income by the seers of the math over the last few decades. Some of the properties that have been recently recovered include a choultry comprising nearly 45 rooms at Tirumala. With the support of the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams “we have been successful in recovering the property”. There were still some prime properties in Chennai and other places, and efforts were on to recover them, he said.

Reorganisation

Giving details of the action initiated to take back the properties and restoring administration in the branches, he said, “Since the takeover of the administration there has been a comprehensive administrative and financial reorganisation of the math, and properties belonging to the institution are being safeguarded. The total income of the math is now Rs. 4.88 crore with a net savings of Rs. 1.25 crore. The math owned more than 3,000 acres of land near Bidadi in Bangalore Rural district and these valuable lands are now in the possession of unauthorised persons.
Improvements have been made at the math’s branch on Govindappa Road in the city, Mysore, Sosale, Srirangapatna and Tirumakoodalu in Mysore district. Works would be taken up on Tirumala in Andhra Pradesh, one of the major revenue earning centres, and Bannur in Mysore district, Kanakapura in Bangalore Rural district and Mulbagal in Kolar district.
Devotees have requested for providing facilities at Srirangam in Tamil Nadu. Borewells would be sunk at Vyasarajapura and Sosale in Mysore district. The wages/salaries of priests, managers and other sub-staff had been increased through two pay revisions. The allowance of Rs. 50,000 a month which was paid to the seer has, however, been suspended since he was reportedly in receipt of income from some of the properties.

Mullaperiyar: The continuing saga
","The >safety of the Mullaperiyar dam in Idukki district of Kerala has been a concern for the state for long. Even as early as 1979, the then Chief Minister C H Mohammed Koya  had told reporters that the state government was aware of the need to strengthen the Mullaperiyar dam at Thekkady at that time under the administrative control of  the Tamil Nadu government. The CM's response came when he was quizzed about the chance of a Morvi-type (In 1979, Morvi, a town in Gujarat was flooded because of the collapse of a dam on Machchu river) tragedy happening to the Mullaperiyar dam, which was built in 1895. The matter has been the subject of many letters exchanged between the Central Water and Power Commission and Kerala from the mid-sixties.

>In October 1979, Mr. Koya told the State Assembly that he had written to the Union Agriculture and Irrigation Minister to direct the Central Water and Power Commission and the Tamil Nadu government to take steps to strengthen  the Mullaperiyar dam. The Commission had directed the Tamil Nadu Government to keep the water level in the reservoir at 145 feet and ""if the level rose beyond two feet, it should be brought down to 145 feet within 24 hours"".
While >ruling out any ïmminent danger ""to the dam, a spokesperson of the Union Agriculture and Irrigation Ministry had pointed out that ""while designing the Periyar dam, the conventional uplift forces had not been taken into account resulting in some tension under full reservoir conditions"".

Quibble over ""seepage""and ""Leakage""

The cause of apprehension among some sections is because of the perception regarding seepage and leakage, as per a report published in this paper during the late seventies.
Under modern building conditions, dams are provided with seepage galleries within, where the seepage is pumped out after testing. But in the Periyar dam, the seepage is visible and hence the anxiety.

‘BJP, TDP have turned politics into a game of chess’
","Promising to fight for protecting the State’s interests, YSR Congress (YSRC) president Y.S. Jaganmohan Reddy on Sunday sought a clear-cut verdict in favour of the party in the elections to the Lok Sabha and the Assembly to ‘secure a bright future for Telugu people’.
Addressing an impressive gathering at Kanigiri in Prakasam district, he said, “Give us all the 25 MP seats in this region. We will select a leader who will help our State and we will make him sit in the Prime Minister’s chair,” said Mr. Jaganmohan Reddy. We will decide whether Narendra Modi or Ellayya or Pullayya should become the Prime Minister.
“With hardly three days left for the general election, people should make up their mind whether they want a party which will fight for protecting the State’s interests or a party which bows before the Centre,” he said.
He charged the Telugu Desam Party and the Bharatiya Janata Party with joining hands with the Congress-led UPA government to divide the State for ‘the sake of votes and seats’.
He said the TDP had claimed credit for granting statehood to Telangana in the run up to the first phase of elections in the State on April 30. But TDP president N. Chandrababu Naidu was now blaming him and his party for the State’s division, ahead of the second phase of elections in Seemandhra.
The parties, which have turned politics into a ‘political chess game’, are responsible for ‘foisting cases to get rid of me in politics’, contended Mr. Jaganmohan Reddy, who is currently on bail for alleged economic offences.
Reiterating that the loan waiver promised by the TDP could not be implemented, he said when Mr. Chandrababu Naidu was in power, he did not even waive interest on farmers’ loans.
He promised to complete the multi-crore Veligonda project early to provide irrigation and drinking water to drought-prone Prakasam district while canvassing for party Kanigiri MLA candidate B. Madhusudan Yadav and Ongole MP candidate Y.V. Subba Reddy.

Nellore Staff Reporter adds: Mr. Jaganmohan Reddy addressed a roadshow at Kavali town where he asserted that it was their party that would decide who will become the next Prime Minister.
Taking a dig at the Telugu Desam Party, Mr. Jaganmohan Reddy deplored that TDP chief N. Chandrababu Naidu was asking people to vote for Modi for the PM’s post, which amounted to prostrating before the Central leaders. This should not be the case and the YSRC will make an appeal that Andhra Pradesh voters should cast their vote for their self-respect and pride this time, he said.
Directing his attack only on the TDP, Mr. Jaganmohan Reddy described the election as a struggle between credibility and dishonesty and between straightforwardness and deception. “Mr. Chandrababu Naidu is lying to the people. He is making all sorts of false promises only to mislead the people,” the YSRC president said.
Stating that his father Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy stilled lived in the hearts of the poor people by virtue of his welfare programmes, Mr. Jaganmohan Reddy said that Mr. Chandrababu Naidu did not care to think of the need for providing financial assistance to students and healthcare for poor families.

Shivaji Memorial: HC to hear in June
","The Bombay High Court on Wednesday decided to hear arguments over the mid-sea Shivaji memorial after its summer break. The decision came after the state government failed to amicably settle the dispute with the architect of the memorial.
A division bench of Justice V M Kanade and Justice Anil Menon heard a petition by Team One Architects India Pvt Ltd. whose design was selected when Ashok Chavan was Chief Minister. The architects challenged the government’s decision to go for fresh tenders. Early this year, the government had accepted a new design by JJ school of Architecture principal Rajiv Mishra.
The state Public Works Department (PWD) filed an affidavit in the court on Monday stating that it had decided to junk the old design plans on the grounds that the new plan would incorporate more features in the same space.
The firm's senior advocate, Janak Dwarkadas, argued that the government was spending the taxpayers’ money to invite fresh tenders after expressing to his clients and other international bidders that only the winning design would be followed while constructing the statue.
At the last hearing the court had asked the parties if they could resolve the matter amicably. On Wednesday, the division bench recorded the submissions of the state that the dispute couldn't be resolved and kept the matter for hearing when the court re-opens in June.
The bench also questioned how Team One’s prayers for interim relief could be granted. They had prayed that only their design and no other be used.
The court asked the architect how they could claim monopoly over the entire project to which the architects’ lawyer replied that they had been granted monopoly. The court told the architects that they had the right to claim damages from the state.
The affidavit states that the new design could incorporate a marine aquarium, a Maratha library and a dolphin pool. The height of the statue itself has also been increased in the new plan from 94 metres to 190 metres.

From the archives: Strengthen Mullaperiyar Dam: Kerala Writes to Centre
","
TRIVANDRUM: The Kerala Chief Minister. Mr.C. H. Mohammed Koya informed the State Assembly on Tuesday that he had sent a letter to the UnionAgriculture and Irrigation Minister on October 17 requesting him to direct the Central Water and Power Commission and the Tamil Nadu Government to take immediate steps for strengthening the Mallaperiyar Dam (Thekkady dam) in Kerala territory and under the control of the Tamil Nadu Government.
On the same day, he had sent a similar letter to the Tamil Nadu Chief Minister also drawing his urgent attention to this matter.
The Chief Minister was replying to a calling attention motion raised by Mr. P. C. Joseph (Kerala Congress-Mani group) on the condition of the dam. Mr. Joseph said the dam was in a dangerous condition and if it cracked, it would result in great havoc for the entire district. The disaster might perhaps be more than what they witnessed in the Morvi tragedy. He wanted the Government to take up this issue with the Centre and the Tamil Nadu Government.
The Chief Minister said the Mullaperiyar Dam (Periyar Dam) was constructed in 1897 on the basis of an agreement entered into by the then Maharaja of Travancore and the Secretary of State of India on October 29. 1886. The dam is 1,241 feet long and the maximum height from the river bed is 158 feet. The capacity of the reservoir is 15.662 million cubic feet. The dam is situated 55 kms. upstream from the present Idukki Dam. There is no record with the Government to show that the life of the dam is 50 years as reported in a section of the press.
In 1972 and 1973, samples were collected from the dam to test its strength. Though some discussion was planned by the Central Water and Power Commission in 1976, it did not come off On May 9, 1978, Mr. A. N. Harkouli, Member of the Commission, Mr. A. K.Pal, Director in the Commission,the Chief Engineers ofKerala and Tamil Nadu and other officials concerned examined the dam.
The Tamil Nadu Government was asked by the Commission on May 19, 1978, to furnish more information about the dam with a view to considering the steps to be taken for strengthening the dam. The Commission also directed that the water level in the reservoir should be kept at 145 feet, and if the level rose beyond two feet, it should be brought down to 145 feet within 24 hours.
On June 13, 1979, the Kerala Government again brought the issue to the notice of the Commission, and the latter replied saying the views of the Tamil Nadu Government had not been received. A subsequent letter to the Commission by the Kerala Government on July 18, 1979 also brought the same reply from the
Commission on August 4, 1979.
Later, the Chief Secretary to Kerala Government also sent a letter to the Chairman of the Central Water and Power Commission on September 27, pointing out all details and urging him to take immediate steps for strengthening the dam.

Modi reaches out to farmers
","BJP prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi told a public meeting here that he saw a brilliant future for the farmers of Rayalaseema in a ‘Swarnandhra Pradesh’, reassuring them that they would “reap gold” in their fields. This he would fulfil through the inter-linking of rivers in the country if the NDA came to power.
Sharing the dais with Telugu Desam Party president N. Chandrababu Naidu and Jana Sena Party founder and actor Pawan Kalyan at a mammoth public meeting at B.T. College grounds at Madanapalle on Thursday, Mr. Modi berated the UPA government for rampant corruption.
He appealed to the people to choose between “Scam Andhra Pradesh” and “Scheme Andhra Pradesh” when they vote on May 7.
In Nellore, Modi’s crowd-pulling abilities were apparent as he started off with Bharat mata ki jai, which was greeted with a thunderous response from the crowd.
Mr. Naidu and Mr. Kalyan made scathing attacks on the YSR Congress leadership, with the former describing its chief Y.S. Jaganmohan Reddy as the ‘traitor of Seemandhra’.
Moving to Guntur, Mr. Modi launched an acerbic attack on the Gandhi family saying that the Congress had always insulted leaders from Andhra Pradesh.
“The family has been insulting people of the State for many years. Rajiv Gandhi, when he was not even the PM had insulted the then Chief Minister T. Anjaiah, while P.V Narasimha Rao, the architect of economic reforms, was shown scant respect by his family; even his body was denied entry at the Congress office. And much earlier, Indira Gandhi had tried to scuttle moves to make Sanjeeva Reddy President of India,” Mr. Modi said at the meeting.
The BJP leader also held public meetings in Bhimavaram and Visakhapatnam.

Vyttila-Pettah road widening soon, says PWD Minister
","RBDCK would commence work on Palarivattom flyover shortly, while PWD would begin Vyttila and Kundanoor flyover works in three months’ time, Minister for Public Works V.K. Ebrahim Kunju said.
Inordinate delay by the two agencies in kickstarting work on flyovers had invited much flak. Speaking to the media here on Friday, Mr. Kunju said the design for Vyttilla and Kundanoor flyovers would be ready within a fortnight. DMRC will commission Edappally flyover in another year.
Widening work of Vyttila-Pettah Road would begin once PWD completes assessment of the rate for buildings that would be pulled down fully or partially, in another fortnight. DMRC and other metro stakeholders had condemned the delay in widening the arterial road since they are unable to begin Kochi metro works on the narrow road.
To a question on PWD’s keenness to widen and develop Thammanam-Pullepady Road, PWD Secretary T.O. Sooraj said Kochi Corporation was yet to hand over the road to PWD. “Once handed over, we are hopeful that the State government will announce a special package for land acquisition.”

UPA welfare laws will go if BJP comes to power, says Rahul
","Charging that the BJP’s intentions were not clean, Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi on Sunday said the party, if voted to power, intended to abolish the welfare schemes introduced by the UPA government.
“I have information that they intend to abolish the legislation on food security and employment guarantee,” Mr. Gandhi said addressing a rally in his constituency, Amethi.
Resuming his attack on BJP’s prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi, Mr. Gandhi said the Gujarat Chief Minister’s development model was limited to one or two industrialists, in a reference to Mr. Modi’s proximity to corporate giant Adani.
While Mr. Modi in a rally in Badohi flayed the Congress for neglecting the interests of farmers, Mr. Gandhi said farmers in Gujarat were being deprived of their land and compelled to flee to other States.
“Modi didn't ask the farmers even once before giving away their land to Adani. Some of the farmers met me and narrated their woes. We fought for Bhatta Parsaul, which led to the enactment of the land acquisition law,” he said.
Elaborating on the welfare steps taken by the UPA regime, Mr. Gandhi said his government had waived Rs 70,000 crore in farmers’ loans even as Mr. Modi distributed land worth Rs 40,000 crore to Adani.
Mr. Gandhi who held a roadshow in his constituency with his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, who has been actively campaigning for him, also tried to strike a chord with women.
While raking up ‘snoopgate,’ Mr. Gandhi flayed Mr. Modi for his double standards on women. Even as the police in Gujarat tap phones of women and harass them, Mr. Modi spoke about empowering women, Mr. Gandhi said. “He should learn to respect women.”

Cross-border strikes
","As a nation that has been shown to foster and back terror, Pakistan will go to any lengths to counter us. India too must desist from fostering terror (“
>India’s new language of killing,” May 1). How can we take on Pakistan in the U.N. if we do the same?
Also, the statement in the article that “the authoritative South Asia Terrorism Portal database shows that violence in Jammu and Kashmir declined year-on-year from 2002 to 2013” shows that peace talks and diplomacy works.

Ibnu Mohamed,


Coimbatore

For more than 60 long years we have debated dispassionately with Pakistan on the need to shun violence and follow the path of peace. Has it helped? It has only resulted in wars being thrust on us, 26/11, and the beheading of our soldiers here and there. Let us try passion for a change. Let us “bash on regardless”, as famously put by Field Marshal Sam Manekshaw. Let us give unadulterated nationalism a chance.

Deshabhimani Rao,


Bangalore

Our new language of killing is neither audible nor visible by our enemies, or even by our existing intelligence agencies. We are not professional enough to have premier intelligence agencies such as the CIA, MI6, KGB or Mossad. Let us evaluate our intelligence success stories since 1947. There is no substantial intelligence report which has saved our nation. The American system traced Osama bin Laden in Pakistan. And, foreign intelligence agencies have undoubtedly succeeded in straying into the Indian intelligence system.

V.V. Nair,


Manipal

Mr. Modi has nothing new to offer in terms of economic policy. Poverty alleviation is not on his agenda at all. Against this background of pursuing the same pro-rich policy like the Congress, in the event of his forming the government he needs to do something to impress and divert the attention of the people. The best option is to threaten to launch strikes against Pakistan which, apart from diverting the attention of the nation, will also fulfil his communal agenda.

A. G. Rajmohan,


Anantapur

Mr. Modi needs to rethink what he has said — it is nothing but a classic example of empty rhetoric. And given the state of our defence forces, how does he think he can do this? It is better he confines himself to his promises on development, leaving serious matters like foreign policy for a later date to be discussed in Parliament with inputs from experts.

People’s concerns sidelined, says Yechury
","Irony of current discourse is that it totally ignores the basic issues concerning people, says CPI (M) polit bureau member Sitaram Yechury.
The issues like health, education and employment are pushed to the backseat and serious discussion is being held in the national media on Modi calling Priyanka ‘daughter’ and Priyanka hitting back at him. This titillating discussion is carried as if it is of national relevance, Mr. Yechury said, speaking to The Hindu here after a gate electioneering meeting in favour of party candidate for Gajuwaka Assembly segment Ch. Narsing Rao.
The governments have abdicated their constitutional obligation to provide health, medicare and education facilities to people and are implicitly encouraging their privatisation. By not allowing these subjects to come in the discussion, they are tacitly empowering the corporate sector to take over them, he noted with alarm. In other words, the ruling class is allowing the private sector to focus on profit maximisation with little concern to its social responsibility, he added.
It’s ironical that the UPA delivered on its constitutional obligation like the Right to Education, that too under pressure from the Left, he pointed out.
There is a little difference between the BJP and the Congress on these subjects. It is in this context that there is a need for an alternative policy direction without which one cannot address people’s concerns. The third front has been created with the sole purpose to ensure that people’s rights are protected and that nation’s resources are used for their benefit.
For instance, the government stopped encouraging small savings. The interest earned on post office deposits has been cut, forcing people into the hands of private and unorganised players like chit funds. The small savings formed the main component of capital investment taken up by the government, he explained. Today, these funds are being taken by large corporates for their investment.

Realty boom, a benefit of bifurcation: Digvijaya
","All India Congress Committee (AICC) general secretary and in-charge of Andhra Pradesh affairs Digvijaya Singh has said that the land prices has gone up in Seemandhra while it witnessed a nosedive in Hyderabad. He listed out this as one of the several benefits for the people of Seemandhra caused by the State bifurcation.
Interacting with the media at a ‘Meet-the-Press’ programme organised by the Andhra Pradesh Union of Working Journalists here on Friday, Mr. Singh said that many provisions had been incorporated in the Andhra Pradesh Re-Organisation Act, 2013 which would benefit the Seemandhra people.
He refuted the claim that 90 per cent of the land in the Seemandhra region was under the control of just 10 per cent of the people.
Taking a dig at the Telugu Desam Party leadership, Mr. Singh said that the party had lost its secular character by joining hands with the Bharatiya Janata Party and any question on the Congress having some kind of political understanding with it in the futurewas totally hypothetical.
Describing former Union Minister D. Purandeswari’s joining the saffron party as a “treacherous act”, Mr. Singh said that many leaders, who grew in stature because of the Congress’ largesse, had deserted it. “Not only did former CM N. Kiran Kumar Reddy fail in his duties, he also ditched the Congress,” he said. Asked how he was different from BJP prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi, when it came to concealing private affairs, he said that there was no need for him to talk about such personal matters.

Modi hankering after power: Priyanka
","In a veiled attack on Narendra Modi, >Priyanka Gandhi on Friday said there is a leader in the country who wants power for himself and makes repeated demands to strengthen him.
Campaigning for her mother Sonia Gandhi in Amethi, she also alleged that books with baseless material written about her family were being dumped a night before at places where her public meetings were scheduled.
Holding that the level of election campaign in the country has stooped down to a very low level, she said, “Politics is seen with a sense of service, but few leaders in the country do not think about that.”
However, Congress vice-president >Rahul Gandhi’s politics was not that to demand, but that of a sense of service, she said.
“He wants to give you strength. He also wants to give you power. There is a leader in the country, who wants power for himself. He keeps on demanding to strengthen him...,” she said, targeting Mr. >Modi.
“My father had a visionary political thinking and Rahul has learned from him. The parameter and strategy of Amethi’s development was prepared by Rajiv Gandhi 35 years ago, this is the reason barren land is not visible here,” she said.
Ms. >Priyanka said that books containing false accusations against her family have been found at places where her public meetings have been scheduled.
“I have come to know that at places where my public meetings are scheduled some books are thrown a night before in which dirty and false things are written about my family.
Those indulging in such activities are cowards,” she said at Shahgarh Shaheed Chowk in Gauriganj Assembly area.
“If they have to say something, they should come in front of me and talk. Indulging in such activities at midnight is not justified,” she said.
Blaming Opposition for the absence of proper power supply here, Priyanka said her “hands are tied” because of a court case in the matter.
Addressing an election meeting attended mostly by women in Amethi, she said the party has made many efforts to provide 24 hours power supply but despite that it could not do so.
“Power supply is the state government’s responsibility. After Mulayam Singh government assumed power in UP, Soniaji and Rahulji approached him for continuous power supply in Rae Bareli and Amethi. Mulayam Singh decided immediately to provide power to these areas.
In a veiled attack on BJP’s Smriti Irani, she charged, “A candidate has come here. Her party people filed a case and got round-the-clock power supply stopped.”
“It was asked in the case as to what was special about these two areas that power should be supplied for 24 hours. That is why the case is stuck here and our hands are tied. Until the case is resolved, 24-hour power supply cannot be resumed,” she said.
Targeting women voters, she said, “This is election time and one should say what can be done for women empowerment.” She also said the election fight should be done on “principles” and it should be done openly and not in a clandestine manner.
In a bid to strike an emotional chord with voters, she said, “I will not ask for your votes. I want your love. You have stood by our side in good times and bad times. We will be with you all the time.”
“This is Amethi. I am coming here since childhood and I will keep coming when I will become old also,” she said.

YSRC asks Pawan to get his facts right
","The YSR Congress Party has suggested actor-turned-politician Pawan Kalyan to get his facts right before blaming YSRC as being responsible for the bifurcation of the State.
Refuting the Jana Sena founder’s criticism of YSRC, party senior leader M.V. Mysura Reddy stated here on Friday that creation of Telangana was the result of Congress’ mishandling of the sensitive issue and the politics of conspiracy played by the TDP. Reading out excerpts from page 194 of Sri Krishna Committee report, Dr. Reddy stated that a separate group was formed in the TDP seeking statehood for Telangana after N. Chandrababu Naidu became the Chief Minister for the second time. Akin to the 1969 situation, K. Chandrasekhar Rao launched TRS in 2001 with an objective to achieve statehood for Telangana region, in the backdrop of NDA carving out Chhattisgarh, Utraranchal and Jhakhand States in 2000.
Both the BJP and TDP had claimed during their election campaign in Telangana that it was because of them the statehood to Telangana had become possible, Dr. Reddy pointed out and reminded Mr. Kalyan that he had said in the past that the BJP had influenced the Congress to announce Telangana.

Manipur hospitals using contaminated water
","Usage of contaminated water in Manipur’s public and private hospitals has sparked concern among people. Disturbing photographs showing private water suppliers’ — on whom these hospitals depend for water requirements — tankers refilling from dirty public drains have appeared in local newspapers.
Sources said the main water pipe meant for Imphal’s Regional Institute of Medical Sciences — which is under the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare — had dried up decades ago since local residents made numerous holes in it to illegally tap water. Villagers near major rivers are not permitting private water
suppliers to use them fearing water shortage. As a result, these suppliers are delivering contaminated drain water at a high price.
Sometimes, surgeries in these hospitals had been put off due to the unavailability of contaminated raw water. Fearing infection and other deadly diseases, some patients had asked hospital authorities to allow them to buy bottled water, which was turned down by the latter.
In Manipur, all water supply schemes had been closed down some months back due to the lack of water sources. The Public Health Engineering Department had failed to translate into action the ambitious plan to distribute lake water to people. The department had submitted the action plan to the Chief Minister Okram Ibobi Singh. It said, inter alia, three water tankers shall be pressed into service in each of the 60 Assembly constituencies. Perhaps the Chief Minister is of the view that this will create more problems than solving the existing ones since 3 water tankers cannot supply water to the people of a constituency.
Showers in Manipur in the past few days have perhaps come as a silver lining. However, these are too sporadic to be of any relief to the people.

Naidu ups the ante
","Telugu Desam Party president N. Chandrababu Naidu on Friday continued tirade against YSR Congress president Y.S. Jaganmohan Reddy saying that the latter would encourage land grabbing in the State if he comes to power.
He claimed that real development was possible only with the TDP which had ensured clean administration earlier.
Addressing public meetings at Itchapuram, Palasa and Patapatnam, he said anarchy would prevail if the YSRC was voted to power in residuary Andhra Pradesh and added that only his party could ensure secure future to people.
He also took a dig at TRS president K. Chandrasekhar Rao and said that the latter was warned against ‘loose talk’ about Seemandhra people.
During his meetings, the TDP chief, in an attempt to woo farmers, assured them that loans would be waived if the party comes to power. In the same vein, he said that a protective mechanism would be put in place to curb crime against women. “The TDP will implement loan waiver at any cost and make agriculture lucrative. We will waive DWACRA loans and also work for women empowerment,” he added. He assured enhancement of pension up to Rs. 1,500 to differently-abled persons and senior citizens.
“Our priority will be people’s welfare. The new government will create more jobs and ensure decent life to youngsters,” said Mr. Naidu.
Party Srikakulam MP candidate Kinjarapu Rammohan, who took part in the meetings, exuded confidence that the TDP would will all the 10 Assembly seats and a Lok Sabha seat with comfortable majority. He said the people were fed up of poor administration and therefore were supporting the Telugu Desam.

Verdict on Mullaperiyar today
","The Supreme Court will deliver its verdict on Wednesday on the suit filed by Tamil Nadu questioning the law passed by Kerala in 2006, constituting the Dam Safety Authority to prevent the State from raising the water level in the Mullaperiyar dam from 136 ft. to 142 ft. 
A five-Judge Constitution Bench of Justice R.M. Lodha, Justice H.L. Dattu, Justice C.K. Prasad, Justice Madan B. Lokur, and Justice M.Y. Eqbal had reserved verdict in August last.
Tamil Nadu filed the suit in 2006, soon after the law was enacted within few days of the pronouncement of the judgment allowing the State to raise water level from 136 ft. up to 142 ft.
The Bench in 2010 had appointed an empowered committee headed by former Chief Justice of India A.S. Anand to go into the safety aspects and the report was submitted in April 2012. 
Tamil Nadu said the law empowered Kerala’s Dam Safety Authority to reach its own findings as to the safety of the dam and to direct it to suspend or restrict the functioning of the Mullaperiyar dam or even decommission the dam and the State was obliged to comply with such directives.
It argued that by enacting the law, the Kerala had not only encroached into the province of the judiciary but had also disobeyed the apex court judgment.
By enacting the law, Kerala had nullified the judgment and usurped judicial power.
However, Kerala had justified the law on the ground that it was intended to protect the safety of its people. Kerala’s case was that the impugned law related primarily to the modification of contractual rights under an agreement created prior to the commencement of the Constitution. It restricted the rights to use within the State of Kerala and a dam constructed within the State of Kerala would clearly be within the province of Kerala’s legislature.
It said: “By enacting the Amendment Act of 2006 and fixing the storage level of Mullaperiyar Dam at 136 ft., Kerala Legislature has not overruled the judgment of this court but removed the basis of the said judgment by curtailing the legal right to store water above 136ft which flows from the 1886 agreement. The law would not become invalid merely because there was a declaration that the dam was not safe if the water level was raised beyond 136 ft.”

Election Commission to consider Army chief appointment issue
","The Election Commission (EC) on Saturday said it will consider the issue of the appointment of the next Army chief at a meeting of its top brass next week.
“We have received a reference from the Defence Ministry and the issue is under examination. But no decision has been taken so far. The matter has so far not been placed on the agenda of the ‘full commission’ (the Chief Election Commissioner and the two Election Commissioners),” a senior EC official told PTI.
“The meeting could take place on Monday or Tuesday where the matter would be considered,” the official said.
The poll panel will consider the matter in the light of its March 27 order that appointments, promotions, tenders and procurements of defence forces are not covered under the Model Code of Conduct in the ongoing elections as well as any other election in the future as well as complaints from BJP that the government was rushing with the appointment of the next Chief of Army Staff.
Amid strong opposition by the BJP to the appointment of the next Army chief, the government had referred the matter to the Election Commission saying any decision will be taken only after getting its nod.
“The matter is before the Election Commission. We want to strictly follow all the procedures before taking any final decision on the issue,” Defence Minister >A.K. Antony had said on Friday when asked about the status of appointing the next Army chief.
The matter was sent to the EC by the Defence Ministry earlier this week though the poll panel has already said that appointments, promotions, tenders and procurements are not covered under the Model Code of Conduct in the ongoing elections as well as any other election in the future.
On why the Ministry has sent the matter to the Election Commission despite its March 27 order, highly-placed Defence Ministry sources said such matters are important and it was felt that nod of all authorities concerned should be taken before proceeding.
The BJP has been opposing the appointment of the next Army chief by the UPA Government, arguing that there was no hurry to do so and the matter should be left to the next government.
Army Vice-chief Lt. Gen. Dalbir Singh Suhag is the front-runner for appointment to the top post which will fall vacant on July 31 after the retirement of present Army chief Gen Bikram Singh.
The EC official also said the panel has not received any reference from the government on the snoopgate commission of inquiry.

Congress may back alternative front to keep Modi out: Karat
","A repeat of the 1996-like situation is possible and the Congress may be forced to support a government of secular parties at the Centre to keep the BJP out of power, the CPI(M) general secretary Prakash Karat told the PTI in an ineterview.
He also did not rule out parties like the AIADMK joining an alternative front to keep the Narendra Modi-led BJP and the NDA out of power like it happened in 1996 when a government under Deve Gowda was formed with Congress supporting from outside.
“Well, depending on the results, there may be a situation where the Congress will have to play a role in terms of ensuring that there is a secular alternative government put in place.
“If the Congress does not want a BJP-led government, then it will have to play a role of contributiung to the formation of a secular alternative government...,” Mr. Karat said.
He acknowledged that the anti-Congress mood is helping BJP in States where the two parties are in direct fight but dismissed reports of a Modi wave across the country.
Mr. Karat said that there are powerful regional parties which are strong and fighting the BJP and they may not be joining the saffron party in forming the government.
The front of non-Congress, non-BJP parties would be able to cobble up a majority with outside support from Congress, he said.
“There are some secular parties which have opportunistically tied up with the BJP and we know who they are. But the bulk of the regional parties today who are in the non-Congress, non-BJP category have not aligned with either the Congress or the BJP in these elections.”
Asked if the Left parties, who had withdrawn support to the UPA-I government on the issue of nuclear deal with the U.S., would have problems dealing with Congress, Mr. Karat said that question will concern all the secular non-Congress parties.
“We will be able to come to a common understanding. I think, as against the BJP, most of these parties would not be averse to seeking the cooperation of the Congress,” he said.
To a question as to who will lead such a front, the CPI(M) leader said, “That is a post-election matter to be decided. As it happened in 1996, the combination or the alliance which is going to be forged will be a post-poll alliance.
“So, the question of the leader, etc., who will lead the alliance, will be discussed at that time. It will be premature to discuss it now.”
He also ruled out the possibility of the Congress staking the right to leadership of a government after it loses the election.
“Well, midway through the polling process and the election campaign, it is evident that the Congress is faring badly and it will face a big defeat.
“In an election, if the ruling party gets defeated, I don’t see how they can contemplate even forming a government or leading a government. That is not done,” Mr. Karat said.
He said the question now was who is benefitting from the anti-Congress trend among the people.
“The propaganda being made that there is a Modi wave is misleading because this anti-Congress mood is going to benefit other secular non-Congress parties, including the regional parties which are a substantial force in the country. So to claim that there is a Modi wave is just an obfuscating tactic by the BJP.”
Asked if the secular parties were refusing to see the writing on the wall on the BJP’s prime ministerial candidate, Mr. Karat said the BJP will be benefited in States where it is the main contender to the Congress in a situation of anti-Congress mood.
But, he said, in a majority of States there was no bi-polar situation of the Congress versus the BJP. “So, State after State, if you see, it is the non-Congress secular parties and they range from some regional parties to various other parties, who are going to gain in such a situation.”
To a query about how many of them could be called secular parties and how confident he was that they won’t align with the BJP after the elections, Mr. Karat said a bulk of these parties have not aligned with the Congress or the BJP in these elections and they have substantial base and support among the people. “We had about six-seven major regional parties which, along with the Left parties, had discussed this matter before the elections and said that we will fight the elections against the Congress and the BJP, and after the elections, we will cooperate and come together.”
He said the main aim of the non-Congress secular formation would be to see that the BJP and its allies do not come to power.
“That is the >mid-course shift in focus. It is evident that the Congress is going to lose these elections. So the main contender would be the BJP and its allies and non-Congress secular parties.”
Mr. Karat expressed confidence that the Left block, which had a record 64 seats in 2004 and was reduced to 24 in the outgoing Lok Sabha, would do well in the current elections.
“We are confident of improving the strength of the CPI(M) and the Left in these elections. We have only one hurdle which we have to overcome, which is the tactics of the Trinamool Congress (TMC) in West Bengal that is rigging elections.”

Gopal Kanda launches party in Haryana
","Former Haryana Minister and Independent MLA from Sirsa City, Gopal Goyal Kanda, who withdrew support to the Bhupinder Singh Hooda Government in Haryana two days back, launched a political party on Friday.
Named Haryana Lokhit Party, Kanda termed it as an alternative to the existing political system, and assured that his party would work to end “dynasty rule, casteism and regionalism in politics” and work for the development of state.
46—year—old Kanda, who is also the president of the party, said Haryana was deprived of development even after five decades of formation and despite its proximity to the national capital.
“The state is lagging behind in the field of education, healthcare and trade,” he said.
Kanda said “dynastic politics of few parties has become biggest hurdle in Haryana’s development” and asserted that his party would provide people a clean alternative which would be free from caste politics.
“The people of Haryana are looking for a viable alternative. The state’s politics has been under the control of two or three political families. We want to change this,” he said.
HLP is headquartered in Gurgaon in the same building as his MDLR airlines, whose operations had been suspended earlier.
Kanda, who is facing trial in the suicide case of air—hostess Geetika Sharma and is currently out on bail, had on Wednesday, withdrawn support to the Hooda government.
The legislator, who was state’s Home Minister, had earlier this week accused the chief minister of betraying him during crises and also charged the state government with tapping the phones of its Ministers and MLAs. However, the state government had denied the phone tapping charges.

What about the job, asks Paralympian Girisha
","H.N. Girisha, who hit the headlines after winning a silver medal in the Paralympic Games held in London in 2012, is angry with both the Union and State governments for failing to keep their promise of offering him a job. It has been 20 months since he won the medal. He feels insulted that he has to remind the governments to look into his case.
Mr. Girisha, a native of Hosanagara village in Arakalgud taluk of Hassan district, was the only athlete from India to win a medal in the Paralympics that year. His achievement not only drew the attention of those in power but also of other sportspersons.
Cricket maestro Sachin Tendulkar himself called him up to congratulate him. The Centre had promised him a Class 1 executive job in the Sports Authority of India (SAI). The then Sports Minister, Ajay Maken, had tweeted his assurance. Even The State government had assured him a job in Karnataka.
Speaking to The Hindu on Friday, Mr. Girisha said, “I approached the Centre and the SAI several times. But nothing has worked out. How many times should I go and beg for a job?” he said.
He had even met State government authorities many times, but to no avail. “I am happy that the Centre honoured me with the Padma Shree. I met Karnataka Sports Minister Abhay Chandra Jain only to hear that something will be done,” he said.
The previous BJP government had assured him a job. “The present Minister and officers say there was no Government Order. If the previous government did not issue an order, does that mean the present government ignores the promises made earlier? If this is the government’s attitude, how will children be motivated to take up sports?” he asked.
Hassan Urban Development Authority offered him a 1,200 sq.ft site in Vijaya Nagar Layout in Hassan. Other Olympic medallists have been offered good posts in other States. There, Olympic medallists are working in the cadre of Superintendent of Police or Deputy Superintendent of Police. Besides, they get financial support to take part in international sports meets, he said.
Mr. Girisha, hailing from a poor family, had resigned from his job in a private company to practice for the Paralympic Games in 2012.
Before leaving for London, he had approached the Deputy Commissioner of Hassan to help him get a job. The DC had suggested he apply for the post of village accountant, for which the recruitment process was on. However, within a couple of weeks, he won the medal in London and he was promised a government post by both the Centre and the State.

Fair political representation eludes women in Krishna
","Krishna district has put up a poor show in giving a fair representation to women in politics if the number of women elected to the State Assembly is an indication. The apparent discrimination against women is startling despite the fact that women voters outnumber their male counterpart in the district.
A good political representation of women in this district is a myth as the number of women elected to the Assembly was just eleven since the formation of Andhra Pradesh while a mere 50 and odd women have contested the elections in the last six decades. And, of the eleven women MLAs, three were elected in by-polls conducted in 1970, 1986 and 2001, while only two women were elected twice from the district.
A majority of the Assembly segments in the district did not elect any women representative since 1955 while segments like Gudivada, Gannavaram, Mudinepalli, Vijayawada (East), Nidumolu (SC), Jaggaiahpet, Vuyyur have a history of electing women candidates. There were 17 Assembly segments in the district till 2004 elections and the number has come down to 16 post-delimitation in 2009.
So far, more than 58 women candidates entered the contest since 1957 and a majority of them had tried their luck as independent candidates while parties like the TDP, Congress, CPI (M) and BSP fielded women candidates on a few occasions. And, in most of the cases, the voting did not exceed two per cent of the total valid votes with the exception of those who contested on tickets of the recognised political parties.
Three TDP MLAs, five Congress MLAs and one CPI (M) MLA have been elected so far, while two MLAs of the TDP and the Congress were elected twice. However, more than 180 male candidates (the number includes MLAs elected more than once) have been elected from the district since the 50s.
Interestingly, no woman was elected from Gudivada, the native place of TDP founder N.T. Rama Rao who gave equal property inheritance to women. NTR, who had a record of contesting from two segments simultaneously, chose to field a male candidate in the by-election in 1985 after he had tendered his resignation. Raavi Sobhanadri Chowdary was fielded in the by-election.
Yerneni Sita Devi of the TDP won from Mudinepalli segment in 1985 and 1994, while Vangaveeti Ratnakumari of the Congress emerged victorious from Vijayawada (East) in 1989 and 1994. D. Padmajyothi of the Congress won from Tiruvur in 2009 general elections.

“Truck with TDP a tactical blunder”
","Even as Bharatiya Janata Party is pinning hopes on three to four Lok Sabha seats in Telangana, a senior leader said the party committed a “tactical blunder” by entering into an alliance with Telugu Desam in the region.
BJP functionaries expressed confidence that senior party leader Bandaru Dattatreya would romp home in Secunderabad Lok Sabha constituency. They are hopeful that BJP nominees would do well in Mahabubnagar, Nizamabad and Karimnagar Lok Sabha constituencies and a dozen Assembly seats, including Amberpet in city from where Telangana BJP president G. Kishan Reddy is seeking re-election.
They said Musheerabad, Goshamahal, Malkajgiri, Khairatabad, Nizamabad urban, Yella Reddy, Karimnagar, Vemulawada, Yella Reddy, Mahabubnagar and Nagarkurnool Assembly seats were the other places where the party was expected to put up a sterling performance. However, the situation would have been totally different and Congress would have been wiped out had the BJP tied up with TRS instead of TDP, said a senior party leader.
The leader, who did not wish to be identified, said most of the seats allotted to BJP were TRS strongholds. Besides, TDP president N. Chandrabau Naidu did not concentrate much on Telangana and also did not spend enough.
He said by aligning with TDP, the party virtually yielded ground to TRS in claiming to be the sole champion of Telangana. “We depended only on Mr. Narendra Modi’s glamour and left Telangana factor to TRS and Congress,” he added. He said that a BJP-TRS alliance would have got at least 14 Lok Sabha seats as the combination of Mr. Modi’s glamour and Telangana issue would have resulted in huge success.
Another BJP leader said BJP-TDP alliance simply did not work. He said the speeches of Mr. Modi during his tour of Telangana when he criticised the manner of bifurcation of the State also did not go well with the people in the region. This aspect was exploited to the hilt by TRS leader K. Chandrasekhar Rao subsequently.

Hibi blames corporation for Metro delay and traffic snarls
","The war of words between Congress leaders over the delay in the Kochi Metro Rail construction and development of related infrastructure intensified when Hibi Eden, MLA, accused the Kochi Corporation of not being proactive in fulfilling its role in the timely completion of the prestigious project.
Kochi Mayor Tony Chammany, who recently shot off a letter to Chief Minister Oommen Chandy stating that he was upset over the tardy pace of works on the Kochi Metro Rail project, lost no time to hit back by saying that Mr. Hibi Eden seemed to be settling personal scores by raising baseless allegations against him on the Metro Rail issue. 
The Mayor also reiterated that he had only pointed out certain facts regarding the need to remove the existing bottlenecks in the Metro Rail project. 
Mr. Eden had blamed the local body for its failure to complete its major road projects, including the Atlantis rail overbridge and Thammanam-Pullepady Road. The government had made all efforts to clear various hurdles, including the vexed issue of land acquisition, aimed at the smooth and timely completion of the Metro Rail project, he said. 
Mr. Eden said the government had already sanctioned Rs. 25 crore for the widening of the Thammanam-Pullepady Raod but the corporation could not ensure the time-bound completion of the project that would have eased the traffic snarls in the city. He said the government had also sanctioned Rs. 19 crore for developing 22 roads under the Kochi Corporation. 
The MLA urged the Kochi Corporation authorities to step up pressure on the State government and relevant agencies to increase funding for various road projects rather than complaining over the lack of support from the State government for city's development.
Mr. Eden said a meeting of elected representatives would be held at Thiruvananthapuram on May 7 to resolve various issues related to the Kochi Metro Rail. He praised the Kochi Metro Rail Ltd for trying its best to ensure the timely completion of the project. 
Referring to the differences between the Mayor and the Chairman of the Greater Cochin Development Authority over the laser show project at Rajendra Maidan, Mr. Eden said it was a viable initiative that should be supported. He requested the local body to speed up necessary clearances for the project.

Move to counter ‘Modi wave’ helps TRS, Congress
","The Muslim vote which can become the deciding factor appears to have gone in favour of TRS in some constituencies and for Congress in some others, apparently to counter the purported ‘Modi wave’.
“The idea to vote for TRS or Congress at some places was to stop the BJP from making any gains,” revealed a leader from Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (MIM) in Adilabad. “The thrust of voting in favour of TRS was more in MP election with the aim of defeating the BJP led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) coming to power at the Centre,” he added, imposing the condition of anonymity.
The number of Muslim voters spread over the 10 Assembly constituencies is estimated to be about 1.25 lakh with the concentration being more in Adilabad town in Adilabad constituency, Bhainsa in Mudhole constituency and Kagaznagar in Sirpur constituency. The Muslim vote has the potential to swing tides in these three constituencies.
The MIM seemed to have arrived at an unwritten understanding with the Telangana protagonist party in this election as its cadres openly canvassed in favour of the latter. Messages, accompanied by pictures of TRS and MIM leaders, claiming that the TRS will make a Muslim leader as Deputy Chief Minister went viral on the Facebook apparently aimed at garnering support for the TRS.
TRS president K. Chandrashekhar Rao himself appeared to have given a hint of the unwritten understanding as he kept referring to MIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi as 'our own' man at every public meeting which he addressed in the district. The impact of his statement however, will be clear only after the counting of votes.

It’s a four-cornered contest in Razole Assembly segment
","Three contestants from major political parties and an independent are in fray for the polls to the Razole (SC) Assembly constituency. Former Minister Gollapalli Suryarao is trying his luck as a TDP candidate, while sitting Congress MLA Rapaka Varaprasad will contest the elections as an independent candidate.
The YSR Congress has fielded Bonthu Rajeswara Rao, a former engineer-in-chief in Rural Water Supply (RWS) Department, while Sarella Vijaya Prasad is all set to contest as a Congress nominee. He worked as Sarpanch of Rameswaram village and said to have good contacts which he had developed during his Praja Rajyam days.
Mr. Gollapalli Surya Rao, like Mr. Bonthu Rajeswara Rao, is a non-local as the TDP has fielded him from the Razole Assembly segment in the last minute. Earlier, he was support to contest from the Amalapuram Parliament constituency.
Sitting MLA Rapaka Varaprasad (Congress), who had switched loyalty to the BJP, resigned immediately after the TDP decided to give the ticket to Gollapalli Suryarao as per the understanding over the seat sharing. He is now in the fray as an independent. All the four candidates are confident of winning the elections.
Razole Assembly constituency in Konaseema region of East Godavari District is reserved for Scheduled Castes and the Congress has been winning this seat for the past four elections. The segment comprises Malikipuram, Mamidikuduru, Sakhinetipalli and Razole mandals. The total electorate in the segment which stood at 1.3 lakh in 2004, has increased to 1,71,026 votes by January 2014.
Though the total number of votes polled in 2009 was more than that of 2004, poll percentage was comparatively less when compared to 2004. In 2009, the segment registered a polling percentage of 79.82 (1, 32,127 votes ) ) and it was 83.98 (1,09,560 votes) in 2004. Rapaka Varaprasad of the Congress had 52,319 votes in his favour, while his nearest Praja Rajyam Party rival got 46,450 votes.

‘YSRC bubble will burst after May 16’
","The Telugu Desam Party has charged the YSR Congress with copying highlights of its manifesto, including the nine steps for accelerated development of Seemandhra region.
Senior TDP leader Yanamala Ramakrishnudu said in a press release that the YSR Congress would be deserted as also the business empire of YSRC president Y.S. Jaganmohan Reddy once the election process was completed. The government that would come to power was sure to attach the leftover properties of Mr. Jagan, he said.
He alleged that the YSRC was not formed on the basis of sound principles, but was an outcome of Mr. Jagan’s lust for power. There was no effective leadership in the party and it was full of defectors who switched over loyalties after their attempts to secure posts in the TDP and the Congress failed. “This bubble will burst after May 16, the day when the results of general elections will be announced,” he said.
The senior TDP leader recalled the Supreme Court’s direction to complete investigation into the charges against Mr. Jagan and said the time limit fixed by the apex court would come to an end 58 days after the results were declared. He appealed to residents of Visakhapatnam not to vote in favour of YSRC honorary president Y.S. Vijayalakshmi warning that her victory could expand the “faction culture” to the peaceful environs of the port city.

Rahul questions source of funds for Modi’s campaign
","Attacking the BJP and its Prime Ministerial candidate Narendra Modi over election expenditure, Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi on Saturday alleged that corporates were pumping money into the saffron party’s campaign and asked it come clean on the source of funds.
“They (BJP) do politics of two—three corporates as they gift them mota paisa (hefty money). From where is the money for big cutouts and posters coming?” Gandhi, who arrived in his constituency for a two—day campaign, asked at an election rally.
He alleged that Modi gave nearly Rs. 26,000 crore of electricity and Rs. 15,000 crore of land to one industrialist which is much more than the Rs. 30,000 crore that Congress gave to the poor through MNREGA in a year.
“Please ask BJP where do they get crores of rupees for such posters. Is it Modi’s money?.... They ask us why we give free money to poor through MNREGA, food guarantee scheme. Poor does not get free money. They work for it whereas free funds are given to Adani,” he said.
“I am not against corporates. But they should be given facilities following rules and regulations. In Gujarat, it is Adani who is getting facilities and not the poor”, Gandhi added.
Describing the elections as a fight between two ideologies, Gandhi said that while Congress wanted to take Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs and Christians along, the other side was stoking politics of “anger“.
“Their (BJP) leaders used to criticise, abuse and keep poor at bay while we (Congress) talk of unity and to take country forward,” Gandhi said.
“The difference is that they want to keep the ATM with themselves, while we want to give the ATM to the poor”, he added.
“They want to create a divide between Hindus and Muslims and want to see them fighting. They want brother to fight against brother, unlike us”, he said.
Hitting out at his opponents, Aam Aadmi Party’s Kumar Vishwas and BJP’s Smriti Irani, Gandhi said they would run away from Amethi after the elections.
Without taking the names of rival candidates, he said the people who come from outside are angry at the relations that the Gandhi family shares with the people of Amethi.
“Let Congress form the Government at the Centre, I will show them what can be done in Amethi....People who come from outside can say whatever they like but Gandhi family shares a relation of love with people of Amethi. They will not be seen once elections are over,” he said.
“Those who are contesting (against me) will run away after election. I have family relations with Amethi. I came here at the age of 12 years with my father (Rajiv Gandhi). I don’t have political relation with this place,” Gandhi said striking an emotional chord.
“Some persons come here, tear posters, throw stones, abuse and return. They did not come here for the next five years.
I am here for my lifetime,” Gandhi said.

Govt to name ‘snoopgate’ judge before May 16: Sibal
","The UPA government will name a judge for investigating the Gujarat ‘snoopgate’ before May 16, Law Minister Kapil Sibal on Friday said and rubbished BJP leader Arun Jaitley’s claim that no judge will “lend” himself to the “political and malafide” exercise targeting Narendra Modi.
Mr. Sibal also said that Mr. Modi against whom accusations have been made in the controversy will be investigated.
“You will get a snoopgate judge before May 16. I don’t know why these people are so worried? Why leaders of BJP are worried and why they are making public statement that no judge should join this commission?” he said in New Delhi.
The Congress leader said BJP is worried as its leaders know the fact that “once the commission is set up there is no saving for Narendra Modi”.
“Because there is documentary evidence of what he (Mr. Modi) has done and how he has snooped the activities of a young girl,” he said.
”....They are worried about the national commission set up by the Centre and I think, they should continue to be worried because the commission will be set up and he will be investigated and he will be brought to book,” Mr. Sibal said.
The Minister also questioned the Gujarat government-appointed snoopgate probe panel, saying, “It will never move forward” as it was appointed “by the Chief Minister who is sought to be prosecuted”.
“It will never move forward, just like the Nanavati Commission. Twelve years have passed. We have not got any report. This is really the track record of the Gujarat government. So we don’t expect anything from the state government,” he said.
Mr. Sibal’s statement comes a day after Mr. Jaitley hoped that no judge will “lend” himself to the “political and malafide” exercise keeping in view the cause of judicial dignity.
He had said that all the judges approached by UPA have refused to be part of the “desperate” exercise as the new government will be in place in a fortnight.

Mr. Siddaramaiah, who was busy in electioneering for nearly two months, made a courtesy call on the Governor on Thursday and discussed various issues, including filling vacancies in the Legislative Council, according to sources close to the Chief Minister.
Terms of four members nominated by the erstwhile Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government — S.R. Leela, Doddarange Gowda, M.R. Doreswamy and B. Shivappa — will end on June 20. Incidentally, Mr. Bhardwaj’s term comes to an end on June 21.
Mr. Siddaramaiah took up the issue of nominations ahead of sending formal proposals to the Governor to avoid any embarrassment in the event of the latter refusing them.
The government was in a fix recently when the Governor refused to nominate a district Congress president to the Council under the educationist quota stating the proposal did not have any supportive documents, sources said.

Effective measures against money laundering essential: President
","President Pranab Mukherjee on Thursday said effective measures against money laundering and terror financing were essential in today’s global economic and security environment, as they fostered a more business friendly setting, facilitating legitimate investments and financial flows.
“India too has put in place a strong anti-money laundering legislation, the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, said Mr. Mukherjee at the “Enforcement Day” organised by the Enforcement Directorate on Thursday.
Commending the agency for its achievements, the President said: “I understand that the Directorate has been making rapid strides in investigating cases under the Act, attaching the laundered proceeds of crime, and launching prosecutions against the offenders. In some cases, the Directorate has succeeded in tracing and restraining the laundered proceeds in jurisdictions outside our territory limit. These attachments of laundered proceeds of crime have bolstered public confidence in them.”
Mr. Mukherjee also emphasised on the need for international cooperation in the fight against cross-border money laundering and terror financing. “Multilateral fora such as the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), the Eurasian Group on Combating Money Laundering and Financing of Terrorism, and the Asia Pacific Group on Money Laundering (APG) also need to be optimally utilised by the Enforcement Directorate for bilateral exchanges and follow up with counterpart enforcement agencies for better mutual cooperation,” he said.
Among the dignitaries present on the occasion were Vladimir Nechaev of the Russia Federation, president of the FATF; Mario Michel Affentranger of the Federal Office of Justice, Swiss Confederation; Rajiv Takru, Secretary Revenue, Ministry of Finance; and ED Director Rajan Katoch.
Last fiscal, the ED recorded the highest ever attachment of “proceeds of crime” valued at about Rs.1,759 crore. It made 127 attachments compared to 65 in 2012-13 and 127 in 2005-2012.
The ED, for the first time, also traded into still-untouched penal legislations such as Trade Marks Act, Customs Act and the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act.

EC may decide on Army Chief’s appointment next week
","The Election Commission would take a call any time next week on the reference made by the government on whether or not it could go ahead with the process for appointment of a new Army Chief.
According to sources in the Commission though in the last week of March it had communicated to the Defence Secretary that the Model Code of Conduct (MCC) does not apply to defence related matters including appointments, the full Commission would look into reference made by the UPA government on selection of a new Army Chief.
“The full Commission meets on a regular basis to consider various issues related to conduct of election. Some times it could even be twice a day depending on the issues and developments. Since the government has made a specific reference it is only natural that as and when the next Commission holds a meeting the Army Chief appointment would be on the agenda,” sources in the EC told The Hindu.
Among other subjects that could come up at the meeting include the petition by the BJP seeking review of the EC order on registration of an FIR against its prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi for alleged violation of The Representation of People Act, 1951 and Model Code of Conduct.
On Friday the Defence Minister A.K. Antony had said that the government had sought counsel of the Commission on the issue as it wanted to `strictly follow all the procedures’ before taking any final decision on the issue. The government move to seek EC’s advice followed questions by the BJP on the competence of the government to make any major appointments in the middle of a general election.
Tenure of the present Army Chief Gen. Bikram Singh would end on July 31. Traditionally, the appointment of chief of services has been made two months before the retirement of the incumbent.
However, in the case of present Army Chief Gen Bikram Singh the appointment was done three months before the retirement of Gen V K Singh, who was engaged in a long-drawn battle with the government over his age issue.
For several weeks now the principal opposition party has been questioning the propriety of the government to make new appointments including that of the new Army Chief on the plea that it would be against the letter and spirit of the Election Commission’s Model Code of Conduct (MCC) in operation since the announcement of the general election scheduled on March 5.
On April 19 the BJP Legal Affairs Cell wrote a letter to the Election Commission asking the poll body to direct the government to refrain from making `major appointments’ including those related to armed forces.
The letter had said, “We learn that something similar is cooking in respect of the Army Chief where the present incumbent is due to superannuate in July 2014. We also hear that there is some hurried activity in hastening the selection process of the Lok Pal”.
Well before the BJP letter the EC had informed the government on March 27 that the Code is not applicable to any matter pertaining directly to the defence forces, be it the recruitments/promotions for defence forces and defence purchases of all kinds.
“These instructions shall be treated as standing instructions of the Commission and will be applicable for all elections in future. This may be brought to the notice of all concerned for future guidance”.

How can RSS-born Modi be pro-women? asks Rahul
","Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi on Thursday observed that Bharatiya Janata Party’s prime ministerial nominee Narendra Modi claimed to be pro-women but represented an organisation known to nurture a patriarchal ideology. “The Lok Sabha elections of 2014 is a fight between two ideologies and one should be conscious of the RSS’s [Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh] thinking [and its] leader [Golwalkar’s belief] that India [made] a huge mistake by giving voting rights to women. And don’t forget that Modi, who now claims to be pro-women, also represents the same ideology.”
Addressing rallies in Himachal Pradesh’s Solan and Bilaspur, Mr. Gandhi slammed Mr. Modi for his alleged links with the industrial house of the Adanis and said “only one person’s wealth grew over the past decade”. He alleged that Mr. Modi allotted free land worth Rs.10,000 crore and free power worth at least Rs.20,000 crore to the Adani group. The business house, as a result, increased its net-worth from from Rs.3,000 crore to Rs.40,000 crore in Modi’s tenure, claimed Mr. Gandhi. “How could Modi claim to have developed the entire State of Gujarat and how much employment has he given to the youth?” he asked amid applause from Congress workers among the sparse crowd. The Congress leader also condemned former Himachal Chief Minister Prem Kumar Dhumal’s alleged allotment of Rs.250-crore-worth land for free to his son for developing a cricket stadium.

Police gear up for elections
","Over 6,000 police personnel, drawn from various security agencies, will be deployed for the Assembly and Lok Sabha elections scheduled for May 7.
According to Commissioner of Police B. Shivadhar Reddy, the contingent will comprise 556 assistant sub-inspectors of police and head constables, 1,281 constables from the civil police, 728 home guards, 570 armed reserve officials, eight companies of Central Reserve Police Force, and 10 platoons of the Andhra Pradesh Special Police.
The force will be led by four Additional Deputy Commissioners, nine Assistant Commissioners, 56 inspectors, and 149 sub-inspectors.
“This apart, we will have 1,717 uniformed personnel drawn from various departments such as Central Excise and RTA,” the Commissioner told The Hindu.
According to him, three CRPF companies will be retained post-elections for guarding the strong rooms where the EVMs will be kept.
“The EVMs will be kept in nine locations in the city and the strong rooms will have three layers of security arrangement. While the inner core will be manned by the armed CRPF men, the second layer will be formed by the Armed Reserve personnel, and the outer layer will be guarded by the men from the armed civil police,” he said.
The force will be deployed as per the Election Commission of India guidelines across the seven Assembly segments in 1,717 polling stations situated in 705 locations.
The Police Commissioner said that about 20 per cent of the polling stations had been identified as critical and hyper-critical.
“Every critical station will have at least five armed personnel from the Armed Reserve Police and hyper-critical ones will be manned by six armed CRPF personnel. This apart, one uniformed person will be posted at each booth to handle the queue,” he told The Hindu.
According to him, 120 route mobile squads, each comprising one officer and five constables, will be deployed for brisk movement covering four to five polling stations within a radius of 8 to 10 km.
“This apart, there will be 25 striking force or quick reaction teams and 10 special striking force to oversee the smooth conduct of the polls,” he said.

Left won’t have strong presence in next Lok Sabha, admits Karat
","Communist Party of India (Marxist) general secretary Prakash Karat conceded on Saturday that the Left would not have a strong presence in the next Lok Sabha to influence policy even if a third alternative government was formed with Congress support.
He was responding to reports suggesting that the Congress was wary of doing business with the Left for fear that the CPI(M) will try to steer the country away from economic liberalisation.
Fielding questions on a range of issues during an interaction with the media, Mr. Karat refused to be drawn into speculation on whether the CPI(M) would be open to having the Trinamool Congress in the third alternative if required. “We will have to wait and see because it is a party which has earlier had no hesitation to go with the BJP. Trinamool chief Mamata Banerjee’s attitude to [BJP prime ministerial candidate] Narendra Modi will become clear only after the elections,” he said, dismissing her anti-BJP statements as poll rhetoric. “It is very possible that she will join the NDA now and leave just before the West Bengal Assembly elections to get the Muslim vote.”
Maintaining that the widespread anti-Congress sentiment was being misinterpreted as a “Modi wave,” Mr. Karat insisted that the BJP alone would not benefit from this mood; even non-Congress secular parties stood to gain.
On the potential constituents of the third alternative, Mr. Karat pointed out that not one of the 11 signatories to the February 25 statement had gone with the Congress or the BJP. He also indicated the possibility of a couple of other parties joining this alternative, underscoring that the Congress would have to be integral to such a grouping.
About the stability of a third alternative, given past experience, the CPI(M) leader maintained that it was not the smaller parties but the Congress which destabilised two United Front governments.
About the Samajwadi Party’s alleged communal campaign, he said many of the statements attributed to the party were essentially made to counter the RSS propaganda that has been gathering steam ever since the Akhilesh Yadav government came to power in Uttar Pradesh.

Congress, BJP condemn Pakistan Army chief’s remark on Kashmir
","The BJP and the Congress condemned Pakistan Army chief General Raheel Sharif’s comments that Kashmir was the “jugular vein” of Islamabad.
Terming General Sharif’s comments as “provocative and aggressive,” the BJP on Thursday said Jammu and Kashmir was an integral part of India. “A unanimous resolution of the Indian parliament has stated in no uncertain words that the entire J & K, inclusive of those parts which are under illegal occupation by Pakistan, belong to India,” BJP spokesperson Nirmala Sitharaman said.
The BJP cautioned the Pakistan government against the use of “hawkish” statements that have the tendency to derail peace in the region.
“It is for the elected civilian government of Pakistan to speak up to ensure there is peace in the region. The government should ensure that it focusses its attention on building a peaceful Pakistan and not allow its army to pose threat and issue alarm calls against peace in the region,” Ms. Sitharaman said.
The Congress, too, asserted that Kashmir remained an integral part of India. “J&K is an integral part of India and the people of the State have just voted in the elections also. We don’t need to respond to statements like these,” said Finance Minister P. Chidambaram.
Reminding Pakistan that the entire State was acceded to India by the Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir, Union Minister and Congress leader Manish Tewari said: “The fact is that Kashmir is an inalienable part of India.”

Alleged IM operative deported from UAE
","Faizan Ahmad Sultan, named by the National Investigation Agency as a key Indian Mujahideen organiser, was deported by the UAE late on Friday, in what investigators describe as a key breakthrough in foiling the Islamist terror group’s recruitment and fundraising operations in West Asia.
Faizan was escorted to New Delhi by Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) officials and was arrested by the NIA soon after his arrival.
Police sources told The Hindu that UAE authorities detained Faizan soon after he was located by RAW in February, based on leads developed through the interrogation of alleged Indian Mujahideen commander Mohammad Ahmad Zarar Siddibapa. Siddibapa, held while crossing the India-Nepal border last year, is now awaiting trial.
Faizan, investigators allege, played a key role in helping Indian Mujahideen fugitives flee India after a 2008 police operation targeting the group led to the arrest of several second-rung operatives, and the death of top commander Mohammad Atif Amin. In addition, he is alleged to have helped Mohammad Ismail, also known as “Gora Ismail,” route funds from Karachi-based Indian Mujahideen military commander Riyaz Ahmad Shahbandri to operatives in India.
In February, a Delhi District and Sessions Judge issued a warrant against Faizan, after the NIA told it he had been held in Dubai. The warrant, sources said, laid the ground for UAE authorities to initiate proceedings for Faizan’s removal from Sharjah.
Earlier, a special cell of the Delhi Police requested another court to issue a warrant against him in connection with the 2008 serial blasts in the capital. The court declined the request.
Diplomatic sources told The Hindu that the arrest was a sign of growing cooperation with West Asian states — once safe havens for Indian criminals. Saudi Arabia handed over alleged 26/11 perpetrator Zabiuddin Ansari, though he held a Pakistani passport. In 2009, Oman handed over Sarfaraz Nawaz, accused of involvement with the Indian Mujahideen.

Migrant boats bound for Greece sink
","At least two people drowned and about 30 are missing after two boats crammed with illegal immigrants bound for Greece sank in the eastern Aegean Sea before dawn on Monday in the third fatal accident of the sort this year, authorities said.
The vessels foundered about 4 miles north of the island of Samos near the Turkish coast, the Greek coast guard said. It said 36 people were rescued from the sea.
According to survivors, up to 65 people were on the two vessels, the coast guard said.
It said the circumstances of the twin sinking were unclear as weather conditions in the area were not severe.
Coast guard vessels, fishing boats and two search and rescue helicopters were combing the area for more survivors. A cruise ship that participated for several hours in the operation was later cleared to continue its journey.
The nationalities of the migrants were unknown.
Greece is a major entry point for people from poor or war-torn parts of Asia and Africa seeking a better life in the European Union. Fatal accidents are frequent as migrants risk the dangerous sea crossing from Turkey.
Another 21 people have drowned in two accidents since the beginning of the year. Over the weekend Greek coastguards rescued about 250 immigrants from the sea.

21 Syrian rebels killed in Aleppo
","Fierce fighting around Syria’s contested northern province of Aleppo killed at least 21 rebels on Monday as rockets slammed into a government-held district in the provincial capital, killing nine people.
The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said that along with the 21 rebels, at least 30 soldiers were killed or wounded in Monday’s clashes in the province.
President Bashar Assad’s forces, backed by Lebanese Hezbollah militants and pro-government militias, have been trying to wrest as much territory in Aleppo from the opposition ahead of the June 3 presidential elections.
In the city of Aleppo, Syria’s largest and the provincial capital, government forces have been relentlessly shelling opposition districts with aircraft and artillery in recent months.
Aleppo has been divided between government - and opposition-held areas since rebels launched an offensive there in mid-2012, capturing whole neighbourhoods and large sections of territory outside the city and along the border with Turkey.
The rebels have been striking back, firing mortars and makeshift rockets into cities and towns under control of Assad’s forces. They have also detonated several car bombs in major cities, including in the capital, Damascus.
The state-run SANA news agency said rockets struck in Aleppo’s residential neighbourhood of Ashrafiyeh overnight, killing nine people and wounding several, mostly women and children.
The Observatory said troops loyal to Assad were battling Islamic rebel groups, including the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, around two rebel-held villages in Aleppo province on Monday.
The clashes, which erupted after Sunday midnight, killed at least 21 rebels, and killed or wounded about 30 Syrian soldiers, said the Observatory, which has documented the 3-year-old conflict based on reports from a network of activists on the ground. Syrian government does not publicize its casualties in the war.
Syria’s conflict, which began with largely peaceful protests in March 2011, has evolved into a civil war with sectarian overtones, pitting predominantly Sunni Muslim rebels against the Assad’ government that is dominated by Alawites, a sect in Shiite Islam. More than 1,50,000 people have been killed and millions have been displaced by the war.
Islamic extremists, including foreign fighters and Syrian rebels who have taken up hard-line al-Qaeda-style ideologies, have an increasingly prominent role in the war, dampening the West’s support for the rebellion to overthrow Mr. Assad. Many Syrians, particularly religious minorities, have also come to doubt the opposition, fearing that Islamic radicals would take over if Mr. Assad is ousted.
Mr. Assad took power after the death of his father, Hafez, in 2000. He has maintained throughout the conflict that his government is facing an uprising, insisting that his army is fighting terrorists that are part of the Western-and Gulf Arab-sponsored plot to destroy Syria.
Over the past year, Assad’s forces have been taking back rebel-held areas throughout Syria with a mix of crippling blockades, deals with rebels and relentless pounding of opposition-held areas. Presenting himself as a defender of united and religiously mixed Syria, Assad has pushed for the June 3 vote to seek a third seven-year term amid fierce fighting.
Despite two other candidates on the ballot, Mr. Assad is >widely expected to win the vote, which opposition activists and Western countries have condemned as a sham. The vote is expected to be held only in government-controlled territory.

Massive Mayan ruins found in Guatemala
","Researchers using a high-tech aerial mapping technique have found tens of thousands of previously undetected Mayan houses, buildings, defence works and pyramids in the dense jungle of Guatemala’s Peten region, suggesting that millions more people lived there than previously thought. 
The discoveries, which included industrial-sized agricultural fields and irrigation canals, were announced by an alliance of U.S., European and Guatemalan archaeologists working with Guatemala’s Mayan Heritage and Nature Foundation. 
The study estimates that roughly 10 million people may have lived within the Maya Lowlands, meaning that kind of massive food production might have been needed. “That is two to three times more [inhabitants] than people were saying there were,” said Marcello A. Canuto, a professor of Anthropology at Tulane University. 
Researchers used a mapping technique called LiDAR, which stands for Light Detection And Ranging. It bounces pulsed laser light off the ground, revealing contours hidden by dense foliage. 
The images revealed that the Mayans altered the landscape in a much broader way than previously thought; in some areas, 95% of available land was cultivated.
“Their agriculture is much more intensive and therefore sustainable than we thought, and they were cultivating every inch of the land,” said Francisco Estrada-Belli, a research assistant professor at Tulane University, noting that the ancient Mayas partly drained swampy areas that haven’t been considered worth farming since. And the extensive defensive fences, ditch-and-rampart systems and irrigation canals suggest a highly organized workforce. 
“There’s state involvement here, because we see large canals being dug that are re-directing natural water flows,” said Thomas Garrison, assistant professor of Anthropology at Ithaca College in New York. The mapping detected about 60,000 individual structures, including four major Mayan ceremonial centres with plazas and pyramids.

Britain’s May discusses trade barriers with China’s Xi "," British Prime Minister Theresa May said on Friday she discussed with Chinese President Xi Jinping the importance of removing barriers to commerce, especially for British food, drink and financial services, as the two countries move toward a future trading arrangement for after the United Kingdom leaves the European Union. 
Ms. May said the two leaders in their Thursday discussions agreed on a “trade and investment review” as a first step to future bilateral arrangements. 
“As President Xi, quoting Shakespeare, said to me yesterday, what’s past is prologue. And I wholeheartedly agree. The U.K. and China are opening a new chapter in our golden era,” Ms. May said. 
Ms. May discussed her meeting with Mr. Xi at a conference in Shanghai where she was introduced by the founder of Chinese online shopping giant Alibaba, Jack Ma. 
She is to fly home later Friday, capping a three-day, three-city visit to China. 
Ms. May’s meeting with Mr. Xi also included discussion of cooperation under China’s “Belt and Road” mega-plan for trade and infrastructure links across Asia. 
Ms. May has been hesitant to endorse the trillion dollar-plus initiative, although on Wednesday she expressed conditional support for British involvement as long as such projects adhere to established global business practices. 
Business deals worth more than 9 billion pounds ($13 billion) were to be announced before her visit ended, Ms. May earlier announced. 
Bolstering ties with China became more urgent after Britain voted in 2016 to leave the EU, compelling it to forge new trade agreements outside of the 28-nation bloc. 
British exports to China are up 60 % since 2010, and China is expected to be one of the U.K.’s biggest foreign investors by 2020. 
Ms. May’s visit coincided with the crash of a minivan into pedestrians in downtown Shanghai on Friday morning in which 18 people were injured. Police ruled the crash an accident caused when the driver set the vehicle on fire by smoking then lost control.

Cheating encouraged in new Monopoly version ","Do not pass Go. Do not collect $200: just steal it.
A new version of the decades-old board game Monopoly encourages players to cheat, but plastic handcuffs will leave them “locked up” if they are caught. The aim of the game remains as it has been since its creation in 1935: to become the richest player through buying properties and collecting rent.
But a recent study “revealed that nearly half of game players attempt to cheat during Monopoly games, so in 2018, Hasbro decided it was time to give fans what they’ve been craving all along,” a statement from Monopoly’s manufacturer said. The “Cheaters Edition” will be available at the end of this year.
It adds 15 cheat cards covering the most common types of traditionally unsportsmanlike play such as moving tokens more spaces than allowed by the dice, avoiding rent, or stealing money from the bank.
If they can get away with it before the next players’ turn, the “cheaters” will be rewarded with Monopoly money, a hotel, or $200 from the bank. “But get caught and you’ll pay the consequences! Pretend handcuffs will leave offenders “chained” to the board until they are released,” Hasbro says.
In another change, there is no longer a designated banker. Each player controls the central money pool during his or her turn — making it easier to pull off a heist.
While Hasbro says it “has finally decided to embrace our less-than-honest fans by encouraging them to partake in those iconic (yet sometimes unspoken) Monopoly moments,” the new version has its detractors.
“Monopoly is a horrible game,” and a cheaters’ monopoly would be even more so, said Edward Castronova, a specialist in media and games at the University of Indiana.

Syrian militants down Russian fighter jet, kill pilot
","Al-Qaeda-linked militants in Syria downed a Russian fighter jet on Saturday and killed its pilot after he ejected from the plane and landed on the ground in the embattled northwestern province of Idlib. The pilot resisted being captured and fired at the militants who then shot and killed him, according to one of the militants and Syrian monitors.
The Russian Defense Ministry confirmed the downing of the Su-25 and said the pilot was killed in fighting with “terrorists.” A report on the ministry’s Zvezda TV said preliminary information indicated the plane was shot by a portable ground-to-air missile in an area under control of al-Qaeda’s branch in Syria.
The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the plane was downed on Saturday afternoon near the rebel-held town of Sarqeb, which Syrian troops have been trying to take under the cover of Russian airstrikes.
Russia is a key ally of President Bashar Assad, and has been waging a military campaign on behalf of his forces since 2015. Since then, Syrian troops have captured wide parts of the country and in recent weeks have been making advances in Idlib. The province is also a base for al-Qaeda’s branch in Syria and other Islamic groups.
A Syrian militant in the area told The Associated Press that the Russian pilot was shot and killed when he resisted capture. The pilot opened fire from his pistol as the militants were trying to seize him, said the militant, who refused to be identified by his real name because was not authorized to speak to the media.
A video circulating on social media shows a lifeless body of a man, his face stained with blood, as bearded gunmen stand around him. One of the armed men shouts: “He is Russian.” The authenticity of the video could not be independently confirmed but it corresponded to events reported by the AP.
Earlier in the day, the Observatory and the media arm of al-Qaeda-linked militants reported intense airstrikes in Idlib. The Observatory reported more than 35 airstrikes on Saraqeb since late Friday, adding that many of its residents are fleeing.
The Ibaa News Agency of the al-Qaeda-linked Levant Liberation Committee, said Russian and Syrian warplanes and helicopter gunships have been pounding Saraqeb and the village of Tel Mardeekh in Idlib since the early hours of Saturday.
Syria’s state news agency, SANA, said Syrian troops captured the village of Maasaran as well as the Tel Tokan hill, cutting links between Saraqeb and the rebel stronghold of Maarest al-Numan to the south.
Syrian government forces and their allies launched a push into Idlib six weeks ago, inching closer to a key highway that connects Syria’s two largest cities, Damascus and Aleppo.
The U.N. says more than 270,000 people have been displaced in Idlib because of the government onslaught since Dec. 15.
Meanwhile, fighting raged on Saturday between Turkish troops and allied Syrian opposition fighters, and a Syrian Kurdish militia in the northern Syrian enclave of Afrin.
The Turkish military said two of its soldiers were killed in Syria and a third was killed on the Turkish side of the border in an attack by Syrian Kurdish militiamen.
The military said Saturday’s deaths were related to Turkey’s operation against Syrian Kurdish-held Afrin, codenamed Olive Branch. One of the soldiers was killed when a Turkish tank was hit in Afrin.
A total of eight Turkish soldiers and at least 24 allied Syrian opposition fighters have died so far in Ankara’s offensive, which started on Jan. 20.
The Turkish operation aims to clear Afrin of the U.S.-backed Syrian Kurdish militia, known as the People’s Protection Units or YPG, which Turkey considers to be a terrorist group and an extension of the Kurdish insurgency within its borders.
Turkish presidential spokesman said Turkey will not tolerate the presence of a Syrian Kurdish militia “anywhere” along its southern border, hinting that Ankara might expand its military operation underway in the Syrian enclave of Afrin eastward.
The spokesman, Ibrahim Kalin, said Saturday that Turkey’s first demand is to see the YPG move east of the Euphrates River and leave the town of Manbij, where American troops backing the Syrian Kurdish fighters are stationed.
Mr. Kalin called on the United States to “disengage” from the YPG and said Turkey will continue communications with “our American allies to avoid any confrontation.”
Turkey shares a 911-kilometer border with Syria. The YPG controls much of the territory along the border and an uninterrupted strip from Manbij to the Iraqi border.

Sri Lankan daily holds a mirror, to the press
","An English newspaper here on Saturday tried to hold a mirror to the state of press freedom in the country by printing a mirror image of its front page contents.
Readers were in for a surprise on World Press Freedom Day.  The printing of indecipherable words by Daily Mirror, an English newspaper here, seemed to be aimed at sparking questions about the state of media freedom in the country, and what it spawns — self-censorship.
Freedom of pressThe sole legible sentence on the front page read: “Only true freedom of the press can turn things the right way around. Celebrating World Press Freedom Day 2014!”  
The message rang a bell as Sri Lanka, for long, has been grappling with the issue of media freedom. There have been many instances of media persons being attacked, and even murdered.
The country has lost some of its senior journalists, including Lasantha Wickrematunge, editor of the 
Sunday Leader.  
“The fact that none of the perpetrators has been brought to justice is rather worrying,” V. Thanapalabalasingham, Editor of Thinakural, a Tamil daily. Such a situation only breeds more fear and consequently, self-censorship, said media professionals. The culture of self-censorship, in turn, negatively impacted the quality of journalism, they observed.
“Gains in professional standards could be undermined by a culture of self-censorship which could be due to a multitude of reasons, ” said Amal Jayasinghe, bureau chief of Agence France-Presse (AFP), adding that risk aversion and a lack of resources threatened to bring down the credibility of Sri Lanka’s press.
Observing that there was a threat to the freedom of expression, Saman Wagaarachchi, editor of Sinhala paper Lakbima said: “Today, most media organisations are wary of being critical of the government and therefore, self-censorship is a major issue.”
Over the last few years, media freedom in Sri Lanka has drawn increased international attention. The U.S.-backed resolution, adopted by the Human Rights Council (HRC) in March this year, has urged the Government of Sri Lanka to investigate all alleged attacks by individuals and groups on various sections, including journalists.
While mainstream media was faced with challenges, Mr. Jayasinghe observed that it was heartening to see social media take on issues which may be taboo or too sensitive for the established news outlets.

Tremors of Afrin attack reach Europe
","Turkey’s military intervention in Afrin, a northwestern Syrian town on the border region, to oust the Kurdish People’s Protection Units (PYG) militia is not only escalating the the conflict in Syria but has also triggered protests and counterprotests by Kurdish and Turkish migrants around the world. Turkey sees the YPG, the militia of the Syrian Kurdistan which is guarding the border towns that were freed from the Islamic State, as an ally of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which has been listed as a terrorist organisation by Ankara.
Military tensions between Turkey and the YPG have been brewing for a few years along the border. With the invasion finally under way, the tension appears to be spilling over to other countries. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has large crowd of supporters among the Turkish diaspora, mostly living in Europe. The same goes for the PKK, which has thousands of Kurdish supporters across Europe. Germany and Austria, where tens of thousands of Turkish and Kurdish migrants have been living for decades, saw several demonstrations late last week. In Austrian and German towns, the protesters marched either for the Turkish government or for the Kurds. Posters of Mr. Erdoğan or Abdullah Öcalan, the jailed leader of the PKK, were everywhere.
However, not every immigrant is happy with the turn of events. “In times of globlisation, people should find a way to engage each other and not fight over political or religious differences. I believe that people like President Erdoğan should not welcome that. The Turkish-Kurdish community is totally split,” said Serkan Kaya, 28, a pharmacist from the city of Innsbruck in Austria. Mr. Kaya, who has Kurdish and Turkish roots, believes the ongoing situation in Afrin “will not just kill innocent people” but also “destroy many friendships”. “In fact, it’s an abuse of the olive branch, which is a symbol of peace,” he said, referring to the code name of the operation.
Turkish immigrants have come out against the war too. “I feel there is a fundamental problem rooted in Turkish society. In no other country the military is so overly glorified and soldiers seen as the pride of the nation,” said Anil Altintas, 26, a student from Berlin. He says many of his compatriots do not take human rights violations by the Turkish military seriously. “The so-called strength of the Turkish nation has been a very popular narrative — not only under Erdoğan but also throughout Turkish history,” Mr. Altintas said.
Demonstrations took place in Turkey as well. Mr. Erdoğan threatened that there will be a “heavy price” for those who protested. Dozens of journalists and social media users have already been arrested for criticising the operation. The crackdown at home is having a ripple effect on the protests abroad.
“It’s problematic. We have already seen escalations during demonstrations. I think it is very obvious that the lines have been drawn clearly. Extreme positions are dominating both sides of the conflict,” said Cengiz Gunay, vice-director of the Vienna-based Austrian Institute for International Affairs.
According to Mr. Gunay, current events make clear that the so-called peace process between the Turkish government and the PKK is truly over. “It is understandable that the local political establishment does not like to see such protests here [in Austria and Germany]. However, they are partially responsible for these developments. Many immigrants, whether Turkish or Kurdish, do not still feel that they have really arrived here.”

Sour turn in India-EU trade
","The ban imposed by the European Union on the import of Alphonso mangoes and four varieties of vegetables from India until December 2015 after some consignments were found infested with “non-European fruit flies” has naturally upset India. As the biggest producer of the golden fruit, India sends about 70,000 tonnes of mangoes abroad every year. Yet, merely insisting that the 28-member bloc’s action is “unilateral… without any meaningful official consultation,” as Commerce Minister Anand Sharma has done, will not do. The EU had notified India in March of its concerns. Whether the Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority, which is tasked with ensuring that items of export are compliant in terms of sanitary and phyto-sanitary standards as set down by importing countries, was able to fully address them effectively, remains unclear. It is also to be noted that scores of consignments of mangoes and vegetables shipped in 2013 had been found to be contaminated. Periodic problems that come up with respect to shrimp exports over contamination concerns, are relevant here. India certainly needs to put in place fool-proof mechanisms for the examination and certification of export commodities to remove such taints once and for all. Necessary correctives need to be worked out with the involvement of technical and scientific bodies in order that in the lucrative but competitive export markets the country would establish its reputation as a reliable partner meeting health and phyto-sanitary standards.
On its part, the EU should ensure that any cause for a perception of its decision being an unfair one which smacks of a punitive approach and that would potentially jeopardise India-EU trade, is avoided. As the Minister has pointed out, the ongoing negotiations for a broad-based India-EU trade and investment agreement is based on the premise of trust and understanding to put in place a more liberal trade regime. Brussels should note Indian domestic concerns and invoke the necessary correctives on the basis of an appropriate assessment of risks. If it is indeed possible that sections of the EU bureaucracy see here a leveraging factor in the context of talks on a Free Trade Agreement, as also other bilateral issues, that will amount to unfairness. Although Europe is not a major market for Indian mangoes — it accounts for 16 million tonnes annually — any ban typically pulls down prices. About 80 per cent of the exports from India go to West Asia. What India should do is to strengthen its bargaining position by raising export standards and leave no quarter to be found remiss. The entire ecosystem for exports, involving farmers, packers and exporters of agri-commodities, should be geared to meet the quality and safety requirements of countries across the world.
***

>Editorial writer’s clarification: “Total Indian exports to EU countries in 2012-13 was only 4,071 tonnes. The figure of 16 million mentioned was not in terms of tonnes but absolute number of mangoes exported to the United Kingdom alone. Total exports of mangoes from India in 2012-13 added up to only 55,584.98 tonnes (according to data from the Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority), and it is unlikely that the figure would go up to 70,000 tonnes this year.”

Moscow’s Dhaka ambassador sees ‘polycentric’ order emerging
","Apparently defending China, India and Russia’s support to the present government, Russian Ambassador in Bangladesh Alexander Nikolaev has said they have “enough political wisdom” not to impose anything on any country.
Replying to volleys of questions at a special briefing with the members of the Diplomatic Correspondents Association, Bangladesh on Tuesday, Mr. Nikolaev said Russia does not impose any model on any country.

South Asian bloc

He said Russia wants to see the countries of South Asia, including Bangladesh, emerge as a powerful bloc in what he saw as a new “polycentric” world order.
The order is taking shape, he remarked, and added “It has become clear today that the unilateral world order is in the past.”
Mr. Nikolaev, who served in Kiev earlier, also accused the U.S. of distorting the Ukraine scenario and belittling Russia.
He observed Ukraine was in a deep crisis and assured that Russia would firmly contribute to the de-escalation of the conflict on the basis of the Geneva agreement. However, he added, the U.S. had “the stunning ability to turn everything upside down, to call black white”. The remarks by the Russian ambassador also came marking the 42nd anniversary of Russia’s diplomatic ties with Bangladesh.

Maldives Supreme Court orders release of former President Mohamed Nasheed, eight others
","In a surprise ruling Thursday evening, the Supreme Court of the Maldives ordered the immediate release of exiled former leader Mohamed Nasheed and eight others, terming their trials a violation of the constitution and international law.
The apex court has ordered new trials, citing the “questionable and politically motivated nature of the trials of the political leaders,” according to a news report of the AFP.
The government has said the administration “is currently working to vet and clarify” the ruling, and sources in Male indicate that the order is yet to be implemented.
“While the ruling makes significant implications on various points of constitutional import and criminal justice procedures, it was issued without representation of the State from either the Attorney General or the Prosecutor General,” international spokesperson at the President’s office Ibrahim Hussain Shihab said in a statement.
Tweeting on the development, former President Nasheed said late Thursday: “Welcome tonight’s SC ruling calling for the immediate release of political prisoners and the restoration of their civil and political rights. President Yameen must abide by this ruling and resign. Urge all citizens to avoid confrontation and engage in peaceful political activity.”
Even as the Male administration has said it will work to engage, and consult with, the Supreme Court in order to comply with the ruling, the police have reportedly clashed with dissidents on the streets of the capital early Friday, as they demanded the release of politicians whose convictions were overturned. “The police pepper-sprayed many of us there. They were trying to disperse the crowd that had assembled spontaneously in a show of solidarity and to celebrate the verdict,” Rushdha Rasheed, a journalist of local news channel Raajje TV, who was present there, told The Hindu over telephone.  
With his terrorism conviction now lifted, Mr. Nasheed will be able return to Male. He has been in London since 2016, when the United Kingdom granted him political asylum. As the Indian Ocean island prepares for Presidential polls this year, the SC ruling and his possible return foretells a significant change in the course of politics in Male.
President Abdulla Yameen's official website said the defence minister had called on the Maldivian people to put on a united front and work together to maintain peace and stability.
U.S. Ambassador for Maldives Atul Keshap welcomed the Supreme Court decision. “I urge the government and security services to respect this ruling, which bolsters democracy and rule of law all Maldivians,” Mr. Keshap tweeted.
The country has been mired in political unrest since Nasheed, its first democratically elected leader, was ousted in 2012. He was later sentenced to 13 years in jail on terrorism charges after a trial denounced as hasty and unfair by the United Nations human rights chief.
Mr. Nasheed, who has been in exile in the United Kingdom but wants to contest a presidential poll this year, had sought U.N. help to restore his political rights. The joint opposition in a statement welcomed the rulings and called for the immediate resignation of President Yameen.
“The Supreme Court's verdict effectively ends President Yameen's authoritarian rule,” it said in a statement.

China asks microblogs to tighten web policing "," China on Friday ordered the country’s microblog operators to establish mechanisms to remove false information, in the latest move by authorities to tighten web policing.
The Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) said the Twitter-like microblog platforms had allowed the spread of pornographic, vulgar and fraudulent content.
In addition to making sure to remove such content, companies should also keep a copy of what users post for at least six months, the CAC said in an online statement.
“Microblogging service providers shall play an active role in promoting economic development and serving the general public by promoting the core values of socialism,” it said. The statement did not go into any detail on what the new mechanisms should include.
China tightly controls the Internet through a censorship system known as the “Great Firewall” and closely monitors social media networks for sensitive content. 
Regulations in force since 2000 say websites are responsible for “ensuring the legality of any information” posted on their platforms.
China’s leading microblogging website by far, Sina Weibo, already uses automated scans and censorship teams to remove inappropriate content, but has not disclosed how many employees are involved in the work. 
Regulations that came into force last June require online platforms to get a licence to post news reports about the government, economy, military, foreign affairs, and social issues.

Man who drove van into London mosque worshippers jailed for 43 years "," A British man found guilty of murder after he drove a van into Muslim worshippers outside a London mosque last June, leaving one dead and injuring many more, was jailed for life on Friday and told he would serve at least 43 years behind bars.
Darren Osborne became obsessed with Muslims after watching a BBC TV drama about child sex abuse involving British Pakistani men and just weeks later carried out the attack in Finsbury Park, north London.
The 48-year-old killed Makram Ali (51), and injured 12 others, two seriously. He was found guilty on Thursday of murder and attempted murder after the jury took less than an hour to reach their verdict.
“This was a terrorist attack. You intended to kill,” said judge Bobbie Cheema-Grubb, sentencing him at Woolwich Crown Court in southeast London.
“You had not been radicalised over a long period of time but your rapid decline into irrational hatred of all Muslims turned you into a danger to the public,” she added. “You will pose a significant risk to members of the public .. for a very long time, perhaps for the rest of your life.”

Cape Town’s water crisis highlights city’s rich-poor divide ","“Day Zero” is approaching as South Africa’s showcase city of Cape Town prepares to turn off most water taps amid the worst drought in a century. Tensions among the four million residents are highlighting a class divide.
The top international tourist destination has both sprawling informal settlements and high-income oceanside neighborhoods. Some say poorer residents are unfairly blamed as concerns rise over wasting precious water. The military is prepared to help secure water collection points if “Day Zero” occurs.
The Associated Press is exploring how residents are coping as water restrictions tighten in an attempt to avoid the possible shut-off in mid-April, and it spoke with researchers about where the water usage problems lie.
Kirsty Carden with the Future Water Institute at the University of Cape Town pointed to the city’s leafy suburbs. “It has been in the areas where people have gardens, they have swimming pools and they are much more profligate in the way that they use water, because they’re used to the water just being, coming out of the taps,” she said.
Some residents appear to be changing their ways, she said, but “there have been problems in the more affluent areas where people are just, ‘We’ll pay for it.’”
About a quarter of Cape Town’s population lives in the informal settlements, where they get water from communal taps instead of individual taps at home, Carden said. “And there are always pictures of running taps and broken fixtures and ‘Look at the leakage’ and all the rest. But the reality is that those 1 million people out of a population of 4 [million] only use 4.5 per cent of the water.”
In one of the crowded settlements of corrugated-metal homes, resident Vuyo Kazi washed her laundry outside as others poured used water into the street.
“Before, I was using two kettles of water to wash myself,” Ms. Kazi said. “So now I use one kettle of water.”
Under new water restrictions that began Thursday, residents are asked to use no more than 50 liters (13.2 gallons) of water daily, down from the previous limit of 87 liters (23 gallons). The use of city drinking water to wash vehicles, hose down paved areas, fill up private swimming pools and water gardens is illegal. Residents using too much water will be fined.
Across the city, in the seaside town of Scarborough, resident Kelson da Cruz demonstrated the new normal of water rationing, pointing out the bucket beside his shower. The city has even promoted a Two-Minute Shower Songs project by top South African artists to keep water usage down.
“We are restricted with an amount of the water that we can use per day,” Mr. da Cruz said. “So we collect that water, and that water you can use to flush the toilet.” Another jar of water is used for tooth-brushing and face-washing.
Some 70 per cent of water used in Cape Town is consumed in homes, authorities say. Experts have said causes of the city’s water shortages include climate change and huge population growth. The local reliance on reservoirs, while projects such as desalination plants were largely left to the future, has been hurt by three straight years of drought.
Scientists are watching how authorities cope, as this would be the world’s first major city to go dry.
“We always open the tap, the water is there, easy,” Mr. da Cruz said. “I was lucky to travel to some dry countries where water has always been a big issue. So when we moved to South Africa that has always been on the back of our mind.
“And I think South Africa is for the first time is really catching up with the rest of the world. They have to change their habits. You can’t just take for granted something so precious.”

Fishing in troubled waters is now costly
","When Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi last month, voicing concern about Sri Lanka’s recent decision to impose steep fines on any foreign vessel found fishing in the island’s territorial waters, he was simply following his late leader Jayalalithaa’s footsteps.
In 2015, she wrote at least 21 letters to the Prime MInister, asking New Delhi to put pressure on Sri Lanka to stop arresting Tamil Nadu fishermen. In 2016, until October, she wrote 22 similar letters, according to officials. Whether it was O. Panneerselvam as Chief Minister, or V.K. Sasikala as the interim general secretary of the ruling AIADMK after Jayalalithaa’s passing, the top leadership has been consistent in this matter. However, Sri Lanka appears to be firm in its position. Amending its exiting Fisheries Act, Colombo has decided to impose anything between LKR 6 million (approximately ₹25 lakh) and LKR 175 million, as fine on foreign vessels fishing in its seas.
‘Fishermen follow fish and fish know no boundaries’ is a common refrain in Tamil Nadu, when it comes to taking a position on the highly-contested Palk Bay fishing conflict. But for all practical purposes, the International Maritime Boundary Line (IMBL) demarcates territory clearly, and most vessels used by Tamil Nadu fishermen — often bottom-trawlers known for their destructive technique that virtually scrapes the sea bed — have GPS systems installed, enabling fishermen to follow their course easily. The issue continues to be a talking point in high-level bilateral meetings, in addition to figuring extensively in the discussions of the Joint Working Group set up by the neighbouring countries to resolve the problem that has been dragging on for a decade.
Following years of bilateral deliberation and the consistent resistance put up by Sri Lanka’s northern fishermen, the two governments came up with some proactive measures. On Tamil Nadu’s part, with assistance from the Centre, efforts are on to convert bottom-trawlers into boats suitable for deep-sea fishing. The State hopes to get 500 deep-sea vessels ready for use this year, according to sources in the Tamil Nadu government.
This, along with Sri Lanka’s ban on bottom-trawling in July 2017, has had some welcome impact. Both the Sri Lankan Navy and the northern fishermen based in Jaffna and Mannar have observed that fewer Indian trawlers are spotted in their waters. However, that their Tamil Nadu counterparts are yet to completely stop trespassing is worrying the northern fishermen.
According to the Department of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources in Colombo, as many 49 Indian fishermen have been arrested from the beginning of this year, and 10 of their boats confiscated. Though some are sceptical about using strong legislation while responding to what is fundamentally a livelihood issue, others feel that is the only option in the absence of other safeguards for fishermen in the war-affected regions in the north. It is in this context that the northern fishermen welcome the higher fines.
Experts have put forth a range of other suggestions, including setting up an autonomous international authority to manage the Palk Bay and its depleting marine resources — initiatives that will warrant much thought, time and effort from both ends. As for northern fishermen, they only wish that Tamil Nadu will take a more honest and comprehensive look at the problem, while making a case for the livelihoods of the fisher-folk in the State.

Michelle Obama slams kidnapping of Nigerian girls
","US First Lady Michelle Obama on Saturday criticized the kidnapping of scores of Nigerian schoolgirls as an “unconscionable act” by “grown men attempting to snuff out the aspirations of young girls.”
Taking over the president’s weekly radio and Internet address on the eve of the American holiday for honouring mothers, Ms. Obama said that she and President Barack Obama are “outraged and heartbroken” over the April 15 abduction of the girls from their dormitory.
“In these girls, Barack and I see our own daughters,” Ms. Obama said, referring to Malia, 15, and Sasha, 12. “We see their hopes, their dreams and we can only imagine the anguish their parents are feeling right now.”
What happened in Nigeria is not an isolated incident, she said, but is “a story we see every day as girls around the world risk their lives to pursue their ambitions.”
Ms. Obama mentioned the case of Malala Yousafzai, the Pakistani teenager who survived being shot in the head as she travelled to school in 2012. Malala has become an outspoken advocate for the rights of all girls to get an education, the same message Ms. Obama delivered in her first solo address to the nation.
Ms. Obama noted that more than 65 million girls worldwide do not attend school even though educated women earn more money and have healthier families.
“When more girls attend secondary school, that boosts their country’s entire economy,” she said. “So education is truly a girl’s best chance for a bright future, not just for herself, but for her family and her nation.”
In Saturday’s address, the first lady asked the nation to pray for the Nigerian girls’ safe return.
“This unconscionable act was committed by a terrorist group determined to keep these girls from getting an education grown men attempting to snuff out the aspirations of young girls,” she said. “Let us hold their families in our hearts during this very difficult time, and let us show just a fraction of their courage in fighting to give every girl on this planet the education that is her birthright.”
The Nigerian government’s inability to rescue the girls nearly a month after they were abducted by the Boko Haram organization has sparked worldwide outrage, including protests and a social media campaign. The U.S. and other countries have sent teams of technical experts to assist the Nigerian government’s search effort.
Authorities have said more than 300 girls were abducted from their school in the country’s remote northeast. Fifty-three escaped and 276 remain captive.
President Obama said this week that the U.S. will do everything to help Nigeria find them.

Pakistan Army regaining lost base
","It’s been a season of rather grievous attacks and outraged denials. After Amir Mir, brother of journalist and anchorperson Hamid Mir who was shot in Karachi on April 19, blamed the ISI for the murderous attempt, the empire has struck back in a big way.
On the same day while ISI director general Zaheer-ul-Islam’s photograph was on air for several hours, the Inter Services Public Relations (ISPR) issued a statement condemning the incident and called for an independent inquiry.
Raising allegations against the ISI or the head of ISI without any basis is highly regrettable and misleading, the ISPR spokesperson said.
A week after the attack on Hamid Mir, posters with the DG ISI’s photo and slogans saying ‘Pakistan loves the Army’ appeared in the capital.
Earlier this week there were huge protests in major cities which sought to express solidarity with the ISI and criticised Geo TV.
On Saturday the Jamat-ud-Dawa (JuD), among the groups which put up the posters supporting the Pakistan army, the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) and other political parties organised a protest ironically on World Press Freedom Day. Amir Mughal, of the PTI said the media cannot attack Pakistan’s biggest institution.
Mariana Babar, diplomatic correspondent for The News told The Hindu on the phone that the ISI taking on the media was not something new.
When she started her career under the martial law regime of Zia-ul-Haq, things were more or less the same. The situation appears as if the country has gone back to the 1980s, she pointed out and nothing seems to have changed over the years.
However, she said the media, specially the electronic media should show greater responsibility while reporting news.
While everyone thought that other institutions in Pakistan had become strong like the media, judiciary, and civil society, Ms. Babar said, as soon as they stepped on the toes of the army, it hit back to show that it is still a sacred institution.
The army remains powerful and possessive about its space, she said.
Already The News and the Jang were being stopped in parts of the garrison city of Rawalpindi and other areas.
On the day after the attack on Hamid Mir, except for The News most other English newspapers played down the incident and chose to highlight the ISPR statement. Senior journalists are of the opinion that while it was natural for Mr. Amir Mir to make such statements, an investigation must first be carried out to ascertain facts.There are few who did not condemn the attack on Hamid Mir but the vindication of the ISI has been ferocious.

Trump again bats for merit-based immigration
","United States President Donald Trump has reaffirmed that he favours an immigration system which is fair, equitable and based on merit instead of visa lottery, a mechanism he described as “terrible.”
He made the remarks on Thursday during his address to the 2018 House and Senate Republican Member Conference in West Virginia.
“We want an immigration policy that is fair, equitable, but that is going to protect our people. We want people coming into our country based on merit and based on the fact that they are going to love our country, respect our people and our country,” Mr. Trump said.
“We don’t want visa lottery. ‘Pick a lottery ticket. Pick a lottery.’ We don’t want that. So we want it [immigration] based on merit,” he said to a wide applause from Republican lawmakers.
The White House had earlier defended President Trump’s proposal for a merit-based immigration system, saying the flood of low-skilled immigrants into the US has suppressed wages, harmed American workers, and strained federal resource.
Mr. Trump told the Republican conference on Thursday that the Congress now had a chance to pass into law the immigration reforms that the American people have been demanding for decades and that many of them have been working on for their entire careers.
“We have a great opportunity as a Republican Party. As the Republican Party, we have a great opportunity. We are getting very little help from the Democrats, but I hope after I leave this room, we’re going to get a call from these people saying, ‘Let’s go’,” the President said.
Mr. Trump said nearly seven in 10 Americans support an immigration reform package that includes a permanent solution on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals or DACA.
DACA recipients are often referred to as ‘Dreamers’ — people who were brought to the US as children by their parents.
“And I’ve been hearing about DACA for so many years. Some people call it DREAMers. It’s not DREAMers, don’t fall into that trap. It’s just much different than DREAMers. And I said the other night, you know, we have dreamers too. We have dreamers in this country, too. You can’t forget our dreamers. I have a lot of dreamers here,” he said. He alleged that the Opposition Democrats do not want to help the ‘dreamers’
“We want to take care of DACA, and I hope we will. We need the support of the Democrats in order to do it, and they might not want to do it. They talk like they do, but I don’t think they do. But we’re going to find out very soon,” he said.
“We want something that is very, very tough and strong, in terms of the border. We need to end chain migration, and we need to cancel the terrible visa lottery. And those are the four pillars that I talked about the other night. We call them the White House framework — a plan that will finally bring our immigration system into the 21st Century,” Mr. Trump said.

Kiev offensive kills dozens
","Ukrainian forces resumed the offensive against anti-government protesters in the country’s east, with dozens reported killed on Monday in fierce fighting near a rebel stronghold in Donetsk region.
Rebel self-defence forces battled advancing government troops on the outskirts of Sloviansk, the flashpoint of armed rebellion in Ukraine’s Russian-speaking southeast.
The Ukrainian army used aircraft and heavy artillery against the rebels, killing “more than 10 militia,” according to Rossiya 24 TV channel. Interfax news agency said at least 20 rebels had been killed.
Government forces lost four servicemen and about 30 were wounded, acting Interior Minister Arsen Avakov said.
Self-defence forces retreated into Sloviansk, and the army also pulled back.
The Ukrainian Defence Ministry said a helicopter had been shot down over Sloviansk on Monday. Kiev admitted to losing two helicopters during the first assault on Sloviansk last week.
In Donetsk, 1,000 volunteers were reported to have signed up to defend the city against Ukrainian forces following a call for mobilisation from the leaders of the self-proclaimed “Donetsk People’s Republic.” Rebels said they will hand out 10,000 firearms captured in the local security service headquarters in Donetsk.
The burning alive of dozens of anti-government protesters in Odessa, after a building was set on fire by Ukrainian neo-Nazi radicals on Friday, has ramped up hostility in eastern Ukraine toward nationalistic western regions of the country.
“We’re ready to fight to the end. If they [ultranationalists] come here they will just slaughter us,” a volunteer told Russian television.
The Interior Ministry announced on Monday that it had deployed in Odessa a new police force, “Kiev-1” battalion composed of “civil activists,” a euphemism for pro-government nationalists.
On Sunday, the neo-Nazis marched through central Odessa in an intimidating display of strength, chanting “glory to Ukraine.”
There were no Ukrainian nationalists among more than 100 activists detained after Friday’s clashes. On Sunday, relatives of the arrested broke into the detention station forcing police to release over 60 activists.
Germany’s Foreign Minister Frank Walter Steinmeier called for a Geneva-2 conference on Ukraine, saying that the April 17 Geneva accord had not been implemented.
“We do need a follow-up conference, as we should finally and fully agree on the diplomatic ways of Ukraine’s crisis regulation,” Mr. Steinmeier told the German broadcaster ARD on Monday.
Russia, for its part, is pushing for talks between Kiev and the protesters in Ukraine’s eastern regions.
One of the reasons Kiev is pressing ahead with its military crackdown is that the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which is due to release the first $3.2 billion out of a $17 billion loan for Ukraine agreed last month, said it could stop the disbursement of the rest of the money if Kiev loses control over its eastern regions.

Imperial Museum offers tantalising menu of war history
","“It was a bold step to attempt to convert buildings in the middle of an English town into an up-to-date hospital for Indians, in which all the different classes among them could live in accordance with their individual customs and as enjoyed by their different religions.”
From A Short History in English, Gurmukhi and Urdu of the Royal Pavilion, Brighton.” Issued by the Corporation of Brighton, published by King, Thorn and Stace, 1915.
When London’s Imperial War Museum opens this July after extensive refurbishment, it will re-tell the story of World War 1 in a newly-curated exhibition and with source material never before displayed.
From tantalising pre-launch titbits on the spirit and content of the exhibition put out by the Museum authorities, it promises to be contemporary and inclusive in its historical approach, and state-of-the-art in display.
The WWI rooms will also shine a new light on the role of armies conscripted from the British colonies in “the war to end all wars.”
The largest non-British component of the British fighting forces, and on which the imperial war machine heavily relied was from India. Nearly 1.5 million soldiers were drafted into the war effort. Of them 74,000 died. These were men who signed up for the promise of Rs. 15 as monthly salary, five rupees as batta and two rupees as field service, plus “free” food and clothes. They had little idea of the inhospitable regions and conditions under which they would have to fight.
“We show that Indian troops take part in critical battles from 1914,” said James Taylor, IWM historian. “Around 70,000 die such a long way from home. But the key value of the Indian Army on is that it takes over campaigns in the Middle East resulting in the Indianisation of campaigns. Mesopotamia is the key example.”
“The war gave India a new sense of national identity, and of course you get Amritsar in 1919, which we will show in the gallery,” he adds.
New facets of the India story in the war are likely to emerge. By this time, the British administration had shed itself of its insensitivities to Indian cultural practices – at least where it mattered to them. For example, in the hospital established at the Royal Pavilion in Brighton with its 724 beds for injured Indian soldiers, the authorities made arrangements for separate wards, kitchens and funeral arrangements for Hindus and Muslims, and different castes.
The main exhibition – into which the strands comprising the colonies will be woven – will tell the story of how and why the war started and its domestic and global impact, as seen through the eyes of those who experienced it on the frontlines and home front. There will be over 1300 war objects on display in 14 thematic areas in the exhibition.
“Visitors can consider some of the big questions and choices, ordinary and extraordinary, that the people of Britain and its former Empire had to face in the first ‘total war’ and discuss the impact the conflict had on the world in which we live today,” said Diane Lees, Director-General of IWM.
The cost of refurbishment was £40 million, but like all public museums in the country, entry is free.

Thousands of Syrians enter Homs after rebels leave
","Men, women and children fanned through the smashed ancient quarters of Homs, some in pickup trucks and bicycles, while most walked on a breezy, sunny day. A youth band banging drums and holding photographs of the Syrian President Bashar Assad marched through the area, adding a celebratory mood for those supporting his government amid the 3-year-old conflict.
The some 2,000 rebels as well as civilians living there were badly weakened by nearly two years of blockade that caused widespread suffering and hardship.
The deal is widely seen as a victory for Mr. Assad weeks ahead of a presidential election that he is expected to win, giving him a mandate to continue his violent crackdown on rebels in the Syrian civil war, which activists say has killed more than 150,000 people.
Residents scavenged what they could from their homes Saturday, mostly clothes, dusty mattresses and some burned gas canisters, carrying them away in plastic bags and trolleys.
“My house was completely destroyed and burnt, but I found some photos,” said Sara Mousa, 49, a resident of the old Hamidiyeh district. “They will remain a memory for me of the beautiful days we had here.”
Some accused rebels of looting their homes. Smaller crowds made the journey Friday.
Others rushed to the area of Bustan al-Diwan, gathering to pray around the grave of an elderly, beloved Dutch priest who was shot to death in April in a rebel-held part of Homs.
Father Francis Van Der Lugt, 75, was a Jesuit, the same order as Pope Francis. His death underscored fears among many of Syria’s Christian and Muslim minorities for the fate of their communities as Islamic extremists gain influence among rebels seeking to topple Assad.
“I came to pray on his grave,” said Rasim Sayrafi, 40. “The father was a secular man who walked with Muslims and Christians, together and equally. I am here to remember that.”

Therefore, the CSG personnel would have to make the routine trip in only one direction at a time — either to the north or to the south. The CSG would have to thus guard the sea 12 nautical miles off the shore, approximately about 21km from the coast.
The CSG personnel are keeping a vigil on not only the entire seafaring fishing community but also on those residing on the sea shore. Besides this, they also monitor the movement of the Sri Lankan refugees from all the camps in both Cuddalore and Villupuram districts.
Inspector (CSG) R. Sekar told The Hindu that he had met the Sri Lankan refugees in all the camps and told them to stay away from those who might come out with an offer to take them on a voyage to foreign countries.
Such offers would mostly come from the surreptitious operators of unauthorised crafts with an ulterior motive.
Mr. Sekar further said that all the fishing boats were being verified for their registration certificates, registration numbers, size, capacity, year of manufacturing and so on.
It was compulsory that all those going for fishing in all sorts of boats should carry with them the identity cards and should produce the same on demand from the CSG or Coast Guard or the Navy personnel.
He also stated that besides bringing all the fishing villages and hamlets under constant surveillance, the possible escape land routes too had been sealed. For instance, the check-posts at Marakkanam, Koonimedu, Bommiayarpalayam (in Villupuram district) and Reddichavadi, Alappakkam, Pudhuchathiram, Vallampadugai, Keerapalayam, Killai and Parangipettai too has been kept in full alert.
The fishing community has been instructed to watch out for the movement of any suspicious persons or vessels, and if they come across any, they are asked to duly report the matter to the CSG for further action, Mr. Sekar added.

Bhattarai calls for General Convention
","The sharp differences within the ranks of top leadership in the UCPN (Maoist) came to the fore again on Saturday with Dr. Baburam Bhattarai criticising the party chairman’s political report and calling for the party’s highest forum, the General Convention to be convened.
Dr.Bhattarai, a former Prime Minister, dubbed Chairman Pushpa Kamal Dahal Prachanda’s report as superficial and failing to address the changed realities in the party and the country, according to several local reports. In his report to the delegates in the closed-door session in the eastern city of Biratnagar, Mr. Prachanda noted that the party was moving in the right direction by adopting the necessary action plan. Dr. Bhattarai begged to differ.
“The report fails to address the managing of the two-line struggle within the party and its leadership style,” Dr. Bhattarai said in his seven-point rejoinder during the closed-door session.
He called for holding the party’s General Convention as soon as possible to suggest a political plan of action.
The General Convention, which should be held at least once in every five years, was last held in Hetauda in 2013 — after a gap of over 20 years.
He also criticised Mr. Prachanda’s assertion that writing the new Constitution “was becoming impossible.” Dr. Bhattarai said it was possible to have the Constitution drafted by the second Constituent Assembly if honest attempts were made.
“This would be in favour of the party and revolution.”
Dr. Bhattarai, who is known for offering notes of dissent or counter suggestions to the party chairman’s political reports or line of action, said it was necessary to have a healthy debate both within and outside the party on the way forward.
The ongoing conference has also brought to the fore internal differences. Delegates from nearly 10 of the 75 districts could not be chosen due to infighting.

Dallas man executed for May 2001 killings of daughters
","A former Dallas accountant condemned for fatally shooting his two young daughters while their mother listened helplessly on the phone was put to death in Texas.
John David Battaglia received lethal injection for the May 2001 killings of his 9-year-old daughter, Faith, and her 6-year-old sister, Liberty. Battaglia and his wife had separated and the girls were killed at his Dallas apartment during a scheduled visit.
The punishment was carried out after the U.S. Supreme Court rejected appeals from his lawyers to review his case, contending Battaglia, 62, was delusional and mentally incompetent for execution.
His was the nation’s third execution this year, all in Texas.
The 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals earlier in the day rejected an appeal that argued a lower court improperly refused his lawyers money to hire an expert to further examine legal claims of his mental competency.
The Supreme Court has ruled that prisoners can be executed if they’re aware the death penalty is to be carried out and have a rational understanding of why they’re facing that punishment.
Attorneys for Battaglia contended he didn’t have that understanding and that the state’s highest court, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, misapplied the Supreme Court’s guidance when it ruled that Battaglia is competent.
State attorneys said the Texas courts ensured proper legal standards were followed and that Battaglia had been provided expert help and a court hearing in accordance with Supreme Court precedents.
Another unsuccessful appeal challenged the effectiveness of the pentobarbital Texas uses as its execution drug.

At least 90 migrants feared dead in shipwreck off Libya ","About 90 people were feared drowned after a smuggler’s boat mostly carrying Pakistani migrants capsized off Libya’s coast early Friday, the U.N.’s migration agency said.
Ten bodies have washed ashore near the Libyan town of Zuwara following the tragedy in the early morning, said International Organization for Migration (IOM) spokeswoman Olivia Headon, citing information from its partner agencies. Eight were believed to be Pakistani, and two Libyans.
""We are told that two survivors swam to shore, and one person was rescued by a fishing boat,"" Ms. Headon said by phone from Tunisia's capital to reporters at the U.N. in Geneva. ""We are working to get more details on the [capsizing] and where the survivors are so that we can assist them better.”
The spokeswoman said Pakistani nationals have been taking an increasing share among the number of migrants attempting to cross the Mediterranean to Italy and Europe via Libya. By nationality, Pakistanis made up the 13th largest nationality represented among migrants making the crossing, while they grew to the third-largest national contingent in January.
IOM says 6,624 people crossed the Mediterranean in January about two-thirds of them to Italy alone about a 10-percent increase from a year earlier in January. About 250 people died in the crossing in January, six fewer than a year ago in the same month.

Iran arrests 29 women as headscarf protests intensify "," Tehran police have arrested 29 women for appearing in public without a headscarf as protests against the dress code in force since the Islamic revolution of 1979 intensify, Iranian media reported on Friday.
 Those arrested were accused of public order offences and referred to the state prosecutor’s office, the Fars, ILNA and Tasnim news agencies reported without elaborating.
 Chief prosecutor Mohammad Jafar Montazeri had played down the escalating protests on Wednesday, saying they were “trivial” and “childish” moves possibly incited by foreigners.
 He had been asked about a woman detained earlier this week for standing on a pillar box in a busy street without the mandatory headscarf.
 Unprecedented images of at least 11 women protesting the same way had been widely shared on social media.
 A prominent human rights lawyer told AFP on Tuesday that one of the detained women had her bail set at more than USD 100,000 (80,000 euros).
 Mr. Montazeri said those flouting “hijab” rules -- which require headscarves and modest clothing -- must have been encouraged by outsiders.
 But even religiously conservative Iranians have voiced support for the protests, with many saying that religious rules should be a personal choice.
 At least two photos shared on Twitter on Wednesday showed women in traditional black chador robes, standing on pillar box with signs supporting freedom of choice for women.
 One held a sign reading: “I love my hijab but I’m against compulsory hijab.” 
Female activist Azar Mansouri, a member of the reformist Union of Islamic Iranian People party, said attempts to control female clothing had failed over many decades.
 “Women show their opposition to such forceful approaches by their very clothing, from resisting covering their hair to wearing long boots and leggings,” she wrote in a series of tweets this week.
 Women have increasingly flouted the Islamic republic’s clothing rules in recent years and often let their headscarves fall around their necks.
 Morality police once rigidly enforced the rules, but are a much less common sight since President Hassan Rouhani came to power in 2013, promising greater civil liberties.
 The protests appear to mirror that of a woman who stood in Tehran’s busy Enghelab (Revolution) Street in December without a headscarf and waving a white scarf on a stick.
 She was reportedly kept in detention for nearly a month and has since kept a low profile.

Obama jokes about Putin, media at correspondents' dinner
","U.S. President Barack Obama poked fun at his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin, Republicans and media elites, and even mocked himself for his administration’s disastrous health care policy rollout at the annual White House Correspondents Association dinner on Sunday.
Mr. Obama, donning the role of comedian-in-chief, poked fun at himself over his signature policy initiative and refereed to the technical glitch experienced by healthcare.gov this year. “In 2008 my slogan was, ‘Yes we can.’ In 2013, it was control+alt+delete.”
Mr. Obama was at his oratorical best as he enthralled over 2,500 audiences, which included celebrities, politicians and American journalists at the WHCA’s 100th anniversary.
First Lady Michelle Obama accompanied him to the annual tradition that has the President mocking others and himself.
The 52-year-old U.S. President then turned to Fox news and said the TV channel would have a tough time in opposing Hillary Clinton, if she runs for 2016 presidential.
“Let’s face it, Fox. You will miss me when I am gone. It will be harder to convince the American people that Hillary was born in Kenya.”
Russian President Vladimir Putin too was at the receiving end of Mr. Obama’s wit, notwithstanding the Ukraine crisis. He cracked jokes about Mr. Putin being headed for a Nobel Peace Prize. “To be fair, they give those to just about anybody these days,” said Mr. Obama, a laureate himself.
He also turned the humour on Republican party saying the opposition brought in experts to learn how to talk to women.
“Both sides are doing whatever it takes to win - a ruthless game. Republicans, this is a true story. Republicans actually brought in a group of consultants to teach their candidates how to speak to women. This is true. And I don’t know if it will work with women, but I understand that America’s teenage boys are signing up to run for the Senate in droves.”
The President, who has completed nearly half of his second innings at the White House, also joked about opposition being busy attempting to repeal “Obamacare”.
“Of course, there is one thing that keeps Republicans busy. They have tried more than 50 times to repeal Obamacare.
Despite that, 8 million people signed up for health care in the first open enrollment which does lead one to ask, how well does Obamacare have to work before you don’t want to repeal it?” he said.
Mr. Obama recalled his days in office and the difficulties he faced last year and also mentioned the presidential election in 2016.
“It is strange to think that I have just two-and-a-half years left in this office. Everywhere I look, there are reminders that I only hold this job temporarily. But it is a long time between now and 2016, and anything can happen. You may have heard the other day Hillary had to dodge a flying shoe at a press conference,” Mr. Obama said as the slide showed Biden holding a shoe. “I love that picture.”
The dinner at the Washington Hilton Hotel has often come at key moments in the U.S. President’s presidency. In 2011, it came a day before Osama bin Laden was killed. Last year, the deadly Boston Marathon happened nearly two weeks before the dinner. This year, the Ukraine crises eclipses the WHCA event.

All the victims are from the same family and were on their way from one village to another when the bomb exploded, Mr. Wafa added.
No one immediately claimed responsibility for the attack, which came hours after another roadside bombing in the province killed three policemen and wounded two others. And on Monday, another roadside bombing in Herat killed four policemen and wounded four others.

Exiled former President of the Maldives Mohamed Nasheed promises to contest elections again
","Mohamed Nasheed, the exiled former President of the Maldives, said on Friday he hoped to contest presidential polls this year, following a surprise Supreme Court ruling that ordered his immediate release.
“Now that all my civil and political rights have been restored, I will be able to contest elections,” he told The Hindu in Colombo.
The Maldives witnessed turmoil on Friday, after the Supreme Court late on Thursday nullified the convictions of Mr. Nasheed and eight others, terming their trials “questionable and politically motivated”. Mr. Nasheed was barred from contesting any election in the Maldives after his controversial 2015 conviction on a terrorism charge.
 

Maldives Supreme Court orders release of former President Mohamed Nasheed, eight others


The development, in the wake of growing allegations of corruption and authoritarianism against President Abdulla Yameen, sparked violent clashes in Male between police and large groups of dissidents. While opposition supporters demanded immediate implementation of the ruling, police used force to disperse the crowd, local sources said.
“The police pepper-sprayed many of us. They were trying to disperse the crowd that had assembled spontaneously in a show of solidarity and to celebrate the verdict,” Rushdha Rasheed, a journalist of Raajje TV, present at the rally, told The Hindu over telephone.
The Supreme Court in its ruling observed that the earlier trials were a violation of the Constitution and international law. The apex court has ordered new trials.
In an official statement issued on Friday morning, the government said it would “vet and clarify” the ruling. On Friday evening, the international spokesperson at the President’s office, Ibrahim Hussain Shihab, said the administration had “shared its concerns” with the Chief Justice over the ruling.
In a press briefing held in Male, Attorney General Uz. Mohamed Anil assured the media that the administration was working with all relevant authorities of the state, to carry out the speedy implementation of the Supreme Court ruling. However, the government is yet to implement the order, according to sources in Male.
 

I will return, even if I have to spend the rest of my life in jail: Mohamed Nasheed


India urged the Maldives government to “respect” the verdict. “In the spirit of democracy and rule of law, it is imperative for all organs of the government of Maldives to respect and abide by the order of the apex court. We also hope that the safety and security of the Indian expatriates in Maldives will be ensured by the Maldivian authorities under all circumstances,” the Ministry of External Affairs said in a press release.
Meanwhile, President Yameen dismissed the Commissioner of Police, Ahmed Areef. According to opposition sources and local media reports, the top cop tried to take measures to implement the ruling on Friday, even as some within the police and military reportedly resisted it. Asked about the Commissioner’s sudden removal, the President’s office confirmed the move, but did not give a reason.
On the apparent reluctance of the Yameen administration to act on the ruling, Mr. Nasheed said: “President Yameen knows that if he implements it, we [the Opposition] would have a majority in Parliament. He is reluctant because he does not want to contest elections against me.”
Mr. Nasheed has been living in London since 2016, after the U.K. granted him political asylum. The likely re-entry of Mr. Nasheed foretells a significant change in politics in Male, especially at a time when opposition forces were finding it hard to field a candidate to fight Mr. Yameen in polls.
Male has been buzzing with the prospect of some change for some time now, political sources in Male said, particularly after Opposition forces began working closely with each other in the last year.
In Mr. Nasheed’s view, while a “combination of factors” were likely to have prompted the court ruling, the “last straw” was a recent raid on a resort run by Gasim Ibrahim, a prominent Opposition politician and a high-profile businessman. Critics said the raid was politically motivated.
“Moreover, people have begun realising that there is a strong radical Islamist strand within the government, the deep state. China’s growing debt trap in the island is also concerning many, about the Maldives possibly relinquishing the country’s sovereignty to China,” he said.
Observing that India’s statement on the development was “very welcome”, Mr. Nasheed said India must not only be “more closely engaged” with Male, but also watch the developments closely and make sure the rule of law is upheld in the Maldives.

President, the best friend of Christian Right? ","The rise of Donald Trump has challenged Americans of all stripes to recalibrate their moral compass, but no section has managed the transition as well as the Christian Right, it appears. The full-throated support that the President received from leaders of the Christian ultras over a fresh sex scandal is the latest case in point. The Christian Right has traditionally sought to hinge its political interventions on grounds of instilling Biblical values in public lives, but it now says that the priority is to ensure favourable policy.
Reports on Mr. Trump’s sexual adventures have long ceased to shock the American public and the latest one — that his personal lawyer paid a porn star $1,30,000 to keep mum about an affair — did not rise to the level of a presidential sex scandal.
The report in the Wall Street Journal, which is broadly sympathetic to the administration, revealed that Mr. Trump’s lawyer Michael Cohen arranged the payment to actress Stephanie Clifford after her lawyer negotiated a nondisclosure agreement, during the 2016 election campaign. Several other allegations of sexual misconduct had surfaced against Mr. Trump in 2016, which pushed back Christian groups only momentarily. Evangelical groups supported him in large numbers and continue to do so.
His alleged liaison with the porn star appeared to test the tolerance of the Christian Right that had long loathed the alleged sexual anarchy of the Left. But prominent evangelists were quick to adapt. Franklin Graham, who heads the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association, said this was a “deep state” conspiracy. “I believe we are in a coup d’etat... There are people in this country who are wanting to destroy the President and take over the government by force,” he said in one interview.
More curious was the new theological interpretation of the separation of church and state offered by Jerry Falwell Jr., a prominent minister and president of the evangelical Liberty University. “Jesus said love our neighbours as ourselves but never told Caesar how to run Rome. He never said Roman soldiers should turn the other cheek in battle... or that Caesar should tax the rich to help the poor. That’s our job,” he tweeted, arguing to keep Christian morality and American politics apart.
The Moral Majority movement that his father founded in 1979 had the exact opposite objective — to instill Christian morality in American public life. The Christian Right’s support for Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush was based on their argument that they were “godly leaders”. Over the past three decades, faith-based political activism has transformed in America as liberal churches declined and conservatives tightened their hold on believers.
The Right that rose to prominence called for virtuous people in office, but has changed tack in recent years. A survey during the 2016 campaign found that 72% of white evangelicals thought elected officials who commit an immoral act can still fulfil their public duties, a significant jump compared to 2011 when only 30% of them held that view. Now, the Christian Right says Mr. Trump has been its best friend in terms of policy and cites measures on abortion, immigration and allowing churches to involve in politics as reasons for supporting him. “We certainly don’t hold him up as the pastor of this country, and he’s not. But I appreciate the fact that the President does have a concern for Christian values, he does have a concern to protect Christians — whether it’s here at home or around the world,” Mr. Graham said.

Four-point peace plan for Ukraine
","Peace gets a chance in strife-torn Ukraine as >Russia and Europe agreed on a roadmap for ending the standoff between Kiev and rebellious Russian-speaking regions.
Following his meeting with Swiss President Didier Burkhalter in Moscow on Wednesday, Russian President Vladimir Putin called on pro-Russian protesters in Ukraine to postpone a referendum for “state sovereignty” they plan to hold on May 11 in Donetsk and Luhansk regions.
The rescheduling of the referendum is needed “to create the necessary conditions for dialogue,” Mr. Putin said in a statement for the press after his talks with the Swiss President.

‘Halt crackdown’

Another condition is a halt to the military crackdown on anti-government protesters in eastern Ukraine.
“Russia emphatically demands that Kiev’s authorities immediately call off all military and punitive operations in Ukraine’s southeast,” Mr. Putin said.
“The main thing today is to set up direct, full-fledged dialogue between Kiev’s current authorities and representative of Ukraine’s southeast, that would convince [the latter] that their legitimate interests within Ukraine would be guaranteed,” the Russian leader said.
Mr. Burkhalter, who is current head of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), announced a four-point peace “roadmap” for Ukraine, which called for ceasefire, de-escalation of tension, the launching of dialogue and elections in Ukraine.
Mr. Putin made it clear the plan had Russia’s backing.
“Our approaches to ways for resolving this crisis largely concur,” he said about his talks with the Swiss President. The peace plan appears to have also been coordinated with Germany. Kiev’s reaction to the OSCE roadmap was not immediately known, but Ukrainian authorities on Wednesday released “people’s governor of Donetsk” Pavel Gubarev, arrested in March.
Mr. Gubarev and two more activists were exchanged for three Ukrainian security service officers captured by protesters in Sloviansk last month.

Hague in Kiev

British Foreign Secretary William Hague and U.N. Under-Secretary-General for political affairs Jeffrey Feltman arrived in Kiev on Wednesday for talks with Ukraine’s acting president Oleksandr Turchynov and other Ukrainian leaders.
Protesters’ leaders in Donetsk region said they would consider Mr. Putin’s call to postpone a referendum at a meeting of their ruling council on Thursday.

G7 ministers seek alternatives to Russian gas supplies
","Alleviating Europe’s dependence on gas supplies from Russia - a problem exacerbated by the crisis in Ukraine - was the key focus as energy ministers from the Group of Seven (G7) concluded a two-day meeting in Rome.
Seeking alternative gas supplies has been on Europe’s agenda since at least 2006, when Russia and Ukraine first rowed over gas supplies.
The current fear is that escalating tensions with Kiev and Western powers may lead Moscow to again cut off gas deliveries passing through Ukraine on their way to Europe.
“The central issue is how to prevent energy from being used as a weapon in an increasingly interdependent world,” German Economics Minister Sigmar Gabriel, who is representing Berlin in the talks, said.
The United States, Canada, Japan, Britain, France, Germany and Italy resumed G7-format meetings in March, after Russia was expelled from the Group of Eight (G8) forum due to its support for separatists in Ukraine.
In Rome, there was no suggestion that Western allies would agree to further punish Moscow by >applying sanctions to its energy sector.
Russia has warned that it would retaliate. Several European nations are overwhelmingly dependent on Russian gas.
Italy and Germany, which have extensive energy and business ties to Russia, have been among the most cautious on sanctions, while the United States and Britain, which have their own gas resources, are seen as hardliners.
Whereas the US has placed Igor Sechin - chief executive of Russia’s state oil company Rosneft - on a sanctions black list, Rosneft has been welcomed in Italy as a minority shareholder of tyre maker Pirelli, one of the country’s leading industries.
The Rome talks were instead expected to produce a statement which would be submitted for further discussion at a G7 summit in Brussels on June 4-5.
The document was likely to list a series of options to reduce Europe’s reliance on Russian gas supplies, including: improving energy efficiency; exploring the possibility of bringing over to Europe shale gas from North America; and developing pipelines from the Caspian Sea.

Spain extradites Russian suspect — thought to be spam kingpin — to US ","Spain has extradited to the United States a Russian citizen who is suspected of being one of the world’s most notorious spammers.
Pyotr Levashov, a 37-year-old from St. Petersburg, was arrested in April while vacationing with his family in Barcelona.
US authorities had asked for him to be detained on charges of fraud and unauthorized interception of electronic communications. He was scheduled to be arraigned on late Friday in a federal courthouse in Bridgeport, Connecticut, where a grand jury indicted him last year.
A statement from Spain’s National Police said officers handed Mr. Levashov over to US marshals on Friday. The extradition was approved in October by Spain’s National Court, which rejected a counter-extradition request from Russia.
The Russian Embassy in Washington didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.
Authorities in the US say they have linked Mr. Levashov to a series of powerful botnets, or networks of hijacked computers, which were capable of pumping out billions of spam emails.
An indictment unsealed last year said he commanded the sprawling Kelihos botnet, which at times allegedly involved more than 100,000 compromised computers that sent phony emails advertising counterfeit drugs, harvested users’ logins and installed malware that intercepted bank account passwords.
On a typical day, the network would generate and distribute more than 2,500 spam emails, according to the indictment.
Mr. Levashov’s lawyers have alleged the case is politically motivated and that the US wants him for reasons beyond his alleged cybercrimes. They had argued that he should be tried in Spain instead, and pointed to evidence showing that he gained access to Russian state secrets while studying in St Petersburg.
Mr. Levashov’s U.S.-based lawyer, Igor Litvak, didn’t return emails or calls seeking comment on Friday.

In Mr. Nasheed’s view, while a “combination of factors” were likely to have prompted the court ruling, the “last straw” was a recent raid on a resort run by Gasim Ibrahim, a prominent Opposition politician and a high-profile businessman. Critics said the raid was politically motivated.
“Moreover, people have begun realising that there is a strong radical Islamist strand within the government, the deep state. China’s growing debt trap in the island is also concerning many, about the Maldives possibly relinquishing the country’s sovereignty to China,” he said.
Observing that India’s statement on the development was “very welcome”, Mr. Nasheed said India must not only be “more closely engaged” with Male, but also watch the developments closely and make sure the rule of law is upheld in the Maldives.

France sends more police to Calais after migrant gunfight "," Police reinforcements are arriving in the French port city of Calais after clashes among migrants left 22 people injured, as the interior minister warned of a worrying spike in violence. 
Interior Minister Gerard Collomb told reporters in Calais on Friday that five of the victims were injured by gunfire in Thursday’s fighting, blaming “totally organized” gangs. Police are seeking a shooting suspect but have made no arrests. 
Mr. Collomb said two extra police units were en route and warned of growing tensions in Calais, where migrants converge in hopes of crossing to Britain. 
Authorities said that Afghan and Eritrean migrants had been fighting with sticks and stones after a meal distribution before the shots were fired. Firearms are rare among migrants. 
The government closed a vast Calais migrant camp in 2016.

Russia pulls back troops from Ukraine border
","Russian President on Wednesday said Russia has pulled back its troops from the Ukrainian border.
Mr. Putin said on Wednesday that the troops have been pulled back to training grounds and locations for “regular exercises,” but didn’t specify whether those locations were in areas near Ukraine.
Earlier, Mr. Putin called for a delay in the referendum on independence for eastern Ukrainian independence, even as government and separatist forces clashed anew.
Mr. Putin made his plea after a meeting with Didier Burkhalter, the Swiss President and current chairman of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation (OSCE). He said the referendum could not go forward until the proper conditions have been established.
Pro-Russian forces in Ukraine have been pressing for the Sunday referendum in the provinces of Luhansk and Donetsk, arguing that they want to be independent from Ukraine and merged with a greater Russia.
To that end, many of their forces have occupied government buildings across the region.
The Ukrainian military has sought to quell the rebellion, sometimes with force and often with little success. The government has admitted it is losing control in the area.
Mr. Putin also called for the end of the anti-terror operations by the government and called for extremist pro-government forces in the region to be disarmed.
He also demanded the release of all political prisoners in the region, while praising the release of the pro-Russian governor of Donetsk, Pavel Gubarev, from Ukrainian custody. Mr. Gubarev was reportedly freed, in exchange for the release of three Ukrainian secret service agents by the separatist groups.
Mr. Burkhalter, who is also Swiss Foreign Minister, was in Moscow to advocate better implementation of the Geneva de-escalation agreement, reached last month between Ukraine, Russia, the United States and the European Union.
Russia has blamed the West and Ukraine for not implementing the agreement, which stipulates the disarmament of all illegal groups and the vacating of occupied buildings throughout Ukraine.
Mr. Burkhalter on Wednesday advocated an action plan, under which the four parties would back the May 25 presidential elections in Ukraine and a parallel referendum on decentralisation. However, the Ukrainian parliament, in a vote Tuesday, rejected a plan for the referendum vote.
In Berlin, Petr Poroshenko, a former Foreign Minister regarded as a lead contender for the Ukrainian presidency, urged the West to impose new sanctions on Russia should the separatists go ahead with the referendum.
“Should Russia support this referendum, we absolutely need a concerted response in the form of a third wave of sanctions,” Mr. Poroshenko said in Berlin.
However, he said that, if he were to become president, he would be open to discussion on any referendum.
He said there was no space at international negotiations about Ukraine’s fate for the separatists, saying Ukraine was not prepared for talks with “terrorists.” “They are, quite simply, terrorists. Some of them are mentally ill,” he said, adding: “We have stuck to all agreements. The separatists, who are supported by Russia, have so far not fulfilled a single one.” Russia has said participation by separatist groups was necessary for any Ukraine conference.
Meanwhile, fighting broke out anew in eastern Ukraine as pro-Russian insurgents from Sloviansk attacked government forces surrounding the rebel-held city.
A rebel representative in Sloviansk told the Russian Interfax news agency that the fighting was concentrated around a television tower in the southern suburb of Andreyevka. “We are taking the checkpoints back under our control,” he said.
There was no immediate information on casualties, nor did the Ukrainian government comment on the reports.
Interior Minister Arsen Avakov, who has been coordinating the operation in the region, said on Monday that the television tower had been retaken and was broadcasting Ukrainian channels.
Separatists, many of them heavily armed, have seized more strategic sites in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions in the past weeks, prompting the Ukrainian government to admit that it has lost control there.
Mr. Avakov claimed that government forces had retaken control of the city of Mariupol. “Mariupol has been completely freed” he said in a statement on his Ministry’s website.
Unconfirmed reports said that at least one pro-Russian activist was killed during the nightly raid on the city administration building.
Hundreds of pro-Russian activists gathered outside the administration building to protest against the eviction, 0629.com.ua news site reported.
An industrial city of almost half a million that borders the Sea of Azov, Mariupol is the second-largest city in the Donetsk region.

Giants grow in Galapagos nursery
","Crowded under a rock in the Galapagos archipelago, the baby tortoises wait for the sun to go down to leave their shelter.
Nothing disturbs these eastern Santa Cruz tortoises (Chelondis donfaustoi), which were determined just two years ago to be a new species native to the Ecuadoran islands that inspired Charles Darwin.
Kept safe on Santa Cruz island and raised in captivity, their nursery is one of three centres in the archipelago’s national park where 12 species of giant tortoises, unique in the world, are bred.
Stretching their necks and poking their heads out of tiny shells, they nibble on nutritious, starchy leaves of tropical plants brought in from the continent 1,000 km away. Digestion plunges them into afternoon slumber.
Long lifespan
“We let them stay a little hungry. That way, when they return to the wild they go looking for their food,” the director of the national park, Walter Bustos, told AFP.
It’s not yet time to let the tortoises go free. For that, their shells have to be 23 cm to 25 cm long, meaning around four or five years of age. That’s an insignificant span for these reptiles that can live up to a century and a half, reaching up to two meters (over six feet) long and weighing up to 450 kilograms.
Up until 2002, the scientific community believed all the tortoises on Santa Cruz island, the second biggest in the Galapagos, came from the same species, Chelonoidis porteri. But after years of genetic studies it was discovered in 2015 that those on the eastern part of the island, on Cerro Fatal (Deadly Hill), were a species apart: Chelonoidis donfaustoi.
There are not many of them, fewer than 400, and the threat of predators prompted park authorities to collect their eggs to hatch them and raise the babies in protective captivity to ensure their survival.
The plan is to release them, once mature, in the same spot where their original nests were found.

Thai students take a jibe at junta’s undeclared watches ","Thai students with huge banners and caricature puppets on Saturday delivered the latest satirical swipe at the junta’s number two — known as the “Rolex General” for his collection of undeclared luxury watches.
The watch scandal has seized a kingdom growing weary of military rule and sparked a spate of creative protests that are challenging the junta’s stranglehold on dissent. On Saturday, students leading an annual pre-football match ceremony in Bangkok wheeled a series of massive parade floats around the pitch — including several poking fun at junta No. 2 Prawit Wongsuwan.
The 72-year-old general has been the a target of public ire ever a since photo circulated of him in December lifting a hand to block his eyes from the sun, revealing a diamond ring and a pricey Richard Mille watch.
Since then, online sleuths have unearthed photos of the junta bigwig wearing some 25 luxury timepieces that he allegedly failed to list when declaring his assets.
One parade float on Saturday showed a puppet in the general’s now iconic sun-blocking pose, with a glittering ring and watch beaming from his massive paper mache hand.
In recent weeks, a growing number of activists have taken to the streets to defy a junta ban on protests and call for elections.

Divers search unopened rooms of South Korean ferry
","Divers battled strong currents and wind on Saturday to search unopened rooms in a sunken South Korean ferry for dozens of missing passengers, officials said.
The divers will focus on opening up six rooms on the third and fourth floors while again combing places already searched, emergency task force spokesperson Ko Myung-seok. The task force said 58 out of 64 target areas have been searched.
“It took a while to develop routes, but after the routes were developed to some degree, opening up the rooms and getting inside worked out in a short period of time,” Mr. Ko said.
The emergency task force said in a news release that eight bodies were retrieved from the rooms in the third and the fourth floor on Saturday. So far bodies of 236 victims have been retrieved; 195 were found inside the ferry while 41 were found floating in the sea. The release said search will continue in the night.
The South Korean passenger liner Sewol was carrying 476 people, mostly from a single high school, when it sank on April 16. Only 174 people survived, including 22 of the 29 crew members.

South Korea lowers survivor count in ferry disaster
","Three weeks after South Korea’s ferry tragedy, the government on Wednesday said it miscounted the number of survivors, a stunning error and the latest of many missteps that have eroded the nation’s confidence in its leaders.
Coast guard chief Kim Suk-kyoon said only 172 people survived the April 16, 2014 sinking of the ferry Sewol not 174, as the government had been saying since April 18.
Mr. Kim said one of the survivors was accidentally listed twice, and he blamed the other mistake on an inaccurate report by a passenger.
Another coast guard officer said the passenger falsely told authorities he had been travelling with someone who had sneaked on board and therefore was not on the ship’s list of passengers. The officer spoke on condition of anonymity because she wasn’t authorised to speak to media on the matter. She said the passenger later told officials he gave wrong information because he had “lost track of things”.
Mr. Kim also said there are two more missing passengers than authorities previously knew about. Both are Chinese nationals.
That change raises the number of people feared dead to 304. So far 269 bodies have been recovered, and divers are searching for 35 more people. More than 80 per cent of the dead are students from a single high school near Seoul who were on a trip to southern Jeju island.
Families of the victims and many other South Koreans have been highly critical of the government’s handling of the rescue effort, and the regulatory failures that may have allowed the disaster to happen.
Shortly after the sinking, officials announced that 368 people were saved, giving scores of families false hope. There is evidence not only that the ship was overloaded with cargo, but that the agency responsible for ensuring passenger safety has incorrect information about how much the ship could safely carry.
The lengthy, difficult underwater search for bodies off South Korea’s southern coast has deepened the anguish of families of missing people, who have been camping out at a nearby port waiting for the news of their loved ones.
Prime Minister Chung Hong-won told a Cabinet Council meeting that officials must work with “resolve to finish searches” by Saturday to help ease the suffering of relatives of missing people. Tidal currents, a frequent obstacle for divers, are forecast to be weak until then.
Mr. Chung has offered to resign amid public anger over the government’s handling of the sinking. President Park Geun-hye has accepted his resignation offer but asked him to stay in his post for the time being as the government was dealing with the aftermath of the sinking.
Searches have been hampered by strong currents, bad weather and floating debris inside the ship. A civilian diver fell unconscious while searching and died on Tuesday, the first fatality among divers mobilized since the sinking.
Mr. Kim, the coast guard chief, said many victims of the sinking crowded together into two cabins far more than had been booked into the rooms. Of the 269 bodies retrieved, he said, 235 were wearing life jackets.
All 15 surviving crew members involved in the ferry’s navigation have been arrested, accused of negligence and failing to protect passengers. Improper stowage and overloading of cargo is suspected as a possible reason the ferry sank, and four employees at the ship’s owner who handled cargo on the Sewol have also been arrested.

Pakistan ready to follow nuclear states in signing NPT
","Pakistan is ready to sign the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), along with five other “have” states. However, not signing it wouldn’t make a difference to the country’s nuclear programme, according to Dr. Ansar Parvez, chairperson, Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC).
Speaking at an international seminar on nuclear non-proliferation organised by the Centre for Pakistan and Gulf Studies (CPGS) and the Konrad Adenauer Stiftung on Tuesday, Dr. Parvez asked, though India’s agreement with the U.S. came with driving force which was commercial, how many plants have been set up in India? He added that you must have a deep relationship with the people with whom you collaborate and they must stick to you in times of need.
Responding to questions, he said that a possible Pakistan-U.S. nuclear deal was more of a foreign office concern but he did not see that coming.
Earlier, there was a heated discussion after Dr. Peter R. Lavoy, former U.S. assistant secretary for defence for Asian and Pacific Security Affairs and Mark Fitzpatrick, author of a new book on Pakistan’s nuclear programme, spoke about the perceptions regarding nuclear safety inPakistan. Speakers also felt Pakistan was facing nuclear apartheid and India would change its stand on no first use of nuclear weapons if a Bharatiya Janata Party government came to power. There was also a feeling that India had refused to engage meaningfully with Pakistan on the nuclear issue among other issues.
Mr. Lavoy said it was the right time for a nuclear deal between the U.S. and Pakistan but it would not be easy since the single most troubling concern in the U.S. was Pakistan’s nuclear weapons. There were also fears that Pakistan may once again resort to using militant or non-state actors for its foreign policy objectives in India and Afghanistan, apart from fears of proliferation of nuclear material.

Gao Yu detained
","Veteran journalist Gao Yu was among at least half-a-dozen Chinese scholars and activists who have been detained in recent weeks in the lead-up to the 25th anniversary of the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, as the authorities moved to limit any discussion or remembrance of the sensitive event.
Ms. Gao, who is in her seventies and has long been a strong advocate of political reforms, had been detained on charges of leaking “state secrets” to a foreign news website, according to State media. She had been missing since April 24. She had participated in the June 1989 pro-democracy student protests on Tiananmen Square, which were violently suppressed leading to the deaths of several hundred people. Twenty five years later, the event is still sensitive in China. State media said authorities had seized evidence from the Beijing home of Ms. Gao, and added that she had made “confessions”. The Chinese government has often used the vague charge of “state secrets” to detain critics.
Human rights groups have called on the government to release Ms. Gao and other activists who have been detained in recent weeks. Human rights lawyer Pu Zhiqiang, who has taken up a number of sensitive cases, was taken away May 4.
Human Rights Watch reported that four others who attended were also detained, including activists Liu Di and Hu Shigen and scholars Xu Youyu and Hao Jian.

Moscow to give peace another chance
","Russia hopes to initiate peace talks in coming days between Ukrainian authorities and rebellious eastern regions even as Kiev presses on with its military crackdown on anti-government protesters.
“I think new efforts will be undertaken in the next few days to bring to the negotiating table Kiev’s authorities and representatives of the southeast in order to resolve problems that cause suffering and death in different parts of Ukraine,” said Russia’s Deputy Foreign Minister Grigory Karasin, who looks after the former Soviet states.
The statement came hours after Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and German Foreign Minister Frank Walter Steinmeier discussed the possibility of Ukrainian talks on the phone.
Moscow said the two Ministers agreed “to assist in launching an equal dialogue” between Kiev and eastern rebels “on practical steps” to implement the Geneva accord. The talks are to be mediated by the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).
According to the Russian Foreign Ministry, Mr. Steinmeier “agreed with the need to immediately halt violence and begin implementing the agreements under the Geneva declaration of April 17.”
The Geneva accord called for an end to violence by all sides, disarmament of irregulars, and an “inclusive” constitutional reform Ukraine acceptable to all regions.
However, shortly afterwards, Kiev moved the army and the national guard against the protesters in Ukraine’s Russian-speaking southeast. Ukrainian authorities and protesters gave conflicting reports on Sunday on the situation in the Donetsk Region, which has been the flashpoint of armed confrontation in recent days.
Kiev claimed to have retaken Kramatorsk and a few smaller towns on Saturday while rebels said that overnight they restored control over the towns.
In Odessa hundreds of residents forced their way into a police station and secured the release of a majority of anti-government protesters arrested following deadly clashes with nationalist radicals on Friday in which 46 people died.
“It is outrageous that they arrested anti-fascist protesters and let go the militants who came from Kiev and massacred Odessa residents,” a demonstrator told Russian television.
Ukraine’s Acting Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk, who visited Odessa on Sunday, accused Russia and “pro-Russian separatists” of waging “a real war, a war to destroy Ukraine and its independence.”
Moscow said Kiev was “incapable of setting up dialogue without outside help.”
It is up to the international community “to force the Kiev authorities to stop violence in the southeast,” Deputy Foreign Minister Karasin said.

Russian hacking: what Trump’s secret memo says (and doesn't say) "," After more than a week of partisan bickering and social media-fueled buildup, the #releasethememo crowd got their wish. 
President Donald Trump declassified it. The GOP majority of the House intelligence committee released it. And the public dissection of the four-page, GOP-authored document began. 
What’s the gist of the memo? 
The memo makes a series of allegations of misconduct on the part of the FBI and the Justice Department in obtaining a warrant under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA, to monitor former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser Carter Page. 
Specifically, it takes aim at the FBI’s use of information from a former British spy, Christopher Steele, who compiled a collection of memos containing several allegations of ties between Trump, his associates and Russia. 
The memo says the FBI and the Justice Department didn’t tell the FISA court enough about Steele’s role in an opposition research effort. The research was funded by Democrat Hillary Clinton through a Washington law firm. 
The document also takes aim at several senior FBI and Justice Department officials. Among them is former Associate Deputy Attorney General Bruce Ohr, who it says knew of Steele’s anti-Trump leanings and whose wife worked at the firm behind the opposition research effort. 
What’s new?
The memo provides the first formal government confirmation of the secret FISA warrant and that Page was the person being monitored. 
Information like that is ordinarily considered among the most tightly held national security information, and it almost never gets released to the public.
Though the memo takes issue with the FBI’s methods, it also confirms that the FBI and Justice Department believed there was probable cause that Page was acting as an agent of a foreign power and a judge agreed four times over. 
The memo fills in the timeline of the Russia investigation, showing that Page was under surveillance for months. 
According to the memo, the Justice Department and FBI obtained the FISA warrant on Page on Oct. 21, 2016, and then had it reauthorised three additional times. 
Given that FISA warrants must be renewed every 90 days, the memo indicates that the government monitored Page’s communications for nearly a year. 
It started with Papadopoulous
The whole Russia investigation, that is. 
According to the memo, information about former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos “triggered the opening of an FBI counterintelligence investigation in late July 2016”. 
That’s significant because Trump and his allies in the GOP have tried to undermine the Russia investigation by saying it all stems from the Steele dossier. 
The memo doesn’t provide further details about the information the FBI received about Papadopoulos. But it appears to confirm, in part, reporting by The New York Times late last year that FBI concerns about Papadopoulos started the investigation. 
Papadopoulos pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI last year. Court papers show he had several contacts with people representing themselves as being tied to the Russian government starting in the spring of 2016. 
Court papers also show that Papadopoulos learned the Russians had “dirt” on Hillary Clinton in the form of “thousands of emails” prior to that information becoming public. 
The FBI did use information from Steele, though
The memo says Steele’s collection of reports “formed an essential part” of the FISA application for Page, but it doesn’t specify exactly what information was used or how much. 
It also says that the FISA application relied on a September 2016 Yahoo News article, and claims that the information in the article also came from Steele.
The document quotes former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe as telling the House intelligence committee in December that “no surveillance warrant would have been sought” from the FISA court “without the Steele dossier information.”
According to the memo, the application also included “Steele’s past record of credible reporting on other unrelated matters.” 
No underlying information released 
The accuracy of the memo is hard to assess because the majority of the underlying contents are classified or confidential. 
The memo cites an initial FISA warrant application a document which usually has dozens of pages as well as three additional renewals by the court. None of those documents are public. 
The same is true of the transcripts of the committee’s closed-door interviews with McCabe and other senior FBI officials who had contact with Steele. 
On Friday, the committee’s ranking Democrat, Rep. Adam Schiff of California, took issue with the memo’s characterization of McCabe’s comments, saying the former FBI deputy director was speaking generally about how any FISA application relies on “each and every component” included. 
But the committee’s chairman, Rep. Devin Nunes of California, said late Friday on Fox News the description of McCabe’s comments is “a summation of a long interview and that’s definitely what he said.” He noted that other witnesses have said “similar things.”
‘Minimally corroborated’ 
It’s been a burning question ever since the dossier was published by Buzzfeed News last year — How much did the FBI corroborate? 
According to the memo, not much at the time the FBI obtained the FISA warrant on Page. The memo cites FBI Assistant Director Bill Priestap as saying FBI corroboration of the dossier was in its “infancy” when the court authorized the first FISA warrant. 
It also says an “independent unit” in the FBI conducted a “source validation report” on Steele’s reporting and found it “only minimally corroborated.” 
But without the underlying documents or transcripts of Priestap’s testimony, it’s hard to judge the accuracy of the memo’s description.

‘N. Korea is flouting sanctions’
","North Korea is flouting sanctions by exporting coal, iron, steel and other banned commodities, earning nearly $200 million in revenue last year, a UN report said on Friday.
A UN panel of experts also found evidence of military cooperation by North Korea to develop Syria’s chemical weapons programmes and to provide Myanmar with ballistic missiles.
North Korea “continued to export almost all the commodities prohibited in the resolutions, generating nearly $200 million in revenue between January and September 2017,” said the report by the experts.
Coal shipments were delivered to China, Malaysia, South Korea, Russia and Vietnam by ships using “a combination of multiple evasion techniques, routes and deceptive tactics,” said the report.
The Security Council last year adopted a series of resolutions to tighten and expand exports bans aimed at cutting off revenue to North Korea’s military programs.
Seven ships have been barred from ports worldwide for violating UN sanctions with coal and petroleum transfers, but the experts said much more must be done to confront “these rampant illicit activities.”
The panel found that North Korea “is already flouting the most recent resolutions by exploiting global oil supply chains, complicit foreign nationals, offshore company registries, and the international banking system.”

People-to-people contact can erase suspicion: Anisuzzaman
","Anisuzzaman, who received the Padma Bhushan this year, has expressed the hope that the political leaders of Bangladesh and India would act like “statesmen” in resolving the outstanding problems between the two countries.
The Professor Emeritus of Dhaka University, who is best known for his secular democratic values, however, said it was “unfortunate” that several issues remained unresolved despite “improved” bilateral relations in recent years.
Indian High Commissioner to Bangladesh Pankaj Saran felicitated the professor on Friday on his receiving the Padma Bhushan which was presented by President Pranab Mukherjee on March 31 for his “distinguished service of high order” in the field of Bangla literature and education.
Hoping for better ties between the two neighbours, the 77-year-old professor said people’s representatives of both countries were the ones who would thrash out outstanding problems. The “fear of the unknown” and “suspicion of the unknown,” he observed, were causing a lot of problems between the countries. “If the people of the two countries can come closer and know each other, many of the suspicions may go away,” he remarked.
Prof. Anisuzzaman dedicated the award to “greater bondage” between India and Bangladesh. As a pragmatist, the professor said, relationships had their ups and downs, “so had the relationship between India and Bangladesh.”
His remarks came in the context of the failure to sign the much-talked about Teesta water-sharing treaty and ratification of the land boundary agreement, although Indo-Bangladesh relations saw wide-ranging engagement during the last five years.
The educationist and researcher, who has established himself in the vanguard of the nation’s secular ethos, thanked the Indian government for the award and called upon all to strive for “world citizenship” that Rabindranath Tagore, world poet and common poet of India and Bangladesh, advised.
Mr. Pankaj Saran said the award was “not only for his personal contributions, but also a tribute to the values for which he stands and the great intellectual and literary traditions for which Bangladesh has always been known.”

Juan Carlos Navarro, a former mayor of the capital, was in third in the seven-candidate field with 27 per cent.
Mr. Varela, who takes office on July 1, dedicated his victory to Panama’s democracy when the Electoral Tribunal’s chief magistrate notified him by telephone of his victory.

Ramallah gets its ‘MeToo’ campaign
","A young Palestinian-American is the driving force behind a nascent #MeToo movement in this patriarchal corner of the world, selling T-shirts, hoodies and denim jackets with the slogan “Not Your Habibti (darling)” as a retort for catcalls and writing down women’s complaints from her perch in a West Bank square. 
Yasmeen Mjalli, 21, wants to encourage Palestinian society to confront sexual harassment, a largely taboo subject. “What I am doing is to start a conversation that people are really afraid to have,” said Ms. Mjalli. 
Palestinian police receive few complaints about street harassment, said spokesman Loay Irzeqat. He believes some women fear unintended consequences, such as male relatives attacking accused harassers. 
Police mostly deal with online harassment, with about one-third of some 2,000 electronic crimes cases in 2017 revolving around men blackmailing women for sexual or financial gain, he said. Typically, extortionists threaten to publish photos deemed compromising, such as showing a traditional woman without her headscarf. 
Women lack legal protection, despite improvements such as the establishment of a police sex crimes unit, said Amal Kreishe, founder of the Palestinian Working Woman Society for Development to which Ms. Mjalli donates some of her proceeds. 
Still, Ms. Kreishe has witnessed gradual changes. More women seek counseling from her group, which has referred about 200 complaints to police over the past two years compared to a few dozen in previous years.

Over 40 dead in Odessa clashes
","More than 40 people have died in deadly clashes between supporters and opponents of the federalisation of Ukraine in Odessa as violence continued to spread across the country’s Russian-speaking southeast.
Clashes in the Ukrainian port city of Odessa erupted on Friday afternoon when around 1,500 supporters of the Kiev authorities armed with guns, chains and bats confronted about 500 anti-government protesters who had set up a tent camp in the city demanding greater autonomy from Kiev.
Pro-government radicals ransacked and burnt down the camp, forcing their opponents to seek cover in a nearby trade union building, which was then set on fire. Dozens of people trapped inside died from suffocation.
Video posted on the web showed a man wearing a bullet-proof vest repeatedly firing at people in the blazing building.
Police said 46 people died in the clashes and the fire and more than 80 were hospitalised.
The sudden flare-up of violence in Odessa, the third largest city in Ukraine, situated hundreds of kilometres away from the flashpoint of armed rebellion in Donetsk region, shows just how far Ukraine has slid towards a civil war.
Kiev said the clashes in Odessa had been financed by allies of ousted Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovich and orchestrated by militants from nearby Moldova’s breakaway region of Transdniestria and from Russia.
Ukrainian Acting President Oleksandr Turchynov blamed “foreign provocation” for the tragedy in Odessa as he declared a two-day mourning in Ukraine. Moscow has angrily denied the charges and pointed the finger at Kiev.
Dmitry Peskov, spokesman for Russian President Vladimir Putin, said the Ukrainian authorities “allowed extremists and radicals to burn unarmed people alive.”
“Their arms are up to the elbows in blood,” Mr. Peskov told Russian news agencies.
Mr. Peskov did not say how Russia could react to the escalating conflict in Ukraine, but pointed out that the Kremlin was getting thousands of calls for help from south-eastern Ukraine and Mr. Putin “is closely analysing the all developments in Ukraine to decide further steps.”
The Ukrainian forces on Saturday took control of Kramatorsk after what the head of Ukraine’s anti-terrorist centre described as “heavy fighting” against anti-government self-defence activists. He did not give any casualty figures, while militants, who are still holding out inside a government building in the centre of Kramatorsk, said 10 people were killed when the military opened fire on civilians trying to stop armoured vehicles from entering the town.
Self-defence activists in Sloviansk on Saturday released a team of international military observers they seized a week ago, handing them over to Russian envoy Vladimir Lukin.

Suspect held for petrol bomb thrown at Suu Kyi’s villa
","The Myanmar police said they have arrested a mentally ill man who confessed to tossing a petrol bomb into the Yangon compound of de facto leader Aung San Suu Kyi this week.
Ms. Suu Kyi was not home when the crude bomb landed inside the gate of her lakeside villa on Thursday, causing little damage other than a fire that burned a water pipe.
But the incident unnerved supporters of the Nobel laureate, who championed Myanmar’s democratic transition but has suffered a fallout with the international community over her failure to condemn army abuses against Rohingya Muslims.
Using photos taken by a witness of the attack, officers arrested Win Naing (48) in the early hours of Friday, according to a report posted on Yangon police’s official Facebook page.
“He confessed that he took a bottle filled with petrol...and threw it into the compound,” the report said, adding that Win Naing does a security job for a construction company.
Police said they believe Win Naing has “mental health problems” but will continue to take legal action against him.
He told officers that he was motivated to throw the bomb because he had been “cursed by magic,” the police report said.
Ms. Suu Kyi has not commented on the incident, which took place almost exactly one year after the assassination of one of her top legal advisors Ko Ni.
Ko Ni, one of few Muslims to hold a prominent government position in mainly Buddhist Myanmar, was shot in the head as he waited outside Yangon airport while holding his grandson.
The murder horrified the Muslim community and the ruling party in particular in a country where political assassinations are rare.

Rescue effort resumes at collapsed Colombian mine
","Rescue workers aren’t giving up hope of finding some 13 miners still missing after an illegal gold mine collapsed in southwest Colombia.
Eduardo Grijalba, mayor of the rural town of Santander de Quilichao where the tragedy took place on Wednesday night, said the search effort went on yesterday even though it is practically impossible to survive so long, trapped under 20 metres of heavy debris.
The bodies of three dead miners were pulled from the rubble on Thursday.
Mining accidents are common in Colombia, especially at wildcat mines in poverty-stricken areas dominated by criminal gangs.
Less than a week ago, four people were killed inhaling noxious gases following an explosion at a mine in Antioquia province.

Uruguay’s rules for marijuana market
","Uruguay has finally released its rules for the legal marijuana market it is launching this year, detailing how the government plans to get very involved in every aspect of the business. But anyone hoping the South American nation will become a pot-smoker’s paradise should probably head to Colorado instead, President Jose Mujica suggested on Friday.
Colorado licenses sellers and producers but allows any adult to buy up to 28 grams at a time and then go down the street and buy 28 grams more. In Uruguay, consumers must be licensed as well, and each purchase will be tracked to ensure they buy no more than 10 grams a week, he said.
Mr. Mujica and his ministers plan to sign the regulations on Monday, and they’ll take effect on Tuesday.

Afghan landslide aid effort gathers pace
","As Afghans observed a day of mourning on Sunday for the hundreds of people killed in a horrific landslide, authorities tried to help the 700 families displaced by the torrent of mud that swept through their village.
The families left their homes due to the threat of more landslides in the village of Abi Barik in Badakhshan province, Minister for Rural Rehabilitation Wais Ahmad Barmak said.
Aid groups and the government have rushed to the remote area in north-eastern Afghanistan bordering Tajikistan and China with food, shelter and water.
Authorities gave $400,000 to the provincial governor on Saturday to use in the aid effort, said Mr. Barmak.
President Hamid Karzai designated on Sunday as a day of mourning for the hundreds of people who died in Abi Barik when a wall of mud and earth broke off from the hill above and turned part of the village into a cemetery.
Authorities still don’t have an exact figure on how many people died in the landslide, Mr. Barmak said. Estimates have ranged from 250 to 2,700, but authorities have said it will be impossible to dig up all the bodies.
The government has identified 250 people, who died and estimated that 300 houses were buried under tons of mud, Mr. Barmak said.

Fraternity songbook in Austria glorifies Nazis "," A scandal in Austria over a student fraternity songbook with lyrics glorifying Nazis has put the new government under pressure and prompted soul-searching about the country’s relationship with its past.
The songbook, contained lyrics such as “Step on the gas... we can make it to seven million”, a reference to the six million Jews killed in the Holocaust.
The timing could not have been worse for Udo Landbauer, a candidate for the far-right Freedom Party (FPOe) in elections in Lower Austria State last Sunday — and the Germania fraternity’s vice-president.
After what Mr. Landbauer called a “media witch-hunt” and protesting he knew nothing about the book, the 31-year-old resigned on Thursday and suspended his party membership pending an investigation. The affair has thrown a spotlight on the FPOe and on the fraternities that many senior party members belong to.

Head of sunken ferry's owner in South Korea detained
","South Korean prosecutors on Thursday detained the head of the company that owns >the ferry that sank last month over an allegation of cargo overloading.
Authorities believe improper stowage and overloading of cargo are possible reasons the ferry sank on April 16, leaving more than 300 people dead or missing. Four employees at the ferry’s owner Chonghaejin Marine Co. Ltd., who handled cargo on the Sewol, have already been arrested.
Kim Han-sik, president of Chonghaejin, was detained on Thursday ahead of his possible formal arrest on allegations that he was aware that the ferry exceeded its cargo limit but didn’t do anything before it started it trip, according to senior prosecutor Yang Jung-jin.
Mr. Yang said prosecutors are investigating Mr. Kim’s actions before deciding if they will request a court to issue a warrant to formally arrest him.
All 15 surviving crew members involved in the ferry’s navigation have been arrested, accused of negligence and failing to protect passengers.
More than three weeks after the sinking, 269 bodies have been retrieved but 35 others are still listed as missing. South Korea’s Prime Minister said on Wednesday that officials must try to complete the search for the missing by Saturday as tidal currents were forecast to be weak until then.
But no progress has been reported as divers have failed to recover additional bodies since Wednesday afternoon due to high waves and strong winds, government task force spokesman Ko Myung-seok said.
Searches have been hampered by strong currents, bad weather and floating debris inside the ship. A civilian diver fell unconscious while searching and died on Tuesday, the first fatality among divers mobilized since the sinking.
The lengthy, difficult underwater search for bodies off South Korea’s southern coast has deepened the anguish of families of missing people, who have been camping out at a nearby port waiting for the news of their loved ones.
Many South Koreans have been highly critical of the government’s handling of the rescue effort, and the regulatory failures that may have allowed the disaster to happen.
On Wednesday, the government announced it miscounted the number of survivors, the latest in a series of missteps it has made that have eroded the nation’s confidence in its leaders.
Coast guard chief Kim Suk-kyoon said 172 people survived the sinking of the ferry Sewol not 174, as the government had been saying since April 18.
Mr. Kim said one of the survivors was accidentally listed twice, and he blamed the other mistake on an inaccurate report by a passenger.
Mr. Kim said there are two more missing passengers than authorities previously knew about. Both are Chinese nationals.
That change raises the number of people feared dead to 304. More than 80 per cent of them are students from a single high school near Seoul who were on a trip to southern Jeju island.
There is evidence not only that the ship was overloaded with cargo, but that the agency responsible for ensuring passenger safety has incorrect information about how much the ship could safely carry.

Musharraf trial: Defence to get FIA report, relevant documents
","The special court trying former President General (retd.) Pervez Musharraf for high treason on Thursday allowed an application from the defence to have access to the joint investigation report of the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) and all other relevant documents.
In its order, the court directed the prosecutor to file by May 14, 2014 copies of all statements of all the persons that were recorded during the course of the investigation, whether they were intended to be produced as prosecution witnesses or not, and the gist of evidence of all the witnesses likely to be adduced at the trial, and copies of all documents collected during the course of the investigation which have any nexus with the alleged crime.
The court also said that a copy of the Joint Investigation Report inclusive of any separate note if recorded by any member of the team must also be filed in court. The defence had contended in its arguments that there was a dissenting note by one investigator who had stated that a single person cannot be tried for the offence.
The order said the copies of all such documents shall be delivered to the defence counsel on the same day- May 14. The process of recording evidence of the prosecution witness shall commence on May 22 so that the defence counsel may have a clear seven days to examine the documents and prepare his case, as per law.
The defence in its application, the first of which has been allowed by the special court, had demanded that the names of all the co accused who aided and abetted with the accused in the promulgation of emergency order of November 3, 2007 be supplied and process be issued to them and they be tried jointly. It also demanded the investigation report based on which the case of high treason was filed and said the names of all those who were questioned in the course of the FIA investigation should also be made available in the interests of a fair trial.
The order said the prosecution had neither claimed immunity nor any secrecy with respect to any material that was collected during the investigation. The right to a fair trial is associated with the right of access to justice, the court held. It said that disclosure of all material having nexus with the alleged crime when demanded by the defence becomes a legal obligation and its withholding a breach, while issuing directions to the prosecution to furnish all relevant material.
Defence lawyer Faisal Hussain said it was the constitutional right of the accused to get all the material evidence and the court had agreed with the defence contention.

Book culture returns to post-Jihadist Mosul
","Literary cafes, poetry readings and pavement bookstalls — Mosul’s cultural scene is back in business, months after Iraqi forces ousted the Islamic State (IS) group from the city following three years of jihadist rule.
At the “Book Forum” cafe, men and women, young and old, sit passionately debating literature, music, politics and history.
Drinking tea, coffee and juice, some smoke nargileh water pipes while an oud player takes the stage to accompany a poet about to read from his work.
Opposite, the only wall not covered with bookshelves is instead host to a gallery of portraits — medieval Iraqi poet Al-Mutanabbi is pictured alongside Palestinian Mahmoud Darwish and a series of abstract paintings.
A few months ago, opening a mixed-gender literary cafe in Iraq’s second city would have been unthinkable — punishable by flogging or death under IS rule.
But with the jihadists gone, Fahd Sabah and his partner have set about realising their dream.
“While we lived under the yoke of IS, I told myself that it was an absolute must to open this place,” Mr. Sabah said. “There was a need to inform people, to enlighten minds, to bring new ideas.”
Like many young graduates in Iraq, the 30-year-old engineer had few prospects of finding employment.
So as soon as the jihadists were driven out of Mosul, he set about finding a venue and preparing to open a cafe, putting his savings into the venture. Within a month, it was up and running.
It was worth the sacrifice, he said. His project aims to create “a new consciousness to overcome this terrible period and the damage left by the war.”
Iraqis are renowned in the Arab world for their literary culture. Mosul, capital of Nineveh province and sitting at the crossroads of ancient trading routes, long boasted a parade of booksellers along its famous Al-Nujaifi Street.
But the IS methodically destroyed and burned books and destroyed libraries.
After the jihadists were evicted six months ago, a handful of activists set up the “Book Pavement” market outside the city’s battle-scarred university.
Ali Najam (23) comes every Friday to scour the stalls of second-hand booksellers next to the concrete carcass of a building disemboweled by bombs.
Today, he has picked up an English edition of Love in the Age of Cholera by Colombian Nobel Laureate Gabriel Garcia Marquez.
“People badly need culture and to build their consciousness after the hardships they went through,” Mr. Najam said. “There’s a need to rebuild people’s spirits, which is even more important than rebuilding the houses and the city.”
Yunis Mohammad, a 33-year-old writer, said that despite the destruction, “Mosul will be rebuilt thanks to the brains of its young people, its intellectuals.”
Abdelmonim al-Amir, head of Nineveh province's writers' union, has said he wants the world, which associates Mosul with “blood, destruction and desolation"", to know that the city has another face.
“Inhabitants and artists must make the human, cultural and academic dimensions of Mosul shine,” he said.
So far, everything is being done on limited means, in a city devastated by war, crippled by unemployment and held back by the slow pace of reconstruction.
“The public authorities in charge of culture must now do their duty,” said writer Hamed al-Zubaidi.
Hind Ahmed, a 31-year-old engineer, said the mission was important to Iraq, which in December announced the “liberation” of the country and the “end of the war” against IS.
“Now the land has been liberated, we must free minds and ideas,” she said, dressed in a white veil dotted with butterflies over a beige coat.
Iraqis must “give everyone the opportunity to participate,” she added. “Men and women.”

India steps up pressure on Switzerland to share bank info
","India has accused Switzerland of “providing protection to taxpayers found to have evaded Indian taxes” and seriously undermining India’s efforts in tackling offshore tax evasion and stashing of unaccounted income abroad”.
Union Finance Minister P. Chidambaram in his third letter to his Swiss counterpart Eveline Widmer Schlumpf within four months strongly objected to Switzerland’s denial of information about account details of certain Indians at HSBC’s Swiss bank branches in whose cases Indian investigators have found “incriminating evidence of tax evasion”.
Mr. Chidambaram also wrote that the interpretation made by Switzerland that it can not share information as per India’s request was not in accordance with international standards. Switzerland had refused to share the said information through a letter dated April 7 to Mr. Chidambaram. The stated reason was that India initiated investigations on the “HSBC” accounts on the basis of information extracted from data a disgruntled HSBC employee had stolen in 2011. India had received this “stolen” data from France.
At the official level meeting in New Delhi in February, the Swiss delegation insisted on a pre-condition, according to Mr. Chidambaram’s letter, for providing the information India is seeking that India needs to demonstrate that the investigation carried out in these cases was independent if the HSBC data was based on information already available with the Indian authorities prior to receiving the HSBC data from France. This pre-condition, Mr. Chidambaram wrote, amounts to Switzerland providing protection to the tax evaders India is investigating.
India has stepped up pressure on the European nation which is considered a major safe haven for alleged black money stashed by foreigners owing to its strong banking secrecy laws. Under global pressure, Switzerland has agreed to ease its banking secrecy laws in recent years. India and Switzerland had signed a tax treaty in 2011 to facilitate greater flow of information about alleged black money. Mr. Chidambaram also reiterated in the letter that India would continue to take a position at the Global Forum about Switzerland lacking legal and regulatory framework for an effective exchange of tax-related information. In the letter dated April 29, the Finance Minister urged Switzerland to honour its “rights and duties” agreed in the bilateral Direct Tax Avoidance Convention (DTAC) with India.

Mango ban: India threatens to drag EU to WTO
","Talking tough, India today threatened to drag the European Union to the World Trade Organisation if the 28—nation bloc did not lift its ban on the import of Indian mangoes and vegetables.
“We do hope that the EU will see sense, considering the strength of the economic partnership between India and EU, and not precipitate the situation any further, which leads us to go to the WTO,” Commerce and Industry Minister Anand Sharma told reporters here.
Sharma said he has already written a letter on the matter to EU Trade Commissioner Karel De Gucht.
He said the government has invested in creating world—class laboratories through the Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA) and their certification processes are acceptable to the EU, the US and other countries.
The Minister described the EU’s move as an “arbitrary action without any consultation.”
“It has no justification and I have said in my communication that it will definitely have a very negative fallout in respect of our economic relationship,” Sharma said.
He said APEDA has the mandate of certification of agri—produce exports and that is acceptable to all countries.
“That is why APEDA and the commerce ministry have taken up this matter,” he said, expressing hope that the issue would be resolved.
On Thursday, when asked if India is considering dragging the EU to WTO’s dispute settlement mechanism over the import curbs, Commerce Secretary Rajeev Kher said the issue should be addressed through consultation.
“I do not think that will be the right approach in this case. EU and India are strong bilateral trading partners. We should sort out differences through mutual conversation,” Kher had said.
On Monday, the EU banned the import of Alphonso mangoes, the king of fruits, and four vegetables from India for the period from May 1 to December 2015 after authorities found consignments infested with fruit flies.
Imports have been restricted as 207 consignments of mangoes and some vegetables shipped from India in 2013 were found to be contaminated by pests.
The UK imports almost 160 lakh mangoes from India and the market for this fruit is worth almost 6 million pounds a year.
India, the world’s largest mango exporter, sells about 65,000—70,000 tonnes of all varieties of the fruit overseas out of its total production of 15—16 lakh tonnes.

Japan’s ‘Insta-gran’ turns famous
","An 89-year-old Japanese woman armed with a camera and an appetite for mischief has shot to fame for taking side-splitting selfies — many of which appear to put her in harm’s way.
Kimiko Nishimoto tweaks the nose of fear: she has amassed more than 43,000 followers in just a few months since she started posting her hilarious snaps on Instagram.
The goofy photos show the fun-loving pensioner riding a broomstick like Harry Potter or, even more alarmingly, knocked over in an apparent traffic accident. “I’ve actually never injured myself taking a photo,” said Ms. Nishimoto at her home in Kumamoto, western Japan.
“I’m always focusing hard on taking a fun photo so I really don’t think about the danger too much,” she explains.
Ms. Nishimoto, who only took up photography aged 72, reveals she quickly became hooked on the hobby after being invited to join a local class.
A decade later she secured her first solo exhibition — held in her home town — but Ms. Nishimoto’s recent decision to showcase snaps of her daredevil stunts on social media has now catapulted her to stardom. Such is her celebrity now that many fans were shut out of her exhibition at a Tokyo gallery in December as it struggled to cope with the crowds.
“At first I didn’t even know that my photos were that popular,” she says, “It’s not so much that I’m trying to shock people, I just take photos that I find funny. It’s just a bit of fun really.”
Ms. Nishimoto manages her social media accounts herself through her smartphone, while her son helps her to set up some of the shots. She has three grandchildren and six great-grandchildren.
Many of Nishimoto’s photos show her face contorted in mock anguish.

Plight of Pak. minorities worsening: rights panel
","The condition of minorities is worsening and it is nearly impossible for those accused in blasphemy cases to have a trial in Pakistan, according to I.A. Rehman, secretary general of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP).
Speaking at the launch of HRCP’s annual report “State of Human Rights in 2013’ recently, Mr. Rehman said: “We are worried about the big picture and we do not find any indication of a comprehensive approach to human rights.”
There is only symptomatic treatment and no holistic approach, he regretted. He said the number of those killed in sectarian clashes did not give an idea of the state of fear they were living in. The state should reorient itself to people’s welfare and meet basic demands, he urged.
In the first few weeks of 2013, sectarian violence claimed the lives of over 200 Hazara Shias in Balochistan.
The report documented more than 200 sectarian attacks which killed 687 people. Seven Ahmadis lost their lives in targeted attacks and in the deadliest attack ever against Pakistan’s Christians, over 100 people were killed in a Peshawar church.
A Muslim mob torched a predominantly Christian neighbourhood in Lahore after a Christian man was accused of blasphemy. Hundred houses were burnt as residents fled. Individuals charged with offences relating to religion included 17 Ahmadis, 13 Christians and nine Muslims.
In Badin, bodies of two Hindus were dug up by mobs which claimed that the graveyards belonged to Muslims and only Muslims could be buried there.

Bhagat Singh case worth reinvestigating: Dawn
","The 1928 case against Indian freedom fighter >Bhagat Singh is worth reinvestigating as it will enrich historical accounts with factual detail, a leading Pakistani daily said on Tuesday.
“The trials and mistrials of the freedom fighters are the latter’s medals, a proof of their gallantry and of the oppressive colonial treatment they were subjected to. From that angle, it is difficult to see what additional honours a retrial could confer on these heroes,” Dawn said in an editorial.
“But a reinvestigation would expose the facts and satisfy the urge to recreate a picture as close to reality as possible. It will help to better understand the system as it worked then, and maybe offer comparisons with the practices of today. To that end - the enriching of historical accounts with factual detail - it is worthwhile to revisit the case of Bhagat Singh and other persecuted freedom fighters,” it stated.
A lawyer in Lahore has sought a reopening of the case pertaining to the murder of British police officer John Saunders in 1928, which led to the execution of Bhagat Singh and his comrades Sukhdev and Rajguru, saying that he might be innocent of the charges.
Last week, the police had provided the lawyer with a copy of the FIR registered against the three freedom fighters on Dec 17, 1928, for killing then assistant superintendent of police John P Saunders in Lahore.
“The FIR does not identify those who had attacked the British police officer. This could just mean that the complainants did not know who the assailants were at the time the FIR was lodged, and that the names of the suspects might have been added later,” the editorial stated.
Bhagat Singh, 23, along with Sukhdev and Rajguru were sentenced to death for killing Saunders and the three of them were hanged in Lahore jail on March 23, 1931.
“The Lahore High Court has deemed the availability of the 1928 FIR necessary for considering the reopening of the Bhagat Singh case and has referred the case to the chief justice and a higher bench,” the editorial observed.

He gave details of his date of birth and when he studied in the school. The prosecution wanted to move an application saying the witness was hostile but later decided to examine him again. The defence too crossexamined the witness with the same result. The prosecution has now moved an application seeking to re-examine the witness next week.

In love with Indian culture
","Lilting notes of music interspersed with spurts of claps and laughter flow into the peaceful evening. Surrounded by green hills, swaying coconut groves and cashew plantations, a young group of Germans sit playing guitar and singing songs in this idyllic village in Anandapuram mandal near Simhachalam. The village has been their home for more than six months now. So what is so special about a bunch of German students in the city? Tourists or maybe Indophiles at best? Not quite so.
Johannes Kuchle, Leonie Konrad, Jana-Nita Raker and Melanie Hunger are all undergraduates from Germany who are here with similar agendas – to impart education to tribal children and soak in the vibrant Indian culture in every possible way. Working as teachers and researchers at Bala Mitra (friends of children) school set up by Samata, an NGO, their experiences in the classrooms with the tribal children has been a “fascinating” journey they say.
“It’s remarkable to see the spontaneous creativity in the children of the villages,” says Leonie, who teaches arts and crafts in the school. “They know the names of every tree, the sounds of the birds and they are so amazing with colours and shapes. Being close to nature opens up the mind so wonderfully! Living in the city clogs those natural senses,” she adds.
Their mornings begin with a session of Yoga after which they head to the kitchen unit to learn the different types of tribal and local cuisines. “Bhendakaya (lady’s finger) curry and ‘Pulihara’ (tamarind rice) are our favourites. The cuisine here is so varied and every dish has a distinct taste,” say Jana and Melanie. They both have been working on a special project ever since they fell in love with the local delicacies. “We are translating the tribal recipes into German and planning to come out with a recipe book to give a glimpse of Indian culture and cuisine to German people,” they say. More than 35 recipes have been tried and tasted which will be a part of the recipe book. “A German foundation has agreed to support this idea and we plan to raise money for ‘Bala Mitra’ by selling the book in Germany,” they say.
The classes at Bala Mitra are as unconventional as the school’s new German teachers. Based on the Waldorf (Steiner) education system which is an experiential and imaginative approach to learning, the classes begin with singing sessions under the shade of tall trees. Art is taught by painting the walls of the well and the classrooms with creative ideas. “The Adivasi children have a pure originality about their interpretation of art. A student of class 3 one day made a portrait of mine which was so beautiful,” says Leonie.
Besides focusing on their work, the German students are also exploring the city and capturing a glimpse of the culture and tradition of India to take back as souvenirs. Interestingly, their favourite spot in the city is not the beaches but the busy Poorna Market! “There is so much character to that place and warmth in the people there. In fact, we made friends with the women vendors and also gifted them some photographs that we took of theirs,” says Johannes. While the weekends mean a dose of surfing lessons in the Rushikonda coast for Leonie, Jana explores her roots in India which she left behind when she was a few months-old toddler. Adopted from an orphanage in Delhi by a German couple, this is Jana’s first trip to India as an adult. “There is a lot of diversity in the culture. But I don’t have any childhood memories of it.

Trump steps up fight over Russia probe, approves release of secret memo ","President Donald Trump and his Republican allies on Friday escalated a campaign against U.S. law enforcement agencies over their probe into Russia by making public a classified memo that the FBI had sought to keep under wraps.
The document, drawn up by congressional Republicans, alleges bias against Trump at the FBI and Justice Department in the investigations into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and ties between Moscow and the Trump campaign.
 

Trump accuses Justice Department, FBI of pro-Democrat bias


Ignoring FBI urgings, Trump approved the release of the memo, deepening an extraordinary showdown between the president and senior law enforcement officials over a probe that has dogged him for his first year in office and that is now headed by Special Counsel Robert Mueller.
As soon as Trump declassified the four-page memo, telling reporters its contents told a disgraceful story of bias against him, Republicans on the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee released it to the public.
The document alleges the FBI concealed the Democratic ties of a source the agency used to justify surveillance on a Trump campaign worker. It says a string of senior Justice Department officials signed off on this.
The memo has become a flashpoint in a battle between Republicans and Democrats over Mueller's criminal probe, which is also believed to be looking into any attempts to impede the investigation.
Democrats say Trump's allies hope to use the memo to protect the president and possibly to give him a reason to fire Deputy U.S. Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who hired Mueller and so would be the person to dismiss him, or even Mueller himself.
Asked by reporters on Friday if he had confidence in Rosenstein, Trump replied, “You figure that one out.”
“A lot of people should be ashamed,” Trump said of the findings in the document.
Trump has repeatedly complained about Mueller's investigation, denying any collusion or obstruction of justice. Moscow has denied any election meddling.
In a Twitter message on Friday, Trump accused top U.S. law enforcement officers - some of whom he appointed himself - of politicizing investigations.
It was his latest attack on top justice officials. Trump fired FBI Director James Comey in May last year. Comey later told a congressional hearing that he believed his removal was an effort by Trump to undermine the Russia probe.
Senator John McCain, who is regarded as a heavyweight in Congress on foreign affairs, strongly criticized his fellow Republicans and Trump for attacking the FBI and the Justice Department.
“Our nations elected officials, including the president, must stop looking at this investigation through the warped lens of politics and manufacturing partisan sideshows. If we continue to undermine our own rule of law, we are doing Putins job for him,” McCain said in a statement, referring to Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Details of the memo
The document, commissioned by the Republican chairman of the House intelligence panel, Devin Nunes, uses the case of investigations into Trump campaign aide Carter Page, saying the FBI used a biased source to justify surveillance on him.
 

A year of Trump


It alleges that a dossier of Trump-Russia contacts compiled by former British spy Christopher Steele, and funded in part by U.S. Democrats, formed an essential part of requests to a special court to be allowed to conduct electronic surveillance on Page that began in October, 2016.
It says the initial application and subsequent renewal applications, signed off on by various senior Justice Department officials including Rosenstein, did not mention the link between Steele and the Democrats.
It also portrays Steele as biased, saying he was passionate about him (Trump) not being president.
The memo largely repeated allegations that Nunes and others had made publicly previously and did not appear to include major surprises.
Two days ago, in a rare public rebuke of the president and Republicans in Congress who were pushing to release the memo, the Federal Bureau of Investigation said it had “grave concerns about material omissions of fact” in the document and it should not be made public.
The FBI director, Christopher Wray, was appointed by Trump.
The memo cherry picks information, says Democrats
“The selective release and politicization of classified information sets a terrible precedent and will do long-term damage to the Intelligence Community and our law enforcement agencies,” Democrats on the House intelligence panel said in a statement.
 

A year of Trump: how much has changed in the past year?


The Democrats said they hoped to release their own memo responding to the allegations on Feb. 5.
The entire file that the Justice Department used to apply for permission to eavesdrop on Page remains highly classified, making it hard to evaluate the memos contents.
In his swipe at U.S. law enforcement leadership on Twitter on Friday, Trump said, “The top Leadership and Investigators of the FBI and the Justice Department have politicized the sacred investigative process in favor of Democrats and against Republicans - something which would have been unthinkable just a short time ago.”
He praised “rank and file” FBI employees.
His latest salvo was sure to worsen the president's frayed relations with agencies that are supposed to be politically independent.
James Clapper, the former director of national intelligence under Democratic President Barack Obama, said Trump's attack on the FBI and Justice Department was the “pot calling the kettle black.”
Seeking to defuse the conflict over the memo, Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan backed the release of a Democratic counterpoint document. His office said he backed making the Democrats' rebuttal public if it does not reveal intelligence gathering sources or methods.
Democrats say their counter-memo restores context and information left out of the Republican version. Republicans have resisted releasing that document.

Musharraf told to appear in court in Lal Masjid case
","Former military dictator Pervez Musharraf was on Saturday summoned by a Pakistani court on May 22 in connection with a case related to the killing of Lal Masjid cleric Abdul Rasheed Ghazi in a 2007 military raid.
Additional district and sessions Judge Wajid Ali heard the case. Musharraf’s lawyers submitted an application requesting that the former president be exempted from attending today’s proceedings, citing security threats.
During the hearing, an acquittal plea was also submitted in the court on behalf of the retired general.
Musharraf’s counsel Akhtar Shah presented the stance that the Lal Masjid operation was conducted on the directives of the then-administration.
He added that Deputy Commissioner Islamabad had written a letter to Triple One Brigade for conducting the operation.
Shah said it would be an injustice to hold Musharraf responsible for the operation.
The court issued notices to the concerned parties on Musharraf’s applications seeking permanent exemption from court proceedings and acquittal from murder charges.
The plaintiff Haroon Rashid’s lawyer, Tariq Asad, said Musharraf could be produced in court by making proper security arrangements.
He also suggested that Musharraf’s trial could be held in the High Court building. He added that Musharraf was also making his mother’s serious illness an excuse for escaping the trial.

Van carrying gas canisters injures 18 in Shanghai crash "," The driver of a minivan hauling gas canisters set fire to his vehicle while smoking a cigarette Friday, plowing into pedestrians and bursting into flames, leaving 18 people injured in the heart of the Chinese financial hub of Shanghai. 
Police ruled out the possibility of a deliberate attack and described the crash as an accident. The 40-year-old minivan driver, whom police identified only by his surname Chen, lost control after a fire erupted in his van, which held several plastic bottles of gasoline as well as six canisters of liquid gas.
A cigarette butt found by investigators in the van likely started the fire, Shanghai police said in a statement on Friday evening. They said Mr. Chen had been alone in the vehicle. 
Mr. Chen was being treated for severe smoke inhalation and was in a coma, and nine other people were still hospitalized, police said. Chen works for a Shanghai metals company and had no criminal record but is now under suspicion for transporting dangerous materials. 
The incident, which took place during a morning commute period near Shanghai’s People’s Park and a vast plaza that is also home to the headquarters of the municipal government, provided a brief scare for a city that was hosting British Prime Minister Theresa May. Vehicle attacks by extremists have killed scores globally in recent years, including some in Chinese cities. 
The minivan veered onto a sidewalk and burst into flames around 9 a.m. on busy Nanjing West Road in the heart of Shanghai, a metropolis of almost 25 million people that is widely regarded as China’s most cosmopolitan city. 
“It couldn’t stop, crashed into the corner and caught fire,” said a cleaner who works in a building across the street from the crash site. Like many Chinese, she asked only to be identified by her surname, Xu. 
She told The Associated Press she saw smoke coming out of the van as it drove down the street before careening out of control. 
The website of the local Xinmin Wanbao newspaper and other local news media said the van struck five to six people waiting for a light change at a busy pedestrian crossing. 
Videos on social media showed injured people lying on the pavement next to a Starbucks cafe and others pinned under the tires of the van. Firefighters were seen trying to put out a blaze inside the vehicle. 
Ms. Xu, the cleaner, said she saw two men struggling to pull a person out of the van. “Other people told them to stop. Then the police and ambulance arrived,” she said. 
A man who witnessed the crash on his way to People’s Park said in a video interview carried by Chinese media that the minivan seemed to be moving fast as it veered across the road. 
“The minivan did not slow down. The driver must have been in a panic at the time. He didn’t slow down and just directly crashed,” said the witness, who wasn’t identified. “It was on the other side of the road and made a turn over to this side. People saw it and quickly tried to get away but a lot of people were still hit.” 
The man said firefighters removed liquefied gas canisters from the vehicle.
At the nearby Changzheng Hospital, Shanghai resident Liu Axing told AP that his daughter, Liu Jianying, was crossing the street on her way to work when she was struck by the van. 
She was undergoing surgery for a broken shoulder and pelvis, Mr. Liu said as he pulled up a picture on his phone of his daughter pinned under the vehicle’s front wheel, seemingly unconscious. 
Three people were more seriously injured than her, Mr. Liu added. 
A relative of one patient in the emergency room, who declined to be identified, said at least five or six crash patients were being treated there.
Before police declared the crash an accident, there were fears of a repeat of 2013, when five people, including three attackers, were killed when a four-wheel drive vehicle plowed into a crowd in front of Tiananmen Gate in the center of Beijing. The attack was blamed on separatist extremists from the Turkic Muslim Uighur ethnic group native to northwestern China. 
Vehicle attacks have also taken place in Europe and the United States, most recently in October, when eight people in New York City were killed by an attacker claiming allegiance to the Islamic State group. 
Friday’s crash occurred just as the British Prime Minister was speaking at a business event in Shanghai. Ms. May’s speech was at a forum in the Lujiazui district on the opposite side of the Huangpu River from People’s Park. 
Other speakers at the event included Li Shufu, the chairman of Chinese carmaker Geely, and Nobel Prize-winning physicist Kostya Novoselov. Ms. May on Thursday met Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing as part of her three-day visit aimed at establishing a new trading relationship after Britain leaves the European Union. 
The crash came at the start of the Lunar New Year travel period, when hundreds of millions of people return to their hometowns for the most important family holiday of the year. During the weeks-long travel period, authorities emphasize safety on the road and aboard planes, trains and ferries. 
Li Jing, a professor of disaster management at Beijing Normal University’s School of Social Development and Public Policy, said the incident also points to the need for increased safety awareness in China, where gas canisters and other highly dangerous objects are sometimes transported on flatbed tricycles even in major cities such as Beijing. 
“Because of his complete ignorance of safety rules, his action has amplified harm and risk to the public resulting in such casualties,” Li said of the driver. “It indicates how urgent it is for the government to step up promotion of public safety knowledge and awareness.”

Gunman, 3 others killed in Arkansas shootings
","A gunman shot six people at a U.S. home, killing a man and a teenager and critically wounding two boys, before fatally shooting a worker at a nearby business, police said.
The suspected gunman was later found dead of a gunshot wound in the driver’s seat of a stopped car, Jonesboro police Sgt. Doug Formon said at a news conference. It was not immediately clear if the gunshot was self-inflicted.
Mr. Formon said a man and a 13-year-old girl were killed on Sunday afternoon inside the home in Arkansas, where it appeared a family was having a party or gathering.
Four other people were injured and were taken to hospitals. Mr. Formon said the children, aged 8 and 10, were transported in critical condition.
Police received a call about the shooting at the home and later responded to a report of a second shooting at a business, where Mr. Forman said the worker was found shot to death.
Mr. Formon said a farmer or passing motorist later called to report a car parked in the middle of a county road. A deputy responded and found the stopped car with the suspected gunman inside.
Mr. Forman said that police did not know of a motive and that the investigation is ongoing.
He declined to identify the victims or the suspect, saying officials wanted to be sure all family members had been notified. He said it was not known if the suspect and victims were related.

Committed to peace process, says Adams
","Released without charge from a >four-day period of custody and interrogation by the Police Service of Northern Ireland, Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president said that his party “remains wedded” to the Northern Ireland peace process, and the policing dispensation that is a part of it.
His assurances that the peace process would not be derailed by his arrest were made along with assertions of his innocence. “This is not 1981, it is not 1972. There can be no going back,” he told a press conference after his release from custody. “The IRA is gone, it’s finished.”
Mr. Adams has always maintained that while he was associated with the Irish Republican Army, he was never its member. “Let me be very clear,” he reportedly told the press conference. “I am innocent of any involvement in any conspiracy to abduct, kill or bury Mrs. McConville,” the woman whose murder in 1972 he is accused of having masterminded.
A suspected informer, the 37-year old mother-of-10 was dragged out of her flat by masked men of the IRA in front of her horrified children, taken across the border and shot dead. One of the 15 “disappeared” in the conflict, her body was discovered buried in a beach in 2003.

End to ‘Troubles’

The 65-year old republican leader’s arrest led to widespread concerns that the peace process — anchored by the Belfast Good Friday Agreement of 1998 — would be undermined. Mr. Adams was the chief architect of the agreement that brought to an end the “Troubles” – the 30-year bloody conflict over the constitutional status of Northern Ireland.
The Sinn Fein — the second largest party in the Northern Ireland Assembly — had warned that if their leader is charged with murder, it would withdraw support to the police, which is a key strut in the agreement.
Mr. Adams’ arrest came after several testimonies by Brenden Hughes and other former associates of Mr. Adams to researchers from Boston College who were documenting the 30-year conflict.
Mr. Adams, who was questioned on the allegations made in the Boston Tapes, has maintained that the testimonies were discredited as they were based on hearsay, and would not stand as evidence in court.
In Northern Ireland, the peace process is still finding its way. In Belfast, for example, walls still separate Catholic and Protestant areas; most schools remain segregated on religious lines; and symbols like flags, insignia, and route-marches are matters of deep contention.
In fact, political differences on how to resolve outstanding peace issues resulted in the Northern Ireland Executive drawing up the Haas Proposals in December 2013. Under these proposals, ex-paramilitaries and former British security service operatives would be given “limited immunity” from prosecution, provided both sides abide by the other terms of the agreement. The British Government has not signed up to the Haas Proposals.

Demand for retribution

If the towering figure who crafted the peace agreement, and who is perceived as a public guarantor of its success, is convicted of murder, it is bound to see the Good Friday Agreement unravel.
At the heart of the peace process lies the difficult task of addressing the legacy of hate and the demand for retributive justice from those who suffered the loss of loved ones in a conflict that took 3,600 lives.
In Northern Ireland, those working the peace process on a day-to-day basis know that the peace process must not involve itself with settling scores of the past as that would only reopen old and unforgiving wounds. The conviction of Mr. Adams would threaten to do just that.

South Korea diver dies in sunken ferry searches
","A civilian diver involved in searches for dozens of missing people from the South Korean ferry disaster died on Tuesday, as other divers helped by better weather and easing ocean currents were picking up efforts to retrieve more bodies from the sunken ship.
The Sewol carried 476 people, most of them students from a single high school near Seoul, when it sank off South Korea’s southern coast on April 16. Only 174 survived, including 22 of the 29 crew members. The sinking left more than 260 people dead, with about 40 others still missing.
On Tuesday, one civilian diver died at a hospital after becoming unconscious, government task force spokesman Ko Myung-seok said in a statement.
The 53-year-old diver was pulled to the surface by fellow divers after losing communication about five minutes after he began underwater searches, Mr. Ko said. It was his first search attempt, Mr. Ko added.
Investigators have also made their first arrests of people who were not on board the Sewol when it sank. The three people arrested are suspected of negligence in their handling of cargo on the vessel.
In all, 19 people have been arrested in the investigation, 15 of them crew members accused of abandoning passengers.

Suicide bomber kills at least 3 soldiers in northern Pakistan "," At least three soldiers were killed and seven wounded on Saturday in a suicide attack on an army base camp in northern Pakistan, officials said, in a region that was once controlled by a local faction of the Taliban.
Attacks have decreased sharply in the picturesque Swat Valley but can cause alarm in a region where Pakistani Taliban insurgents took partial control in 2007, before being ousted two years later in a major military operation hailed as an important blow against Islamist violence.
Swat was the first sizeable region outside Pakistans lawless tribal regions bordering Afghanistan to fall to the militants. More than 2,000 Taliban fighters have been driven out of the region, government officials say.
The Pakistan Army's public relations wing said in a statement that the “suicide attack” in the Swat Valley took place at the “army unit sports area"".
A security official who asked not to be identified said the suicide bomber blew himself up as soldiers were playing a volleyball match that was being watched by a number of local civilians.
He added that the casualty count could rise as a large number of people had gathered in the area.
The attack was claimed by the Tehreek-e-Taliban, also known as the Pakistani Taliban, in a statement sent to the media.
“God willing Tehreek-e-Taliban has started the process of revenge attacks,” Taliban spokesman Mohammad Khurasani said in the statement. “Wait for more [attacks] to follow.”
The military has been on alert for signs of a Taliban resurgence as it seeks to rebuild civilian institutions and win over the local population as a bulwark against radical ideology.
Since being chased out the region, the Taliban have carried out revenge attacks against anti-militancy activists and attempted to extort money from business owners in a region where Pakistan has stationed more than 4,000 soldiers.
Pakistan's Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi condemned the attack in a region that has also increasingly become an important part of the country's domestic tourism industry, with ski resorts popping up along the hills of the Swat Valley.
“No cowardly attack can deter us in pursuing our struggle against the menace of terrorism to its logical conclusion. We will continue our fight till the last trace is rooted out,” the prime minister said in a statement.

Bomb kills local al-Qaeda leader: Syrian activists
","A roadside bombing in Syria killed a local al-Qaeda leader and his wife, activists said on Tuesday, an attack that may ignite a new round of infighting between rebel groups in the war-torn country.
The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said Ali al-Nuaimi of the Nusra Front al-Qaeda’s affiliate in Syria and his wife were killed overnight while travelling in the southern Daraa province.
The bombing took place near the town of Busra al-Sham, according to the Observatory, which described the killing as an “assassination.”
The pro-rebel Sham News Network also reported the incident and its Daraa coordinator, Omar al-Hariri, said it wasn’t immediately clear who killed al-Nuaimi. The Nusra Front did not mention the attack on the social networks it typically uses.
The attack came after Nusra fighters seized a controversial Western-backed Syrian military commander, Ahmad al-Nuaimi last Friday. It is unclear if the two men are related the al-Nuaimi is a large tribe in the area. Also, it wasn’t immediately clear if the two incidents were connected.
The bombing and the abduction risk igniting rebel infighting in the south between more moderate Syrian opposition fighters and the hard-line Nusra Front.
The abducted commander, Ahmad al-Nuaimi, was widely disliked by many rebels who accused him of abandoning his men in battle in the past and fleeing to Jordan.
A radical organization calling itself the “Islamic Courts of the Eastern Areas Daraa” has confirmed it has Ahmad al-Nuaimi and another military commander, saying it would soon air their “confessions.”
Meanwhile, activists said that negotiations were underway to evacuate rebels from opposition-held parts of the embattled central city of Homs, which Syrian government forces have been besieging for over a year.
The activists said on Tuesday that Iranian and Russian representatives have been attending the meetings in Homs. They said they were there because they were negotiating a prisoner exchange as part of the Homs deal that would free at least three Iranians and a Russian who were seized by rebels in the northern province of Aleppo.
Russian and Iranian government officials were not immediately available for comment. The two countries are staunch allies of Syrian President Bashar Assad’s government.
Activists provided AP with a video showing an Iranian woman they claimed was being held captive by the rebels. The video was uploaded on March 8 this year, but it wasn’t clear when the Iranians and the Russian were seized.

Ukraine separatists to go ahead with referendum despite Putin call
","Two eastern Ukrainian provinces will go ahead with a referendum on seceding from the country as planned this weekend despite Russian President Vladimir Putin’s call for a delay, separatist leaders told Russia’s Interfax news agency on Thursday.
“The referendum on May 11 will take place,” said Miroslav Rudenko, a separatist leader of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic.
The secession referendum will let the 3 million residents of the provinces of Luhansk and Donetsk vote on whether they want to stay part of Ukraine. Ukrainians opposed to a split see it as a precursor to an eventual merger with Russia, as happened with Crimea in March.
Separatist leaders said they were merely following popular opinion.
“This is not our decision. This is the decision of the people of the region of Donbas,” Andriy Purgin, using a colloquial name for the region, told the Itar-Tass news agency.
Pro-Russian activists in the Luhansk region also confirmed plans to go ahead with the referendum, saying a citizen’s council had given the go-ahead.
The move comes amid worries that tensions could boil over into violence on Friday. May 9 is the day when Russia and Ukraine traditionally commemorate the defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II.
Some say this year’s festivities could degenerate into violence.
Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk attacked Russia in a statement, referring to the country’s attack against Ukraine in 1941, during World War II. He said Friday’s Victory Day celebrations would be the first since 1945 conducted “under war conditions.” “In light of this foreign aggression and terrorism, the Ukraine values more than ever the immortal heroes who defended peace 69 years ago,” he said, warning against provocations and sabotage on Friday.
The decision to proceed with the referendum drew reprisal from the European Union.
“Such unauthorised local referenda have no democratic legitimacy and can only lead to further escalation,” said Maja Kocijancic, a spokeswoman for E.U. foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton.
The decision to stay the course with the referendums came as Ukrainian officials said military efforts to clear separatist strongholds would continue.
And they both came after a brief window of opportunity seemed to open in which both sides said they could countenance talks to calm the situation, albeit under conditions that would have unlikely been acceptable to each side.
The separatists have been storming government buildings for weeks, prompting the government to send out anti-terrorism units. This has led to clashes and deaths. The government has said it is losing control of the region.
A spat also continued between Russia and the West about whether or not Russian troops massed on Ukraine’s border had been drawn down. U.S. and NATO forces insist that the troops remain in place, which prompted Russian officials to tweet overnight that anyone who couldn’t see the withdrawal had vision problems.
“I have very good vision, but, while we’ve noted Russia’s statement, so far we haven’t seen any — any — indication of troops pulling back,” said NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen.
“If we saw visible signs of a meaningful pullback by Russia troops I’d be the first one to welcome it.” Adding to the worries, Russian military forces on Thursday tested three multi-stage nuclear missiles on its own territory. Russia said the tests were long-planned and conducted under Mr. Putin’s supervision, along with tests of several cruise missiles.
Ms. Kocijancic, Ms. Ashton’s spokeswoman, said the E.U. does not believe claims by Mr. Putin that Russia had no influence on separatists in Ukraine.
“We have always maintained that these pro-Russian separatists have the Russian backing,” Ms. Kocijancic said, adding, “In this respect we... repeat our calls on Russia to exercise influence in that way.” Meanwhile, German Chancellor Angela Merkel also called upon Putin to focus on ways to de-escalate the situation.
“The onus lies upon President Putin to get the pro-Russian forces in the Ukraine to lay down their weapons and call for occupied buildings to be cleared,” she said in comments carried by the Rheinischen Post newspaper.
Work is also under way to extend an E.U. sanctions list, which could for the first time also include entities in Crimea, according to E.U. sources. The decision could be taken at a meeting of E.U. foreign ministers on Monday.
The bloc has so far placed travel bans and asset freezes on 48 individuals for their role in destabilizing Ukraine.
The European Union is now looking at changing its sanctions criteria, which have so far stipulated that entities can only be targeted if they are associated with individuals on the list, an E.U. source said.
This linkage would be lifted in the case of Crimea, she said.

Pistorius’s neighbour testifies at murder trial
","A man who lives next to the house where Oscar Pistorius fatally shot his girlfriend testified on Tuesday at the athlete’s murder trial about the night of the killing, saying he heard a man crying loudly and that he called the security of the housing estate for help.
Michael Nhlengethwa was a witness summoned by the Olympian’s defense team, which contends that Pistorius killed Reeva Steenkamp by mistake after believing there was an intruder in his home on Feb. 14, 2013. The prosecution says Pistorius intentionally killed Steenkamp after the couple had an argument.
The differently-abled Olympian runner shot four times through a toilet cubicle door with his 9 mm pistol, hitting Steenkamp in the hip, arm and head.
Security checks at the courthouse where Pistorius is on trial were disrupted on early Tuesday because of what police said was a protest over work conditions by security staff, who left their posts and gathered outside the building. Some people entered the courthouse without having their bags checked, and Pistorius was heard asking whether a security check had been conducted as he entered the courtroom.
Nhlengethwa, who was Pistorius’ next-door neighbour, testified that his wife woke him up after hearing a bang and that he did not hear gunshots. He said he then heard a man crying in a high-pitched voice that indicated he urgently needed help. Mr. Nhlengethwa could not make out most of what the man was saying, though he heard the words- “No, please, please, no.”
The neighbour’s bedroom window was around 25 meters (80 feet) from the balcony doors of Pistorius’ bedroom, closer than neighbours called by prosecutors and who said they heard a woman screaming on the night of the shooting.
The defense was trying to present Mr. Nhlengethwa as a more reliable witness on the events of the night because of how much closer he lived to Pistorius’ villa. A neighbour who testified to hearing a woman’s “blood-curdling” screams on the night lived around 170 meters (560 feet) from Pistorius’ house.
Mr. Nhlengethwa testified that he called estate security to ask them to come to their road.
During the testimony, Pistorius sat on a wooden bench in the courtroom, looking impassively at the witness.
Mr. Nhlengethwa, who said he runs a civil engineering company, earlier described how Pistorius was the first neighbour to welcome him to the gated community when he moved there in late 2009.
“He was basically that friendly neighbour,” Mr. Nhlengethwa said. He said he also met Steenkamp once on the weekend before she was killed by Pistorius, and was struck by the warmth of her personality.
“I don’t think I will ever forget that moment,” he said. “She just opened her arms. She just came and hugged me.”

Six injured in third China station knife attack
","A wave of organised knife attacks by groups of armed assailants targeting railway stations has unnerved Chinese authorities, with six people on Tuesday left injured in the latest violence, in the southern metropolis of Guangzhou – the third such attack in two months.
At least one man armed with “long knives”, witnesses said, indiscriminately stabbed passengers at the square in front of Guangzhou railway station at 11.30 a.m. local time on Tuesday morning. Photographs taken by witnesses showed pools of blood at the scene and crowds of shocked bystanders.
There were conflicting reports on how many people were involved in the attack. Initially, State media reports quoted one witness, named Chen, as saying he saw three men armed with knives involved in the rampage.
The Guangzhou public security bureau, or police authority, said in a later statement only one man was involved in the attack. After stabbing at least six people, he was shot by police and later taken to a hospital for treatment. The police authority said his identity was still being established.
Four bystanders, including two women, who were injured were being treated at a nearby military hospital and did not have any life-threatening injuries, officials said.
As of Tuesday evening, officials released few details about the attack. The incident was strikingly similar to last week’s violence targeting a railway station in Urumqi, the provincial capital of the western Muslim-majority Xinjiang region, and the March 1 attack by armed assailants on the railway station in Kunming, in southwestern Yunnan province. At least three people were killed in Urumqi while 29 died in Kunming.
The two earlier attacks, the government said, had been carried out by terrorists linked with separatist groups in Xinjiang, home to the ethnic Turkic Uighurs, which has seen a spate of violent attacks in recent years.
Xinjiang officials said one of the Urumqi attackers, a 39-year-old Uighur named Sedirdin Sawut, had “long been involved in religious extremism”.
The Kunming attack, carried out by at least 8 Uighurs, armed with knives and seemingly trained, had been organised by a group of Uighurs who had earlier sought to travel overseas “for jihad”, officials said.
The Urumqi attack was seen by Chinese security experts as reflecting a stepped up capability – and intent – by groups as it took place on a day when China’s President Xi Jinping was touring Urumqi, despite the tight security in the city. Mr. Xi last week pledged “decisive actions” against terrorist groups to “resolutely suppress their rampant momentum”.

Russia, West wrangle over talks format
","Russia and European nations on Tuesday wrangled over the format of Ukrainian peace talks even as Kiev pressed on with armed suppression of anti-government protesters in eastern Ukraine.
The crisis in Ukraine dominated a Council of Europe meeting in Vienna that demonstrated a shift in the stand of Europeans in favour of halting escalating bloodshed in Ukrainian south-eastern regions.
German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier warned that Ukraine was close to war following deadly clashes in Odessa last week in which dozens died.
“The bloody pictures from Odessa have shown us that we are just a few steps away from a military confrontation,” Mr. Steinmeier said in interviews published on Tuesday simultaneously in Europe’s four leading papers.
Germany’s view of the situation in Ukraine was in sharp contrast with the stand taken by the United States, which has strongly supported Kiev’s military crackdown on the protests in the southeast.
“I’m convinced we are struggling against a situation that has taken on a dynamic of its own. There are groups in eastern Ukraine that are not listening to either Kiev ... or Moscow,” the German Foreign Minister said.
Mr. Steinmeier proposed holding another round of four-way Geneva talks between Russia, the U.S., the European Union and Ukraine, who first met in April.
However, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said that any new round of talks in Geneva should include representatives of protesters telling reporters that otherwise the talks “would go round in circles.”
The main task today is to “bring all sides to the negotiating table,” Mr. Lavrov said.
The Russian and German Foreign Ministers met for one-to-one talks later on Tuesday in Vienna.
The Ukrainian Parliament on Tuesday turned down a proposal to hold a referendum on decentralisation of power to the regions. Instead, Kiev plans to conduct a non-binding “survey” on this issue, to coincide with presidential elections scheduled for May 25.
The crisis in Ukraine has sharply escalated in recent days. Interior Minister Arsen Avakov said on Tuesday that four soldiers and about 30 rebels had been killed in fierce fighting near Sloviansk on Monday.
Self-defence forces in Sloviansk confirmed suffering heavy losses. Rebel intelligence reported a large column of Ukrainian tanks and other armoured vehicles moving towards Sloviansk on Tuesday.
Several opposition politicians accused Ukrainian authorities of concealing the true figure of casualties in Friday’s violence in Odessa.
According to official reports, 46 people died in clashes, but Oleg Tsaryov, a presidential candidate, said “no less than 100, and probably far more” had died.

Militants threaten to sell abducted girls
","Nigeria’s Islamic extremist leader threatened in a videotaped statement seen on Monday to sell the more than 200 teenage girls abducted from a school in the remote northeast of the country three weeks ago.

Hour-long video

Abubakar Shekau for the first time also claimed responsibility for the April 15 mass abduction, in a video reviewed by The Associated Press. “I abducted your girls,” said the leader of Boko Haram, which means “Western education is sinful.”
“By Allah, I will sell them in the marketplace,” he said in the hour-long video that starts with fighters lofting automatic rifles and shooting in the air as they chant “Allahu akbar!” or “God is great.”
It was unclear if the video was made before or after unverified reports emerged last week that some of the girls have been forced to marry their abductors and that others were carried into neighbouring Cameroon and Chad.
An intermediary who has said Boko Haram is ready to negotiate ransoms for the girls also said two of the girls have died of snakebite and about 20 are ill. He said Christians among the girls have been forced to convert to Islam.
Nigeria’s police have said more than 300 girls were abducted. Of that number, 276 remain in captivity.
The mass abduction and the military’s failure to rescue the girls and young women have caused outrage with protests in major cities. Protesters accused President Goodluck Jonathan of being insensitive to the girls’ plight.
First lady Patience Jonathan fuelled anger on Monday when a leader of a protest march said she ordered the arrests of two protest leaders, expressed doubts there was any kidnapping and accused the protest leaders of belonging to Boko Haram.
It was unclear what authority Mrs. Jonathan would have to give such orders, since there is no office of first lady in the Nigerian Constitution. The first lady’s office denied there were any arrests.

Vehicle ploughs into pedestrians in Shanghai, injuring 18 "," Eighteen people were injured on Friday, three seriously, after a vehicle caught fire and mounted the pavement in a busy part of central Shanghai and ploughed into pedestrians, said police.
According to preliminary investigations, the fire was caused by a 40-year-old driver surnamed Chen who was smoking a cigarette inside the vehicle, the Shanghai public security bureau said on its official Weibo feed. Mr. Chen, who is currently receiving treatment, is suspected of illegally transporting dangerous substances, police said.
The Shanghai government said in a short statement the vehicle hit the pedestrians on a road running next to People's Square, injuring 18 people, three of them seriously.
Shanghai-based news portal The Paper said the vehicle was a minivan, and cited eyewitnesses as saying it was on fire as it drove onto the pavement, knocked people down and came to a stop in front of a Starbucks outlet.
A Shanghai-based Starbucks spokesman told Reuters the store was not damaged and its customers and employees were safe. “The store is currently closed and we will assist the authorities in their investigations,” he said.
The incident coincides with a visit to the city by British Prime Minister Theresa May.
Some bystanders tried to break the window of the vehicle and drag out the six people in the vehicle, including the driver, The Paper reported in a story later reposted by the official People's Daily newspaper.
Other witnesses told the news outlet that there were gas cylinders in the vehicle.
Footage on Chinese social media, which Reuters could not independently verify, showed smoke coming out from the vehicle and people lying flat on the ground injured in the street.

Pakistan for resolving Kashmir issue through dialogue: Sharif
","Prime Minister Muhammad Nawaz Sharif on Tuesday said that Pakistan was committed to reaching out to India and seeking a peaceful resolution of all outstanding disputes, including Kashmir, through a sustained dialogue.
“Pakistan desires peace and tranquillity in the Middle East and it would maintain its policy of non- interference in the internal affairs of States,” Mr. Sharif said at a meeting of Pakistan envoys to West Asian countries. He said the central emphasis had been on building a “peaceful neighbourhood,” and he had pursued a policy of constructive engagement with all neighbours.
“We are also paying attention to the promotion of our special relationships with countries in the Gulf and Middle East. Recent exchanges at the highest level reflect these endeavours,” he said, according to an official statement.
“We have an equal aspiration to forge closer bilateral ties with all countries in the region. Our efforts to develop bilateral ties with one country are not and will not be at the expense of another. Pakistan remains ready to take two steps to greet a hand extended in friendship,” he pointed out. The main dynamic in South Asia should be cooperation, not confrontation, he said.
He outlined a policy of non-interference in Afghanistan, and support for the peace and reconciliation process in that country. The bilateral relationship, he said, should be marked by enhanced trade and economic cooperation. Since June 2013, Pakistan had reinforced its strategic partnership with China, re-oriented the relationship with the U.S., upgraded ties with the European Union, reached out afresh to Russia, and strengthened linkages with the ASEAN, Africa and Latin America, he said.
In this age of globalisation and growing inter-dependence, Mr. Sharif said foreign policy had also virtually become economic policy. “My emphasis on economic diplomacy stems from this belief,” he added.

Former British bank boss pleads guilty to drug possession
","Paul Flowers, the former boss of Britain’s Co-operative Bank, on Wednesday pleaded guilty to possession of drugs.
The 63-year-old was fined £400 ($679) and ordered to pay £125 in costs by the court in Leeds in northern England for possessing cocaine, methamphetamines and ketamine.
Flowers was forced to step down as head of the Co-op Bank in June 2013 after it lost £700 million in the first half of 2013 and a £1.5-billion hole was uncovered in its balance sheet.
He also resigned as deputy chairman of the Co-operative Group, to which the bank belongs. The group prides itself on its ethical values and is one of the largest businesses of its kind in the world.
As Flowers arrived to enter his plea, he called the crowd of waiting photographers and reporters “vultures” and said, “Don’t ask me any questions because I won’t give any answers.” He was first arrested over the drugs charges in November when allegations were published in a national newspaper.
In a video published on the newspaper’s website, Flowers could be seen in his car counting out 300 pounds and giving it to a friend to buy cocaine and crystal meth.
The paper also said he had sent a text to a friend in which he had boasted of “snorting some good stuff” on the day he was to appear before a parliamentary committee examining his performance at the bank. In the end, he was not called until a week later.
After the allegations were published, Flowers was suspended by the Methodist Church, for which he was a minister and which led him to be dubbed the Crystal Methodist. His membership in the Labour party was also suspended.
It emerged as well that he had quit in 2011 as a Labour councillor in the city of Bradford after pornography was found on his computer and that he stepped down as chairman of a drugs charity after allegations were made about his expenses.

U.S. wants Pakistan to act against terrorist sanctuaries
"," The U.S. has made it clear that it expects Islamabad to take action against terrorists in sanctuaries inside Pakistan, a top American diplomat has said.
 Deputy Secretary of State John J Sullivan, who recently returned from a visit to Afghanistan, said the U.S. also expects Pakistan to contribute to a lasting and enduring peace in the region.
 “That was certainly part of my conversations with the Afghan leadership,” Mr. Sullivan said in a briefing with reporters on his return.
 “We have made clear to the Pakistani government our expectations for them to take action against terrorists that are in sanctuaries in Pakistan, to reduce the pressure and the threat of violence in Afghanistan,” he said.
 The trip to Afghanistan, Mr. Sullivan said, was an important opportunity for him to reaffirm the U.S.’ commitment to strengthening its partnership with the country.
 He met with Afghan President Ashraf Ghani; Chief Executive, Dr. Abdullah Abdullah; Foreign Minister Salahuddin Rabbani and other government leaders during the visit.
 “During each of these meetings, Afghanistan’s leadership made it clear to me that despite the recent tragic events, the Afghan government will continue to work to create the necessary conditions to bring the Taliban to the negotiating table, and establish an environment for a sustained peace,” Mr. Sullivan said.
 “We applaud this conviction, as the path to peace and reconciliation must be an Afghan-led and Afghan-owned process, as we have laid out in the President’s South Asian strategy,” he said.
 Mr. Sullivan rued that despite everyone wanting peace at this stage, the Taliban still seemed unwilling to come to the negotiating table.
 “The Taliban’s reprehensible attacks targeting innocent civilians demonstrate that they are not ready to enter into good faith peace negotiations,” Mr. Sullivan said.
 “The U.S. will continue to support its Afghan partners to defeat the ISIS, Al-Qaeda, and other terrorist groups in Afghanistan, and deny them and their affiliates safe haven and material support,” he said.
 Mr. Sullivan said he discussed security cooperation, and the importance of holding timely, credible and inclusive parliamentary and presidential elections with the Afghan leaders.
 “During an executive committee meeting of the Afghanistan compact, we reviewed Afghanistan’s progress in the areas of security, governance, rule of law, economic development and peace and reconciliation,” he said.
 Responding to a question, Mr. Sullivan said President Donald Trump’s recent comments ruling out talks with the Taliban is a reflection of the ground realities.
 “Our policy is to continue to put pressure on the Taliban to bring them, eventually, with patience and perseverance, to peace talks that are Afghan-led and Afghan-owned,” he said.

Experts to re-examine all gathered data on MH370
","An international panel of experts will re-examine all data gathered in the nearly two-month hunt for the missing Malaysia jet to ensure search crews who have been scouring a desolate patch of ocean for the plane have been looking in the right place, officials said on Monday.
Senior officials from Malaysia, Australia and China met in Canberra to hash out the details of the next steps in the search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, which will centre around an expanded patch of seafloor in a remote area of the Indian Ocean off Western Australia. The area became the focus of the hunt after a team of analysts calculated the plane’s likeliest flight path based on satellite and radar data.
Starting Wednesday, that data will be re-analysed and combined with all information gathered thus far in the search, which hasn’t turned up a single piece of debris despite crews scouring more than 4.6 million square kilometres of ocean.
“We’ve got to this stage of the process where it’s very sensible to go back and have a look at all of the data that has been gathered, all of the analysis that has been done and make sure there’s no flaws in it, the assumptions are right, the analysis is right and the deductions and conclusions are right,” Angus Houston, head of the search operation, told reporters in Canberra.
Investigators have been stymied by a lack of hard data since the plane vanished on March 8 during a flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. A weeks-long search for surface debris was called off last week after officials determined any wreckage that may have been floating has likely sunk.
“Unfortunately, all of that effort has found nothing,” Australian Transport Minister Warren Truss said. “We’ve been confident on the basis of the information provided that the search area was the right one, but in practice, that confidence has not been converted into us discovering any trace of the aircraft.”

For a clear nuclear doctrine
","For India, nuclear deterrence is defensive and a means to secure its sovereignty and security. Its strategy of assured retaliation, combined with “no first use,” provides adequate guarantee for this purpose. The strategy was unveiled concurrently with its 1998 nuclear tests, which ended the determined U.S. bid to prevent India from acquiring nuclear deterrent. Ironically, India’s nuclear weapons tests, together with the rapid expansion of its economy, transformed its global outlook and relations with the U.S. and the world.
The Chinese nuclear weapons test of 1964, on the heels of the 1962 war, had always rankled in Indian minds. K. Subrahmanyam and K.R. Narayanan, at the time in the early years of their public service, advocated a matching Indian response. This did not then have resonance at the top, as India was facing the twin crises of food and finance.
The P-5 states treated non-proliferation as their default foreign and security policy objective, but this was invariably trumped by national interest. India’s restraint and decision not to weaponise its nuclear capacities after the 1974 test were well known. Yet, when Pakistan accelerated its nuclear proliferation, it was not stopped in the wake of the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan, when U.S. President Jimmy Carter designated Pakistan a “frontline” state.
The Chinese transferred nuclear materials and technology to Pakistan, including the weapons design and the means to deliver them — the solid fuel 300-kilometre range M-11 ballistic missiles. In a paper published in 1972, Professor Wayne Wilcox of Colombia University, then working as cultural attaché in the U.S. Embassy in London, perceptively recognised that India’s policy concerning China and Pakistan “is to hedge all bets and cover all contingencies.” India was compelled to acquire nuclear weapons to deter nuclear blackmail in its contiguity.
Unlike Pakistan or Israel, India could not have a “recessed” deterrent or bomb in the basement, given India’s governance practices. Contingent factors delayed India’s nuclear weapons tests, such as the persistent external pressure on India, and arguments by internal agnostics who claimed that such testing would betray India’s long-held principles, diminish its international standing, and reduce future GDP growth rates by up to two per cent annually. In 1995 came the perpetual extension of the Non-Proliferation Treaty, without linking it to the complete elimination of nuclear weapons. The conditions attached to the 1996 Comprehensive Test-Ban Treaty, which could foreclose India’s nuclear weapons option, became the final point of conviction. From then on, the question was not whether to test but when.
For India today, the choice is clear, as it was in 1998: so long as nuclear weapons exist, India’s nuclear deterrence will have to be maintained. Until there is a global compact for creating a nuclear weapon-free world, India will have to persevere with this policy.

What is credible deterrence?

In delivering the message of credible deterrence, all nuclear weapons states, including those that have embraced no first use, face a conundrum. Nuclear weapons are weapons of the last resort, fundamentally different from conventional weapons. War is a traditional tool of statecraft, but the weapon to end all wars cannot be a standard instrument of an ordinary war — it can only be the final recourse for dissuasion. It cannot be chance, for then it will fail to deter. While embracing a declaratory policy to avoid nuclear war, the state concerned must simultaneously demonstrate that it has nuclear war fighting capacity — the resilience to take the pain of a first strike, and both the ability and resolve to inflict massive and intolerable destruction on the attacker.
For improving its punitive capacity, China is seeking a sea-based nuclear deterrent, deploying mobile solid-fuel missiles, and moving missiles below the surface in elaborate tunnels in mountainous terrain, undetectable from space, called the “Underground Great Wall.” The same motivation has led India to similar pursuits. India’s missile force, the weak link in its deterrence, is under rapid repair. Its transformation is enabling the shift toward strategic deterrence. In the past half-dozen years, India has invested in improving the command, control, communications, and intelligence systems and its second strike capacity, including the survival of the decision-making structure. The National Command Authority deserves credit for this. Simultaneously, the sea-based leg of the triad of delivery systems is taking shape — even if at a slower pace than the situation warrants. India might also have to do more to communicate effectively that its deterrent carries credibility.
In popular domestic imagination, India’s assurance of “credible minimum deterrence” is confused with minimum credible deterrence, as if it connotes an arbitrary limitation. The essential prerequisite for nuclear deterrence is as much the sufficiency of the retaliatory capacity as the surety of response. This hinges on the size and nature of the arsenal and delivery systems, their survivability in the event of a pre-emptive attack, and the realisation by a potential adversary that the costs of attack outweigh the gains.
All nuclear weapons states that have robust missile programmes retain their first strike capabilities, since conventional missiles of short and intermediate ranges can be mated equally with nuclear or non-nuclear warheads, and can be used to attack nuclear facilities. At times doubts arise about the “responsible” behaviour of certain states, such as when Chinese President Xi Jinping did not mention China’s no first use doctrine in a defence policy speech delivered in December 2012 to the Second Artillery Corps, or when the Chinese Defence White Paper, released in April 2013, did not contain the standard reiteration of this doctrine, thereby creating doubts about a shift in its nuclear policy.
While India remains watchful, most P-5 states appear to be settling into a more stable deterrence, discounting first strike weapons, despite holding a range of nuclear weaponry and delivery mechanisms. Under the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, the U.S. and USSR had agreed to eliminate their intermediate and shorter range missiles between 500 and 5,500 kilometres. Pakistan alone is going in the other direction.

Myth of flexible response

The U.S. and Russia did contemplate flexible response and limited use of nuclear weapons in specific theatres in the hope of containing damage to their homelands. A graduating use of nuclear weapons is not possible, except in theory books and planning exercises. Envisaging escalatory nuclear weapons exchanges is even more difficult in India’s security context: here, the space and time span between launch and delivery is non-existent. “Controlled” nuclear war between the U.S. and Russia is hard to imagine. Between India and China, or between India and Pakistan, it is impossible.
Admittedly, nuclear weapons can be used for coercion, but up to a point, and with some success only against a non-nuclear state. The experience of Kargil 15 years ago demonstrated how the leaders of the Pakistan Army took the wrong lesson from deterrence. They believed that with the advantage of stealth and shock, they could upset the conventional status-quo, without inviting an effective riposte for fear of a nuclear exchange. This was a serious miscalculation, as they discovered to their cost. Changing India’s defensive nuclear doctrine to complicate their calculus will be irresponsible. India can survive a first strike but Pakistan cannot. What incentive would Pakistan have to consider a second strike if it believed India could attack it first? As for the growing non-nuclear threats to security, India can meet them by augmented conventional preparedness, hardened defences, upgraded equipment and a strong indigenous armament industry.

Toward a more secure India

The foremost threat to Indian security today comes not from its nuclear posture or externally, but from social deprivation and anaemic economic growth. Unshackling its entrepreneurship, accelerating infrastructure development and regenerating growth will make India safer. There is a clear vision in India on what has to be done. The new government should focus on how best and quickly to do it.
As Shyam Saran, Chairman of the National Security Advisory Board, has said, it would be best to put to rest any further speculation of a change in India’s nuclear weapons policy. For a credible deterrent, constancy of doctrine in its core essentials has definite merit. The Bharatiya Janata Party has embraced the national inheritance on no first use. India’s nuclear deterrent can be made more robust, meanwhile, by continuing the work to guarantee the efficacy of its retaliatory strike.

China wants to tap India’s expertise in services sector
","Even as India is on the threshold of electing a new government, neighbouring China sees a huge potential for cooperation between the two countries, especially in economic development, according to Cheng Guang Zhong, minister-counsellor of the Chinese Embassy in Delhi.
Mr. Cheng, heading a four-member delegation on a visit to Chennai from May 2 to 4, said China could gain a lot from India’s expertise in the services sector.
“China is much developed in industrial area and is actually facing the problem of overindustrialisation. India is better in the service area. So it is time for China to learn from Indian experience in the services sector and it can provide its experience to India’s industrial development,” he told The Hindu.
He said the Chinese Ambassador would visit Chennai by month-end and one of the purposes was to identify the place for setting up a Chinese Industrial Park, planned when Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Chinese Premier Li Keqiang exchanged visits last year.
“The Ambassador had already visited Madhya Pradesh, Bihar and a few other States but the place had not been finalised. The specifications of the model of the Park were also not clear” he said.
Mr. Cheng also revealed plans to launch a joint venture project for production of power equipment as there was only one state-owned company in India.
“I was told there is a power crisis” and that bookings made for equipment would have to wait till 2030. “The joint venture project would facilitate manufacture in India itself,” he said, adding it was better than buying equipment directly from China.
Expressing confidence that both India and China had great future in economic cooperation, he said the benefit of cooperation was good not only for revitalisation of the two ancient civilisations in the 21st century but also for the Asian continent as a whole.
“As long as China and India, the two ancient civilisations, can cooperate and join hands, it is good for world peace, development and prosperity,” he stressed.
While India and China were holding talks for cooperation in the Information Technology and Health sectors, the two countries could have broad cooperation in agriculture also, he said..
“We also see a huge potential in the field of infrastructure development and construction, especially in the area of railway, port and road development,” he said.
Asked how China could help India in the agricultural sector, he said China’s agricultural revolution had solved the problem of feeding a 1.3-billion population. The two countries could have cooperation on seeds and high production.
“China is on the way to modernisation of agriculture. Through modernisation we are definitely solving the problems of urbanisation and also creating jobs for farmers,” he said.

Maldives’ delay in freeing opposition leaders fuels concern
"," As domestic and international pressure mounts, the Maldives has delayed complying with a Supreme Court order for the immediate release and new trials of nine opposition leaders, freeing them to contest presidential elections this year.
The Indian Ocean nation has been mired in political unrest since Mohamed Nasheed, its first democratically elected leader, was ousted in 2012. He has been in exile on medical grounds from a 13-year jail sentence on terrorism charges.
The Supreme Court on Thursday said the trials of Nasheed and eight others, many of whom had challenged President Abdulla Yameen, had violated the constitution and international law. It found that prosecutors and judges were unduly influenced “to conduct politically motivated investigations” against them.
On Friday, Attorney General Mohamed Anil said he had held discussions with Chief Justice Abdulla Saeed over the administrations concerns about releasing individuals whose offences ranged from terrorism to corruption and treason.
“The prosecutor general is currently in the process of examining the cases to determine the best way to proceed with the implementation of the Supreme Courts ruling, and the prosecutor general will present recommendations at the earliest,” the government said in a statement.
The unexpected ruling frees opposition leaders to run against Yameen in the presidential poll expected to be completed by October. The terrorism convictions would normally bar them from competing unless they received presidential pardons after completing a third of their jail terms.
The joint opposition of the Maldives expressed concern over Yameen’s refusal to abide by the order. “We are deeply fearful that the governments refusal to implement the Supreme Court order could escalate to unrest and incite violence across the country,” it said in a statement.
Hundreds of opposition supporters chanted slogans such as “Enforce the Supreme Court ruling,” and “Defend the constitution,” in a Friday night rally outside the opposition MDP campaign center in Male, the capital.
The United Nations, the United States, the European Union and India also urged Yameen’s government to follow the ruling.
In a statement, the office of U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said, “The Secretary-General reiterates his belief in finding a solution to the political stalemate in the Maldives through all-party talks, which the United Nations continues to stand ready to facilitate.”
“We understand the situation is extremely tense,” Rupert Colville, a spokesman for the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights told reporters on Friday. The agency was “closely watching how the situation develops in the aftermath of Thursday’s decisions by the Supreme Court, and in particular, the reactions of the government, military and police,” he added.
The European Union urged the government to hold “inclusive dialogue with the leaders of all political parties that should pave the way for credible, transparent and inclusive elections”.
Nasheed, who has been in exile in Britain, had sought U.N. help to restore the political rights of which he was stripped after a trial denounced as hasty and unfair by the United Nations human rights chief.
Thursday’s decision also nullified a ruling in which 12 lawmakers lost their parliamentary seats for defecting last July from Yameen’s ruling party, costing him his majority in the 85-member legislature.

ASEAN summit: Myanmar boosts security
","The Myanmar police will deploy 11,000 personnel for the security of ASEAN leaders attending the 24th ASEAN Summit to be held in capital Nay Pyi Taw this weekend, media reported on Tuesday.
This will be the first time for Myanmar to take such security measures by mobilising the highest number of police personnel for the most number of world leaders attending a regional summit in Myanmar, Xinhua cited local 7-Day News as quoting senior police official Soe Myaing.
Police forces from Nay Pyi Taw, Yangon and Mandalay regions have been mobilised to stand by for security duties.
Reports said Myanmar has tightened security at Yangon International Airport in cooperation with Interpol a week ahead of hosting the regional summit.
The Interpol team deployed at the airport comprises officers from South Korea, Canada and Slovenia.
They will help Myanmar airport immigration authorities to look for suspects as part of counter-terrorism activities.
The 24th ASEAN Summit is slated for May 10-11 at the Myanmar International Convention Centre in Nay Pyi Taw.
Myanmar is taking the rotating chair of ASEAN this year for the first time after joining the grouping in July 1997.

What if English loses dominance?
","Being an English-speaking country is a blessing — and a curse. It is a blessing to be native speakers of the language of Shakespeare — and the language of world science and popular culture. The success of UK science is built not just on its excellence but also its English, which since the decline of the Soviet Union has been the only serious global scientific language. The success of UK universities in recruiting international students also owes a great deal to the language.
But it is also a curse. As the incentives to learn other languages decline year by year, the English-speaking countries are increasingly locked into an Anglophone prison. It may be an advantage to travel almost everywhere and be “understood”. But maybe the ability to understand other cultures is declining. The Chinese speak English; not many British speak Mandarin. Maybe there is a wider lesson here: monolingualism inhibits multicultural sensitivity.
This inhibition is expressed in a number of ways. Within the university, the humanities, where such sensitivity is crucial, are hardest hit. STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) subjects may be able to flourish as a monoglot domain (because their language is as much mathematics as English). But that can never be the case with literature, philosophy, history — and even some of the less theoretical social sciences — without a narrowing of perspectives.
In wider society, it is at least possible that the lack of challenge to neo-liberal ideas can be attributed partly to monolingualism. Alternative ideas can only become influential when they are translated into English. Secondly, we are not really talking about English but “Globlish”, a communication tool stripped of most of its cultural resonances. Non-native English speakers can easily become fluent in Globlish. Maybe they can even speak it better because most are not inhibited by faint memories of the King James Bible or Hamlet. For them Globlish is largely a functional language.
The way forward is not just to promote other languages; we also need to learn to celebrate wider cultural differences. — © Guardian Newspapers Limited, 2014

6-party nuclear talks with Iran were ‘useful’
","The European Union (EU) says nuclear experts from Iran and six world powers had “a useful meeting” in New York ahead of high-level political talks next week aimed at reaching an agreement to limit Iran’s ability to produce nuclear weapons.
An EU spokesperson said on Wednesday night that the talks aimed at “further deepening” knowledge on the issues and contributed to preparations for next week’s high-level negotiations on a comprehensive agreement in Vienna.
Iran’s U.N. Mission said the two-day experts meeting ended on Wednesday. Hamid Baeidinejad, the Foreign Ministry’s director for political and international security affairs who led the Iranian delegation, did not comment on the talks.
Russia, the U.N. nuclear agency and outside experts tracking negotiations agree that the Iranians are cooperating and appear to want an agreement that ends crippling sanctions.

Trump accuses Justice Department, FBI of pro-Democrat bias
"," U.S. President Donald Trump publicly attacked the FBI’s leadership on February 2, accusing them of politicising their investigations in favour of Democrats as he gets set to approve the release of an explosive memo alleging the agency’s abuse of power.
The extraordinary accusation is the latest salvo in the President’s open conflict with the top U.S. law enforcement agency amid an investigation into possible Trump campaign collusion with a Russian effort to sway the 2016 presidential elections.
Mr. Trump is expected to give a green light for the the publication of a Republican-drafted memo accusing the agency of abuses in obtaining a warrant to monitor a member of Mr. Trump’s campaign team over his contacts with Russian officials. 
“The top Leadership and Investigators of the FBI and the Justice Department have politicized the sacred investigative process in favour of Democrats and against Republicans,” Mr. Trump tweeted. He called the alleged bias “something which would have been unthinkable just a short time ago. Rank & File are great people!”
Mr. Trump nominated both Attorney-General Jeff Sessions and FBI director Christopher Wray as leaders of their respective departments. The Republican President hand-picked the latter to replace James Comey, whom he abruptly sacked in May 2017.
Now just six months into his tenure, the 50-year-old Mr. Wray — who has made clear he does not support releasing the memo — finds himself on a collision course with the President.
The four-page memo was written by Republican lawmaker Devin Nunes, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, and purports to show the Justice Department and the FBI as deeply politicised, anti-Trump agencies.
Its release would amount to an outright rejection of the FBI’s extraordinary warning on January 30 that it had “grave concerns about material omissions of fact that fundamentally impact the memo’s accuracy”.
Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House intelligence committee, reacted swiftly to the President’s tweet: “The country’s top elected leader has agreed to selectively and misleadingly release classified info to attack the FBI — that’s what would’ve been unthinkable a short time ago.”
Democrats and critics in the intelligence community say the release is a stunt aimed at casting doubt on the independence of the FBI and Justice Department, using very selective information that cannot be countered publicly without revealing more secrets about government counter-intelligence operations.
They hold that the ultimate goal of the memo, with Mr. Trump’s support, is to undermine special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into possible Trump campaign collusion with Russia and possible obstruction of justice.
Speaking to CBS on February 2 morning, Mr. Schiff said the President’s early morning missive made plain that the memo’s release was “designed to impugn the credibility of the FBI — to undermine the investigation; to give the President additional fodder to attack the investigation”. “It’s a tremendous disservice to the American people, who are going to be misled by this — by the selective use of classified information.”
Based on highly classified documents dealing with Russian espionage, Mr. Nunes’ memo is his summary of what lay behind the FBI obtaining a so-called FISA national security warrant in 2016 to monitor Trump campaign official Carter Page, who had many Russian contacts.
Mr. Nunes alleges that the basis of the warrant application was the “Russia dossier”, information on contacts between the Trump campaign and Moscow compiled by former British intelligence agent Christopher Steele.
The dossier remains contentious and unproven, and was financed in part by Democrat Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign — a fact that Mr. Nunes says shows the FBI and Justice Department’s anti-Trump bias and abuse of power.
Paul Ryan, the Republican Speaker of the House of Representatives, defended the memo on February 1 as an attempt to protect American civil liberties. “This memo is not an indictment of the FBI or the Department of Justice,” Mr. Ryan said.
“What it is, is the Congress’s legitimate function of oversight to make sure that the FISA process is being used correctly,” he said, adding “this does not implicate the Mueller investigation.”
Other Republicans, including Representative Jeff Duncan, seemed less reticent to cast it all in a political light.
“Having read ‘The Memo,’ the FBI is right to have ‘grave concerns’ — as it will shake the organization down to its core — showing Americans just how the agency was weaponised by the Obama officials/DNC/HRC to target political adversaries,” Mr. Duncan tweeted.

Former BBC presenter admits to sexual assault on minor girl
","Stuart Hall, a popular and long-serving BBC commentator, admitted on Tuesday to the charge of indecently assaulting a girl under the age of 16, but denied 20 other charges of sexual assault.
He is to go on trial for the alleged offence of 15 rapes and five indecent assaults against two minor girls between the years 1976 and 1981.
Mr. Hall is one of several high profile media personalities whose sexual transgressions have recently come to light under the Jimmy Savile effect. Mr. Savile, a radio and television presenter, and celebrated BBC media personality, was discovered after his death to have been a predatory sex offender who raped and otherwise sexually abused hundreds of children during his media career.
Mr. Hall, now 84, was first arrested in 2012 on charges of multiple sexual offences.
Just one week ago, celebrity publicist Max Richards, 71, was sentenced to eight years’ imprisonment for a string of sexual offences against young girls and women whom he had groomed during his professional career.
Mr. Richards’ was the first conviction under Operation Yewtree, the investigation set up in October 2012 by the Metropolitan police into sexual abuse allegations, especially against children, in the wake of the Savile scandal. The case against Mr. Hall however falls outside the Operation Yewtree investigation.
Last month Dave Lee Travis, 68, a former Radio 1 DJ was charged by the police under Operation Yewtree on one count of indecent assault on a young woman. Mr. Travis had been earlier cleared of 12 counts of indecent assault.
In all these cases, the accused used their position as powerful media icons to terrorise their victims into acquiescence. Many of the alleged crimes took place as long ago as in the 1970s.
It is due to the enabling environment for disclosure that the police have created after the Savile scandal, that victims are coming forward to speak out.
More skeletons are expected to tumble out of the cupboard in the course of the Yewtree investigation.
Some on whom suspicion had fallen have subsequently been cleared, like comedian Freddie Starr, 71, who was arrested in 2012 and released on bail. He was recently let off by the Crown Persecution Service that cited insufficient evidence.

11 EU nations set to tax financial transactions
","A group of 11 European Union countries agreed to introduce a financial transaction tax from 2016 onward, Austrian Finance Minister Michael Spindelegger said on Tuesday.
The nations including economic heavyweights Germany, France, Italy and Spain will initially tax only the trading of shares and some derivatives, Mr. Spindelegger told a meeting of the EU’s 28 finance ministers in Brussels.
European officials started pushing for the tax following the 2008-09 financial crisis, to curb speculation and claw back revenues after government bailouts of banks, but failed to muster the required unanimity for an EU-wide solution.
Britain, which is home to the bloc’s biggest financial hub, the City of London, is strongly opposed to the plan, saying it’s a populist measure that will harm the economy and undermine banks’ global competitiveness.
“It’s not a tax on bankers, it’s a tax on job, on investment, on people’s pensions. That’s why the United Kingdom does not want to be a part of it,” U.K. treasury Chief George Osborne said.
Mr. Spindelegger, who played a leading role in the tax negotiations, said the group of 11 will now work to overcome remaining practical hurdles to finalize the legislation by the end of this year.
The levy’s scope won’t be as broad as supporters initially hoped, but the countries hope to reach agreement on a wider scope later on.
The EU estimates a broad levy encompassing trading in most assets could yield 30 billion Euros ($42 billion) in annual tax revenues.
German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble acknowledged it was “a very difficult matter to get a common position” on the tax, but said the current limited proposal is a good starting point to get the financial sector to contribute.
“To tell people that we are not able to find a way, is not a way to deliver,” Mr. Schaeuble insisted.
Britain’s Mr. Osborne, meanwhile, denounced the lack of detail of the current tax proposal and threatened Britain would challenge any financial transaction tax if it were to affect also EU economies not participating.
“If they seek to damage jobs and investment across the rest of Europe, then we are entitled to challenge that,” he insisted.
Spain’s Finance Minister Luis de Guindos sought to reassure the countries not participating, saying the group of 11 is “fully aware of the potential consequences” on lending conditions and the wider economy and will carefully draft its legislation.
The EU’s top court last week dismissed a British challenge to the introduction of the tax as premature since the tax has yet to be established. Britain argued it is illegal under EU law since it would affect even countries who don’t sign up to it.

Chinese national kidnapped in Malaysia
","A Chinese national working at a fish farm in eastern Malaysia was kidnapped by gunmen early Tuesday and believed taken to the southern Philippines, where suspected insurgents are holding another Chinese and a Filipino also seized from Malaysia.
Mohamad Bakri Zinin, Malaysia’s national deputy police chief, said five men clad in military fatigues entered the fish farm before dawn and kidnapped its manager, Yang Zailin, 34.
“However, they managed to escape and were headed to a neighbouring country,” Mr. Bakri said in a statement.
A Philippine security official, who declined to be named as he wasn’t authorized to speak to the media, said Filipino authorities had been notified of the kidnapping. The official said the victim was believed to have been taken to the Mindanao region in the southern Philippines.
China’s Xinhua News Agency said that Beijing had urged Malaysia to speed up efforts to rescue the man.
The spate of kidnappings underline persistent security threats in Malaysia’s Sabah state on Borneo island, a popular tourist destination and dive spot that is a short boat ride from the southern Philippines, where Muslim militants and kidnap gangs have long found safe haven.
Last month, militants from the Abu Sayyaf group seized a 28-year-old Shanghai woman a 40-year-old Filipino hotel receptionist from the Singamata Reef Resort in Sabah and took them by motor boat to their jungle stronghold in the predominantly Muslim province of Sulu, according to Philippine security officials who spoke to AP on April 5.
Last November, suspected Filipino militants shot and killed a Taiwanese tourist and kidnapped his wife from a resort in Sabah. The woman was released a month later in the southern Philippines. Authorities didn’t say whether a ransom was paid, as is usually the case.
Filipino militants are still holding more than a dozen captives, including two European bird watchers who were seized from Tawi-Tawi, the southernmost Philippines province closest to Sabah, in 2012.
The Abu Sayyaf had links to international militant networks, including al-Qaeda, but a U.S.-backed Philippine military crackdown has weakened it considerably in recent years. The group, which is on the U.S. list of terror groups, has about 300 fighters and is now much more focused on ransom kidnappings than global jihad.

Egypt unveils ornate tomb of ancient priestess in Giza
","Egyptian archaeologists on Saturday unveiled the tomb of an Old Kingdom priestess adorned with well-preserved and rare wall paintings.
Antiquities Minister Khaled al-Enany told reporters that the tomb on the Giza plateau near Cairo was built for Hetpet, a priestess to Hathor, the goddess of fertility.
The tomb was found during excavation work in Giza’s western cemetery by a team of Egyptian archaeologists led by Mostafa Waziri, secretary general of the Supreme Council of Antiquities.
The Antiquities Ministry said the cemetery houses tombs of top officials from the Old Kingdom’s Fifth Dynasty (2465-2323 B.C.), and that several have already been dug up since 1842.
The newly discovered tomb “has the architectural style and the decorative elements of the Fifth Dynasty, with an entrance leading to an ‘L’ shaped shrine”, the Ministry said.
“The tomb has very distinguished wall paintings in a very good conservation condition depicting Hetpet standing in different hunting and fishing scenes or... receiving offerings from her children,” it said.
The paintings also show scenes of musical and dancing performances as well as two scenes featuring monkeys — domestic animals at the time — one picking and eating fruit and the other dancing in front of an orchestra. Mr. Waziri said the paintings were unusual.
“Such scenes are rare... and have only been found previously in the (Old Kingdom) tomb of ‘Ka-Iber’ where a painting shows a monkey dancing in front of a guitarist, not an orchestra,” he said. That tomb is located in Saqqara, a necropolis about 20 km south of Cairo.
Mr. Enany said the tomb includes “a purification basin on which are engraved the name of the tomb’s owner and her titles”. “A German expedition had found in 1909 a collection of antiquities carrying this lady’s name, or a lady who has the same name, and these antiquities were moved to the Berlin museum at the time,” he said. “And 109 years later, we find this tomb that carries Hetpet’s name.”
Mr. Waziri said archaeologists will continue to excavate the site and hope to make new discoveries.

All 955 miners trapped for over a day in South Africa gold mine 'unharmed'
","All 955 gold miners who were trapped underground for more than a day in South Africa following a power cut resurfaced unharmed on Friday, the mine’s owner, Sibanye Gold, said.
“Everybody’s out,” said spokesman James Wellsted, adding that there were “cases of dehydration and high blood pressure but nothing serious.”
The miners were stuck in the Beatrix gold mine, in the small town of Theunissen near the city of Welkom, for around 30 hours after a massive power outage caused by a storm prevented lifts from bringing workers on the night shift to the surface.
After several hours engineers were able to restore power, allowing the hoist to bring up the miners — who had been trapped since Wednesday evening — in batches.
Asked if there had been any casualties, Mr. Wellsted said there was “no indication so far that anyone has been in distress"" although it had been a ""traumatic experience.”
Several ambulances arrived on-site overnight, the AFP reporter said.
Nervous family members had earlier patiently gathered along the road to the shaft, kept at a distance by security guards.

Thai PM Yingluck testifies in abuse of power case
","Thailand’s Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra defended herself on Tuesday against abuse of power allegations in a crucial court case that is one of several legal challenges, which could remove her from office.
Ms. Yingluck is accused of abusing her authority by transferring her National Security Council chief in 2011 to another position. Critics say the transfer was to benefit her ruling party and violated the Constitution.
“I would like to deny all allegations I am accused of,” Ms. Yingluck said calmly, seated beside her legal team. “As the Prime Minister, I am entitled to carry out responsibilities I have toward the people ... and for the utmost benefit of the general public.”
The case was lodged by anti-government senators, who won an initial victory in February when another court ruled that the official, Thawil Pliensri, must be restored to his job.
If Ms. Yingluck is found guilty of interfering in state affairs for her personal benefit or that of her political party, she would have to step down as Prime Minister.
The court has not said when it will rule on the case.

Japan launches micro satellite rocket
"," The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) launched on Saturday the world’s smallest rocket with the ability to put a micro-satellite into orbit, following a failed attempt and several postponements over the last year.
The launch of the low-cost rocket — with a height of 10 metres and 53 centimetres in diameter — took place from the Uchinoura Space Centre in Kagoshima prefecture and was aired live on YouTube, Efe news reported.
The rocket, an improved version of JAXA’s SS—520, was carrying a micro-satellite weighing three kilograms and was developed by the University of Tokyo to capture images of the Earth’s surface.
JAXA had launched the first of these rockets on January 2017, which fell into the sea after launch due to short-circuit caused by vibrations during take-off.
The current launch aimed to test the ability of the Japanese aerospace agency to launch low-cost rockets that can put micro satellites into space at affordable rates against a background of growing demand from the private sector.
Satellites for weather observation or defence that are in use are normally large and are commissioned by the authorities. 
In recent years there has been increase in the development of smaller ones by private firms for use in traffic control or geographical studies.

Strong quake shakes Thailand, Myanmar
","A strong earthquake shook northern Thailand and Myanmar on Monday evening, and some light damage was reported.
People were evacuated from the terminal of the main airport in Chiang Rai, a northern Thai city near the epicenter of the 6.0-magnitude temblor.
Pieces of the building ceiling fell but there was no damage to the runway or flight disruptions, airport General Manager Damrong Klongakara said. No one was hurt at the airport, but Damrong said the terminal and its roof were still being checked for further damage.
Damages were being assessed in Chiang Rai’s Phan district, where ceilings fell in some homes, said Wander Radchompoo, head of the district. She said no casualties have been reported.
Broken windows and cracks in building exteriors and roads were visible in the region.
The head of a Buddha statue fell at the Udomwaree Temple in Chiang Rai, according to monk Phra Pathompong. A residential building at the temple also had exterior cracks and ceiling damage, and nearby residents reported only minor damage in their homes, he said.
People ran down stairs in office buildings in Myanmar’s largest city, Yangon, and severe shaking also was felt in Chiang Mai, Thailand’s second-largest. Window curtains briefly swayed in the Thai capital, Bangkok.
The U.S. Geological Survey said the epicenter was 9 kilometers south of Mae Lao, Thailand, and 27 kilometers southwest of Chiang Rai.
The quake occurred at a relatively shallow depth of 7.4 kilometers. Shallow quakes are generally felt more widely.
Southeast Asia is seismically active and quakes are often felt in surrounding nations. Thailand has several fault lines, though in recent times quakes centered in the country have been less severe than those in other Southeast Asian nations such as Myanmar and Indonesia.
The 9.1-magnitude earthquake off Indonesia’s Sumatra island on Dec. 26, 2004, which triggered an Indian Ocean tsunami, killed more than 8,000 people in Thailand’s coastal areas, among the overall death toll of 240,000.
The last quake in Thailand approaching a similar size to Monday’s was one of 5.1 magnitude on Dec. 13, 2006, in the northern province of Chiang Mai.

Iran-Pakistan to increase cross border cooperation
","A few days before Prime Minister Muhammed Nawaz Sharif’s visit to Iran this weekend, its interior minister arrived in Islamabad to meet his Pakistani counterpart and pave the way for a smooth trip.
There has been some tension over the kidnapping of five Iranian border guards, four of whom were released. Iranian Interior Minister Abdolereza Rehmani Fazli had a protracted meeting with Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan on Tuesday and a number of issues were discussed in a bid to resolve border issues.
Addressing a joint press conference after that, Mr. Chaudhry Nisar said the meeting would help raise relations between the two countries a notch higher and all areas of concern would be addressed including cross border terrorism, smuggling, human and drug trafficking and there would be greater intelligence sharing and coordination between the security forces and armed forces of the two countries.
The two countries have agreed to a special task force or a commission which would be finalised before Mr. Sharif visits Iran. The entire framework would be in place by then. Chaudhry Nisar said that Pakistan had no problems with Iran and the relations of the two countries should be reflective of the demands of the people who want good relations.
Mr. Fazli in turn said he had a good meeting with Mr. Sharif and the interior minister and important issues to promote security and economic cooperation were discussed. He said it was agreed to share intelligence, and have joint committees and visits to the border to carry out surveillance operations against terrorists, money launderers and drug traffickers.
He also suggested a trilateral meeting with the Afghan interior minister to increase the level of cooperation in Balochistan. It was also agreed to set up a hotline between the Frontier Corps on Pakistan’s side and the Border Security Force on the Iran side. A proposal is in the offing to have a hotline for the directors general of military operations of the two countries. However, Mr. Chaudhry Nisar clarified the issue of joint operations as mentioned by Mr. Fazli and said while there would be greater collaboration between the security forces, Pakistan would carry out operations in its own country while Iran would do the same on its side.
Mr. Chaudhry Nisar also said that there is no question of Iran violating Pakistan territory and the kidnapped border guards were not present in Pakistan. When asked about one more guard who was reported to have been killed, he said he would stick to his stand that the guards were not present in Pakistan and the question of the fifth guard doesn’t arise. Mr. Fazli too said Iran has never intended to interfere or violate Pakistan’s territory. The recent issue of the Border guards was resolved with the cooperation of Pakistan after the Iranian President called Mr. Sharif.

The ‘100-yen’ answers to all of life’s needs
","Shopping in Tokyo conjures up images of swanky boutiques and equally swanky price tags. But the Japanese capital’s real retail engine thrums in the tiny, crammed and endlessly inventive environs of the ubiquitous ‘100-yen’ stores. These unassuming giants of consumerism allow the residents of one of the world’s most expensive cities to shop away with scarcely a dent made to their bank accounts.
The ‘100-yen’ stores do exactly what they advertise: sell almost everything on their heaving shelves for ¥100 (plus ¥8 for tax) — about a dollar. But they are more than just a place for cheaply made tat. They are a place for education as well, where the shopper learns about everything she never knew she needed but simply can’t do without after encountering it.
There is scant logic to the arrangement of goods with only the price tag in common: plant fertilisers rub up against laundry bags, and pencil sharpeners are nested with surgical masks. But where else can you find a banana-holder, an owl-shaped egg-maker, a cherry blossom-shaped carrot slicer, bicycle rain-covers, an origami paper, Halloween masks and everything in between? Small wonder that the combined sales of the four largest ‘100-yen store’ operators was estimated at ¥660 billion ($5.85 billion) in the 2016 fiscal, up by 20% over a five-year period. The clear leader of the pack is Daiso, a Hiroshima-headquartered outfit that opened its first store in 1991 and now runs roughly 3,700 shops across the country. Revenue for Daiso, which stocks about 70,000 household items, was ¥420 billion ($3.79 billion) in the last fiscal.
Part of the success of these stores has to do with Japan’s sluggish economy and stagnant wages that have resulted in a consumer culture focussed on bargains. But their history can be traced back to the pre-bubble era street stalls of the 1970s — makeshift outfits that sold cheap stationary and household bric-a-brac. The 1980s saw the rise of supermarkets, which on occasion would stage popular ‘100-yen sales’, but the stores took on their contemporary avatar only about two decades ago.
The ‘100-yen question’ is: How does the entire operation work in economic terms? How can selling goods for so little turn a profit? The answer lies in mass production of products in low-wage countries, bulk ordering by Japanese retailers and elimination of the middlemen. The disparate items available at these stores are not all of equal value. Some are worth only ¥10 at cost, while others are worth well over ¥100. The cheaper items in effect subsidise the pricier ones, balancing out to a figure that has both shop-owners and consumers smiling. What really makes Japan’s ‘100-yen stores’ stand out compared to ‘one-dollar stores’ and their equivalents around the world is not only that the quality of their offerings is often higher than average, but also the ingeniousness of those who design them.
This correspondent’s favourite is the portable trash bag holder, a neat solution to one of Japanese life’s biggest headaches: what to do with one’s rubbish. There are virtually no public trash cans in Tokyo to get rid of increasingly insipid wads of chewing gum or wet wipes oozing baby spit. You usually have to hold on to these in your hands or stuff them in your bag. But a roll of a dozen trash bags in a compact holder that fits into any tote allows one to peel off a bag to toss garbage into and carry it back home mess-free. An elegant ‘100-yen fix’.

Regional parliament member Vyacheslav Markin, who was known for speaking out against the government in Kiev, was buried on Monday while about 300 pro-Russian supporters shouted “Hero, hero!” Markin died on Sunday from burn wounds sustained in Friday’s fire.
Many of those at the funeral wore the St. George black-and-orange ribbon that has become a ubiquitous symbol of the pro-Russian protest movement in Ukraine and said they were planning to storm the regional government building in Odessa later that afternoon.

Tillerson plays up U.S.-Mexico cooperation in ‘war on drugs’
","U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson insisted on Friday that the U.S. and Mexico are bolstering cooperation in the fight against drug trafficking, brushing aside concerns about the impact of his boss Donald Trump’s anti-Mexican barbs. The U.S.-Mexican relationship has been strained by Mr. Trump’s attacks on Mexican immigrants and the North American Free Trade Agreement — and his insistence on building a border wall.
But as Mr. Tillerson kicked off his first major tour of Latin America, he and his Mexican counterpart sought to play down any tensions, focussing instead on fighting what Mr. Tillerson called the “devastating impact” of the international narcotics trade. “We’ve created... a different approach as to how we cooperate to attack the entire supply chain of this devastating impact of drugs — cocaine, heroin, fentanyl, opioids,” Mr. Tillerson said after meeting with Mexican Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray and Canada’s Chrystia Freeland in Mexico City.
Mr. Videgaray said all three countries had agreed to place “special emphasis” on fighting both the supply and demand side of the problem: the Mexican drug cartels fuelling a wave of bloodshed in his country, and the U.S. and Canadian consumption making it a multi-billion-dollar business. 
However, Mr. Videgaray stayed mum as Mr. Tillerson sought to explain Mr. Trump’s wall proposal and immigration crackdown as part of a shared security push.
The three also found common ground on the Venezuela crisis, calling for President Nicolas Maduro’s government to restore constitutional rule.

No group has immediately claimed responsibility but the blast is suspected to be the work of the al-Qaeda-linked al-Shabab militants, who are waging an insurgency against Somalia’s government.

Strong earthquake jolts Tokyo
","A strong earthquake jolted Tokyo early Monday, rattling windows and nerves though there were no initial reports of major damage.
The national broadcaster NHK, citing local authorities, said 17 people were reported injured, some of them from falls as the quake struck.
The Japan Meteorological Agency said the quake at 5.18 am (local time) had a magnitude of 6.0 and was centered 160 kilometres under the seabed near Izu Oshima island south of Tokyo.
The quake was felt across a wide area of Japan, with the strongest shaking registered in central Tokyo, the agency reported. Tokyo Fire Department reported that four people were injured, but details were not immediately available.

NHK reported some delays in train services on Monday and said speed restrictions were imposed briefly on expressways in the affected area as a precaution.

WHO sounds alert on polio
","The World Health Organisation (WHO) on Monday said Pakistan, Cameroon, and the Syrian Arab Republic posed the greatest risk of spreading wild poliovirus in 2014 and recommended that these states declare that the interruption of the poliovirus transmission is a national public health emergency.
The recommendations came after members of the WHO’s Emergency Committee met on April 28 and 29. The three countries would have to take steps including ensuring that all residents and long-term visitors (those who stay more than four weeks) receive a dose of Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV) or inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) between 4 weeks and 12 months prior to international travel, a statement from WHO said.
Pakistan reported 93 cases in 2013, most of them from the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) where polio vaccination teams have little access. In 2014, so far 56 cases have been reported, 44 of them from FATA. Also cases of the wild poliovirus in Syria were traced to Pakistan last year.
The WHO also declared the international spread of wild poliovirus a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). The WHO Director-General endorsed the Committee’s advice for ‘states currently exporting wild polioviruses’ and for ‘states infected with wild poliovirus but not currently exporting’ and issued them as Temporary Recommendations under the International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005, to reduce the international spread of wild poliovirus, effective May 5, 2014.
There was increasing evidence that adult travellers contributed to the spread in 2013, WHO said.

New Libyan premier vows to restore security
","The new Libyan prime minister has vowed to empower security institutions so they can bring order to the country, promising also to advance national reconciliation.
Ahmed Maiteg spoke in his first televised speech since being appointed in a vote opposed by parliament’s non-Islamist bloc.
Listing his government’s top priorities, Mr. Maiteg said on late Monday that security comes first.
“Imposing state hegemony, control and sovereignty on the country’s soil and building the security and military institutions,” stood at the top of the list, he said, followed by national reconciliation, decentralization and restructuring of public services and the economy.
Libya has been hit with sporadic violence since the downfall of longtime dictator Moammar Gadhafi in an eight-month civil war in 2011. Successive governments have depended on militias to restore law and order.

Search for missing ferry passengers put on hold
","Bad weather and the deterioration of internal partitions in a sunken ferry are hampering the search for those still missing in the disaster, South Korean officials said on Saturday.
More than three weeks after the ferry sank, 29 passengers remain missing, with 275 bodies recovered so far, most of them high school students.
Internal partitions in the ferry have become waterlogged and started to bend, said government task force spokesman Ko Myung-seok. Coast guard officials said this can prevent divers from entering different parts of the ferry.
Mr. Ko also said divers were unable to carry out underwater searches Saturday because of bad weather.
Search teams took advantage of improved weather this past week, but later were hampered by strong currents and floating debris inside the ship. A civilian diver fell unconscious while searching and died on Tuesday.
Only 172 people survived the April 16 disaster. Most of the passengers were students from a high school south of Seoul.
All 15 surviving crew members involved in the ferry’s navigation have been arrested on suspicion of negligence and failing to protect passengers. Besides possible freight problems, prosecutors say they are looking into other factors, such as the turn made during the time the ship began listing, ocean currents and modifications made to the ship.
On Friday, Kim Han-sik, head of Chonghaejin Marine Co. Ltd., which owns the sunken ferry, was arrested after investigators raised suspicions that improper stowage and overloading of cargo might have contributed to the accident. Mr. Kim is facing allegations that he was aware that the ferry exceeded its cargo limit but didn’t do anything to stop it from leaving port, according to prosecutors.

Maldives govt. yet to implement SC ruling ","Nearly 48 hours after the Maldives Supreme Court overturned the conviction of nine opposition leaders, including the exiled former President, Mohamed Nasheed, the Male administration is yet to release them, raising domestic and international concern over the delay.
On Saturday, authorities indefinitely postponed Monday’s Parliament session, citing “security reasons”, and the government dismissed the acting police commissioner from the post, a day after it sacked the police commissioner, following a tweet from the Maldives police saying it would uphold the Supreme Court ruling.
The Joint Opposition, including the Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP) led by Mr. Nasheed, has expressed concern over President Abdulla Yameen’s “refusal” to abide by the ruling. “We are deeply fearful that the government’s refusal to implement the Supreme Court order could escalate unrest and incite violence across the country,” it said in a statement.
The government has maintained that it needed to “vet and clarify the order”. “No deadlines are being considered at this point — the focus is on , through consultations, implementing the ruling in the swiftest manner possible within the proper rules of procedure,” Ibrahim Hussain Shihab, the international spokesperson at the President’s office in Male, told The Hindu.
President Yameen has said he did not expect the ruling. In a report published on Saturday evening, the Male-based Maldivian Independent quoted Mr. Yameen as saying: “I didn’t expect this Supreme Court ruling at all, but as they are the top court and there’s a ruling, the state and all relevant authorities have to do a lot of work to see how to implement it.”
Addressing supporters gathered in Male, Mr. Yameen said: “If they [the Opposition] need to see who has support now, if it takes holding elections early I would do that.”
The administration has neither released the nine persons, nor reinstated the 12 parliamentarians expelled earlier for defecting, despite the order mandating both. If reinstated, the legislators would raise the Opposition number in Parliament to a majority. The developments have sparked greater anxiety among locals critical of the Yameen administration.
“I hear that my husband has been shifted to another prison and kept in isolation,” Mariyam Nashwa, wife of former Vice-President Ahmed Adeeb, told The Hindu over telephone. Mr. Adeeb was among the nine persons the apex court named for immediate release, pending a fresh trial.
For months, Ms. Nashwa has been pleading with the authorities to grant medical leave to her husband who was diagnosed with glaucoma. “He has also been advised cancer screening, but even after the ruling, the government is refusing to release him.”
After the ruling, India, the U.S. and the EU, among others, have urged the government to respect the order and ensure that democracy and rule of law prevail.
Top UN officials and human rights watchdogs are also putting pressure on Male to comply with the order. The UN Secretary-General even offered to facilitate all-party talks to find a solution to the “political stalemate” in the Maldives.
“For the rule of law to retain any meaning, this ruling must be implemented and the witch-hunt against the political Opposition and other critics must come to an end,” said Biraj Patnaik, Amnesty International’s South Asia Director.
Following inaction for two days, countries, including the U.K., have issued travel advisories warning visitors of possible violence in Male, given the mounting frustration among people awaiting government action.

Gunman opens fire on foreigners in Italian town ","A lone gunman opened fire on foreigners in drive-by shootings in a central Italian city, wounding an undisclosed number of people on February 3 morning before being arrested, police said.
The suspect’s motive wasn’t immediately clear, but the city of Macerata is still reeling from the gruesome killing of a young Italian woman this week, allegedly at the hands of a Nigerian immigrant.
Police said all those wounded were foreigners and they later confirmed the arrest of the unidentified suspect about two hours after the shooting erupted in the city of Macerata.
Video posted by the newspaper il Resto di Carlino showed what appeared to be a body on the ground on a shopping street.
The shooting spree came days after the murder of 18-year-old Pamela Mastropietro and amid a heated electoral campaign in Italy where anti-foreigner sentiment has become a key theme. The head of the anti-migrant Northern League, Matteo Salvini, has capitalised on the killing in campaign appearances, and is pledging to deport 150,000 migrants in his first year in office if his party wins control of parliament and he is named premier.
The teen’s dismembered remains were found on January 31 in two suitcases, two days after she walked away from a drug rehab community.
Police haven’t said how many people have been wounded in the February 3 shootings. The news agency ANSA said two of the injured were black, and that witnesses reported that the car was seen in the area where the woman’s body was found and also near where the suspect lived.
Police had warned people to stay inside while the shootings were ongoing. Authorities ordered public transport halted and that students be kept inside schools, which are open on Saturdays.
Italians vote in the general election on March 4.

East Ukraine fighting kills four soldiers, wounds 30
","Ukrainian troops fought pitched gunbattles Monday with a pro-Russia militia occupying an eastern city, and the government sent an elite national guard unit to re-establish control over the southern port city of Odessa.
The twin moves reflected an apparent escalation of efforts to bring both regions back under Kiev’s control. Any possible loss of Odessa in the west and parts of eastern Ukraine could leave the sprawling country landlocked, cut off entirely from the Black Sea. Russia has already annexed a significant part of Ukraine’s Black Sea coast in grabbing back the peninsula of Crimea.
AP reporters heard gunfire and multiple explosions Monday in and around Sloviansk, a city of 125,000 that has become the focus of the armed insurgency against the new interim government in Kiev.
Interior Minister Arsen Avakov said on his agency’s website that pro-Russia forces numbering about 800 were deploying large-calibre weapons and mortars. His agency reported four officers killed and 30 wounded in the fighting.
A pro-Russia militia spokesman in Sloviansk said an unspecified number of people had been killed and wounded in the clashes, including a 20-year-old woman killed by a stray bullet.
Both sides indicated fighting was taking place at several sites around the city. An AP crew saw at least four ambulances rushing injured people to a city hospital, and one militiaman was seen being carried in for medical treatment.
Ukraine is facing its worst crisis in decades as the polarized nation of 46 million tries to decide whether to look toward Europe, as its western regions want to do, or improve ties with Russia, which is favoured by the many Russian-speakers in the east.
The goals of the pro-Russian insurgency are ostensibly geared toward pushing for broader powers of autonomy for the region, but some insurgents do favour separatism.
In the last few weeks, anti-government forces have stormed and seized government buildings and police stations in a dozen eastern Ukrainian cities. Authorities in Kiev who blame Russia for backing the insurgents have up to now been largely powerless to react. Since Russia has kept tens of thousands of troops along Ukraine’s eastern border, Ukraine’s central government fears Russia could try to invade and grab more territory.
Kiev also moved on Monday to restore control over the Black Sea port city of Odessa, where pro-Russian activists vowed to take over government buildings.

>Odessa had remained largely peaceful even as violence erupted across east Ukraine. But 46 people died on Friday after riots broke out there between pro-Russian and pro-Ukrainian groups and a government building was set on fire.
Pro-Russian activists gathered on Monday in Odessa at the funeral of a regional member of parliament, Vyacheslav Markin, who died in that fire and was known for speaking out against the interim government in Kiev. They shouted “Hero! Hero!” and vowed to avenge his death.
“Kiev doesn’t control the situation in the country, Kiev controls only one half of Ukraine,” said 32-year-old Dmitry Sheiko, who was wearing the St. George black-and-orange ribbon, a ubiquitous symbol of the pro-Russia protest movement. “Even in Odessa they can’t maintain order, which means that we will restore order ourselves.”
Riots over the weekend have also brought into question the loyalty of Odessa’s police forces. On Sunday, pro-Russian demonstrators stormed the Odessa police headquarters and freed 67 people who had been detained in the rioting.
The Interior Ministry said in a statement Monday that it was sending an elite national guard unit from Kiev to re-establish control in the city, and said 42 of those arrested during the rioting were being sent to another region for investigation, presumably to prevent local police from releasing more prisoners.
Russia, which the >international community has accused of promoting the unrest, has vociferously condemned Ukraine’s security operations in the east and blamed it for the Odessa fire.
Ukraine is planning to hold a national presidential election on May 25.

France sends more police to Calais after Eritrean, Afghan migrants clash "," Police reinforcements arrived on Friday in the French port city of Calais after clashes among migrants left 22 people injured, with the interior minister warning of more potential violence among those seeking to cross into Britain. 
Interior Minister Gerard Collomb told reporters in Calais on Friday that five of the victims were injured by gunfire in Thursday’s fighting, blaming migrant traffickers and “totally organized” gangs. Police were seeking a shooting suspect but have made no arrests, he said. 
Firearms are rare among migrants, and the shootings were the most serious clash in recent times among migrants around Calais. 
Mr. Collomb said that while in the past such violence was spontaneous, he said it appears to be growing more organised. He said local authorities have dismantled six migrant trafficking networks already this year, compared to 20 in all of 2017. 
The prefecture of the Pas-de-Calais region said the gunfire was the culmination of a showdown between Afghan and Eritrean migrants, fighting each other with sticks and stones, after a meal distribution near the Calais hospital. 
In a second confrontation, up to 200 Eritrean migrants cornered 30 Afghans near the former site of a makeshift migrant camp that housed thousands of people before it was evacuated and destroyed in 2016. 
Mr. Collomb said the government will start meal distribution to migrants outside Calais in the coming two weeks, instead of leaving it to aid groups, in an effort to stop feeding spots from becoming fixed nodes of tension. 
Insisting that “very few” people successfully sneak across to Britain, Mr. Collomb said, “if you want to go to Britain, you shouldn’t go to Calais.” 
He also called for long-term solutions to speed up asylum decisions and deport economic migrants with no right to refugee status. 
Tensions have been high in Calais since the camp was destroyed. More than 1,130 French security forces have been posted in Calais to keep migrants out of the port and Eurotunnel and to stop them from setting up camps.

Syrian rebels claim massive Aleppo hotel bombing
","A rebel-claimed bombing on Thursday in the northern Syrian city of Aleppo levelled a hotel near the ancient Citadel that government troops used as a military base, along with several other buildings, activists and militants said.
Syrian state television said the explosion struck a government-held area on the edge of a contested neighbourhood in old part of Aleppo. The television report identified the hotel as the Carlton Citadel hotel.
The attack in Aleppo is a significant blow to President Bashar Assad’s government in the north as his troops prepare to regain control of the central city of Homs following last week’s cease-fire agreement after a fierce, two-year battle with the rebels trying to oust him.
No such agreement appears to be in sight in Aleppo, Syria’s largest city and former commercial hub. The city has been carved up into opposition — and government-held areas since the rebels launched an offensive there in mid-2012, capturing territory along Syria’s northern border with Turkey.
In recent months, government aircraft relentlessly has bombed rebel-held areas of the city and the opposition fighters have hit back, firing mortars into government-held areas. The rebels also have detonated car bombs in residential areas, killing dozens of people.
Thursday’s attack targeted a government-held area on the edge of a contested neighbourhood in an old part of Aleppo. The country’s official news service said terrorists a term the government uses for rebels dug up tunnels under Aleppo ancient district and detonated explosives there.
A local activist group called the Sham News Network also reported the blast, saying that Mr. Assad’s troops were based in the hotel.
The Islamic Front rebel group claimed responsibility for the blast. A statement posted on its official Twitter account Thursday said that its “fighters this morning levelled the Carlton Hotel barracks in Old Aleppo and a number of buildings near it, killing 50 soldiers.” It did not say how it knew how many soldiers died.
The Islamic Front is an alliance of several Islamic groups fighting to topple Mr. Assad. Many of its fighters have joined the Front after breaking away from the Western-backed Syrian Free Army last year.
Another activist group, the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, said Islamic Front fighters planted a huge amount of explosives in a tunnel they dug below the hotel and detonated it remotely.
It said the hotel was completely destroyed in the blast and that there were casualties among the troops.
Meanwhile Thursday, more rebels were expected to leave the central city of Homs as an evacuation of opposition fighters moves into its second day.
Mr. Barazi was seen touring Homs on Lebanon’s Al-Manar TV, which is owned by the Shiite militant group Hezbollah. Hezbollah has been battling rebels in Syria alongside government troops for months.
A reporter with Syrian state TV was seen broadcasting live from an entrance to Homs Old City. Standing near the city’s main square known as the Clock Square, the reporter interviewed a priest who said he hoped people in the city would be safe again.
The Observatory, which has been documenting Syria’s three-year-old conflict through a network of activists on the ground, said that about 250 opposition fighters remain in the old districts of Homs, where they have been holed up under a crippling government siege for more than two years. The Observatory’s head, Rami Abdurrahman, said more than 960 left the city on Wednesday.
The rebels agreed to a ceasefire deal on Friday as part of the evacuation.
An activist in Homs who goes with the name of Beibares Tellawi told The Associated Press that seven buses went into a once-besieged area of Homs on Thursday to take the remaining rebels out of the city.
“The siege of old Homs will be over in a few hours,” Tellawi said via Skype. “We expect that everyone left inside will leave today.”
In exchange for the rebels’ safe departure from Homs, the opposition fighters have released 70 people who had been held by gunmen in various areas, including in Aleppo and in the costal province of Latakia, Mr. Barazi said.

Fresh fighting reported in eastern Ukraine
","Fighting broke out in eastern Ukraine on Wednesday as pro-Russian insurgents from Sloviansk attacked government forces surrounding the rebel-held city.
A rebel representative in Sloviansk told the Russian Interfax news agency that the fighting was concentrated around a television tower in the southern suburb of Andreyevka. “We are taking the checkpoints back under our control,” he said.
There was no immediate information on casualties, nor did the Ukrainian government comment on the reports.
Interior Minister Arsen Avakov, who has been coordinating the operation in the region, said on Monday that the television tower had been retaken and was broadcasting Ukrainian channels.
Separatists, many of them heavily armed, have seized more strategic sites in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions in the past weeks, prompting the Ukrainian government to admit that it has lost control there.
Mr. Avakov claimed that government forces had retaken control of the city of Mariupol. “Mariupol has been completely freed” he said in a statement on his Ministry’s website.
Unconfirmed reports said that at least one pro-Russian activist was killed during the nightly raid on the city administration building.
Hundreds of pro-Russian activists gathered outside the administration building to protest against the eviction, 0629.com.ua news site reported.
An industrial city of almost half a million that borders the Sea of Azov, Mariupol is the second-largest city in the Donetsk region.
Later on Wednesday, Swiss President and Foreign Minister Didier Burkhalter was to hold talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin on the crisis.
Mr. Burkhalter, who chairs the Organisation for Security and Cooperation (OSCE), is expected to advocate better implementation of the Geneva de-escalation agreement reached last month between Ukraine, Russia, the United States and the European Union, diplomats said.
Russia has blamed the West and Ukraine for not implementing the agreement, which stipulates the disarmament of all illegal groups and the vacating of occupied buildings throughout Ukraine.
Mr. Bukrkalter on Wednesday advocated an action plan, under which the four parties would back the May 25 presidential elections in Ukraine and a parallel referendum on decentralization.
However, the Ukrainian Parliament, in a vote on Tuesday, rejected a plan for holding a referendum with the elections.
Plans by the insurgents to hold a referendum on the regions’ future status on Sunday were condemned by the United States and the European Union on Tuesday.
E.U. president Herman Van Rompuy said the bloc was drawing up plans to help Ukraine reform its security sector.
“The E.U. is ready to assist Ukraine in the field of civilian security sector reforms,” Mr. Van Rompuy said, after talks in Brussels with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.
E.U. Foreign Ministers are expected to make a decision on such proposals when they meet on Monday, Mr. Van Rompuy added.
Mr. Abe, meanwhile, said that Japan would send 10 observers to help oversee a presidential election in Ukraine scheduled for May 25.
Russia has said the election should not be held while the government’s military operation in the east continues.
The separatists in the east plan to hold a referendum at the weekend on secession from Ukraine.
Presidential candidate Petr Poroshenko, regarded as a lead contender in the May election, urged the West to impose new sanctions on Russia in the separatists go ahead with the referendum.
“Should Russia support this referendum, we absolutely need a concerted response in the form of a third wave of sanctions,” Mr. Poroshenko said in Berlin, where he will meet German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier.
Meanwhile, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) paid a first tranche of aid loans approved for Ukraine to avoid bankruptcy.
The Ukrainian National Bank said that it received a $3.19 billion payment from the IMF, local media reported.
The IMF has promised $17 billion in aid to Kiev.

H-1B visa spouses to get work permits soon
","With more than a year lapsing since the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) first proposed to amend immigration law to allow H-4 visa holders, the spouses of those holding H-1B visas, to work under certain conditions, the U.S. federal agency this week announced the formal publication of the new rules, implying that they would enter into force soon, possibly 60-day public comment period.
The ruling is likely to have particular salience to visa holders of Indian citizenship, particularly those working in the IT sector, as India is the country receiving the largest proportion of H-1B visas from the U.S. every year. In 2013, its citizens received 99,705 H-1B visas of a total of 153,223 issued globally, slightly over 65 per cent.
In a statement DHS Deputy Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, said that as part of the administration’s proposals to “attract and retain highly skilled immigrants,” the new rules had been proposed because, “Businesses continue to need these high-skilled workers, and these rules ensure we do not cede the upper hand to other countries competing for the same talent.”
Mr. Mayorkas noted that up to 97,000 H-4 visa holders may be eligible to apply for employment authorisation under this rule within the first year of its entering into force and 30,000 may benefit annually.
On a call with media in Washington, Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker highlighted the transformative role of immigrant entrepreneurs in the U.S. economy. She said, “Many tire of waiting for green cards and leave the country to work for our competition. The fact is we have to do more to retain and attract world-class talent to the U.S. and these regulations put us on a path to do that.”
As the DHS did when the proposals were initially announced in January 2013, it was careful to clarify that the extension of work authorisation to H-4 visas would only apply in the cases of H-1B visa holders, who had begun the process of seeking “lawful permanent residence” in the U.S., in other words a ‘green card’ application. Currently, DHS does not extend employment authorisation to H-4 dependents.
The changes were initially announced in 2013, a few months after The Hindu carried a series of articles (
>‘For Indian women in America, a sea of broken dreams,’ July 29, 2012 and >‘On the H-4, a trail of misery and lonely battles,’ July 30, 2012) that spotlighted the debilitating personal circumstances faced by many H-4s.
These included depression, loss of enthusiasm and self-esteem associated with joblessness and social isolation, in numerous cases leading to mental health issues or familial breakdown.
Reflecting a greater sensitivity to this reality of spouses of H-1B visa holders, the DHS said during its initial announcement of the proposed changes that it, “recognises that the limitation on the period of stay is not the only event that could cause an H-1B worker to leave his or her employment and cause disruption to the employer's business, inclusive of the loss of significant time and money invested in the immigration process... This rule will encourage H-1B skilled workers to not abandon their adjustment application because their H-4 spouse is unable to work.”
The proposed rules granting employment rights to some H-4 visa holders were also “intended to mitigate some of the negative economic effects of limiting H-1B households to one income during lengthy waiting periods in the adjustment of status process,” the DHS noted in 2013.
However, the DHS emphasised applicants seeking to obtain the right to work in the U.S. on this basis should bear in mind that the proposed changes would only impact spouses of H-1B workers, who have been admitted or have extended their stay under the provisions of the American Competitiveness in the Twenty-First Century Act of 2000 or AC21.
Pre-empting criticisms that the new rules may lead to job losses for American citizens, the DHS said, “Allowing certain H-4 spouses the opportunity to work would result in a negligible increase to the overall domestic labour force. The benefits of this rule are retaining highly-skilled persons, who intend to adjust to lawful permanent resident status.”
The latest change in rules come on the back of numerous top U.S. company heads, including Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg lobbying in Washington for the passage of bipartisan immigration reform legislation that would better permit U.S. companies to recruit highly talented foreign citizens.
However, despite the U.S. Senate passing a sweeping comprehensive Immigration Reform Bill in 2013 year, the Republican-led House of Representatives has blocked debates on the floor, ostensibly due to concerns that a ‘path to citizenship’ for the nearly 11.5 million undocumented immigrants could have a potential negative impact on the U.S. economy.
U.S. President Barack Obama now appears to be leaning towards the use of executive actions to take immigration reform forward in a piecemeal format, and this week’s DHS proposals would reflect such change of tack.

","Trade between India and the United States is estimated to have jumped substantially from $118 billion in 2016 to $140 billion in 2017, according to an advocacy group that aims to promote bilateral trade.
In 2016, India was the ninth largest trading partner of the US and one of the major countries with which America has had trade deficit of more than $30 billion. This is expected to continue in 2017 as well, an issue which has repeatedly been raised by President Donald Trump and his top officials in their interaction with their Indian counterpart.
“We estimate that in 2017 India’s trade [with the US] has gone up from USD 118 billion [the previous year] to USD140,” Mukesh Aghi, president of the US India Strategic and Partnership Forum (USISPF) told PTI in an interview.
Official figures of annual bilateral trade are yet to come, but the USISPF estimates are based on its own research and surveys.
India, Mr. Aghi said, has proactively started working on addressing the issue of trade deficit with India.
“India roughly has a thousand plane orders with US companies. That will start bringing trade imbalance in the right direction. India, last year bought $2 billion worth of energy from the US. India spends roughly $80 billion dollars acquiring energy. And I think a lot of that will start moving to the US,” he said.
“I think next five years, you will see a little more balance in the trade between two countries,” Mr. Aghi said.
India and the US have set a goal of increasing the bilateral trade to $500 billion a year.
“I think it [bilateral trade] is moving,” he said.
Overall, the relationship between India and the US is moving in a right direction.

Tomb dating back to 1100 BC found in Egypt
","Archaeologists have found a tomb dating back to around 1100 B.C. south of Cairo, Egypt’s Antiquities Ministry said on Thursday.
Antiquities Minister Mohamed Ibrahim said that the tomb belongs to a guard of the Army archives and royal messenger to foreign countries. Mr. Ibrahim said the Cairo University Faculty of Archaeology’s discovery at Saqqara adds “a chapter to our knowledge about the history of Saqqara”.
Ola el-Egeizy of Cairo University said the tomb contains “very nice inscriptions” of the funerary procession and the afterlife of the deceased.
The tomb was found near another one dating back to the same period belonging to the head of the Army that was discovered in the previous excavation season. That tomb was larger but much of what remains is mud bricks as “most of its stone blocks were stolen and many of them are in museums all over the world,” said Mr. el-Egeizy. Because of the blocks, archaeologists had long known that the tomb existed though it was not uncovered until recently.
Saqqara was the necropolis for the ancient Egyptian city of Memphis and site of the oldest known pyramid in Egypt.
Egypt’s vital tourism industry has suffered in the wake of the 2011 uprising that toppled autocratic leader Hosni Mubarak.

Fidel Castro’s eldest son commits suicide: Cuban media
"," Official Cuban website Cubadebate said Fidel Castro Diaz-Balart, eldest son of late Cuban revolutionary leader Fidel Castro, committed suicide on Thursday aged 68. Mr. Diaz-Balart had been in a “deeply depressed state.” A brief note read on state television said his treatment had “required an initial hospitalization then outpatient follow-up.” 
Mr. Diaz-Balart was known for his resemblance to his father, earning him the nickname Fidelito or Little Fidel. He studied nuclear physics in the former Soviet Union and served as scientific adviser to Cuba’s Council of State. He was vice-president of the Cuban Academy of Sciences. He previously led its nuclear program. 
Mr. Diaz-Balart was born to Fidel Castro’s first wife, Mirta Diaz-Balart, a woman from Cuba’s aristocracy who Fidel married in his youth before beginning the revolutionary struggle that later brought him and his brother Raul to power.
By his maternal lineage, Mr. Diaz-Balart is cousin to Republican Congressman Mario Diaz-Balart, who represents Cuban exiles in Florida. 
Fidel Castro, the father, died in November 2016 at the age of 90.

Brotherhood will not return: el-Sissi
","Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi, the former military chief who removed Egypt’s Islamist president and who is now poised to win the post in elections this month, says the Muslim Brotherhood will never return as an organization, accusing it of using militant groups as cover to destabilize the country.
Field Marshal el-Sissi spoke in the first TV interview of his campaign, aired late on Monday, vowing that restoring stability and bringing development are his priorities. The comments were a seemingly unequivocal rejection of any political reconciliation with the Brotherhood, which was Egypt’s most powerful political force until Field Marshal el-Sissi removed President Mohamed Morsy, a member of the group, last summer.
Since ousting Mr. Morsy, Field Marshal el-Sissi has been riding an overwhelming media frenzy lauding him as Egypt’s saviour, and his status as the country’s strongest figure all but guarantees him a victory in the May 26-27 election. El-Sissi’s only opponent in the race is leftist politician Hamdeen Sabahi, the third-place finisher in the 2012 election won by Mr. Morsy.
Field Marshal el-Sissi’s comments were a stark signal of his intention to ensure the elimination of the 86-year-old Brotherhood as both a political and ideological force in the country. He is building on an unprecedented popular resentment of the group, after its rise to power in the last three years.
Asked whether the Brotherhood will no longer exist under his presidency, el-Sissi replied, “Yes. Just like that.”
“It’s not me that finished it, the Egyptians have. The problem is not with me,” he said.
The Brotherhood and its Islamist allies won every election following the 2011 ouster of autocrat Hosni Mubarak, dominating the parliament and capturing the presidency under Morsy. The Brotherhood’s electoral strength was largely rooted in a widespread grassroots organization it had built up for decades despite being banned under Mubarak.
But after a year in office, millions joined protests demanding Mr. Morsy’s removal, accusing his Brotherhood of monopolizing power and seeking to change the country’s identity along the lines of Brotherhood ideology prompting el-Sissi’s ouster of Mr. Morsy.
Since then, there’s been no sign of reconciliation between the sides. The Brotherhood and its allies have denounced Mr. Morsy’s removal as a military coup that has wrecked democracy, rejecting the new government and persisting in a campaign of street protests.
Security forces have waged a ferocious crackdown on Mr. Morsy supporters, clashing with protesters. Hundreds have been killed and more than 16,000 members of the Brotherhood and other Islamists have been arrested. The Brotherhood’s leader, Mohammed Badie, has been sentenced to death though the sentence can be appealed and he and Morsy and other senior Brotherhood figures face a string of trials. The government has branded the Brotherhood a terrorist organization. Under the weight of the crackdown, the pro-Morsy protests have waned.
At the same time, Islamic militant groups have stepped up bombings and shootings against police and the military in retaliation for Mr. Morsy’s removal.
In the joint interview with two private Egyptian TV stations CBC and ONTV, Field Marshal el-Sissi directly accused the Brotherhood of being behind the campaign of bombings and shootings. He said the movement “created” Islamic militant groups to use as “covers to fight from behind ... to keep the movement away from any accusations.” He said a senior Brotherhood leader had warned him that if he removed Morsy, extremist fighters from Afghanistan and elsewhere would come to Egypt to fight.
The Brotherhood denies any connection to militants.
“The thought structure of these groups says that we are not true Muslims, and they believed conflict was inevitable because they consider us non-believers,” he said. “It will not work for there to be such thinking again.”
The 59-year-old el-Sissi retired from the military in March with the rank of field marshal to launch his candidacy. The one-hour interview was his first direct address to the public since he declared his intention to run and after the start of the official campaigning on May 2.
A second part of the interview, likely to go into more details about his economic program, is to be aired on Tuesday.
El-Sissi’s candidacy has also raised concerns among some secular activists over a return of the autocracy that reigned in Egypt under Mubarak, who was also a veteran of the military. A number of prominent secular activists have been arrested in recent months, several of them under a draconian new law banning all protests without a police permit.
El-Sissi defended the protest law, saying it was needed to prevent further instability and insisting that police will give permits to those who seek to hold peaceful demonstrations.
“We are talking about a country going to waste. People must realize this and support us. Whoever imagines otherwise, only wants to sabotage Egypt and this won’t be allowed,” he said, losing his temper for the first time during the interview.
“This chaos will bring it down, because of this irresponsible protesting,” he said.
El-Sissi spent a part of the interview discussing his family, explaining that he met his wife as a teenager and promised her marriage when he was admitted to military college. He spoke fondly of her as a major supporter of his decision to run for president. She told him he had no choice, he said, telling him, “We of course love you, but this nation will be lost.”
U.S. trained el-Sissi said the military will not play a role in politics under his presidency and promised to consult with political factions. Asked if he will accept criticism, he responded with a smile, “I will put up with it” but then said he won’t accept “offenses.”
In one Cairo neighborhood, Sayeda Zeinab, el-Sissi supporters organized showings of the interview at local coffeehouses, where dozens gathered to watch. During advertising breaks, they sang and clapped to pro-military anthems.
“After God, I worship him,” 65-year-old Alia el-Sayed Saad said, raising two pictures of el-Sissi. “We are not ignorant, we can differentiate between the wicked and the honest.”
Turnout at the cafes was not high, however and nearby coffe shops with TVs showing a soccer game were packed with larger crowds.
Meanwhile, an Egyptian court has banned officials from the country’s former ruling party under ousted President Hosni Mubarak from running in elections.
The ban comes as Egypt prepares for presidential elections later this month. Former military chief Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi who removed Islamist president and Mubarak’s successor, Mohamed Morsy is poised to win that vote.
The Cairo Court for Urgent Matters on Tuesday ruled that leaders of Mubarak’s National Democratic Party cannot run in any presidential, parliamentary or local city council elections.
The ruling is binding until a higher tribunal issues a final verdict in the matter.
It closes the door, at least for the time being, to Mubarak party officials returning to the political scene.
The NDP was dissolved just months after Mr. Mubarak’s ouster in the 2011 popular uprising.

Pakistan legal fraternity protests killing of human rights lawyer
","Lawyers on Thursday protested the killing of human rights lawyer Rashid Rehman who was shot dead in his office in Multan on Wednesday even as the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) condemned the fatal attack on its Multan Task Force coordinator.
HRCP in a statement said Rehman was a committed rights activist and lawyer and had been associated with HRCP for over 20 years. On April 10, 2014, the HRCP said that it had brought to the attention of the authorities that Rehman was being openly threatened by prosecution lawyers in the Multan District Prison where he was representing a blasphemy accused.
The hearing was being held in the prison due to security concerns. The judge, it was reported, did not take any notice of threats issued to Rehman in his presence, HRCP said. Three persons had addressed Rehman in the judge’s presence and said: “You will not come to court next time because you will not exist anymore.”
HRCP said it was regrettable that no attention was paid to HRCP’s or Rehman’s concerns and nothing was done to apprehend the three persons who had threatened him. It had demanded that the three persons who had threatened Rehman be “proceeded against under the law without delay and effective measures be taken to ensure the defence lawyer’s security”.
The Commission demands that cases be immediately registered against those who had threatened Rashid and his killers be brought to justice. It would be a travesty of justice for the cause of human rights and for Rehman’s family if this plea was also ignored and meaningful action was not taken, the statement said.
Rehman had bravely decided to represent a blasphemy accused in a society where bigots believe that those accused do not have the right of defence and in his death, HRCP has lost a courageous and committed human rights defender, the statement pointed out. The forces of religious extremism, unchecked by the state, may have won a battle but not the war, the statement added.

Hamas ends ban on West Bank’s Al-Quds newspaper
","Gaza’s Hamas rulers on Wednesday permitted a veteran West Bank newspaper to be distributed in the coastal territory for the first time in six years, taking a new step toward implementing a >reconciliation deal with the rival West Bank government.
The return of the independent Al-Quds daily generated excitement in Gaza City, and all 1,500 copies that were delivered on Wednesday quickly sold out.
“
Al-Quds is back!” shouted Nabil Baker, a 42-year-old newspaper vendor, as he drove his bike through the streets, selling copies.
While devoted readers have followed Al-Quds online, he said there was something different about reading and touching the hard copy. “The readers like Al-Quds more than any other paper. They are yearning to read it again,” he said.
The Palestinian split goes back to 2007 when the Islamic militant group Hamas seized control of Gaza after routing the rival forces of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. Mr. Abbas’ Palestinian Authority, dominated by his Fatah movement, now governs parts of the West Bank.
After repeated attempts at reconciliation, the rival governments signed a unity pact last month calling for the two sides to form a unity government in June 2014, and then hold new elections around year’s end.
Although the split weakened Mr. Abbas’ position in peace talks, Israel has also objected at his recent attempts to reconcile. Israel considers Hamas a terrorist group and says it will not negotiate with any Palestinian government that includes the Islamic group. The latest round of U.S.-brokered peace talks collapsed last month.
On Monday, Mr. Abbas and Hamas leader Khaled Mashaal held a rare meeting in Qatar where they agreed to move forward with the reconciliation deal.
The Fatah-dominated West Bank government has banned Gaza newspapers since Hamas wrested control of Gaza in 2007.
Ihab Ghussein, the Hamas government spokesman, called on Wednesday’s gesture a “new initiative in support of Palestinian reconciliation”. He said Hamas hoped to see similar moves by the West Bank government.
Moustafa Barghouti, a Palestinian official in the West Bank, said the newspaper bans in both Palestinian territories would be lifted soon.
Rafeq Abdel Fatah, a 64-year-old tailor, said it was like a dream to see copies of Al-Quds. “You know the feeling you have when you are familiar with something for 30 years and forced to stop doing it every morning?” he said. “This is the case with my newspaper.”
“I hope all good things come back again, not only the newspaper but everything we missed during the past seven years of division,” he said.

Exiled former President of the Maldives Mohamed Nasheed promises to contest elections again
","Mohamed Nasheed, the exiled former President of the Maldives, said on Friday he hoped to contest presidential polls this year, following a surprise Supreme Court ruling that ordered his immediate release.
“Now that all my civil and political rights have been restored, I will be able to contest elections,” he told The Hindu in Colombo.
The Maldives witnessed turmoil on Friday, after the Supreme Court late on Thursday nullified the convictions of Mr. Nasheed and eight others, terming their trials “questionable and politically motivated”. Mr. Nasheed was barred from contesting any election in the Maldives after his controversial 2015 conviction on a terrorism charge.
 

Maldives Supreme Court orders release of former President Mohamed Nasheed, eight others


The development, in the wake of growing allegations of corruption and authoritarianism against President Abdulla Yameen, sparked violent clashes in Male between police and large groups of dissidents. While opposition supporters demanded immediate implementation of the ruling, police used force to disperse the crowd, local sources said.
“The police pepper-sprayed many of us. They were trying to disperse the crowd that had assembled spontaneously in a show of solidarity and to celebrate the verdict,” Rushdha Rasheed, a journalist of Raajje TV, present at the rally, told The Hindu over telephone.
The Supreme Court in its ruling observed that the earlier trials were a violation of the Constitution and international law. The apex court has ordered new trials.
In an official statement issued on Friday morning, the government said it would “vet and clarify” the ruling. On Friday evening, the international spokesperson at the President’s office, Ibrahim Hussain Shihab, said the administration had “shared its concerns” with the Chief Justice over the ruling.
In a press briefing held in Male, Attorney General Uz. Mohamed Anil assured the media that the administration was working with all relevant authorities of the state, to carry out the speedy implementation of the Supreme Court ruling. However, the government is yet to implement the order, according to sources in Male.
 

I will return, even if I have to spend the rest of my life in jail: Mohamed Nasheed


India urged the Maldives government to “respect” the verdict. “In the spirit of democracy and rule of law, it is imperative for all organs of the government of Maldives to respect and abide by the order of the apex court. We also hope that the safety and security of the Indian expatriates in Maldives will be ensured by the Maldivian authorities under all circumstances,” the Ministry of External Affairs said in a press release.
Meanwhile, President Yameen dismissed the Commissioner of Police, Ahmed Areef. According to opposition sources and local media reports, the top cop tried to take measures to implement the ruling on Friday, even as some within the police and military reportedly resisted it. Asked about the Commissioner’s sudden removal, the President’s office confirmed the move, but did not give a reason.
On the apparent reluctance of the Yameen administration to act on the ruling, Mr. Nasheed said: “President Yameen knows that if he implements it, we [the Opposition] would have a majority in Parliament. He is reluctant because he does not want to contest elections against me.”
Mr. Nasheed has been living in London since 2016, after the U.K. granted him political asylum. The likely re-entry of Mr. Nasheed foretells a significant change in politics in Male, especially at a time when opposition forces were finding it hard to field a candidate to fight Mr. Yameen in polls.
Male has been buzzing with the prospect of some change for some time now, political sources in Male said, particularly after Opposition forces began working closely with each other in the last year.
In Mr. Nasheed’s view, while a “combination of factors” were likely to have prompted the court ruling, the “last straw” was a recent raid on a resort run by Gasim Ibrahim, a prominent Opposition politician and a high-profile businessman. Critics said the raid was politically motivated.
“Moreover, people have begun realising that there is a strong radical Islamist strand within the government, the deep state. China’s growing debt trap in the island is also concerning many, about the Maldives possibly relinquishing the country’s sovereignty to China,” he said.
Observing that India’s statement on the development was “very welcome”, Mr. Nasheed said India must not only be “more closely engaged” with Male, but also watch the developments closely and make sure the rule of law is upheld in the Maldives.

Airliner engine failure closes Melbourne airport
","An explosive engine failure on a Vietnamese airliner showered fiery debris across a runway at Melbourne Airport on Tuesday, preventing planes landing and taking off for 40 minutes, an official said.
The malfunction happened as Vietnam Airlines Flight 780 was taxiing to take off on a flight to Ho Chi Minh City, Melbourne Airport spokeswoman Anna Gillett said.
The twin-engine Airbus A330 came to rest at the intersection of the airport’s two runways, blocking all traffic for 40 minutes until 11.30 am local time, she said. No one was injured.
“The issue also resulted in some debris from the plane causing some spot fires on the runaway and surrounding area,” Ms. Gillett said.
“There are some rumours that the aircraft itself was ablaze with fire that’s not the case,” she added.
A passenger told ABC radio that the jet’s nose had begun lifting for takeoff when the engine failed, forcing the pilots to abort the flight.
An airline official in Melbourne declined to comment.
Ms. Gillett said the cause of the engine failure was under investigation.

Tech giants oppose plan for two-speed Internet
","Google, Facebook, Twitter and Amazon were signatories to a strongly-worded protest letter attacking a proposal to give big corporations higher-speed Internet access while relegating smaller users to relatively slower speeds of data transfer online.
After Tom Wheeler, Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, put forth a plan last month to allow broadband providers to charge companies a premium for access to their fastest ‘lanes,’ 100 top tech companies wrote that the FCC, “instead of permitting individualised bargaining and discrimination… should protect users and Internet companies… against blocking, discrimination and paid prioritisation…”
A vote on the plan is scheduled for May 15.
Some consider the FCC, which has been under significant pressure since the latest rules were proposed, to be seeking a middle ground between preserving absolute ‘net neutrality,’ the concept that “that no providers of legal Internet content should face discrimination in providing offerings to consumers, and that users should have equal access to see any legal content they choose,” and preventing broadband Internet providers such as Comcast, Verizon Communications Inc. and Time Warner Cable from slowing down certain websites accessed by individual consumers.
This week’s protest letter may only be a first step in a larger grassroots-style protest hinted at in some reports, especially as many of the same companies participated in a large-scale protest in 2012 that knocked out the controversial Stop Online Piracy Act, which was also know as SOPA.
While the companies’ fears may be exacerbated by reports that the two Republican Commissioners of the FCC were “broadly opposed to regulation of Internet traffic,” and were expected to vote against any net-neutrality rules that they consider to be unnecessarily burdensome on Internet providers, they are likely to find support from the Democratic members of the Commission.
One of them, Jessica Rosenworcel, said this week that she has “real concerns” with Mr. Wheeler’s proposal, adding that she felt, “We should delay our consideration of his rules by at least a month…I believe that rushing headlong into a rule-making next week fails to respect the public response to his proposal.”
Another Democratic Commissioner, Mignon Clyburn, said in a blogpost that she was “listening” to the thousands of people who have spoken out on the issue. However, she addedding, “I would have prohibited pay for priority arrangements altogether.”
With speculation mounting that the FCC intended to “gut the open Internet rule,” the tech firms warned in their letter that if the Commission enabled phone and cable Internet service providers to discriminate both technically and financially against Internet companies and to impose new tolls on them, it would “represent a grave threat to the Internet.”
They further urged the FCC to take necessary steps to ensure “certainty to all market participants and keep the costs of regulation low,” pleading that such rules were essential for the very future of the Internet.
Among the other major technology companies signing the letter were Netflix, Microsoft, LinkedIn, Tumbler, Reddit, Yahoo, Ebay, Etsy, Vonage, DropBox, FourSquare and Zynga.

UN chief in S.Sudan to urge for peace
","U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon is visiting South Sudan to urge both sides involved in the country’s conflict to abide by a peace deal they signed in January, a U.N. spokeswoman said on Tuesday.
Mr. Moon’s visit comes four days after U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry met with South Sudanese President Salva Kiir leading to Mr. Kiir’s announcement that he is ready for talks with the rebel leader, former Vice President Riek Machar.
But government troops over the weekend attacked the rebel—held city of Bentiu, the capital of Unity state and the rebel stronghold of Nasir, in Upper Nile state.
Mr. Moon will call on the participants in South Sudan’s war to implement the >cease-fire agreement they signed on Jan. 23. Neither side has honoured the peace deal.
South Sudan has been rocked by violence since December, when Mr. Kiir accused Mr. Machar of attempting a coup. Thousands of people are believed to have been killed and 1 million people have fled their homes. The violence has taken on an ethnic dimension between Mr. Kiir’s Dinka ethnic group and Mr. Machar’s Nuer tribe leading to fears of genocide.
The U.N. refugee agency said on Tuesday that it is seeing a sharp increase in the number of refugees fleeing South Sudan’s violence to western Ethiopia.
Over the past 72 hours some 11,000 people have crossed into the Ethiopian town of Burubley along Baro River, which divides the two countries, after South Sudan government forces captured a key rebel stronghold of Nasir, said U.N. refugee agency spokesman Adrian Edwards.
Many more refugees are massed on the South Sudanese side of the border, waiting to cross the river on one of the few small ferry boats, Mr. Edwards told reporters on Tuesday in Geneva.

Over 350 killed in Afghan landslide
","A landslide triggered by heavy rain buried large sections of a remote northeastern Afghan village on Friday, killing at least 350 people and leaving more than 2,000 missing. Villagers looked on helplessly and the governor appealed for shovels to help dig through the mass of mud that flattened every home in its path.
The mountainous area in Badakhshan province has experienced days of heavy rain and flooding, and the side of a cliff collapsed onto the village of Hobo Barik around midday. Landslides and avalanches are frequent in Afghanistan, but Friday’s was one of the deadliest.
Gov. Shah Waliullah Adeeb said more than 2,000 people were missing after the landslide buried some 300 homes about a third of all the houses in the area.
At least 350 people were confirmed dead, according to Ari Gaitanis, a spokesman from the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan. He said the U.N. was working with authorities on the ground to rescue people still trapped.
The governor said rescue crews were working but didn’t have enough equipment.
“It’s physically impossible right now,” Mr. Adeeb said. “We don’t have enough shovels; we need more machinery.”
Badakhshan provincial police chief, Maj. Gen. Faziluddin Hayar said rescuers had pulled seven survivors and three bodies from the mounds of mud and earth but held out little hope that more survivors would be found.
“Now we can only help the displaced people. Those trapped under the landslide and who have lost lives, it is impossible to do anything for them,” Hayar said.
Video footage of the scene showed a large section of the mountain collapsed, sending mud and earth tumbling onto the village below.
The landslide was likely caused by heavy rain, said Abdullah Homayun Dehqan, the province’s director for National Disaster Department. He said floods last week in different districts of the province killed four people and eight more were still missing.
Landslides occur frequently in the province, but they generally happen in remote areas and produce far fewer casualties, said Mohammad Usman Abu Zar from the Meteorology Department of Badakhshan province.
Authorities evacuated a nearby village over concerns about further landslides, the governor said. Dehqan said blankets and tents had been sent and about 400 people from nearby villages had gathered to help with the rescue effort.
Badakhshan province, nestled in the Hindu Kush and Pamir mountain ranges and bordering China, is one of the most remote in the country.

Authorities have blamed a number of attacks on the Somali radical Islamist group al-Shabaab. It claimed responsibility for a September attack on a Nairobi shopping mall, which killed 67 people.
The U.S. Embassy in Nairobi sent out an emergency message shortly after the blasts urging all U.S. citizens in Mombasa to shelter in place and avoid any unnecessary travel.
Small grenade and gun attacks have occurred regularly on Kenya’s coast ever since the east African nation invaded Somalia to fight the al-Qaeda-aligned al-Shabaab extremists. Police routinely blame al-Shabaab and its sympathizers for the attacks though few people have been charged in court in connection with the blasts.
Saturday’s bombings occurred despite a major police crackdown that has seen thousands of people arrested across the country over the past month. The round-up has been heavily criticised by human rights groups that say it has targeted ethnic Somalis instead of criminals.
Numerous radical Islamist leaders also have been gunned down on the coast in mysterious circumstances, but the violence has not abated.
On April 1, the controversial cleric Abubaker Shariff was killed and his followers have vowed to avenge the death.
Last week a car bomb at a police station in Nairobi killed four people including two police officers.
Kenya’s tourism industry is heavily dependent on visitors, but has taken a major hit due to the widespread insecurity.

Stand up for yourself
","You are in the midst of studying when a friend who is done with her exams calls and wants to discuss whether she should break up with her boyfriend. Deep down, you know that this is not a good time for you to talk as you have a lot to revise. Yet, you hear her out, thinking she will feel hurt if you cut her off.
A professor asks you to take part in an intercollegiate debating contest. You would love to participate, but your sister is getting engaged on that day. Your parents advise you to ask the professor to be excused this time. Just as you approach the professor, he pats you on the shoulder and says, “I have just submitted the form for the contest with your name. I know you won’t let the college down.” 
Voice yourself
In both situations, a student is worse off for not speaking up. This happens to all of us some of the time. But if you are a person who always puts your own needs behind, you are likely to experience chronic frustration. However, you can learn to assert yourself. So, even if you are always the one who ends up doing most of the work on group projects, you can learn to speak up and even get others to do their share.
One of the impediments to stating your needs or position is that some people erroneously believe that assertiveness is the same as aggressiveness. But, there is a wide chasm between the two behaviours. As Catherine Saint Louis writes in The New York Times, “You can stand up for yourself without resorting to bullying.” In fact, being assertive involves disagreeing respectfully. She provides the following tips to make disagreeing more agreeable to those of us who find it difficult to stand up for ourselves. 
First, stick to the point. As Saint Louis succinctly reminds us, “No is a complete sentence.” Don’t feel the need to elaborate on reasons why you may choose not to do something for someone. While some situations may call for extended explanations, like telling your boss why you didn’t finish the project on time, avoid long-winded answers if a shorter one will suffice. 
Next, if someone extends an invitation to an event, be it a party or a conference, and you would rather not go, you may decline graciously. “While I hope to goes really well, I won’t be able to make it this time.” Further, take ownership of your utterances by using ‘I.’ So, if a friend calls you for dinner in the last-minute and you are loath to go, instead of making an accusatory statement involving ‘you’, simply say, “I already have plans for tonight.” Never mind if those plans involve staying home and watching Netflix.
If you cannot decide on the fly and want more time to think through your options, ask for it. “I will get back to you about this by tomorrow.” Often, people give in because they feel pressured to respond immediately. But, in many situations, you can always buy time so that you can weigh the pros and cons of various choices. Finally, if you can predict what someone will request, as they seem to repeatedly ask for favours that you give into reluctantly, prepare what you will say beforehand. “I can’t come shopping with you this weekend to buy your mother’s birthday present, but I heard there are great sales going on in Globus Mall.” If they press on, as some people are wont, simply hold on to your stand. Once they realise that you won’t give in, they will.

Keep at it
","‘Ek baar jo maine commitment kar di, fir main apne aap ki bhi nahi sunta’ and the theatre erupts into euphoric catcalls and revelry. This is undoubtedly one of the most resounding Salman Khan one-liners, vital to the runaway success of a Bollywood blockbuster. This is a favourite Bollywood quip of mine.
I was talking to a fitness enthusiast the other day who seemed to have taken to running daily lately, “I’ve signed up for a #3Kchallenge — to run 3K every day for a month as I realised I had stopped running regularly. There is no getting away now.”
Commitment
A client who worked with me on accountability and life goals, once shared that her minimum daily steps commitment is sacrosanct, “If nothing else, I now complete my step-goal walking inside my apartment however seemingly numbing it is.” As I know, she has undergone an unprecedented shift in fitness and well-being, committing to small yet discernible changes in her daily schedule.
This is real life, made of small, yet defining personal victories. Such stories don’t make it to a bestselling autobiography but every inspiring autobiography is indeed a recount of personal challenges and hard-won victories in the writer’s milieu. The common thread being that commitments made to the self succeed well above the promises made to appeal to others or our own unfavourable impulses.
So, this month, as I watched Nike’s latest Colin Kaepernick commercial, it stirred connections to many stories of individual challenges and wins. To me ‘Don’t try to be the fastest runner in your school or the fastest in the world! Be the fastest ever!’ is a big leap and a deeper, more insightful personalisation of the ‘Just Do It’ mantra. It operates at two levels — one, it urges us to consider resetting the bar to break through personal barriers and redefine goals; two, it speaks to the prowling hero in each of us.
The truth is, no one wants to be found out, no one wants to look bad at the end of the race and more insidiously, no one wants a confirmation of not being good enough. This exists as we focus outward, pitching the self in comparison with the other who is winning. It is endemic. I see many, a morning walker, break into a run when no one is watching, ‘Let me try but let no one else find out’ — is a basic urge. When that focus shifts inward the self-dialogue is kinder — ‘Let me find out how it feels! Let me do my best.’
Confidence-building
Getting around self-debilitating urges is achievable. I also believe that getting to that place of committing-the-self is a road made of many confidence and character building steps where we make promises to keep them. When you say you will arrive at 9.00 a.m., you arrive at 8.58 a.m. When you are tempted to commit to call back in two minutes, you stop! Instead promise to call in 10. To wake up at 6.00 a.m., set up the alarm for 6.00 a.m.; no snooze mode, you just wake up! These simple yet vital wins foster tenacity. 
To win we must examine commitment as our very character on the line. No wonder we have to be unrelenting. Going a step further, we will publicise a commitment and deny it the cushion of anonymity. Small, frequent victories will form the bedrock of success and higher goals. Of course sleep, convenience, comfort, anonymity are collateral damage on this road. As Nike says, ‘Believe in something, even if it means sacrificing everything’.
And then we will witness our confidence and character grow deep, ingrained roots.

Gen M: What are you talking about?
"," “Is something wrong? You don’t look too well. Did you have a fight with Sujatha?”
“No, I was late for my chemistry class, and the teacher gave me a good banging.”
“Did you know that the expression ‘to give someone a good banging’ meaning ‘to scold someone severely’ is an Indianism?”
“Really? What’s the expression that native speakers use?”
“They have many. One of them is tongue-lashing! The coach gave a tongue-lashing to all the players.”
“Makes it seem that the coach whipped the players with his tongue! Anyway, I got a tongue-lashing from the chemistry teacher today — in front of the whole class.”
“Must have been quite embarrassing. What did you...”
Nodding acquaintance
“Listen, I have a test in chemistry tomorrow. Do you think you’ll be able to help me?”
“Don’t really think so. I have only a nodding acquaintance with the subject.”
“Nodding acquaintance? Does it mean you don’t know anything about chemistry?”
“That’s not what I mean. When you say you have a nodding acquaintance with chemistry, what it suggests is that you know only a little bit about chemistry. Not much.”
“I see. How about this example? I have a nodding acquaintance with Hindi and Bengali.”
“Sounds good. Suchi was able to help us because she had a nodding acquaintance with the new software. The expression can be used with people as well. When you refer to someone as a ‘nodding acquaintance’, you’re suggesting that...”
“That you don’t know the individual very well. You don’t really talk to him that much.”
“Exactly! You merely smile or nod when you see this person. I have a nodding acquaintance with most people who live in this building.”
“I really don’t know my new neighbour. We only have a nodding acquaintance.”
“You being part of Generation Mute, it’s not really surprising.”
“Generation Mute? What are you talking about?”
“A lot of young people today don’t really like to talk. They don’t talk to people when they are face to face with them or on the phone. But they don’t mind carrying on a lengthy conversation with others by texting or emailing them.”
“Since they prefer to write and not talk, they are a part of ‘Generation Mute’. They’re mute.”
“Exactly! Quite a few people I know are part of Generation Mute.”
“That’s true. Deepak says that he doesn’t have time to make friends. He is so busy...”
“Deepak? Are you talking about your cousin? That proud chap who is always...”
“He’s changed — he’s no longer proud. A few months ago, my cousins and I got together and cut him to size.”
“That’s good to know. By the way, it’s not ‘cut someone to size’ but ‘cut someone down to size.”
“I see. And before you ask, I know what the expressions means. When you ‘cut someone down to size,’ what you’re doing is ‘making them aware that they’re not as important as they think they are. You kind of deflate their ego.”
“Exactly! And you usually achieve this by criticising or making fun of them. After he became the President of the club, Chinthan became insufferable. His friends had to cut him down to size.”
“Whenever my friend Jeevan starts bragging about his good looks, his sister cuts him down to size.”
“If only we could cut some of our politicians down to size.”

Integrating body and mind "," The whole world is turning towards the Indian subcontinent to find not immediate but long-lasting answers to the fundamental questions of life. “In that sense India is a spiritual oasis. However, there isn’t much of this holistic view in clinical psychology and therapeutic practices which are currently dominated by the western theories, both of the mind and the body,” observes Brinda Jacob-Janvrin, Founder, Studio for Movement Arts and Therapies (SMART), Bangalore.
It is to tap this rich spiritual reservoir of the East and employ it in the field of therapy, Samaghama, an intensive course for professional counsellors and therapists has been conceptualised. Samaghama comprises of an eight-month training and a four-month research, it is founded on the basic principle that body, mind and spirit are all connected and are in continuum. Brinda asserts that it is not just the mental disturbances that cause diseases, but also bodily illness can result in mental sickness. “Therefore a holistic approach to overall health of the individual is the need of the hour which demands integration of knowledge from different disciplines and epistemic world-views that are hitherto disconnected,” she argues. 


“The course is aimed at raising awareness of the participants about the confluence of physical, mental and spiritual aspects in themselves,” says Brinda, who has designed the course along with Dr. Leonilla Ageira, a metaphysical practitioner.
This one of a kind course that is beginning in September is aimed at understanding the human expression, body, emotions, energies, health and well-being at a deeper level. “The participants of this course therefore need to have basic training in yoga, expressive arts, therapy or psychology,” says Brinda, who also conducts a programme in expressive and creative arts therapies and a workshop called ‘the body remembers’ at SMART. “Samaghama will be an advanced course to those who have attended the expressive arts therapy course,” says Brinda, who started off as a contemporary dancer and later ventured into art therapy and counselling in UK and India.
The idea to begin such a course actually spurred when students of depth psychotherapy from John F. Kennedy University were at SMART for a two-week residential programme. “JFK University wants to explore further what Psychoanalyst Carl Jung theorised in India during the last century. The University is willing to collaborate and render its expertise to this course which also explores Jungian philosophy,” she informs.
“Only when a therapist finds a balance in her personal life, will she be able to serve her clients effectively. Unlike other professions, this one particularly demands mental clarity and stability from a therapist,” asserts Brinda, who feels that personal journey is as important as the professional.
Therefore, a course like this would take these professionals who work in the body-mind modality to a deeper understanding of themselves. “Isn’t it invigorating to explore deeper and come in contact with what lies within you?” asks Brinda.

Q1 Auguste Rodin was a French sculptor and artist who was born on this day in 1840. He was a master of technique in sculpting, choosing somewhat unconsciously, to rebel against contemporary norms. He admired Dante, the Poet, and depicted him and his work in many of his sculptures. Rodin’s most famous statue, ‘Le Penseur’, known to us all by a different name, is also supposedly modelled on Dante. Rodin said about the statue, “What makes my _____ ____ is that he _____ not only with his brain, with his knitted brow, his distended nostrils and compressed lips, but with every muscle of his arms, back, and legs, with his clenched fist and gripping toes.” What is the name of this world-famous statue?




Q2 Sticky Rice mortar was invented using organic materials in inorganic mortar. Sticky rice soup was mixed with slaked lime to create a mixture that had high adhesive strength and waterproofing capacity and prevented weeds from growing through, and rivals modern cement. This application was used in the construction (around 500 CE) and renovation (around 1400-1600 AD) of a very famous monument. Which monument?




Q3 This footwear brand, using durable pigskin, was originally conceived for the U.S. Military, and later made footwear with ‘casual’ pigskin for the public. It was a hit in the 1960s and 1970s as a leisure staple. One possibly apocryphal story of the origin of this company’s name goes as follows: when a sales manager of the company was at a customer’s house, he wondered aloud as to why fried corn dough balls were called by a certain name. The customer responded that they were called so as they were fed to barking dogs to get them to keep quiet. The manager felt it would be a perfect name for the product he was selling, as hurting feet were as annoying like barking dogs. Which brand was thus born?




Q4 “Road to Sangam” is a 2010 Bollywood film which follows Hasmat, a mechanic, who is entrusted by the UP Government to repair a truck’s V8 Engine. He realises through a series of events, that the truck he is repairing was used for a purpose of national significance roughly 60 years prior, and had made its journey to the Triveni Sangam. For what purpose was the truck used?




Q5 A staple of Indian physics and chemistry textbooks, this scientist won the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1906 and is well-known for his discovery of an electron being a particle. His son won the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1937, for showing that the electron was a wave, and could be diffracted. Although these proofs were initially considered contradictory, it is now well accepted that electrons have a particle-wave duality. Name the father-son duo.

Sparks from a conversation
"," A two-day gathering focusing on peace education explored the subject. Diversity of the panel members and audience ensured that quality questions were raised.
The issues
Any form of exclusion is violence, stated a panellist. The idea, at school, is to enable a sense of belonging, to blur the line between ‘us’ and ‘them’, said another. To what extent is this possible, one wonders, especially given that there is so much of ‘us’ and ‘them’ the society incessantly bombards a child with. The ‘us’ and ‘them’ of religion, of caste, of status, of nationality and more. A child has no role in any of these and adults have little clarity on.
An informal environment is a must — children must be free to ask questions. A panellist, in a separate session, asked whether there was any point in children having the space to question, when their questions were neither deliberated upon nor responded to. This is prevalent more in schools which like to believe that they are alternative schools, but perhaps end up subjecting their children to a poorer environment.
The deliberations also touched upon freedom. One stark point which was raised was that when one taught entirely based on the textbook, the question of freedom of speech did not arise. The topic ‘freedom’, elucidated pertinent responses from the audience. Do we need to first have freedom in staff rooms before we have freedom in classrooms? If speech is free can silence also be free? 
Caste too made its way into the discussions. Classrooms, in most of our schools, adhere to our caste system. Teachers belong to the proverbial upper castes while children bear the brunt. This is a strong point but reflects the teacher-centred classrooms we have, which espouse silence, and wherein is writ the teacher runs supreme. One of the panel members questioned why schools, including those claiming to be liberal refrain from discussing caste.
Our approaches, of late, have not helped. We have schools which levy fines on children for speaking their native language. Our sports have become far more aggressive; listening to cricket commentary for a short time will bring out lines in the nature of ‘shot like a bullet’ and ‘thrashed the bowler’. The scenario has changed to such an extent that what was previously the Education Ministry is now the Human Resources Ministry; in other words we are producing raw material for the market.
Way forward
On the way ahead, one speaker spoke on two possible avenues which could synthesise a non-violent brain; early childhood nurturing and mindful meditation. Another pointed to the need to have inner peace before expecting outer peace. A third speaker said that while we live in an imperfect world and face complex situations, we strive for perfect solutions. We need to work towards approximate and imperfect solutions — those that are attainable and will have us at peace.

Inclusive move
","



Radhika Mall, graduate, B.A. (H) Economics, Lady Shri Ram College for Women, Delhi University, New Delhi
This is a move of great significance as there is no holding back for a disabled sportsperson now. Investing in the stadiums emphasises the importance of the differently-abled in this nation. This step will instill in them a zeal for progress and give them hope of prospective freedom. Moreover, it is a potential for reaping exponential talent from society. 
 


Dishant Passi, engineering graduate, Dronacharya College of Engineering, Delhi
There has always been negligence towards the differently-abled, and their aspirations are often compromised in all aspects and fileds. This move will empower them in many ways. The sense of independence that is manifest in every human being will be promoted, along with the physical assistance that these stadiums will provide.
 


Abir, IV, B.Tech (IT), Jaypee University of Information Technology, Himachal Pradesh
This move signifies that the differently-abled are not inferior to other athletes. They are equally worthy of opportunities and infrastructure which they are often denied of. Also, it promotes courage and talent. It shall help the society realise that disability is just a matter of perception and true talent is what matters.
 


Anjali Notandas, I, journalism and communications, O.P. Jindal Global University, Sonipat, Haryana
The setting up of these stadiums will definitely step-up our nation’s differently-abled. It will serve to encourage desire and confidence in them to play without the fear of being rejected or alienated. More importantly, it will encourage them to pursue their aspirations, despite their tribulations, which is the need of the hour.

Smogged celebrations ","



Deepavali has gone from being the festival of lights to a celebration of irony and anarchy. A quick post-mortem of the streets revealed the burnt remains of firecrackers littering every nook and cranny, and the violation of the Supreme Court’s ban too. It amuses the mind, if not the lungs, to see the perpetrators wear smoke masks the following morning, as they returned to their lives with irritated coughs and itchy eyes.




 In my hometown Gwalior, I have observed a trend over the past five to six years where the use of firecrackers seem to be on the decline. However, the situation this year was particularly bad, with an unexpected increase in the number of crackers and the consequent pollution. Clearly, the Suprene Court order has not contributed much to reduction in the usage of firecrackers, largely because of a hasty and reactionary decision in the face of an immediate pollution crisis, instead of taking and implementing the decision in a planned manner.




While smog blanketed New Delhi last winter, the SC passed orders to regulate the situation this Deepavali, which many transgressed. Though, unfortunately, we had to spend less time with crackers, it is crucial that we compromise. Recent reports show that despite the SC order, smog has been at large in the Capital, while in Tamil Nadu, air pollution decreased as compared to last year, which shows a sure sign of awareness.
 


 The Supreme Court had restricted the time for bursting the crackers, but only a few took the regulation seriously. The air quality is again hazardous, as it has crossed the limit of the air quality index. The situation is even worse for senior citizens. These are just the visible short-term effects; if things continue at this pace, then things could worsen. The Supreme Court, along with the government, should formulate stringent laws.

Lessons for life
","“They used to call me Akka, then Aunty and now Paati,” chuckles Mrs. Leela Smart. “Most of the people in Tennur know me as Leela Teacher.” The 86-year-old former educator stays in a heritage cottage (one that she came to first as a tenant 56 years ago and her family went on to own eventually), but every line on her gentle face speaks of struggle and accomplishment.
Born in Musiri in 1928 as Irene Leelavathy James, Mrs. Leela was among the first batch of Secondary School Leaving Certificate (SSLC) students to train under the Emergency Course for Teachers at the All Saints Training School, Tiruchi, in 1946-47. “There was a severe shortage of teachers during the Second World War, so I decided to join the course after graduating from the C.S.I Girls High School in Thanjavur,” she says.
The trainees were put up in a hostel room at the old Bishop Heber College campus in Puthur. “We used always be a little hungry, because there were only eight ounces of food rations,” she recalls. “Once, I had come back from a match (the young Leela was a keen sportswoman), and had dozed off on my desk in class. Our principal Mrs. Ada Schubert woke me up with a gentle tap and said, ‘God will forgive you, but Time will not forgive you.’”
Those words have inspired her to stay alert all her life.

Always together

“Our marriage was one of the grandest in Thanjavur,” says Mrs. Leela, recalling the way she and her husband, Joseph Smart rode a decorated phaeton carriage after their wedding ceremony at St. Peter’s Church in 1952.
Mr. Smart (named by his father in tribute to the English organist Henry Thomas Smart) was working as a lower divisional clerk at the Railway Police office in Tiruchi. He was more famous as a virtuoso organist, having started playing at the age of 12 at St. Christopher’s Church in the Cantonment area.
“My husband was always involved in social work,” recalls Mrs. Leela. “He was on the board of directors of the Young Men’s Christian Association (YMCA) in Tiruchi and also an active secretary of Toc H (Talbot House, a Christian social service organisation founded in 1915 in Belgium).”
Managing on a modest salary (Mrs. Leela’s salary was Rs. 40 per month, while her husband earned Rs. 50) was not easy, but it had to be done. “Living in a joint family, we used to have a lot of guests, but I used to try and follow Mrs. Schubert’s advice of saving at least five rupees every month.”
Mrs. Leela’s third pregnancy in 1968, 12 years after marriage, was to prove to be a real test of her mettle. A tumour in her uterus was diagnosed at the same time, and treatment for it was not available even in Madras. But a greater setback was the stroke that left her husband paralysed on his right side. “We were both in the General Hospital (Puthur) at the same time,” recalls Mrs. Leela, “my husband was in the upstairs ward, being treated for his stroke, while I was admitted in the ground floor maternity ward.”
Fortunately a healthy baby was born by normal delivery to Mrs. Leela, who had to start taking care of her husband’s physiotherapy when her son was just 16 days’ old. “You didn’t have home nurses in those days,” she adds by way of explanation. “And anyway, I was determined to take care of my husband myself.”
The stroke only strengthened her husband’s resolve to rehabilitate himself, says Mrs. Leela. Taking a little over a year as medical leave, he rejoined the Railway Police as a file copy superintendent overseeing a pool of seven typists. “I’d help him to finish the correspondence after I returned from school,” recalls Mrs. Leela. Mr. Smart retired in 1975. He died in 1994.

Schooling past and present

After a short stint at teaching in Thanjavur, Mrs. Leela’s career post-marriage started off with her as an office clerk at the All Saints Middle School (now High School) in Puthur. “I used to help out Miss Mary Ruth Anstine with the office work, and then was shifted to teaching duty after one year.”
Mrs. Leela started off as ‘Tamil pundit’ for the girls-only Classes VI, VII and VII, but had to give it up in favour of a lighter workload of general subjects with the junior (co-educational) classes when she fell ill with pleurisy in 1956.
Teachers of her generation had to follow a strict dress code, says Mrs. Leela. “We’d always have to drape our saris modestly, and pin our pallu with a brooch. An umbrella and a wrist-watch were essential accessories, and we had to always wear our hair in a bun. Nowadays teachers dress more like their students,” she says.
Fees were in the range of one rupee to four rupees at All Saints, and to be paid by the 15th of every month. “There was a fine of one anna per rupee for defaulters. Once we spent two days figuring out why we had an extra anna in our account, and then realised that I had forgotten to underline a fine payment in the ledger with red ink,” laughs Mrs. Leela.
She doesn’t deny her sadness at the passage of time. “I turned down the opportunity to upgrade my degrees because of my husband’s illness, even though I did attend the re-training courses in the early 1960s. But I find students and teachers don’t really know subjects in depth these days even though they study a lot,” she says.
Quite a stickler for her principles (she took a vow to give up wearing jewellery since her husband fell ill in 1969), Mrs. Leela has been staying alone since 2005, next door to her elder son. “My father always used to say that we should never be a burden on our children in our old age, and should cultivate our own circle of friends. I am used to being by myself now, and though I don’t go out as much, there will always be someone looking out for me,” she says.
“Many generations of this area’s children have been taught by me,” says Mrs. Leela, who retired in May 1987. “Some them are senior doctors and government servants, and possibly a lot of them have become grandparents. I am so proud to have been a part of their life.”

She was the only legitimate child of the renowned poet Lord Byron, and was coaxed into mathematics and logic by her mother so as to not beget the same ‘insanity’ that Lord Byron had.
Her work brought her in touch with other renowned scientists like Michael Faraday and Charles Dickens. Much like her father, she too passed away at a young age.
Name this woman with a palindromic name, who was born this day 203 years ago?




Q2. Harry Colebourn was a cavalry veterinarian who purchased and rescued a black bear from a train stop on his way to volunteer to serve in World War I. He named it Winnipeg, after his hometown in Canada.
When he had to leave to France, he left it with the London Zoo, where it was adored by many for its playfulness and gentleness.
Among its fans was a little boy who loved the bear so much that he changed his teddy bear’s name from ‘Edward Bear’ to ‘Winnie.’
Who was this boy, who was also in popular consciousness a few months ago?




Q3. The origin of this phrase is believed to be from a play of Shakespeare, where he suggests to ‘threaten the threatener’ by performing this activity.
This phrase is often used to refer to retribution or revenge, similar to the phrase, “an eye for an eye.”
Apart from symbolisms and metaphors, this phrase actually indicates a method to try and end a specific type of disaster when it cannot be controlled by water or sand.
What is the phrase?




Q4. People of the Roman Catholic faith practise fasting on Fridays, abstain from eating flesh meat, and instead give alms to the poor and needy using the money that was to be spent on meat.
This saw the sales of hamburgers at McDonald’s go down drastically on Fridays. To attract customers on Fridays, Lou Groen, a McDonald’s franchise owner in Ohio, invented a new dish — one that didn’t contain flesh meat.
The composition of the dish has changed over time, but it essentially consists of a fried breaded ___ ____, a steamed bun, tartar sauce and American cheese.
What is this dish, which is available at McDonald’s stores worldwide?




Q5. This name was recently in the news when a Southwest Airlines employee mocked a child with this name, when she was travelling from California to Texas.
Surprisingly, this name is more common than people think, as it was discovered that there were 328 girls in the U.S. with this name. 
What is this alphabetical name, that is pronounced ‘ab-city’ or ‘ab-si-dee?’




Q6. According to Greek legend, the Titan Prometheus stole fire from the Gods to pass it on to man, symbolising the transfer and spread of knowledge, and was revered deeply for it. For this act, he was punished by Zeus by having a vulture eat his entrails for eternity.
To honour him, there exists a practice, that has been occurring since Ancient Greek times, at regular intervals of time, that references the gift given to mankind by Prometheus.
What is this practice, from the world of sport, that is televised and of great interest to global audiences?
ANSWERS:
A1. Lady Ada Lovelace.
A2. Christopher Robin, from A.A. Milne’s ‘Winnie the Pooh’ stories.
A3. Fighting fire with fire.
A4. Fish Fillet, aka the Filet-O-Fish burgers.
A5. Abcde.
A6. Lighting of the Olympic Torch, and keeping the flame lit till the end of the games.

Around the world with a camera
","There are those who click pictures while travelling and then there are those shutterbugs who travel to click the sights. Suraj Khan, Shiju S. Basheer, Sandeep Somasekharan and Venu Gopalakrishnan are some of those keen photographers who think nothing about hopping on a plane or revving up their cars and bikes in search of the next best shot. The shutterbugs talk to MetroPlus about their yen for travel photography.

Suraj Khan

“Every image has to tell a story,” says Suraj. Every other month Suraj travels the world to indulge his passion for photography. In fact, he’s just back from a photography-cum-business tour of Turkey. “The country’s unique juxtaposition of the old and the new – its heritage buildings, sculptures and culture, side by side with modern architecture and lifestyles – is a photographer’s dream,” explains Suraj. “On that note, Kerala too is a great destination for photography, particularly nature photography, because everywhere you go the greens and the blues make for striking frames. South East Asia, meanwhile, also has great scope for nature photography but its uniqueness lies in its street life that extends into the wee hours of the night. No where else in the world is street life more vibrant than in Cambodia, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam and the likes,” he says. Suraj, a management graduate who runs a travel business, has been interested in photography since his childhood days, particularly after his parents brought him a camera. “Thanks to my business, I’m able to travel for photography. I’ve always been interested in the play of light and colour. That’s why I call myself a ‘light’ photographer; I like capturing anything and everything, from landscapes and food to people and architecture.”

Shiju S. Basheer

Shiju is a firm believer in the phrase ‘a picture is worth a thousand words’. This keen photographer who plans “photo breaks” twice a year has trained his lens on several topics. While at first, “like most novices” he started out by shooting flowers and butterflies, he then graduated to capturing the life around him, especially the “culture and moods of the place and its people”.
Shiju’s fascination with photography began after watching a documentary on war photographer James Nachway. “The documentary captured my attention and I dreamt of being a photographer ever since. I love exploring different cultures, visiting strange places, meeting new people…. Some of these people I have met, fight to survive in extreme conditions,” says Shiju who has travelled to West Asia, Nepal and Vietnam, to name a few places, and more recently Ethiopia. “Before I plan my travels, I speak to friends who have visited the place and to fellow photographers to find out if there are possibilities for my intended frames. In Ethiopia, I have captured the Hamar people’s way of life.”
Shiju says travelling and photography has changed his perspectives on life and has gained him a lot of good friends across the globe.
He plans to travel to the Melanesian island of Vanuatu to study and capture the “Vanuatu tribal life.”

Sandeep Somasekharan

Sandeep’s shots abound with nature, animals at their candid best and landscape shots off the beaten track. “I like photographing the sights in uncharted territories, far flung places in the remotest corners of the country. The flora, fauna and the scenery in the Himalayas, the Rann of Kutch, picturesque Agumbe, near Madikkeri in Karnataka, or, Perumathura Pozhi, closer to home, for example,” says Sandeep, who often uploads his photos on Flikr or on popular environmental blog ‘The Green Ogre’.
“I’m the principal photographer of the blog. Until around two years ago a bunch of us from Green Ogre used to travel together. These days, I often go off on my own, armed just with my SLR camera,” he adds. It was while living in Mysore, eight or so years ago, that Sandeep, a techie who works at an MNC in the city, got interested in photography. “Mysore has a wealth of bird life and I got interested in bird watching and subsequently, bird photography,” says Sandeep.
These days he is also into minimalistic photography. “There is so much drama in a minimalistic shot. The best photographs are always instinctive shots, something that catches my eye, which I just feel would look good on frames,” he explains. Sandeep is off to the United States for an extended assignment this week. “The first thing in the suitcase was my camera!”

Venu Gopalkrishnan

Venu Gopalkrishnan is shooting in the Kanha National Park in Madhya Pradesh when I call him for an interview. Along with wildlife photographer Balan Madhavan and Belinda Wright, the shutterbug, who is wild about the wild, was happily clicking tigers and more.
Venu paints and sketches. Being a perfectionist, most of his works were left incomplete because he felt his paints could never capture all the reds of a sunset or the shades of greens of verdant forests. That is when he turned to painting with light – photography.
“As my father was a warden in the forest service, I have travelled to all the forests and wildlife sanctuaries in Kerala. Munnar, Thekkady, Wayanad, Rajamalai, Eravikulam .. Gavi is my favourite. Meeting Balan chettan's [Balan Madhavan] tips on photography gave me a flash of realisation into what wildlife photography was about,” says Venu.
Once the techie, who is CEO and founder of Litmus 7, amassed the financial muscle to bankroll his expeditions, his travels widened to wildlife sanctuaries in India and abroad. “In fact, I travel to click pictures,” he says. Kenya, Nepal and Spain were seen through his viewfinder as he trained his camera on flora and fauna.
The trip to Kenya was memorable because “we get to see encounters in the wild. Unlike dense forests in Kerala, in the grasslands, we get to see animals in flight, fights and feed modes. One of my favourite pictures is of two ostriches fighting,” he says. Next in focus is Antarctica.
Patience and luck, he says, are mandatory for wildlife photographers. While his camera is his companion for his trips abroad, he says that he has also managed to some great pictures around his home in Kochi.

Fixed or flexible?
"," You know that textbook picture of gears — wheels, spokes and plates that seem to be arranged in a perfect design that allows the wheels and spokes to turn? Some parts move, while others stay firmly in place, refusing to budge, even as the moving bits pull and push past them. It struck me that life’s a bit like that — it has things that remain constant and others that shift and change, elements that one simply has to accept, and others that can be altered. 
Some months ago, I had written about how it is important to understand the difference between a situation and a problem. A situation is something like those immovable, fixed parts of a machine, while a problem has both fixed and moveable parts, and the search for a solution is largely about identifying the latter and getting them to align with each other. Maybe not the best analogy,but it struck me that it could give us a way of getting through rough patches…or even just working our way through an everyday problem.
Break down components
It is useful to look at our lives at any given moment, in terms of these fixed and flexible components. There are some things that do not change, some that change with time (continuous but evolving factors), and some that can be controlled by us. If we are happy with the way things are and feel no anxiety, then, we may not need to fiddle with anything; changes will continue to balance with the needs naturally, as we go along. But if we are caught in a difficult situation, it helps to take it apart and see what these elements are, and which ones we can actually work on, rather than trying to push against the immovable ones which will refuse to budge and sap our energy, in the process.
Let’s take one kind of problem: a difficult college course that we seem to be stuck with. A refrain that we might often encounter is, “too bad, you are stuck with it, now deal with it”. But what exactly are you stuck with? How do you deal with it? You can pick apart the situation at various levels of detail. Let us assume, for now, that you do not want to walk away from the course, as it might involve giving up on the programme entirely, and an accompanying financial loss (apart from the disapproval of parents or others). So, the “immovable” factors might be —the course syllabus, instructor, schedule and location, and your presence and other academic requirements
There is no point wasting time complaining about these. The factors that are within your control include the effort you put in (inside and outside class), the help you seek, the resources (time, materials) you draw upon. These are the gears you need to move to make the output — satisfactory performance — happen.
In other situations, too, you can try to analyse the three kinds of elements so that you see where you can actually focus your energies, rather than worrying about those that you cannot change, or that arise from the larger circumstances. It is something like the serenity prayer, asking for wisdom to see the difference between the things you can change and those you cannot.

Mollycoddling the moonstruck ","What is the difference between ‘semi-monthly’ and ‘bimonthly’? (Mukesh, New Delhi)
The word ‘bimonthly’ is rather ambiguous; it has two very different meanings. A magazine that is published twice a month — i.e. every two weeks — can be called a ‘bimonthly’. The term, however, can also be used to refer to a journal or magazine that is published once in two months. Americans, in general, prefer ‘semi-monthly’, and they frequently use the word to mean ‘twice a month’.
We decided that the new publication was going to be a semi-monthly/bimonthly. 
What is the meaning and origin of ‘happy as a sandboy’? (Vinod Ghai, Amritsar)
This rather old-fashioned expression is mostly limited to British English; the idiom was quite popular till the 19th century. The original expression was ‘jolly as a sandboy’. When you say that someone is ‘happy as a sandboy’, what you are suggesting is that the individual is extremely happy about something. The idiom has more or less the same meaning as ‘happy as a clam at high tide’. In the old days, the word ‘boy’ was frequently used to refer to a man who did menial work; a male worker of low status. This probably explains why the men who look after cattle and work on ranches are called ‘cowboys’, and why men who work in hotels and carry people’s suitcases are called ‘bellboys’. Several centuries ago, sand was used as a form of floor covering in theatres, bars, houses, etc.; whenever someone spilt something or spit on the floor, the sand absorbed it. Sandboys were hired to spread the sand on the floor and also remove it at regular intervals. Though these individuals were seldom paid in cash, they always remained in excellent spirits — the free drinks that they received ensured they always remained happy.
Ramana was happy as a sandboy when the company promoted him.
He’s happy as a sandboy when his grandchildren play with him. 
What is the meaning of ‘moonstruck’? (G. Sailaja, Madurai)
Many people believe that the moon somehow influences the way human beings behave. There are many stories about how on a full moon night, some people transform into werewolves. When you say that someone is ‘moonstruck’, you are suggesting that the individual is acting in an odd manner — the person is in love and is therefore not himself; he is acting in a crazy or foolish manner.
Don’t pay any attention to Priya. She’s moonstruck.
When the actor stepped out of the club, moonstruck teenagers mobbed him.
How is the word ‘mollycoddle’ pronounced? (Nalini, Erode)
The first word rhymes with ‘jolly’, ‘volley’, and ‘poly’. The ‘cod’ in ‘coddle’ rhymes with ‘god’, ‘pod’, and ‘mod’, and the second syllable sounds like the ‘dle’ in ‘middle’ and ‘fiddle’. The word, which is mostly used to show disapproval, is pronounced ‘MO-li cod-el’ with the main stress on the first syllable of ‘molly’. When you mollycoddle your children, you are being overly protective. The word also suggests that you indulge them too much; in other words, you make sure that all their wants and demands are met. 
Like any grandmother, she took great delight in mollycoddling her grandchild. 
I don’t understand why the government is mollycoddling the power industry.

Sleep on it
"," The first class in the day can often be a fraught affair. Students may come bleary eyed and hungry, and teachers have to deal with yawns and glazed looks. I remember being distracted one entire semester by a student who sat in the front seat and more often than not, nodded off even before I could start speaking. As a young lecturer, I couldn’t help wondering if it was my fault. While the class may be redeemed by a minority that is wide awake and adequately fed, several sleepy students and an anxious or irritated teacher aren’t necessarily the ideal combination for learning.
Sleep deprivation is one of the major challenges for college students everywhere, and particularly so for those who live on residential campuses with a fair amount of freedom and no lights-out policy. Medical colleges and IITs are notorious for students pulling all-nighters for days at a stretch, sometimes using chemicals of various kinds to stay awake. In some cases, the workload is such that students feel compelled to push themselves to work long hours. But in others, it is more of a social pressure and that most millennial of anxieties — the fear of missing out — that makes sleep a low priority.
Quantity matters
Health writer Jane Brody, in a recent New York Times article, noted that adequate sleep is one of the most important markers of a successful college experience, citing studies that have shown that the quality and quantity of sleep are linked to academic performance. Most parents, when sending their adult children off to college, worry about the possibility of alcohol or drug abuse, and often spend a lot of time counselling them about such issues. Rarely, however, do we worry about abusing the circadian rhythm.
College can be an exciting time. The temptation to do it all, and stay awake through it all is just too great. The combination of social and academic demands can make the 24-hour day seem way too short. And then there is social media. The fact that libraries on many campuses stay open late makes it possible to work late, and so, students end up pulling all-nighters to complete papers or finish their reading. Outcome: those yawns and bleary eyes in morning classes.
There’s a certain romance associated with working late into the night, collaborating on projects over midnight chai and noodles, and these are certainly experiences that one wouldn’t want to argue away. But if one also has to be in a class early in the morning, too many of those late nights can become a problem. Of course, if you have a flexible schedule, you can catch up on your sleep in the day and be ready for another late night…but unfortunately, most academic institutions require students to show up during the day. Clearly, something has to give, and that something is usually your sleep. So why not choose your all-nighters — whether social or academic — and space them out, so that you give your body and mind the rest they need?

An exchange spree
","Perfectly predicting defects of designs in manufacturing, construction, and various biological aspects with attractive colour maps has always fascinated me and made me curious to know how it is done. That is why I was interested in pursing computational mechanics. 
I chose my undergraduate programme in Mechanical Engineering at SCSVMV, Kanchipuram, where things started to dawn upon me. Dr. Ratna Kumar Annabathula, Assistant Professor, IIT Madras, identified my interest towards Finite Elements as well as research. He encouraged me to pursue masters in computational mechanics through the programme called Erasmus Mundus. 
An Erasmus Mundus Joint Master Degree, is an integrated, international study programme, jointly delivered by an international consortium of higher education institutions. Subsequently, I applied and got selected in the Erasmus Mundus MSc in computational mechanics programme with funding which was more than enough to cover my monthly living expenses. 
The course is designed for students who wish to develop their knowledge in the field of computational mechanics with applications in solids, fluids, and other interdisciplinary fields. The programme also includes a component of entrepreneurship and innovation. 
It provides the skills for the modelling, formulation, analysis, and implementation of simulation tools for advanced engineering problems, as well as skills for understanding these approaches in the broader context of business and innovation. Mostly students may take the Master’s as a professional terminal degree, or in preparation for a Ph.D. 
This course is provided by international consortium of four leading European Universities in computational mechanics: Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya (UPC), Spain; Swansea University, the U.K.; Ecole Centrale Nantes (ECN), France; Universität Stuttgart, Germany.
One programme, two institutions
 Usually, students study in two universities: the first year in Barcelona, Spain or Swansea, the U.K.. The remaining two semesters will be spent at any of the other three institutions which is different from that of the first year. I did my first year at Swansea University and second year at UPC. Swansea University is considered as the birthplace for finite element analysis and its computational engineering department is named Zienkiewicz Centre for Computational Engineering after Professor Olgierd Zienkiewicz, who is the father of finite element methods. It is now lead by Professor Perumal Nithiarasu, an Alumni of IIT Madras. Both universities have excellent on-going research works and amazing teaching faculties. 
Swansea University, in particular, is very student-friendly. A faculty is appointed as a tutor who meets each student once in two weeks during which they can share all their personal and professional issues.
Also, being an exchange programme, students benefit from interacting with different groups of academics in an exciting international environment. It provides an amazing platform to understand different research collaborations happening in European universities.

Research for change
","A professor and his students at the Indian Institute of Technology - Madras (IIT-M) have developed a technology to remove arsenic from water and make it potable. Over a period of 10 years since the project began in 2008, the researchers have finally seen the benefits of their work on the ground. The technology developed by the Institute is being used widely in West Bengal and Punjab to eliminate arsenic from water.
In as many as eight to 10 states in the country, the groundwater contains a large amount of arsenic — a chemical that is a major health hazard causing an increase in cancer mortality rate. States such as West Bengal, Assam, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Nagaland, portions of Uttar Pradesh, Manipur and Punjab bear the brunt of arsenic deposits in water. In these states, the concentration of arsenic is as high as 200 parts per billion litres (ppb) when the permissible limit is only 10 ppb. Until recently, the only solution was installing reverse osmosis plants, which were expensive. 
Cost effective 
 IIT-M’s solution was to develop a material that can selectively absorb arsenic from water. “Over nine lakh units have been installed benefitting 70 lakh people,” says T. Pradeep, professor of chemistry at the Institute, who leads the research. In Punjab, using the same technology, around 10 million litres of clean water are currently being provided.
The cost of removing arsenic is less than two to five paise per litre of water, which is far less compared to the budget governments must allocate to put up reverse osmosis plants.
“What is clear from this data is that all forms of water quality situations spread across the country, in arsenic affected areas can be tackled by this technology.
 In places where there is a genuine desire to solve this menace, this solution is being implemented. We can confidently say that the arsenic menace can be wiped out from the country,” says Pradeep. 
Way forward
“Right now, we have only community scale units, but we are still developing the technology that would make it viable for domestic use,” says Ramesh Kumar Soni, an M.Tech student who is now involved in the project. 
The material developed by the IIT-M uses no chemicals and is “by the water, for the water”, according to him. Ramesh is excited about the project which won the Millennium Alliance Award. He is now improving upon the material that can be installed for domestic use.
A native of Rajasthan, Ramesh says that in his state the problem is fluoride in water. He would get to that issue at a later date as his specialisation is understanding contamination of groundwater.

Commit to yourself
","I am 22 years old and have completed B.E. in electrical and electronics engineering. I am good at aptitude and reasoning. So I decided to prepare for bank exams. But this is not the actual reason for my decision. My passion is cricket and I have represented my college. After that, I did not get a chance to showcase my talent. I have never represented my district or state. I am feeling lost. I belong to a middle-class family, and cannot afford to take the risk of pursuing my passion without any backup, since we have only one earning member. I can get a job in my domain which will give me income to invest in my passion. But, I fear that once I get into the job, I will never be able to pursue my passion. Please help. — Anand R.
Dear Anand,
 Your clarity is so profound. I understand your dilemma. Cricket, in our country, is not a sport but a religion. It is almost impossible to make it to the big league without having exceptional skills and having tasted some success across district and state levels. Securing a job in your own domain and saving up to pursue your passion, as a serious, steady hobby seems to be the best plan going forward. You only need to make sure that playing cricket will become a non-negotiable commitment that you promise yourself as a self-care ritual and will find the ‘me time’ to pursue it irrespective of a busy work life. 
I am 20 years old and currently in B.A. second year. I am confused between a career as a civil servant and an MBA. I feel that if I pursue MBA and get a decent paying job, I can settle down soon and also have a backup while attempting the civil services exam later. But I am least interested in preparing for CAT because of the subjects involved. I could not score well in my class XII boards either, due to which my selection into the IIMs is difficult. I am in a dilemma about whether I should opt for coaching for the civil service exam or CAT as I just have a year left. Please help me. — Anushka Rao
Dear Anushka,
You seem to be sitting on the fence with two difficult choices — coaching for the civil services versus CAT preparation. It is interesting that you say you aren’t really interested in the CAT but keen as it will ensure you getting a job sooner than making it to the civil services and once you have a job, you can prepare for the civil services. I am not sure if that is the right criteria for selection. Please understand that both are tough exams and rightfully have a gruelling preparation procedure.
What do you see yourself doing in life at 25? What do you want to be and what do you enjoy the most? Please make your choice based on that and not merely on what is easy and doable and what isn’t. Every job, career, and work schedule, however interesting, has some percentage of boring tasks and that doesn’t matter once you enjoy most of what you choose in life, as it brings immense happiness and joy to you.
I am a B.Tech student currently in my seventh semester. I am interested in joining IAF as a pilot. I fulfil all the requirements for being a pilot but there is only one issue — I have scored less than 60 in math in class XII (CBSE). Kindly guide me on how I can amend this since I am keen on achieving my goal. — Vaidehi Sharma
Dear Vaidehi,
It is indeed an honour to join the IAF as a pilot. Please apply for your class XII math exam privately and secure a good score to ensure that the process is smooth. 
I was so passionate about getting into St. Stephen’s that I worked 10 times harder than I ever had in my school life but, unfortunately I only managed to get about 90% which broke me so much that I didn’t even fill the admission form. I didn’t take admission in any other DU college and settled for Central University of Karnataka which doesn’t have a great faculty or any societies. I am helpless; I don’t know if I should waste one year and apply for other universities next year or stay here and waste the three most important years of my life. I am desperately looking for some advice. — Meha Gupta
Dear Meha,
I am so sorry that you had to go through this. What do you want to do? What course and what subjects do you wish to study? 90% is a good score, but yes, perhaps not sufficient to warrant admissions to St. Stephen’s or DU. So what? There are a lot of other good colleges across the country that would love to have you with that score. Why would you want to waste this score and your talent? I would urge you to meet a good career counsellor who can profile your choices and help you select and shortlist a course of your choice at the earliest. Good things await you; please move quickly.

Surging interest in study abroad
","“No overseas experience is more powerful or more meaningful than education,” said the U.S. Consul General Jennifer McIntyre. She was speaking at the inauguration of The Hindu Education Plus International Education Fair. The fair, which is now in its seventh year, opened in Chennai on May 3, at the Taj Coromandel.
Speaking on the relevance of studying abroad, Ms Mac Intyre said,”There is no greater influence on international understanding – and through it on peace and progress – than that which comes from the opportunities for people of different countries and cultures to meet each other and spend time in each other’s countries.”
Despite fluctuations in the rupee, an international education has remained popular in the last few years. If the U.S. has about 100,000 Indian students pursuing higher studies, Holland has close to a 1000. This growing interest in going abroad for studies was evinced by the number of countries that had put up stalls there: U.S.A., the U.K., Russia, Canada, Australia, Malaysia, Singapore, Dubai, France, Poland, Sweden and Latvia included. There were about 60 stalls in all.
Ms Nirmala Lakshman, Director of Kasturi and Sons Ltd. said “
The Hindu, with its commitment to building partnerships in education, is happy to take part in the fair.”
Apart from education providers, the fair also saw the participation of banks and airlines which offered special packages for students Indian Overseas Bank partnered in the fair with its offer of education loans for students; British Airways was the official airlines partner; Thomas Cook the Travel and Forex partner and Radio one the radio partner.
Seminars were held by country representatives from all countries.

Tiding over dilemmas
"," I am 22 and have completed my graduation in physics from Delhi University, two years back. After that, I worked in an IT company, but resigned, in order to prepare for government exams. Meanwhile, I have developed a taste for history (archaeology, to be precise) and thinking of pursuing it as career. Is it a good career option keeping in mind that there are very few job opportunities in this field? Where do should I start? I mean should I enroll in undergrad or postgraduate courses as both the options are open, and most of the universities ask for a bachelor’s degree to get admission into M.A Archeology? Which universities can I apply to? Please advise me on this. Thanks and regards, — Roshan Kumar
Dear Roshan,
 What I understand is that you have developed a taste in archaeology (with a background in Physics) and would want to work in that field (as a researcher / teacher/ lecturer?) and/or become an archaeologist? To become a successful archaeologist, you first need to obtain a graduate degree, preferably in history, sociology, or anthropology — to get a deeper understanding of the subject. Further, check the admission and the eligibility criteria for related PG courses — Maharaj Sayajirao University of Baroda, offers a three- years bachelor’s degree in Indian History, Culture and Archaeology. Banaras Hindu University, offers two undergraduate courses — a three-years honours programme in ancient Indian history, culture and archaeology, and a three-years vocational programme in Museology and Archaeology. Then there is The Institute of Archaeology under the aegis of Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), New Delhi, which conducts a two-year post graduate diploma in archaeology. 
Jobs with Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) are available both at the centre and the state-levels. Postgraduates qualify for lectureship in various universities across the country. The National Eligibility Test (NET) or the Junior Research Fellow (JRF)-Lectureship examination is a prerequisite for the same. Success in JRF paves way paves the way to a for a doctorate degree in the capacity of a paid research fellowship.
What do you want to do? Are you sure this is what you want, and not just a fancy that you are smitten by right now? Identify and gain complete clarity on what you want first. Meet a competent career counsellor to affirm that you have the aptitude and the attitude (plus personality) for this career choice. All the best to you!
I am unable to talk to people while looking them in the eye. I try my best to stay confident, but I feel uncomfortable. I also want to bond with them, but I don’t know how. Over socializing gives me headaches, literally. Should I seek medical help.— Anonymous
Dear Anonymous,
The inability to look at people in the eye whilst talking could be due to an array of reasons. Maybe you don’t like to socialise and genuinely seek solace. The person at the receiving end, however, might feel that you think, you are ‘better off’, ‘smarter’ or have a ‘higher social standing’ than him or her. This can beembarrassing for you and demeaningfor the latter. It can create disturbance in friendships and relationships.
It can also stem from the fact that you have not organised your thoughts well, or you don’t want to share much — you say too much or too little and make a mess of the communication. The pressure for this ‘performance’ itself must create so much anxiety that it must be nightmarish to meet people. Friends can also feel offended and uncomfortable. You will greatly benefit from a therapist who specialises in behaviour modification, or a coach who can teach you this art.
I am 17 and I have just completed class XII. I am passionate about science and I want to pursue a related career. Ever since class X, I have always wanted to join IISER. But , I need to have a high percentile in the class XII board exam, about which I am unsure of. So, I have decided to try for medical entrance examinations, instead. But to prepare within this short period and being a person who has never attended any coaching, cracking the exams seems almost impossible. Meanwhile, I cracked the JEE Mains, but engineering is not my cup of tea. I am also thinking of going for a repeat, but my family is against the idea. Is going for repeat a good idea?I also have this issue with confidence. At times, I feel like I am good for nothing. Please guide me — Ankita.
Dear Ankita,
Congrats on cracking the JEE mains.What was the ranking? You certainly don’t need to repeat the year. I am assuming that you wrote this email before your class XII results were announced and the uncertainty caused you all this anxiety and fear. What was your class XII score? You can easily apply to IISER. 
There are three channels of admission to IISER. The first is Kishore Vaigyanik Protsahan Yojana channel where candidates having a valid KVPY fellowship commencing from 2018-19 academic session are eligible to apply for admissions. Additional cut-off criteria may be applicable. The next option is Joint Entrance Examination of Indian Institutes of Technology (JEE) channel where candidates in General category, securing a rank within 10,000 in the Common Rank List of JEE Advanced 2018 are eligible to apply. For candidates belonging to reserved category (OBCNC, SC, ST, PD), their category rank should be within 10,000. Third, State and Central Boards Channel (SCB) channel where students who have passed (10+2) level with science stream in 2017 or 2018 with marks equal or above the cut-off percentage in their respective boards as given (CBSE - 88.3, ICSE - 93.3, National Institute of Open Schooling (NIOS) - 83.6) are eligible to apply. For candidates belonging to the Other Backward Classes (OBCNC) and Persons with Disability (PD) categories, there is a 5% relaxation. The cut-off percentage for the Scheduled Castes (SC), the Scheduled Tribes (ST) and Kashmiri Migrants (KM) candidates is 55% in (10+2) level for all boards.
Please get in touch with IISER institutes and get on with your admissions.
I am going to class X. I am concerned as to what to opt for in my intermediate. I want to study psychology and become a forensic psychologist, but I don’t know what to do after class X. Please help — Grace Advitiya
Dear Grace,all the very best for your class X. What board are you studying in? 
I think you would enjoy a B.Sc. in forensic sciences. A prerequisite for admissions would be PCM/PCB with psychology if possible, across your XI and XII. Also, please read the link given below; it will give you a course overview.

The problem of burning out ","Over 10 lakh students attempt JEE (Joint Entrance Exam) every year. Only if one manages to get the top 3,000 to 5,000 ranks, (0.01% of the total students) will one be able to get a popular branch in the top five to six IITs. Thus, most students, however good they are, will not make it. Three to four lakh students also drop one year to prepare exclusively for JEE. 
Most good students in top schools have stopped attending Class XI and XII, as they seriously study for JEE, to the exclusion of everything else. We are thus producing a unidimensional work force. In addition, most undergraduates in every engineering college are burnt out.
Lateral entry 
I propose a solution to the JEE issue through an exclusive lateral entry approach into IITs. This will result in the following benefits:
1. Postponement of JEE advanced preparation to colleges, leaving school students alone. 
2. Ensuring that IITs conduct their own admission exams, thereby ensuring fairness.
3. Keeping the number of B.Tech graduates through IITs small, only twice of what they produce now.
4. Ensuring that only those who like engineering get into IITs. 
I propose that B.Tech admissions into IITs happen in the third year, after students spend two years in engineering colleges. After getting admission into IITs, these students may complete the education of III and IV years, and graduate with a B.Tech degree. It may be a joint degree with the institution that trained them in the first two years of B.Tech.
The entrance exam will be based on the first two years of engineering and science courses that one normally undergoes at the IITs. The syllabus for these exams will be based on the excellent NPTEL (National Programme on Technology Enhanced Learning) video courses, freely available to all. If NPTEL videos can be dubbed into all 22 Indian languages, quality study material will be within the reach of motivated students, rich or poor, urban or rural. 
The IITs may also mandate that all students who aspire to join the B.Tech course must know how to write at least one working computer programme. Although I mentioned only the IITs, other top institutions such as BITS Pilani and ICT (formerly UDCT) can be included in the above indicated mentoring list. Colleges that routinely send many of its students to the IITs can themselves move over to this mentoring group. 
As the portion for the exams is clearly defined, students will know what to study. Help can be given by the IITs to help clear doubts of students. IIT Bombay has successfully been running a programme ‘Ask a Question’ through which its professors have been answering students’ questions. 
This activity, spearheaded by the best teachers from all established institutions, can provide free of cost, the extra help a bright student needs, to make the cut. 
Joint mentoring
Many of the heads of departments at IIT Bombay gave their personal view that students selected in the manner proposed in this article will do at least as well as the current students. 
The IITs can be encouraged to closely work with colleges that send their best students: teacher training, joint guidance of students, joint master’s degree, applying for project grants, and so on. These colleges may also get higher ranking in accreditation and NIRF (National Institutional Ranking Framework) evaluations.
JEE Main will be conducted more or less in the same manner as we do now. Once all top level colleges and the IITs are selected to do the mentoring work, there could be 100 to 200 comparable colleges at the next level, with a total of about 50,000 seats. It should be easy for a good school student to get into any of these seats without extraordinary preparation. It will also be possible for a student to pick and choose a branch of his/her choice.
JEE Main may be kept comparatively simple; as not much distinction needs to be made amongst these 50,000 students. It would then be possible to reduce the syllabus of Class XI and XII, which the government has been trying to do for quite some time. School students will get a lot of free time, to play, create art forms, participate in social work, prepare for science olympiads, and so on.
The science departments of the IITs, freed from the teaching load, can work with smart school students, desirous of carrying out science research. It will also not be necessary for school students to drop a year to prepare for the JEE Main.

All about learning virtual reality "," We are in an era of digitisation. Technological advancements have an impact on almost every aspect of our lives on a daily basis, right from the way we communicate to how businesses are run. 
The impact of digitisation is also visible in the field of education and has effected major changes in how education is being imparted and consumed. Rote learning and reliance on printed material or book-based learning is fast becoming a thing of the past. A new era requires a recalibration of the education curricula to cater to new and emerging needs. Virtual Reality or VR has managed to do just that. 
Transcending barriers 
Though the use of books and other traditional tools have not been completely replaced as yet, VR technology has delivered an effective means through which digitisation and audio-visual aids can be more effectively harnessed to address current requirements of education and required outcome.
VR uses software-generated digital environment that allows a seemingly realistic interaction with simulated contents through VR-enabled headsets and embedded sensors. This medium has emerged as the ultimate in delivering digital contents as it gives way to an immersive learning experience. A learner can explore an archaeological site or explore the human anatomy right from within the classroom itself. 
The proliferation of smart phones and tablets capable of delivering VR contents and the reducing cost of VR headsets has made wide scale consumption of VR contents much more accessible to the masses. Though other digital formats such as PowerPoint, smart classrooms, audio/visual rooms, projectors etc., have been in use for quite some time now in education, none of them comes close to the immersive experience that VR delivers.
One of the highpoints associated with VR is that it transcends all logistical barriers of the real world. Students can walk the ocean floors or interact with the solar system from within the safety of their schools or colleges. In fact, VR can be effectively utilised in the training field as well, be it surgical training in medicine or understanding the working of complex machines. Training can be imparted in real world conditions without any associated risk through VR simulations. 
As opposed to passive learning through observation or listening, the simulated hands-on approach in VR has proven to be more effective in knowledge retention and VR contents can be re-used over and over again to reinforce key learnings. Other important outcomes of VR in education are increase in student’s motivation, improved knowledge absorption and classroom practices, etc.
It is therefore not surprising that the adoption of VR in the field of education is soaring. The traditional text books and digital aids will continue to co-exist for the foreseeable future. The technology associated with virtual reality itself is evolving and promises an exciting future. 
New technologies may emerge and new digital solutions may be invented but it is highly unlikely that any new intervention will have as much effect and supersede the role played by VR in revolutionising education.

Do I really care?
"," Laughter and yells erupted at the table near ours at dinner in a restaurant. It didn’t seem to make the slightest difference to those diners that there were others in the same place trying to enjoy their evening out. 
In the life-plan of some people, no one else counts. 
Just once, observe how you become invisible in a corridor. A woman advancing from the opposite direction moves as if you do not exist. In other words she doesn’t have to recognise your presence and you therefore step aside to avoid collusion. What you realise after that split-second ‘encounter’ — if you can call it that — is that the other individual has not moved even ten centimeters to avoid crashing into you. Zero adjustment on the part of X and maximum on the part of Y (yourself).
Was it always so or is a rise in displays of poor manners and rudeness in public — be it a jumping a queue, callousness towards the elderly or grabbing a restaurant table — suddenly more marked? It is matched only by its close cousin in the scale of inhumanity: indifference. 
Root cause
 One is particularly astonished at the indifference to rules on our roads. A two-wheeler will drive so close to you that you can smell the driver or he will cut right in front of your car moving laterally to the other side of the road uncaring of the danger and inconvenience to you. If they get home safely it is only because drivers of cars struggle not to hit them. And if at all they meet your glance it is with eyes of stone: so cold and unfeeling are they as they break the rules and cause the person at the wheel great stress. In an unspoken understanding between two-wheel drivers, they will not frustrate one another only the rest of the public. Where does this indifference to the rest of the population come from? My guess is that it comes from deep-seated unexpressed anger and a need to feel superior in some way to the rest of the world and to make everybody else feel inferior; not to mention putting them at risk. For them the rest of the world on the same road might just as well not be there. That a city is filled with strangers is probably at the root of this situation. Politeness and courtesy are expensive in terms of time and the withdrawal of these marks of civility are therefore expressed in a form of indifference.
Another kind of indifference is not lack of feeling but a lack of imagination when it comes to recognising that another person is in distress. It does not occur to us that we ought to take notice. In the preface to his autobiography the rickshaw-driver-cum- writer Manoranjan Byapari wrote: “Here I am. I know I am not entirely unfamiliar to you. You’ve seen me a 100 times. Yet if you insist that you do not recognise me…take a look outside your window. You’ll see a bare-bodied goatherd running behind his cows and goats with a stick. You’ve seen this boy many times. That is me and my childhood.”
When will this boy be free?
Responsibility
 Two important events in our freedom struggle took place in September and both because people refused to be indifferent. The first was on September 25, 1916 when Annie Besant started another Home Rule League and the second was the Second Round Table conference on September 7.
Let us remember those who were not indifferent. They acted because they felt responsible for people they did not even know.

Double your chances
","The National Testing Agency (NTA) has come out with a two-pronged Joint Entrance Examination (JEE)-Main for 2019. Compared to many other programmes, like the AIEEE in 2002, by CBSE, this scheme seems to be wholesome and a result of more mature planning.
The first factor of appreciation is to have complete sessions of the online test. All candidates will have to answer the same set of questions, as against the system like National Aptitude Test in Architecture (NATA), where each candidate will be served a different set of questions, randomly selected by a computer.
However, the different sessions will have different sets of questions, which may result in differences in the difficulty levels in the questions. This anomaly is proposed to be tackled by NTA by normalising a procedure which is simple, effective and acceptable to all. It consists of computing the percentiles of candidates in each mark list, leading to preparation of percentile rank lists, all of which will be merged to yield a single percentile rank list. (Ties will be resolved by standard methods).
Two chances
For the JEE 2019, NTA proposes two tests, one in January and the other in April. The intention is, if the first test is missed by a candidate for some reason, the second can be taken, without having to wait for a year. There are some areas where further improvement is possible. NEET 2019 will also be held in May. In practice, every student will prefer attempting both the January and April exams of JEE. Many will also attempt NEET. Thus, the students’ exertion on these entrance tests will be more than before, resulting in less attention to board exams, which may lead to reduced proficiency in the basics of physics, chemistry, math/biology. Further, both JEE and NEET test the candidate’s knowledge in physics and chemistry which are commonly learnt at the same level, by the candidates. Therefore testing in these subjects twice is redundant, causing avoidable strain to students. 
A scheme that was adopted in the Tamil Nadu Professional Courses Entrance Examinations (TNPCEE) that was being held until 2006, could be emulated. Accordingly, a common test pattern for (one set of) JEE and NEET can consist of a paper I on physical sciences (physics + chemistry), a paper II on math and a paper III on biology. Each paper can be of two-hours, all the three scheduled for one day, constituting one ‘session’, online. Admission authorities for JEE and NEET will consider the results of candidates in Papers I and II, or papers I and III, accordingly. This programme is plausible since the same agency, namely, NTA will be conducting both exams.

Immersive learning
"," Having secured offers from the best universities in the U.K., I was juggling between them before finally deciding on Newcastle University. In this ultra-modern era, it is imperative to understand rapidly evolving and agile businesses, innovation, technology, and operations, and further apply the acquired knowledge in one’s professional career. Being tripled accredited and among the top business schools in the world, Newcastle University, through its MBA course, offers essential opportunities to enhance skills and create good leaders. 
Quality training 
The course is well-structured, and some of the best academicians in the world impart quality academic training. The modules are linked well with and can be effectively applied to real-world challenges, workshops and more. MBA students are given priority for major leadership events, to enable networking with reputed organisations, speakers and leaders. The cohort of students is diverse, comprising experienced professionals from across the world. They bring expert insights to the table, enabling me to continuously expand my knowledge.
Coping
Life in Newcastle is happening — the city and the university are highly rated by students for the lifestyle and cost of living. Being an international student, I was always in a dilemma about coping with a different way of living and mingling with foreign students. However, my worries disappeared quickly. There are ample Indian food chains, restaurants and supermarkets with items at reasonable prices. The weather is cold, with temperatures even dipping to -3°C at times. We get the opportunity to engage in fun activities and social work, which are either organised or supported by the students’ union. I have learnt a lot, something I will cherish for a lifetime.

Get hands-on
"," Everyone has heard ‘experience needed’ while applying for jobs. However, what is confusing is how one could be a fresh graduate and have experience. A lot of students get caught in this dilemma and struggle to escape this vicious circle. A solution could be internships and part-time jobs.
Internships, is one of the best and the worst things that can happen to a student. While some of them are paid, others are not. However, an internship will always help you gain experience and add a lot to your CV too. 
Training
While theory classes help us understand the basics, internships and work experience help us learn about the real world through the ‘on-job training’ technique. While choosing a career option, one needs to take care that whatever one chooses, is going to be their daily work for a few years at least. Therefore, one should always be sure of what they want to do before they start hunting for jobs. In order to be sure, it is always helpful to first work as an intern for a while. “If you wish to know the nuances of any field, do an internship during your college life. I would recommend that internships should be a part of the course curriculum,” said Kush Kalra, Advocate, Delhi High Court.
Bhavna Batra, Assistant Professor, Amity Law School, feels that everyone “needs experience to get experience. Finding a job can be difficult if one does not have an experience. Internships are protracted towers to capture and attain valuable experiences and encourage the interns to acquaint themselves with the terrain they are interested in.”
No more coffee
Ashina Khurana, who interned for two and a half years during her three years of Bachelors shared her experience, “When I started to look for internships, five years back, it was difficult to get something suitable. And this meant compromising to get anything rather than what you wish for. But now it is easy. And thanks to social media and some internship related websites it has paved the path for students.” Talking about the same, Bhavna feels that the intern world has drastically changed as they can play an indispensable and integral role in bringing crisp and contemporary notions on the table.”
No job is small
While the people in West have never been shy of getting a part-time job in a supermarket or a diner, Indians have often assumed that these are jobs performed by people who belong to families of ‘lower income groups’ only. The youngsters are now trying to break out of this mind-set, calling all jobs as equal.
Naman Vasal, who is now a Business Development Manager, recalls his experience . “I wanted to work in a supermarket in India to earn money instead of asking for pocket money but to no avail. Not a very graceful job in society for someone whose father makes a decent amount to raise the kid.”
With the concept of part-time jobs and work experiences garnering attention, students get to learn various qualities and abilities that they fail to learn within the confines of a classroom. In order to develop communication skills, time management and so on its important to broaden our minds and take up jobs that break stereotypes.

Driving innovation
"," Higher education is booming as governments across the world fuel their knowledge economies with skilled graduates. India is no exception. However, like many other countries, India has a shortage of places and a mismatch between graduate skills and what is needed to power economic growth and jobs creation. Foreign universities have a role to play in meeting these challenges, but they must help raise quality as well.
The way forward
The willingness of the Indian Government to open up opportunities for foreign universities would be a commendable step as it strives to increase the number of university places and drive up quality. But India also needs innovation in education. Indian youth needs people, places and ideas that drive innovation, such as practice-based teaching methods and unique ways of conducting classes. The creativity that comes from the students just needs the right push to help them achieve their goal.
 A robust registration of outcomes on a national platform will help in understanding the virtual success of all efforts. For example, British higher education is admired across the globe for its high academic standards and the autonomy of its universities — autonomy which India is only just starting to recognise as crucial to high standards of scholarship. Good regulation can raise quality and encourage innovation, while also creating opportunities for Indian students to study for British degrees in India.
Allowing foreign universities to develop expertise and exchange knowledge in academic collaborations can be a great mutual advantage for Indian students, which will certainly help expanding in-country provision and bringing in innovation, ideation and niche knowledge.
For example, Middlesex University London’s academic partnership with KM Music Conservatory in Chennai, founded by A. R. Rahman, enables students to experiment with fusions of Indian and Western music techniques. Students who complete their diploma at the Conservatory can progress to a full honours degree at Middlesex in London, but that should not be their only option. With KR Mangalam University, Middlesex is planning mutual recognition of degree programmes, joint degrees, mentoring, student and staff exchanges, internships and summer courses. 
Options
India should welcome discussing similar partnerships with other high quality institutions. While many Indian students want the incredible experience of studying and working in foreign countries, many others want a less expensive or more convenient option of achieving a prestigious, skills-based degree in India. Others will opt for a combination of local and overseas study.
Education is the key to economic and social progress, from high value-added industries to social justice and empowerment. While governments need to be vigilant of the practices that institutions are adopting, each institution must come up with a self assessment mechanism by unlocking the job market with the help of foreign universities. To develop and maintain the Indian education model, a working plan can metamorphose into an iconic programme that will last as a model to follow for years to come.

Take the plunge
","Akshaypat Singhania, belonging to the fourth generation of the illustrious Singhania family, balances two worlds: the old and the new. He shapes his businesses with an eye on the future while up-keeping the vision and repute of the generations past. 
Currently the Chairman and MD of JK International, he was instrumental in the launch of Park Avenue, as part of Raymond Apparel. As part of JK Files and Tools, he warded off the Chinese threat through innovative cost engineering. He has experienced similar success in cement and engineering businesses of the group. He is at present involved with setting up business ventures in high growth industries such as finance, venture capital, private equity, wealth management, and angel investing.
Singhania chats with EDGE about his take on today’s graduates, the changing business scenario, and preparing for the family business.
How well-prepared are today’s graduates for the corporate world?
Today’s fresh graduates would be much more confident in their communication skills because they are products of the communication age. However, this does not necessarily mean they are prepared for the real world. While digital chats and texting work on campus, work communication is very different. Students should be trained accordingly. Universities must focus more on soft skills and meta-learning to prepare students for the ever-changing workplace instead of concentrating on a fixed syllabus. Essential skills cannot be learned by reading or talking about them; they must be practised.
What, would education for the current generation of learners encompass?
Some schools in India are talking about developing 21st century skills in children, but these schools are not advanced enough. For instance, all schools have closed classrooms where children are listening to a teacher. But, at work, nobody sits in a closed room and listens to one person all the time. To really change the education system, India needs to build new schools from the ground up with new learning spaces; where students work in groups on projects with the teacher acting as a guide rather than a content expert; and where school life and life after school are bridged. Schools must inculcate four skills: creativity, critical thinking, communication, and collaboration. 
How much has the Indian business scenario changed from when you started out to now?
With nearly 500 million internet users, India represents a digital economy with the biggest market potential for global players. India has shown promise and leadership in digital technologies over the past decade. Going forward, businesses should aim to bridge the gap between rural and urban India so we can all grow together. With Blockchain technology and artificial intelligence, we can have real-time participation, safer and smoother transactions, and a better-organised working environment. 
How different should one’s education, learning, or preparation be when entering a family business?
The three most important skills are entrepreneurship, leadership, and succession. Educating the next generation about the family business can be key to strengthening the bonds between the family and the business. This helps to build a sustainable, long-term vision for future generations and create a platform for sharing experiences within the family. Also, it’s important that people gain exposure in other countries and this experience can definitely help.
What are the unique challenges faced in a family business and how much of it can be tackled through the right, focused education?
The challenges faced by today’s family businesses are greater than ever: a more turbulent environment dominated by pluralistic social values, intensified competition, a global economy, and rapidly-changing politics and regulation. This is when education and experience can make you more adaptable to the work environment and you learn to manage the vulnerable situations at work. 
What do you value more — education or experience?
The right education and experience go hand in hand. For instance, while studying, you can apply for internships and gain knowledge and experience in the sector you want to work in. Hence, the fresher is exposed to large roles and opportunities in the real world and can tackle them once he/she joins the business as a full-time employee.

When work is a chore no more
","There is a song that’s been stuck in my head for a few days now, a childhood favourite: “In every job that must be done, there is an element of fun….” 
Much like a “spoonful of sugar makes the medicine go down”, you have to find the “fun” aspect of a job to make it easier to deal with. The grey-suited governess — Mary Poppins — gets a pair of unenthusiastic children to finish their chores by showing them how “a song can move the job along”.
But — I hear you say — not all jobs can be moved along with a song. There are many that are absolutely no fun, where the only pleasure is that of completion. How does one find that “element of fun” where none exists? Or, to put in a different way, how can one inject fun into a dull chore?
Let’s take college assignments, for instance. Sometimes, the assignment takes on a life of its own and becomes an enjoyable exercise just because of the subject matter, or because you find the topic interesting. But what if it is for a course that you have found dead boring, or one that you have no real engagement with? What can you do that lights a spark and makes the process more bearable? Almost all topics can be looked at through a variety of lenses and interpreted in multiple ways. Look for a way to link the boring subject with something that you are interested in. For instance, if you are a football fan, you can use the sport to speak to a number of concepts in science, marketing, history, and so on. If you enjoy keeping up with fashion, you can do the same — the industry depends on a whole range of processes and partnerships — materials science, adaptability to climate, aesthetics, and yes, even math.
Team work
Of course, this approach may not always be feasible, as some assignments are specific and do not allow you room for such interpretation. Another way of bringing relief to tedious or difficult work is to pool resources with a friend — what in common parlance is called “joint study”. Agree to work together in a way that motivates you — take short “chat breaks” to compare notes, egg each other on, and share ideas as you work, and give feedback on progress. Group assignments are usually structured in a way that you need to work with others, and this can be fun and well as productive, as you are combining ideas and keeping each other on track. Work becomes a shared project, not a burden you alone have to bear.
For some people, playing music helps them focus and release the tensions related to meeting deadlines, or addressing quality and completeness. In fact, music has been used even by surgeons in operating rooms, because it helps steady the nerves and achieve a working rhythm. This may not be true for all of us, of course, and for some, music is actually distracting, so you have to figure out which group you belong to!
Ultimately, the real fun is in getting the work done, in knowing that you have accomplished the task. But when the road seems long and hard, it doesn’t hurt to look for ways to make the journey not just bearable, but also enjoyable.

ETS to no longer provide TOEFL, TOEIC tests for UK visa
","Dealing a blow to many visa aspirants especially students, British authorities have said global testing giant ETS will no longer offer TOEFL and TOEIC tests for U.K. visa-granting purposes, in the wake of a recent controversy.
Following allegations in a BBC programme in February this year that fraudulent measures were adopted by candidates to obtain Test of English for International Communication (TOEIC) accreditation, the British Home Office has announced that its contract with the global testing giant — Education Testing Service (ETS) — will not be extended.
As per the U.K. Council for International Student Affairs’ official website, “ETS is no longer providing TOEIC and TOEFL tests for people who want to use them in support of U.K. immigration applications. This is because of allegations of fraud.”
“The Home Office has been investigating the allegations of fraud and decided that in future it will change the list of English language test certificates that are acceptable in support of U.K. immigration applications. So that ETS tests are not included,” it says.
The ETS has confirmed this news on its Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) website.
“Following the broadcast of a BBC Panorama programme in February 2014 which highlighted an organised element seeking to circumvent the U.K.’s visa-granting process, ETS has made the decision not to extend our Secure English-language Testing (SELT) licence with the Home Office. As a result, TOEIC and TOEFL iBT testing will no longer be offered for U.K. visa-granting purposes,” ETS said in a statement on its website.
However, the organisation said, “The fraud uncovered by the BBC programme was limited to TOEIC testing,” and the security of TOEFL was not questioned.
“The fraud uncovered by the BBC programme was limited to TOEIC testing. Security measures around the TOEFL test were never under question,” the statement said.
The U.K. Council for International Student Affairs has advised students who use ETS tests in their immigration applications to take other English proficiency tests approved by the Home Office, or to contact the advisors at their education institutions for assistance.
The TOEFL test remains the most widely respected English-language test in the world recognised by more than 9,000 institutions in more than 130 countries.

‘Half-baked decision’ "," On deputation from the School of Education, Indira Gandhi National Open University, CB Sharma, current Chairman of the National Institute of Open Schooling gets candid about distance education in India.
Recently, the Distance Education Bureau (DEB) of the University Grants Commission (UGC) de-recognised many distance-learning courses, including several at IGNOU. Your view?
The UGC acts like big brother without the requisite expertise and is damaging the system and the interest of the learners who otherwise cannot attend regular education. Till 2013, the Distance Education Council constituted under the IGNOU Act was looking after the promotion and coordination of the open university and distance education system. It was a full-fledged body with more than 50 people. When it was merged with the UGC, it became the DEB, comprising less than half-a dozen-people. Given that distance education handles about 30% of the learners of higher education in India, it needs an independent, expert agency. 
So you are not in favour of the decision?
I agree that distance education in India needs an overhaul, and some courses and open universities de-recognised by the UCG deserved. India has around 15 open universities and hundreds of traditional universities that have a distance education wing. Many of these function simply as certifying agencies. So, such an exercise is important. However, the UGC’s decision is half baked and taken in a huff. There should be an expert body parallel to the UGC, with experts from distance education, who should take researched and considered decisions.
What ails distance education in India?
Ideally, it is an amalgamation of well thought-out and structured study material developed in different media, such as text and audio-visual that will help students understand a subject without regular access to a teacher, and personal contact hours for resolving doubts and evaluating assignments. All of this needs funding, and it is a misconception that distance learning is cheap. It is in fact, quite expensive and we are only able to subsidise because of economies of scale. However, this is often not sufficient and in the absence of funding, most places cut corners, reducing distance learning to correspondence courses where students rote-learn study material and give exams to secure certification. As such, there is little respect for it. Also, profit-making institutions often do not spend money on development of material and save major portion of the fees collected. This has damaged the reputation of distance learning. There is also some pressure to privatise distance education, with a large number of private players who have entered this domain. 
How does one overcome the challenges?
There should be an independent, expert agency to give a direction to distance education in the country, and it should become the custodian of all self-learning-material developed by different Open and Distance Learning (ODL) institutions. Gradually, private institutions should be allowed to enter the sector and also use the material. Use of multiple media should be a pre-condition for offering courses through ODL. The agency should be allowed to decide on what courses institutions can offer and should be the monitoring agency for ODL. As universities, they must also get the same type of autonomy that other universities have.

What makes a meaningful life?
"," Do you find that you have to drag yourself to college every day? Do you find the class stimulating, or do you switch off, the moment the professor walks in? Have you chalked out your short and long-term goals? Or, are you merely drifting along? In a nutshell, do you feel there is meaning to your life?
Of course, ‘meaning’ in life can come in umpteen forms. Some people derive satisfaction from academic pursuits, others from sporting achievements. Many derive meaning from relationships with family, friends and significant others. For some, their life purpose may stem from professional success, while others may lose themselves in a hobby. Some may find religious activities or a spiritual outlook providing direction to their lives. And, for most people, meaning is found in multiple domains. 
According to psychologist Michael Steger, people who believe their lives are meaningful, tend to do better on a number of dimensions. They are happier, more satisfied, feel they exert more control over their lives, and are more engaged in their work. Further, those whose lives are imbued with meaning also tend to be less depressed, are less likely to engage in substance abuse or have suicidal thoughts. 
Subjective
But what exactly does a meaningful life entail? Like many psychological constructs, iteludes definition. However, Steger argues that there are two major dimensions to it The first, purpose, relates to a human need to act and involves our goals and aims. The second, significance, refers to a pan-human tendency to make sense of our lives and our place in the world. Thus, Steger defines meaning in life “as the extent to which people comprehend, make sense of, or see significance in their lives, accompanied by the degree to which they perceive themselves to have a purpose, mission, or overarching aim in life.”
Of course, our sense of meaning also changes with time and circumstance. When the going is smooth, most people derive meaning from the various roles they are engaged in — student, parent, friend, lawyer, accountant or dancer. However, life also hurls googlies at us every now and then. And, when we feel we are at the nadir of our lives, meaning may seem as elusive as catching shadows. Whether we are battling cancer, mourning the loss of a loved one, regretting a failed marriage, feeling immobilised for getting the pink slip, or worse, if we are pummelled simultaneously on multiple fronts, we may feel rudderless, and life may seem devoid of purpose.
But, we need not despair that all is lost even when we are at the ebb of our lives. In fact, one of the most touching paeans to finding meaning in the most abject conditions imaginable is Viktor Frankl’s Man’s Search for Meaning. Imprisoned in gruesome Nazi concentration camps, he was surprised by “how much we could endure” both physically and psychologically. As he writes in the prologue to the 1992 edition, “Life holds a potential meaning under any conditions, even the most miserable ones.” For Frankl, his love for his wife was what gave him fortitude to withstand the harshest of realities. 
According to Frankl, “Everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms — to choose one’s attitude in any given set of circumstances.” So, no matter how dire your circumstances may seem now, the manner in which you deal with life’s blows is a “spiritual freedom” that “makes life meaningful and purposeful.”

The land left behind
","In this election season, when thousands are losing their sanity and, with it, control over the words they use, it is important to retain one’s equanimity. Think back to the Partition and the much-worse times that visited us. In such challenging times, there were people who retained their humanity, their sense of right and wrong. Mohinder Singh Sarna, known to today’s generation as Navtej Sarna’s father, is an eminent humanist and a perceptive Punjabi writer-poet. The recent publication of a translated collection of his short stories set into motion a trail of nostalgia. Though Mohinder penned his experiences, he could well have been expressing our own. Navtej says, “In terrible times too some people retain their sanity. There are bad Sikhs, good Sikhs, just as there are bad Muslims and good Muslims. My father talked of both, though he preferred to remember the good ones.”
It all comes through splendidly in Savage Harvest. Recalls Navtej, “My father hailed from Rawalpindi but unfortunately could never go back to the city. He had a fractured reaction to Partition. He would talk about our house there, food, fruits, the climate. He missed the books that he had to leave behind, particularly early Punjabi literature.” Listening to him, my mind goes back to Babur and his vivid description of Farghana; how he missed its climate, fruits, and people. Baburnamah is as much about Central Asia as it is about Hindustan; as much about the place and people Babur left behind as the new place he used to revive his fortunes.
For Mohinder, though, it was different. He had not set out from Rawalpindi to conquer Delhi; he was forced to begin anew. Navtej frankly admits, “At another level, my father probably did not want to go back to Rawalpindi because he had barely escaped with his life.” Unlike Gulzar, I.K. Gujral, Kuldeep Nayar, Mohinder never set foot in Pakistan once he made India his home. Adds Navtej, “I, however, did go back. I went to his college, found the road, the cinema he used to talk about. The house where he lived was not there. But there was still Raja Bazaar. Also Trunk Bazaar. There was Rose cinema, Imperial cinema. It was all very emotional for me.”
And so he decided to bring out the collection of stories. “My father wrote about the Partition but also wrote epic poetry, novels, social commentaries.” The most fetching, though, were stories of his childhood. Those were the stories of the good times, of happy memories of the places where he played, his mates.” One particularly engrossing story is Winter Evening; Deccan Evening which links 1947 and 1984. Hardly surprising considering Mohinder counted Krishan Chander as a major influence on his work.
The collection has been noticed in literary circles and those who know Mohinder Singh are not surprised that the work of the Sahitya Akademi winner still commands attention. Confesses Navtej, “I am surprised when I read the stories at readings/launches. The audience has many youngsters. They have questions too. While age-old memories have to be kept alive, hatred has to be killed.”
Amid all the talk of Savage Harvest, has Navtej ever thought of continuing his father’s ways by writing in Punjabi? “I have not felt competent enough to write in Punjabi. I am fluent in the language but not steeped in its literature.”

Going home to the stars: Finding meaning in travel
","The quest for meaning and purpose is one of the predominant traits of the millennial generation. This is true, not only in the way they think of their careers or how they interact with nature, but also in the way they experience leisure. Inevitably, the hospitality industry is seeing some deep transformations, that were once isolated niches, make their way into mainstream. Consumer expectations are changing and a growing number of travellers are in search of experiences that will make them grow as citizens of the world, or enrich them with uniquely satisfying adventures. Hoteliers are becoming purveyors of personal growth and realisation, rather than simple products to be consumed. However this poses certain challenges in terms of management and new priorities are being set, such as eco-friendliness, sustainability or safety in often quite remote locations.
The Ecole Hôtelière de Lausanne (EHL) gained access to one of the most remote and inhospitable scientific outposts in the world: the European Southern Observatory’s VLT (Very Large Telescope) site in the Atacama desert, and its legendary Residencia, to explore the challenges of extreme hospitality management, and to hear from the scientists on site. 
In this documentary, EHL professors Etemad (marketing/management) and Terrier share (psychology), insights into some essential industry drivers and how hoteliers can cope with these changes.

Be confident, not officious
","What is the difference between ‘officious’ and ‘official’? (A Khelkar, Pune)
 The word ‘official’ is frequently used in everyday contexts to refer to someone who has the authority or the power to do something. People talk about ‘police official’, ‘government official’, and so on. The word can be used as a noun and an adjective when you talk about the ‘official spokesperson’ of a political party, you mean that he is the authorised or appointed individual. The word ‘officious’ (e-FISH-es), on the other hand, is used only as an adjective, and it has a rather negative meaning. When you say that someone is ‘officious’, you mean that he is an official who asserts his authority very aggressively even in the case of trivial matters. This individual has an inflated opinion about his importance. The word has another meaning as well someone who meddles in other people’s business can also be called ‘officious’.
The officious clerk seldom looked at people and always sounded rude.
What I like about Dilip’s parents is that they’re seldom officious.
How is the word ‘debonair’ pronounced? (V Anirudh, Secunderabad)
The ‘e’ in the first syllable of this old-fashioned word is like the ‘e’ in ‘set’, ‘pet’ and ‘get’, and the following ‘o’ sounds like the ‘a’ in ‘china’. The final syllable rhymes with ‘bare’, ‘care’ and ‘share’. The word is pronounced ‘deb-e-NARE’ with the stress on the third syllable. It comes from the French ‘de bon’ aire’ meaning ‘of good race’. Nowadays, the word is mostly used with men. When you refer to a man as being ‘debonair’, what you are suggesting is that he is a charming, confident and stylishly dressed individual. Ladies are usually drawn to his charm and sophistication.
Who’s the debonair man in the three-piece suit?
Girls swooned when the debonair professor walked into the classroom.
What is the meaning of the expression ‘meet someone half way’? (J Uma, Erode)
This is an expression mostly used in informal contexts to mean ‘to compromise’. When you negotiate with someone, what is it that usually happens? You make certain demands, and then proceed to negotiate with the other party. They may be willing to meet some of your demands, but not all. In order to reach an agreement, both of you compromise; you do not insist on all your demands being met. The two of you arrive at an agreement by each one of you giving up something. When two parties meet each other half way, they agree to do a part of what the other wants.
The bill couldn’t be passed because the Opposition wasn’t willing to meet the Government half way.
I wanted 60 lakhs for the flat and Abdul was quoting 50. We both met halfway and settled on 55 lakhs.
Is it okay to say, ‘You’d better take care of not shouting at Jyothi’?
 No, it is not. The expression ‘take care of’ is usually used to mean to look after someone. We normally talk about ‘taking care of one’s parents/children/health’, etc. In the example that you have given, you are not requesting someone to look after Jyothi. What you would like the person to do is not shout at Jyothi. We normally say, ‘You’d better take care not to shout at Jyothi’.
Raj better take care not talk to Satish’s girlfriend.
You’d better take care not to make my boss angry.

Make your time count
","Better time management is an important skill to have for every student, but is essential for class XII students, especially those preparing for competitive exams. Most competitive exams such as JEE and NEET also consider your board exam results, so, it is important to score well in both. It is difficult to juggle between preparation for such major exams, and students often get overwhelmed by the portions that lies before them — they don’t know where or how to start. Here are some tips that could help you manage your time better:
Fundamentals
Your boards help build theoretical knowledge and understanding of formula derivation, whereas competitive exams test your fundamentals through difficult problem-solving. One is closely connected to the other. While approaching a chapter, look at it as one unit. Pick one chapter, ideally the one you dread, and start studying the fundamentals. Understand the derivations and theoretical aspects of the chapter. This will be useful for both exams. Then, study the same chapter from your competitive exam syllabus, where you explore it in greater detail and apply your knowledge, by solving complex problems.
Slot your time
A day might have 24 hours, but with school, classes, and extracurriculars, you have only limited time dedicated to self-study. A question that’s asked too often is, ‘How much time should I study every day?’. There is no definite answer; it varies with every student’s grasping power, however, six hours is recommended. Split these six hours into slots of two hours each, and pace your studies.
Timetable in advance
Making a new timetable every day is counterproductive. You end up wasting a lot of time planning and not doing as much. You need to be able to look at what you will be studying, for at least a month. By splitting your day into slots, you have already made it easy for yourself. You can assign a different slot for each subject or you can assign slots for learning, revising and attempting tests. Ensure your timetable is flexible enough to account for surprise tests or any other unforeseen circumstances. No timetable will work unless you exercise discipline and maintain it. Within three weeks of sticking to it, you will be able to decipher whether the timetable works for you or not.
Revise
Any competitive exam syllabus also requires you to be thorough with your class XI portions. Once there are six months to your competitive exam, start setting out ten slots in a week where you re-learn your class XI portion and test yourself on it. Since it is something you have already learned before, it won’t take up too much of your time.
Take breaks
Stress is your biggest enemy and the only way to deal with it is to take a break. But, how do you know how many breaks are too much? Simple, each time you finish a slot, take a 15-minute break. You can do what you please during that time, but the idea is to turn off the thoughts of studying completely. 
Countdown
If you are worried about falling behind, or you are unsure about how you should map out the months approaching your exams, here is how you can divide your time to account for both boards and competitive exams.
12 months:
 Start learning theory, understand every concept in detail and solve basic, as well as complex problems from boards and competitive exam syllabi. Spend 70% of your time learning and 30% solving problems.
Six months: 
Attempt part tests for three or four chapters every day to see how well you have understood the concepts. Revise your class XI portions. Attempt test series and mock tests for your competitive exam.
Three months: 
You should have completed your portions by this time. You need to devote the following three months solely to revision and tests. Use 20% of your day to revise and 80% to practice.
A month: 
February should be all about your boards, only a few revision slots should be reserved to look at your competitive exam notes.
Try to solve as many questions as possible to ace your competitive exam. Attempt as many mock tests and make sure you thoroughly revise your notes. If you manage your time well, you can ace both exams with ease.

The big bang theory
","Joker, Harley Quinn, Enchantress and Sharpshooter have been cornered. They are about to be taken into custody at Anna Adarsh College for Women in Anna Nagar. A loud explosion rings out, and the super villains are lost in a haze of cloud. When the smoke settles, we find they have escaped the trap set for them. All thanks to the handy liquid nitrogen.
Education start-ups Infinite Engineers and Vaayusastra have recently started conducting such plays, interwoven with science experiments, in schools and colleges of Tamil Nadu. Science is not boring, they reiterate, jazzing up seemingly dry equations with the pizzazz of theatre. “We have teamed up with Vaayusastra, who have professional theatre artistes. They write the script and we design the science experiments. If a play is one and a half hour long, it will have about five to six experiments,” says Harish Srinivasan, who started Infinite Engineers with MA Aravind and MC Jaikanth. 
At their first play in a school in Erode, the central character was an alien with magical powers, who challenged Earthlings to a show of prowess. “So we had the students come up and take part in experiments with us, to defeat the alien,” he says. “To teach the children chemistry, we used butane gas fire that you can light on your hand, without causing any harm.” In another, they used a Tesla coil that lit up a bulb simply when it was is moved across it — electromagnetism 101.
Most of their experiments are flashy, and their characters have a certain touch of the magical, in order to re-spark the wonders of science that seem to have been lost in thick 1000-page books.




It all started with Vaayusastra’s founder Jagadeesh Kanna. Jagadeesh has a master’s degree in Aeronautical Engineering, but has also been in the drama circles since 2010, working with The Little Theatre. “We officially started Vaayusastra four months ago, but have been trying to merge theatre and science since last year,” he says.
Jagadeesh, who now writes and directs these plays with Infinite Engineers, started out with teaching children the concept of aerodynamics using small skits based on folk tales.Tracing back the roots of aerodynamics to our mythology, Jagadeesh recounts, “Look at The Ramayana, Ravana comes in the pushpaka vahana — which is a type of air chariot, a plane — to kidnap Sita. In The Mahabharata, there are so many references to ballistic missiles like the brahmastra. We can use these epic stories to inspire children in the direction of science,” he says.
Working in theatre while getting a degree in science had armed Jagadeesh with the belief that the two should not be separated. “STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math), the base of our education system has been a colonial product. Before that, Indian education had always involved learning sciences through art such as storytelling or dance. I want to bring back that system, in the form of ASTEM,” he says.




So when Jagadeesh teamed up with Infinite Engineers, it allowed Vaayusastra a chance to move out of just aerodynamics and expand with the range of science experiments . The latter has already been in the field for about four years, taking experiment boxes to students across Tamil Nadu.
Meanwhile, as science experiments are performed on stage, a different sort of experiment is brewing off stage. For Harish and his friends from Infinite Engineers, this is the first time they are acting, in the remotest sense. “The first time I went on stage, there were some 300 people facing me. I was nervous,” he says. “We are the ones conducting the experiments, and it may not always go right, so we also need to improvise.”
Harish has given speeches in public before, but never has he needed this sort of showmanship. “You have to be spontaneous and energetic, you have to get the audience to ooh and aah at the right moment,” he says, laughing. “We’re still in the early stages but it’s nice, we’re getting into the groove of it.”
On the other hand, Jagadeesh has taken up the role of being a science teacher to his actors from a non-engineering background — a little bit of learning for everyone.
The next Science on Stage play will be held on September 1 (4.30 pm to 6 pm) and 2 (10 am to 11.30 am) at IIT Madras Research Park. Call Harish at 9884190590 for tickets.

Research connect
","



It is not unheard of when foreign universities look towards India to collaborate for future work, giving ample opportunities to students. Over the recent years, Britain’s Coventry University has been working towards developing and establishing its research partnerships with Indian universities and research centres.
A delegation from the university, led by Professor Richard Dashwood, deputy vice-chancellor of research, was recently in Chennai to promote the identification and growth of partnerships in all areas of the university’s research enterprise and innovation interest. These include business, engineering, computing, health, life sciences, arts and humanities projects.
“The university is trying to focus on building links with like-minded universities in India, which equip students for the world of work, not just focusing on academic excellence but also the transferable skills that are needed in the work place,” says Professor Dashwood. “It is also about research with a purpose — not to carry out just any research, but to ensure that there is a ‘customer’ for the research that is conducted.”
Collaboration
“We are starting with five areas that our governments have identified as priorities: smart cities, energy, water and food, future manufacturing, and cyber systems. The Government of India has identified its intention to encourage partnerships in areas related to manufacturing and transport, and we know there are many challenges for these topics in the country. Approaches to deliver affordable healthcare will be another major focus, and Coventry University has a history of engagement with India to address healthcare challenges,” he adds.
The university is also looking forward to working with industry partners. Healthcare is another key area in which the university wishes to focus on. According to professor Guy Daly, Pro-vice chancellor, Faculty of Health and Life Sciences, “There are a number of areas that need emphasis. One is in terms of health services where we are looking at innovations that can help improve health service provisions and health professions. Also, in terms of system leadership, how to get health systems to operate effectively. Third, in terms of health technologies which involve bringing different researchers from across various interdisciplinaries, not just health professionals but also those from as bio-tech, engineering, big data, artificial intelligence, and so on, working together.”
He adds, “We look forward to discovering how we can work with India leading universities and other organisations, both to collaborate in cutting-edge research and also to bring benefits to students and academics in both our countries.” The research is increasingly focused on those areas that deliver a global impact, as Coventry seeks to ensure that it distinguishes itself around its high quality level of international engagement. “We recruit many students from India, and other countries, but we also have a strong international research agenda,” continues Professor Daly. “We are committed to the internationalisation of our programmes and curriculum.”
Coventry University is to establish research partnerships with a group of Indian universities that have already expressed strong interest in collaborating. Just recently, the university had finalised an arrangement with the Institute of Chartered Accounts of India (ICAI) to launch a range of progression routes for the members; to allow them to complete the MBA (Global Financial Services) degree course from the university.
“We recognise the size and importance of India and we see our proposed activities as mutually beneficial. Coventry is investing significantly in all areas of research to enhance its international impact, and research cooperation within Indian researchers will help to ensure that we deliver global relevance through our programmes,” says Professor Dashwood.
The university is also keen to develop different forms of joint supervision for Ph.D students and is welcoming communications from Indian research universities and staff interested in collaborating together. The university has many new research areas it will be investing in, over the coming years. The activities are mainly transdisciplinary and ensure relevance and applicability of research towards solving current and emerging challenges that researchers face. “One of the things we have already launched is a scholarship programme for postdoctoral research. So, with our partners, we will have joint supervised Ph.Ds where they will spend time in both countries,” says Professor Dashwood. They also aim to bring innovations in teaching, promote the global mobility of their students and improve the prospects for long-term employability.

The rhythm of routine
","On Monday nights, Sheldon must have his mee krob and chicken satay (with extra peanut sauce on the side). Tuesday dinner is at The Cheesecake Factory, where he orders a barbecue bacon cheeseburger: the barbecue, bacon and cheese on the side. Wednesday, of course, is comic book night. As fans of the popular American comedy show “The Big Bang Theory” know only too well, Sheldon Cooper is a creature of unwavering habit; his routine is tightly regimented, and anyone who tries to change it does so at their own peril.
We can laugh at Sheldon’s commitment to — no, obsession about — his routine, his refusal to be flexible and his insistence that everything must be followed just so. But there is something about structuring one’s day — or week — in a certain way that allows us to develop a pattern of work that can actually end up being quite productive. While making sure that we build in time for the things we need to do, it can also help us mark out time for the things we would like to do.
Some people, for instance, set a time every day (or every week) to call parents, if they live in a different place. Others have a routine of going to the grocery store at on a particular day of the week, while still others earmark a block of time to play tennis or football with friends, and nothing can get them to change that — it is absolutely sacred.
Better use of time
The school or college timetable is a kind of routine that is made for us — some might say it is “forced” on us. But, there is a logic to it. It allows the big system of the institution to allocate teaching time in a fair manner, and gives students (and teachers) a basic plan around which to arrange the rest of their activities. A big chunk of a student’s life (and a teacher’s too) is earmarked for the routine of classes. But, there is a significant chunk of the day that is left for other activities, and it helps to create a routine for that time as well. Monday may be the library day, while Tuesdays could be the “catch-up-on-notes” day and Wednesday, the assignment review day. It is a way to build a comforting rhythm to your week.
If you read biographies of successful people, you will find that most of them had some sort of routine that helped them become productive. Successful writers set themselves a certain number of hours each day to write (good, bad, whatever, but those words must be produced). Successful athletes train routinely, morning and evening, no matter what the weather. Those who play the stockmarket have a routine that follows the major markets systematically.
Having a routine doesn’t mean that you have to bind yourself to it. It could then become an empty and meaningless ritual (Monday, at the library, might have you sitting and staring into space or at your phone waiting for your time to be up). You needn’t fill up your entire day with a pre-set routine. Leaving a bit of room around the edges of what you need to do will give you the flexibility to assign time to unplanned activities. The routine, then becomes the anchor that steadies you, and gives you a base from which you can wander away, but also one that you can come back to, and take comfort in.

Forest: Stay Focused
 Addiction to using smartphones is a valid cause of concern these days, and not without reason. It might seem ironic to use an app to beat this addiction, but Forest: Stay Focused does the trick. Here’s how it works. First, one needs to plant a seed in the app. This seed eventually grows into a tree. However, the moment one uses one’s phone — whether it’s for checking social media notifications, playing a game or watching videos — the tree starts withering away. Attached to the tree is a sense of responsibility and achievement, which helps one beat the addiction. (http://bit.ly/2LSTOGN)

Leading the varsities of tomorrow
"," I have spent more than 20 years in the education industry, during which I have worked in positions that have presented opportunities to interact with people at the helm of the university leadership, both in private as well as in government institutions. 
Universities, around the world, are going through a transformation. Technological advancements, rising costs, reduced funding, increasing competition, and many other factors make the role of a vice chancellor extremely challenging, yet critical for a university.
Currently, universities select their vice chancellors from the applicants who meet the basic criteria (candidate with a Ph.D. with a minimum of 15 years of experience in teaching and research, having held posts of dean, director or principal of a university or reputed institution, is ideal). 
However, universities of the future will need a charismatic leader with excellent administrative, academic, financial and team management skills to be able to navigate the changes that are been seen in the horizon. It is time to think about how our universities ought to get ready to address the challenges of tomorrow, and what roles the vice chancellors would play, while they lead these institutions.
Purpose: Ability to drive results
Universities of the future will be built on the culture of meritocracy and performance. They will need to ensure that they deliver quantifiable and measurable results in terms of academic and administrative performance, as well as deliver student outcomes. 
Vice chancellors need to be pioneers, who value possibilities, and ignite energy and imagination in their teams. They must look at new ways and methods to accomplish things, to gain competitive advantage. They will need to use their imagination to derive extraordinary models of how things ought to work, to produce a result which transforms situations.
Financing
Universities are faced with a multi-edged sword: increased costs due to demand for higher quality, increased investment in technology and allied services, pressure to bring down tuition fees and a reduced funding from the government. 
Also, the pressure to continuosly improve the quality of infrastructure, increased pay for better qualified faculty, spending on marketing, increased investment in content for fast changing curriculum has made the situation increasingly critical. 
Universities will need to find alternate sources of funds to ensure that they are being able to fight the trinity of cost, quality and scale. The ability of a vice chancellor to mobilise funds from multiple sources including, but not limited to, endowments, charities, public allocations, and so on will become important.
Networking
Vice chancellors will need to play the role of the integrator, who values connection and draws teams together. Their ability to network profoundly with the components of the ecosystem is critical to drive the university. 
They must be able to communicate the vision of the university with passion and authenticity, pull things together at critical points, avoid arbitrariness and give focus to the process. They shall be responsible for the cohesion in the team and for making efforts comprehensive — pull different positions and perspectives back on track so that the greater good is realised.
Collaboration
The lines between formal and informal, degree and vocational, class-room and online education are getting blurred. With multiple guiding frameworks like NSQF, CBCS, LOCF and government focus on skill education at university level, it is imperative to identify the right collaborators who can add complementary and supplementary value to the university. Vice chancellors would need to collaborate with multiple agencies, frameworks, regulators, employers, academic and research organisations, national and international counterparts and funding agencies to get the desired results. 
They will need to be the guardians who value stability and bring order and rigour, a prudent guide to what is pragmatic and workable without resulting in organisational deficits across the board.
Teamwork
Leaders, in the university of the future, must value challenges and generate momentum; moving things forward, exerting mild pressure to get things done while respecting individual personalities. They must exert enthusiasm and foster energy to accomplish goals. They must goad the team into action, generating momentum to ensure benchmarks are met and time is managed so that desired results are achieved.
As the competition becomes fierce and expectations from students, higher, a vice chancellor’s ability to build a performing team to ensure greater productivity through responsibility sharing, using the unique competencies of each member to advance the interest of the entire organisation, shall be of great importance.
Universities will have to deal with a new set of challenges and must rise to new opportunities. It is order and stability that harness what is positive in attempts at innovation, and contribute to creativity being more responsible and realistic. Tagore’s magnificent view that ‘life should not be the infinite elongation of a straight line’, fits so well to define the risks of tomorrow. Universities have big goals and aspirations, and only a non-linear planning and a strategic mindset can help reach them.

Top-up funds
"," It is no news that international students in the U.K. pay higher tuition fees than domestic or EU students, while funding their accommodation and living costs during their course. In 2018, students from the U.K. and EU enrolling in to English universities had to pay up to £9,250 as the annual fee. However, the fee for international students vary considerably, ranging from £10,000 and going up to £38,000 or more for medical degrees. Along with a high cost of living, the average cost of studying in the U.K. is estimated to be £22,200 per year, needless to say, studying in London is likely to be significantly more expensive.
Fortunately, there is support available and ample opportunities for part-time work for international students to top up funds and pay university fees. If you are an International student , and are enrolled into any full-time undergraduate or postgraduate degree programme at a recognised university, you are allowed to work part-time during the term for up to 20 hours a week, and full-time during the holidays.
 Here is useful information on employment preconditions and types of jobs that international students can pursue.
Range of jobs
There is a range of part-time jobs to expat students in the U.K. Flexible in nature, the KRAs of such jobs are designed such that they suit the life of a student. Websites such as indeed.com and studentjob.co.uk are most sorting by both employers and students for jobs such as:
Sales assistants in retail
Customer assistants inhospitality
 Research assistant in universities
Data analyst in corporates
 Event organisers
Catalogue distributor
Shopping assistant
There are other jobs like babysitting and pet-sitting as well. Paid internships can earn you additional money and give you vital extra skills, which is also beneficial for your CV.
 Minimum wages
The U.K. has set national minimum wages, which means you get paid according to your age and nature of job. The ‘National Minimum Wage’ is the minimum pay per hour almost all workers in the U.K. are entitled to. Regardless of the scale of an enterprise, they still have to pay the correct minimum wage. Such as:
21 or older: £6.70 an hour
18 to 20: £5.30 an hour
16 or 17: £3.87 an hour
25 and above: £7.20 an hour
Apprentices: £3.30 per hour
*These rates are as on 2016 and are reviewed annually by the U.K. government.

Data analysis at Barclays
","I interned with Barclays for two months as a part of my summer internship. I cracked this opportunity through on-campus recruitment; it was one of the rigorous selection processes of four rounds. Working for a big brand like Barclays, at the start of my career, seemed surreal. 
It was primarily a workforce analytics project aimed at improving the net promoter score for the business and also to improve its employee performance. HR analytics is a relatively new phenomenon. So, the experience was quite challenging. There was a lot of self-learning that I had to do, but, in the end, the deliverables were appreciated by the Director (Operations), Vikas Anand, which was encouraging.
Exploring new domains
The final review of my internship is something I will cherish all my life. That was the day when all my hard work was acknowledged and appreciated by the senior management in the company. I had got an outstanding rating for my project which was very heartening and motivating. 
My project involved a lot of data analysis where I had to learn and work on tools such as R and SPSS, use techniques such as regression and factor analysis to provide them with data-driven recommendations to improve their NPS scores and employee performance. It also involved secondary research and usage of survey techniques to zero-in on the problem statement. With help from my mentors and other seniors, I was able to understand the processes of the business, the business model, the performance evaluation metrics and the kind of impact they had on the employee satisfaction.
This opportunity helped me explore new domains and assess myself in a profound way. The pace at which the technology and innovation are emerging today, one cannot afford to stay ignorant of these developments. Post my internship the comfort I had developed with these tools helped me learn more during my analytical courses in my second year of MBA. 
My experience at Barclays was enriching. I had the opportunity to interact with veterans and who were so motivated. It was also a great leverage for me in my campus placement interviews where I could justify my analytical and deductive reasoning capabilities by narrating my project outcomes. 
Nischala Reddy Bujangari, is a second-year student, PGDM, Great Lakes Institute of Management, Gurugram, and interned at Barclays for two months.

Way of the future
","The job market may have begun to lean towards a candidate who has a breadth of knowledge rather than single-minded specificity. But until this is the norm rather than the exception, students with diverse interests could continue to feel that they have to pigeonhole themselves to succeed. 
Soon, however, they will have the option not only to pursue these distinct paths, but perhaps find meaningful overlaps. Krea University, an upcoming institution at Sri City, will place ‘interwoven learning’ at the core of all its four-year B.A. and B.Sc. honours degrees. This means, stitching together threads from various disciplines to form a cohesive fabric, applied to solve problems in real-world settings.
R. Seshasayee, chairman, IndusInd Bank, is the chairman of the university’s executive committee, and a member of the university’s governing council. He discusses the gap in higher learning that Krea could potentially fill; why interwoven learning was made a priority, and how it can shape leaders of the next generation.
Higher learning 
What the real world requires from those coming out of higher learning institutions is diverging more from what institutions can cater. We have to address this — create something that is more appropriate for the 21st century.
There are many of us, including N. Vaghul, and Raghuram Rajan, coming together for Krea University, because we believe something needs to be done in higher education to prepare the right kind of leaders for the future. Education is central to anything we dream about. 
In the U.S., liberal arts and science colleges give you access to a multiplicity of disciplines. So, you can opt for two or three subjects you are interested in. For example, economics and theatre studies. But merely pursuing these interests separately isn’t what society requires of graduates, and isn’t what would bring out the best in them. So we thought of interwoven, or interdisciplinary learning. The threads from different subjects aren’t just left as loose strands; they’re woven together to produce a pattern and a fabric. This is reflected in the university’s logo too. It is about multiple disciplines coming together for a purpose — to solve problems, or address an opportunity — not just to satisfy curiosity or interests.
Working backwards
We first examined 10 problems each in the fields we wanted to teach. When taking social science, for instance, we considered communal harmony. Next, we thought of the kind of learnings that one needs to address it. It could involve history to tell us which periods in India’s past had communal harmony. What do we need by way of data analytics? What about taking into account ethics, or social impact to make the right choices? It isn’t just a random choice of subjects; interwoven learning brings together relevant knowledge from different domains — it could be data science, political science, or social science
For the first year, students opt for core and required courses, and then choose a specialisation. But even after that, interwoven learning plays a big part. To make this more relevant, we will pick around 20 careers, examine the dominant issues in each of them, and decide what will equip the students to become competitive in that career. This is not abstract or open-ended because in India, students have to be able to take on a career when they come out of an institution. We will have corporates and social institutions partnering with us to facilitate placements. They will be our partners right from the start, involved even in tweaking the curriculum, in order to get the right kind of output from the institution.
Next-generation leaders
Leadersneed to be problem-solvers . Second, they must have an understanding of the major influences shaping the 21st-century. This includes keeping abreast of developments in technology, such as human-machine interfaces or artificial intelligence. It wouldn’t be about just learning C++, but knowing what tools in data analytics or technology are available to solve a given problem. The third aspect,is the most important. Everything is to be anchored on an understanding of ethics and social impact. Not just a moral class, but debating the ethics of the choices that we make to solve a problem.
We have an illustrious academic council. Some of them, like Srinath Raghavan and Gaurav Raina, will be teaching too. They have a huge network of faculty who have worked and trained with them that we may be able to tap into. 
Wedon’t want students to take just another exam. We will consider their past scholastic records, but our intention is to look at the candidate as a multi-dimensional person. The admission process is still being designed, and we plan to keep the student-teacher ratio tight. Admissions for the first batch will be opening later this year. www.krea.edu.in.

Boon or bane?
","  


I never thought I would say this, but studying in a private university has finally paid off because we are not the victims of the cell phone ban.This wasn’t the best decision made by the government of Tamil Nadu because smart phones have become an integral part of a student’s life. How are students to share notes, access university portals online, get informed about where and when their next class is in case of any switch, know where their faculty are, check if the administrative blocks are functioning and even simply find their way around the campus? Cell phones are definitely a lifeline to the outside world and banning them is almost foolish! Students will have a hard time commuting due to lack of communication with their drivers and no information in case of road blocks.




While it is definitely at the discretion of the teacher to allow or disallow mobiles in classrooms, a blanket ban on its use is definitely retrograde. The reasons for imposing the ban, such as inappropriate filming of women students and malpractice in exams, must be addressed through other punitive measures and not by banning of phones. The benefits of mobiles far outweigh any harms associated with its usage. What is also dubious about the ban is the exemption of central institutions in Tamil Nadu such as IIT Madras due to the ‘knowledge of students there to use phones reasonably’. Is this based on a presumption that students from other institutions do not know how to use phones reasonably? The policy lacks sound reasoning and one can expect considerable backlash from both students and teachers.




The advertising brochure of my college proudly talks about the Wi-Fi enabled campus. However, a prohibition of smart phones inside it seems quite contradictory. One of the principle points raised against mobile phones is that the device would be misleading, diverting and a disturbance in class. Smart phones aren’t that bad. Sharing through a less time consuming means would beat the conventional time taken and definitely help students.




Every coin has two sides, and mobile phones too are a boon and a bane. It depends on how we make use of it. While there are tremendous advantages, there are just as many drawbacks. When mobile phones have a constitutive role in today’s world, it is irrational to ask students not to use them. Reasonable restrictions are understandable, for reasons such as causing disturbances inside classrooms or to other students. If college students are seen as adults, then it is only fair that we are treated as such and are trusted that we know how to use mobile phones reasonably. At the same time, we as students also need to be more responsible when it comes to how we use our mobile phones. After all it is ‘you’ and ‘I’ who decide what the pros and cons of it are.

Inter results: poor show by Telangana districts
","Intermediate second year results yet again reflected the poor performance of Telangana districts with two of them figuring at the bottom and the remaining except Ranga Reddy district securing results below the State average of 66 per cent.
Adilabad and Medak recorded a low pass percentage of 49 while Krishna district topped the State with 82 per cent passes. Ranga Reddy district with 73 per cent passes topped in Telangana.
But much to the surprise of officials, performance of Seemandhra districts was much better as eight out of the 13 districts crossed the State average. Since schools and colleges in Seemandhra were affected by the bifurcation, officials expected that the agitation would affect the results.
The results declared on Saturday revealed that the pass percentage increased marginally this year with 65.57 passes compared to 65.36 per cent last year. Out of the 8,01,419 students who appeared for the exams, 5,25,526 have passed. Pass percentage in government colleges stood at 65.
Students can collect marks memos from respective colleges from May 7. Any discrepancies in marks can be brought to the notice of the principals by June 1. Those who wish to apply for recounting have to pay Rs. 100 per subject while they have to pay Rs. 600 for photo copy-cum-re-verification of answer book.
The last date for this is May 9. The advanced supplementary exams will be held from May 25.
The evaluation of answer scripts of advanced supplementary exams will be separate for both Telangana and Seemandhra, said the Board of Intermediate Education (BIE) secretary, Rama Sankar Naik. The A.P. Social Welfare Residential Educational Institutions (APSWREI) Society put up a good performance with pass percentage of 85.04 as against the State average of 65.57 per cent, the Society’s Secretary R.S. Praveen Kumar said.

On the cutting edge
","Neuromorphic Engineering, a field that takes its inspiration from biological processes, especially of the human nervous system, and has its roots in physics, mathematics and engineering, is an emerging area for science students who wish to work in the cutting edge areas of technology. The scope of the subject is only highlighted with significant number of countries and giant corporates such as Intel, IBM, Qualcomm and Samsung setting up teams to work on neuromorphic systems in the last couple of years.
Speaking about the relevance of the field in the present scenario, Andre Van Schaik, Director, International Centre for Neuromorphic Systems (CNS), Western Sydney University (WSU), Australia said, “performance of devices which was hitherto being enhanced by increasing the number of transistors, is now witnessing a dead-end as we have reached a point where we are forced to think of newer means to improve it. Neuromorphic engineering can address this problem effectively as it can help receive accurate data, cut down the number of steps in processing and then revert it quickly in the same form.” Professor Andre Van Schaik was in Bangalore recently to sign a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore. According to him, neuromorphic engineering is about equipping a device to sense the environment, process information and make decisions similar to the neurons of human brain.
For effective automation and scaling up, he said, “it is necessary that technology makes sense of complex human thought process and behaviour. Neuromorphic engineering aims at mimicking the working of the nervous system by creating a similar architecture artificially.”
The MOU between CNS, WSU and IISc enables students from both institutions to seek co-operation from each other with regard to the study of neuromorphic engineering. If three Master’s students get to do their final project for a period of six months at WSU, three Ph.D candidates from IISc can spend about 12 months in WSU completing their thesis under the joint supervision of professors from both India and Australia. “Apart from this, one master’s graduate from IISc will get a grant to do her/his PhD with us for the full period,” informed Schaik. An International scientific symposium on neuromorphic engineering will also be co-organised and hosted by IISc next year in furtherance of this collaboration. The student exchange programme will begin from January 2018.

We are the world
","We are the world 
We are the children
We are the ones who make a brighter day, so let’s start giving...
It’s true we’ll make a better day, just you and me
The above is an extract from the chorus of the song “We are the World” written by Michael Jackson and Lionel Richie and recorded by United Support of Artists (U.S.A.) for Africa in 1985. Sung by a star-studded line-up of over 30 artistes including Stevie Wonders, Michael Jackson, Lionel Richie, Kenny Rogers, Diana Ross and Tina Turner, the song was remade as “We are the World 25 for Haiti” by an all-star cast of singers following an earthquake in Haiti in 2010. 
The song made music lovers across the globe feel that they are global citizens and have a role to play in making the world a better place to live in. The impact of the song on me was so great that it inspired me to work in the 1994-genocide-hit Rwanda in Eastern Africa for five years, and get to know the people of a different continent and appreciate different cultures. 
World Citizens Day is observed on November 19 every year.It is a wonderful opportunity to experience the feeling that we are part of a big global community. The occasion is a call for educators to raise these questions: Do we have a good inclusive education system in the country? Does our education system promote global citizens education? Do educators in India allow the student community to truly feel and joyfully sing “We are the World”? 
Importance
Today, quite unfortunately, people are becoming jingoistic and nationalistic. The feeling ‘My country, my language, my people, my culture, my religion’ makes people myopic and selfish, creates chaos in society and divides the country. The level of intolerance is so high that many are not able to digest differences and accept others as they are.
A good global citizen believes all people are equal, has concern for others, shows interest in the welfare of people, appreciates differences, demonstrates empathy and responds positively to various global challenges. Educators have the responsibility of producing global citizens and promoting global citizen education.
The broad objectives of global citizen education are: to make every teacher and student feel that they are part of the global society and connected to people in different parts of the globe, to enable them to become aware of global issues, and to respond positively to the issues and contribute to a more peaceful and inclusive society.
Role of educators
Educational institutions should sensitise teachers and students about the need to know about people of different countries, races, religions, and so on. This helps them appreciate otherness. Teachers should discuss global issues in the classroom and help students become aware of what is happening around the world. 
Labelling students based on their level of intelligence, background and performance is against the principle of inclusiveness. When teachers fail to understand the learning styles of students who do not perform well, they tend to label them as “slow learners”. Making every student feel comfortable and equal is crucial to promoting tolerance, acceptance and inclusiveness. 
In the era of commercialisation of education and unhealthy competition that kills inclusiveness, whether educational institutions can teach values is a debatable question. At a time when there is much stress on conforming to the status quo, whether the concept of development-oriented education is possible is another question. As optimists, educators should be able to see light at the end of the tunnel and prepare students to meet the demands of society. 
The moment we feel that we are global citizens, our world view will change. All our petty politics and divisions will vanish and we will value inclusiveness. We will recognise and celebrate otherness. We will joyfully sing, “We are the world. We are the children.” It is a dream. Will the dream come true?

Metabolic mysteries
"," Heart disease is becoming more common today — what was once considered an elderly person’s disease today affects adolescents too. Scientists and clinicians have come to realise that many patients of heart disease and related problems have a set of traits such as a large waistline, high blood sugar and high blood pressure. These conditions are grouped under the term ‘metabolic syndrome’. 
In India too, this syndrome affects a significant portion of the urban and rural population (up to 25%). Until recently, doctors treated the symptoms individually, and were not successful at this. There can be no hope for a unified treatment without identifying the starting point. Reports also hint that metabolic syndrome patients are more susceptible to cognitive decline, but this too is not well-understood. This makes the area interesting for scientists like Dr. Asha Abraham, Associate Professor at St. Aloysius College, Mangaluru.
Animal biotechnology 
It is a field of applied biology where molecular biology, genome editing and other techniques are used for pharmaceutical, agricultural or industrial applications. Such research has given rise to genetically modified animals that synthesise useful proteins, have better growth rates or are resistant to disease. In Asha’s case, it is used to gather clues about metabolic syndrome.
The research
Since she cannot experiment on humans, Asha works with mice. To be suitable ‘models’ for metabolic syndrome, Asha needs to get her mice to develop the symptoms. The easiest way is to feed mice fatty food and wait for them to become unhealthy. However, Asha felt this was not realistic as most humans do not only consume fat. So she devised a high-fat-simple-carbohydrate diet for the mice that was more similar to diets followed by humans today. Simple carbohydrates are abundant in energy-dense junk food and sugar-rich items. These spike sugar levels as the body can easily break them down into glucose that accumulates in blood. This is less for complex carbohydrates like in whole grains and legumes.
Asha’s diet plan worked on her mice. They began to show metabolic-syndrome like symptoms. The mice are monitored and then eventually sacrificed so the protein and chemical levels in their brain can be measured with techniques like HPLC High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). Through her experiments, Asha proved that neurotransmitter levels in sick mice get derailed by this diet and this is likely causing mice to over eat. This could be happening in humans, too.
Academic path
After a BSc in zoology, Asha chose to study the relatively new (at the time) subject of biotechnology at Cochin University of Science and Technology. She continued this with a Ph.D and then obtained a post-doctoral fellowship from the Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR). She joined St Aloysius College as faculty after two years of research at the College of Fisheries in Mangaluru.

Change your course
","The most important thing we do in life is to take decisions. At a time of information overload, this can be particularly challenging. Yet, this is the time of year when students have to make up their mind on their future course of study. It is one of the most difficult and important decisions they will need to take, one that will impact the rest of their life. 
Trends suggest that there will be an increasing number of Indians opting for higher studies abroad, particularly in Australia.
Keep in mind
Do your homework: Basic research is important, but information overload can make decision-making difficult and confusing. It is important to decide what subject you would like to pursue, where you would like to study, whether you meet the entry and eligibility criteria and finally, whether we have the required funds to pay for it. Given the Indian rupee-Australian dollar exchange rate, studying in Australia is significantly cheaper than traditional destinations, such as, the U.S., and the U.K., which pose new challenges. 
How to apply: If you are going through an education agent, find out which education agents have been empanelled by the university of choice. For instance, the internationally-ranked University of New South Wales, Sydney (UNSW) has only 12 registered India-based education partners. No one else is authorised to process student applications. The list is available on the university’s website. Furthermore, empanelled agents are not authorised to charge students for services they render. Such payments, or commissions, are paid for by the university. 
Know ‘why’ you are pursuing higher studies: Simon Sinek, in his path-breaking book The Power of Why, stressed on the misplaced emphasis that many place on ‘what’ and ‘how’, without ever knowing ‘why’. If you know ‘why’ you are planning on a particular course of action, other things fall in place. In terms of sequencing, ‘why’ is where we first start. You can decide, for instance, to pursue an undergraduate course in finance and accounting, if you are clear as to why you would like to do so. Once you know your why, where is easy. 
Embrace change: Often, our parents, in particular, and sometimes even we, fear the uncertain. Living abroad, especially if it is the first time, can be challenging. Our parents worry about multiple things: Is it safe? What is the culture like? Will my son or daughter make friends? Will the studying and living culture cause problems? These are legitimate questions and anxieties. At the same time, if the decision is to study abroad, it is important to be open to change. Some things might be similar to what we are used to, but there will be big differences in other aspects. What is particularly fascinating is that ‘other cultures’ open up the mind to new ways of seeing and thinking and even, behaving. This creates a global mindset. It lies at the heart of what great education is all about. 
Learn with passion: We can learn every single day, but only if we are open to it. ‘Smell the roses’ we are told and yet, we rarely do. Employability is not a quotient of how many books we have read or quotations we know by heart, but how we are able to relate with our external environment. This is what employers look for because what they want are persons who can work in a team, take decisions and consequently, anticipate and solve problems without compromising on integrity and values. Great educational institutions recognise this and embed it into their pedagogy. It is what makes them stand out.

Avoid a meltdown
","“Your friend Akash tells me that the man who came to your school yesterday spoke really well. He had some interesting things to say about...”
“Akash may have liked it. But most of us didn’t. The man used too many jargons.”
“Jargon. The word ‘jargon’ is mostly used...”
“I know what ‘jargon’ means. It refers to the special terms or expressions used in a profession or field. For example, LBW, forward short leg, leg slip, and so on, are jargons used in cricket.”
“That’s right! But what I wanted to say was ‘jargon’ is an uncountable noun. The plural is ‘jargon’ and not ‘jargons’. I don’t understand the jargon of law.”
“I don’t think anyone does. The speaker used too much jargon yesterday. How was the annual party, by the way? Did you have a good time?”
Eventful
“Most of us were having a good time till the Marketing Manager had a major meltdown.”
“A major meltdown? Does it mean he became rather emotional and started crying?”
“It could. The expression ‘meltdown’ is mostly used in informal contexts. When an individual has a ‘meltdown’, he becomes very upset about something.”
“Usually when people get upset, they shout at others.”
“That’s right! A meltdown suggests an emotional outburst of some kind. You could either shout at somebody or break down because...”
“In other words, the person is no longer in control of his emotions. He loses his self-control. Serena had a major meltdown during the recent US Open final.”
“She did, didn’t she? Here’s another example. Taking care of triplets can’t be easy. I’m sure Revathi has a meltdown every now and then.”
“Why don’t you ask her husband? When I was young, my father used to have a major meltdown whenever he saw my report card. Was it the same case with your father?”
“In my case, it was my mother who used to have the meltdown. My father, on the other hand, didn’t really care. He was pretty laid-back.”
Composed
“Laid-back? Does it mean a lazy person? Someone who doesn’t really care about anything?”
“That’s not what it means. A laid-back person is someone who doesn’t get upset about things very easily. He seems very calm and relaxed all the time.”
“In other words, someone who doesn’t let the pressure get to him. Nothing really worries him. My physics teacher has a laid-back approach to everything.”
“I enjoy being in the company of people who are laid-back. When you’re in their company, you begin to relax. The term can be used with things as well. For example, compared to Mumbai, Hyderabad is a very laid-back city.”
“Compared to Mumbai, any city in India would seem laid-back. Raju says that the company that he’s working for now is pretty laid-back. They don’t have a dress code or anything. The only thing they care about is meeting deadlines.”
“Isn’t your uncle coming to your place today?”
“That’s right. He said that he’d be arriving in our place around six in the evening.”
“Arriving ‘at’, not ‘in’. You normally use ‘arrive in’ when you have a city or country in mind. For example, the children arrived in Hyderabad last week.”
“The President will be arriving in Singapore this afternoon.”
“Otherwise, it’s usually ‘arrive at’. We arrived at the airport a little after one.”
“By the time we arrived at the bus stop, the bus had left.”
“That sounds like you. You’re always late for everything.”

Get Ahead in tech "," A self-confessed proud Hyderabadi, Sreeja Kamishetty is a final-year dual-degree student who is pursuing her master’s in the machine learning lab under Prof. Praveen Paruchuri, and her main areas of research are artificial intelligence and intelligent transportation. Her work on developing a machine learning solution for prioritised (and better quality) routing of vehicles, especially during emergencies has culminated in a research paper. It has been selected for the annual flagship conference of the IEEE Intelligent Transportation Systems Society (ITSS) which will be held in November at Hawaii, the U.S. 
Rare honour
Like many other hopeful peers, 20-year-old Sreeja Kamishetty too applied for an internship at Google last year. She was hoping to have a learning experience from the interview and selection process. Hence, she says she wasn’t particularly disappointed when she didn’t get selected for the internship. But her application didn’t go unnoticed. Sreeja was instead chosen for the Get-Ahead programme for EMEA (short for Europe, Middle East and Africa regions). She was the only Indian selected to attend the retreat in London.
In an endeavour to create awareness of its culture, Google organised a programme called Get-Ahead, where women in tech were invited to workshops and related events. “As a part of the programme, the organisers conducted Kickstart coding competition for all the Get-Ahead participants. The top 20 were selected to the EMEA Google Students Retreat in London,” explains Sreeja. “Like any other Google Kickstart, there were two questions which we needed to answer in two hours. I have been practising coding, which helped me do well in the competition,” she says. 
Then there was the EMEA Google Students Retreat 2018 which took place in the first week of August. Ït was a platform for women in tech to strengthen skills, network with other attendees and engineers and learn about Google products and culture, during the course of the three days. Each day had a specific agenda,” elaborates Sreeja. “For example, the first day was dedicated to networking with other scholars. There were talks on Google’s culture, a talk on machine learning in YouTube, and an office tour of beautiful King's Cross office in London. The second day was technical, with code retreat workshops organised by Google employees. On the final day, we had panel discussions on stories of successes and failures, and talked about opportunities at Google.”
For Sreeja, the retreat was a wholesome learning experience which not only boosted her confidence but also helped in her current preparation for job interviews. “There was an activity where we were asked to write different things in which we are remarkable at. At the end of it, the facilitator made us realise that everyone was remarkable,” exclaims Sreeja. Another workshop she fondly remembers is ‘True Colours’. “The workshop left a great impression on me. It taught us how to work with people with different colours, where each colour represented a set of behaviours,” she explains.

Mixing business with pleasure
","It was the end of the second term at IIM Calcutta for the Post Graduate Programme for Executives (PGPEX) Class of 2019, and 20 of us were headed to University of Strathclyde in Glasgow, Scotland, to participate in the immersion module which is a mandatory part of our curriculum. This module introduces one to industry and education in a different geography and culture. For most of us, it was a unique experience — discuss the pressing economic and business issues and soak in the culture.
We started the programme with a workshop conducted by Prof. Ian Wooton of the Fraser of Allander Institute, a leading independent economic research institute focused on the Scottish economy, on Brexit and the trade challenges that lie ahead for the U.K. in a post-Brexit world. During our two weeks at Strathclyde, we had the opportunity to interact with senior professors and discuss areas such as strategy, fintech, risk management, digital marketing, supply chain management, and so on. An interesting session was conducted by Prof. Phil Taylor on the impact of automation on business services in a global delivery setup, where we discussed various service delivery models and the probable impact of automation on jobs not only in India and the U.K., but across the globe. 
Experiential learning 
The classroom sessions were complemented by our visits to various businesses. We visited the Scottish Power headquarters and learned about the IT transformation the organisation is going through. We were treated to a boardroom experience at the Royal Bank of Scotland headquarters in Edinburgh, and understand how the organisation has evolved post the 2008 economic crisis. The icing on the cake was a visit to Will Grant & Sons — the home of “Glenfiddich” — to nose the various whiskies and to see the bottling lines in operation.
We also visited  Glasgow when the European championships 2018 were on, and were greeted with concerts in George Square after classes. “People make Glasgow”, the motto of the city, could be felt in all the venues we frequented. A quick weekend getaway to the Scottish highlands made us fall in love with Scotland. Unfortunately, the two weeks came to an end and we had to return to Kolkata to resume the next leg of our course, though with lasting memories of Scotland and a promise to return.

Re-think your approach
","With less than two weeks to go for the Common Admission Test (CAT) 2018, the nervousness and fear would have increased manifold.
Should I do only mock CATs now? Should I leave out some of the topics that I am weak in? My scores in two sections are good, but I haven’t been scoring well in one section. My scores are erratic, what do I do? How do I prepare for other exams while CAT prep is still on? There are too many concerns students are saddled with. But, the answer to almost all these questions is the same — Concentrate on what can be done rather than on what cannot be!
Acing the CAT requires two parallel distinctive approaches: Ensuring the full utilisation of the three hours in the exam, and ensuring the maximum returns for the hours invested prior to the exam (read ‘preparation’). 
Strategise 
However good one may be in solving problems of quantitative ability (QA) or data interpretation and logical reasoning (DILR), or good in vocabulary and grammar, the exam requires a special approach. It is much like adapting oneself to various formats of cricket (Test, ODI, T20).
Basically, the strategy is to ensure the following:
Read all questions in a section/set
Identify and solve the easy and medium-level difficulty questions
Identify and avoid difficult or lengthy questions
Have a cut-off time (stop loss) for every question/every set
Maximise attempts
Be systematic and clinical in your approach
The approach 
Ideally, by now, you should have come up with a viable strategy that works for you. The mocks that you have taken and the analysis that you have done should be enough to have zeroed-in on the best approach to the CAT exam. However, here is a quick summary of how a strategy for the exam can look like. 
Possible break-up of time limits:
QA – Do it in two rounds (35 min and 25 min) or six questions in 10 min
DI – 30 min (7.5 min for each set)
LR – 30 min (7.5 min for each set) OR
DILR - Give about nine to 10 minutes per passage and try to do five passages. 
Every set should be read for at least one to two minutes before deciding on doing the same or skipping it. 
Reading comprehension – 40–45 min (8-9 min for each passage)
Verbal ability – 20–15 min (depending on RC)
In every section, sticking to the time limits is sacrosanct. Within each set of say, DI/LR or RC, doing all questions is NOT the objective. Reading and trying to attempt them is.
The final leg
This is the time to forget all the books and concentrate only on Mock CATs and original CAT papers. 
If required, take up some sectional tests. However, there is really no point going back to the basics often or solving tons of questions from each chapter/area. 
Now is the time when writing the Mocks to finalise one’s strategy becomes imperative. At the same time, writing only mocks and doing nothing to improve one’s capability of solving more questions/different types of questions would be counter-productive. 
Take one mock in three to six days (as per your convenience) and then utilise the days between the Mocks for improving the marks in each of the areas. 
In quantitative ability, the important topics to cover are arithmetic, QE/polynomials/inequalities/logs, numbers, geometry/CG/mensuration.
Divide data interpretation into the seven types of questions: tables and its variants, bar chart, line graphs, pie charts, tournament and games / sports-based, max/minima and venn diagram, and miscellaneous like spider, triangle, scatter diagram, and so on. For each of the three days in between mocks, solve about 10 sets in each such type of questions.
Divided logical reasoning into the following: arrangements (linear and circular), selection, networks and routes, grouping, order sequencing and ranking, cubes and venn diagrams, and mathematical and logical puzzles. Everyday solve about six sets of the same type. Which means, in a day you will only do arrangements and take up five to six sets at one go. 
In Reading Comprehension, it is not enough to keep solving passages or taking tests. The scores will only improve if you figure out how to improve the accuracy levels while maintaining the attempts. 
The areas to work on in verbal ability are: Critical reasoning, para completion/summary/others, para jumbles, and words. For each of these areas, one should solve 10 questions each day from the mocks or sectional tests that one has already taken.
Two weeks of preparation can make a huge difference to your score. You can add a minimum of 60 marks than you are currently getting. That could mean jumping about 20 to 30 percentile in the final analysis. But what is more important is to work without the fear of failure.

ON HIGH ALERT
"," Have you ever wondered what will be your first reflex if a disaster occurs? Many say that they would simply try and run out of the place in the event of an earthquake or fire. However, people end up panicking when disaster strikes. 
A major reason behind this panic is lack of knowledge, and it can be worked upon during a person’s formative years. It is therefore important to train children about how to react in the face of a disaster or emergency.
A majority of the schools and colleges in India train children about the basics. However, when asked if the training was useful, some students said that though they had drills in schools, not a lot of them thought that it was useful.
“We had mock drills for earthquakes and went to the fire station to learn how to extinguish a fire. It was useful information, but from the way it was provided it looked more like a formality. Moreover, all we were taught was to cover our heads and lie under a table in case of an earthquake, not to use lifts, leave the building and so on. Though we have received instruction. we have not practised it. We were taught how to extinguish fire with a huge bunch of students; only the students standing in the front row could even understand something,” says Sahil Chhabra, who passed out from school in 2017.
This observation is not new. Bikramjit Singh Mann, who completed his schooling in 1986 from a Punjab school, says that even he was not taught about disaster management while studying. “I now have some training due to the nature of my job. If not for this, I would not be able to handle an emergency,” he says. 
Empowerment
Teacher Kanika Narula, who teaches disaster management in her school, recalls her own school days and reminisces about how she belonged to one of the fortunate batches who were taught about emergency situations. “The idea is that when a natural disaster strikes, we are already operating in the unknown, and to act fast is a prerequisite. If we don’t have a checklist or plan in mind, it only delays any efforts to minimise or curtail the damage. Knowledge empowers us to face what would otherwise be a completely intimidating situation — and so this training is absolutely essential, for just a basic familiarity with the tools and measures for disaster preparedness and mitigation,” she observes, while adding that there are steps being taken nowadays to help children understand the gravity of these situations. 
Col. Mohit Bawa, Dean, Student Life, BML Munjal University, explains how the university has taken steps to educate students. “We have a tie-up with VPS Rockland Hospital, who provide emergency medical services to our campus. Emergency trainers visit the campus regularly to refresh and train students, faculty and staff in emergency procedures and first aid, equipping them to handle earthquakes, fire breakouts, accidents and so on.”
The right way
 Technology has helped us in many ways; however, is learning about emergencies through movies or the Internet the right way to go about it? Bikramjit, who is trained for emergencies, says, “Learning without proper training can actually do more damage, so it is very important to learn the right way. For example, basic first aid tells us to put a person in a recovery position after checking for their airway and breathing. But if someone has not been put in the position properly and they have an item lodged in the throat, we could end up killing them instead of saving them.”
There is no doubt that the situation is improving, but it is not entirely clear if it is due to students learning the basics themselves or because of the efforts of institutions. In either case, the best solution is for schools and colleges to increase their efforts to train students.

Cut yourself some slack
","We love to make plans. Plans to accomplish big and little things within time frames long and short. Goals set for life, to be reached by the time one is this age or that. Even those of us who may not be obsessed by milestones and targets, may have a hazy sense of what we want for ourselves, and vaguely wonder how we might get it.
A student recently told me he was concerned that he would not be able to reach all the targets he had set for himself within the time frame he had planned. He said he had had it all worked out, that he would get to point A by a certain age, complete goal one, move towards goal two within a specific time, and so on. And now, it seemed, that it wasn’t going to happen exactly as he had hoped. He was already several months behind in his estimation, and he felt his entire plan was slipping away.
When you’re 18 — or 25, as in the case of my young friend — every year seems like an eternity. I remember thinking, at 18, that the best phase of one’s life ended at 25, that I needed to have things sorted and in place by then, that success (in the not-so-modest way I defined it) had to be realised by then. If not, I would have achieved nothing. Or so I thought.
Expect the unexpected
In the decades since then, I have realised that there is no point in setting certain kinds of time-dependent goals (first novel by 25, first patent by 28, first million by 30). Yes, by all means set goals for yourself, but be realistic about how and when you will achieve them. Most of our aspirations require a number of things to fall into place, and there are things that are beyond one’s control. In addition, as we go through life, we run into unexpected situations that require us to spend time and effort that we had not bargained for. So, even as we may not be progressing towards our pre-set goal, we are actually being productive in other ways — so, it is not all time wasted.
What is important is that we find a way to work steadily towards those goals — and look kindly upon some of those interruptions and distractions. So, let us say you have set out to finish five big things during a particular year. You need to be clear-headed about what time and effort each of those requires, and whether you can realistically do it. Some may depend only on your own discipline while others are contingent on many factors. If you get stuck on the idea that success means finishing all five, then, you are likely to be disappointed. Instead, suppose you set your goals without that deadline in mind. There are some things you want to accomplish. Some must be done within a certain time frame (a degree programme, for instance, or a project). But, others may be done over a longer period, and are more in the nature of aspirations that you will work toward fulfilling over time.
So that is the key. Differentiating between what must be done (and no two ways about allocating time and resources for this) and what can be done, time and resources permitting. My 25-year-old friend should probably go back and re-think his criteria for success and failure, and not blame himself too much.

Paint it green
"," It sometimes happens that a student has something lurking on their application that they know isn’t going to make them look good. It could be a bad grade, a less than stellar test score, a disciplinary infraction, anything that they might be unhappy about in their past that, unfortunately, could affect their future chances future.
The thing about academic dips or issues in a student’s past is that they often have a good explanation, as long as you know the student and their context. But how do you communicate that to a college, who doesn’t know the student? How do you deal with potential red flags, if you have them?
For some students, their response is often to try and hide these issues, adopting the “put your head under the covers and hope the monsters go away approach”. But what works for an ostrich doesn’t work for college applications, and in fact, it ends up making the student look really bad if they have a big issue in their application and they haven’t dealt with it. The most common thing I see is a grade dip, or failing out of a class, and that’s an impossible thing to hide.
Owning up
When I worked with a student who had ended up failing a class, it changed the nature of the degree she would be getting from her school, which meant that she had a lot going on on her application that was important to make clear to a college. It may seem insane to you right now, what I’m about to say, but colleges do actually know that you aren’t perfect. They get it. They know you’ve struggled, and made mistakes, that you aren’t good at everything, that you’ve probably had difficulties dealing with some of your educational challenges. It’s okay to admit that, but how you do it can mean the difference between representing yourself as a mature thoughtful person with a full perspective on their life and… not.
The place you would deal with this would be that elusive tricky “additional information” section of the common application. It’s an optional section, and it was built for things like this. So how do you approach talking about something you know to be a potential problem in your application, something that might tip the scales from admission to rejection?
The first thing you have to remember is that what you are giving is an explanation, not an excuse. Candour, self-awareness and clarity are the watchwords of this concept. You need to talk about your issue, be clear and succinct about the problem, and then talk about how you’ve bounced back since.
So, if your issue was an expulsion from school, you would want to explain why you got expelled.Maybe, you were under stress and you acted out. Or you were dealing with some issues at home and it came out at school. Be honest, take responsibility for what happened, and define the emotional context of the issue without dipping into melodrama.
Then, you would want to talk about what has happened since this issue, how you dealt with this expulsion, how you turned it around, and how you’re back on track.
Remember, this isn’t a diary entry, and it isn’t a pity party. It’s a chance to explain yourself, to own up to your mistakes, and to make it clear that you have learned from them. So treat it seriously, but don’t avoid it. You aren’t defined by one mistake; don’t let your application be overshadowed by it either. It’s only a red flag if you let it be one.

MCI denies approval for final year course in medical college
","Following yearly inspection, the Medical Council of India has recommended that the government need not give approval to the Indira Gandhi Government Medical College and Research Institute to start their final year course.
Every year, before admitting students into the subsequent year, the MCI conducts an inspection of the college to ensure that they have adequate infrastructure and staff. For the past four years, the IGGMCRI has been asked to clarify a number of shortfalls, including the staff shortage as well as the lack of infrastructure.
The Indira Gandhi Government Medical College, which started in 2010, has now applied for approval to start the fifth and final year of the MBBS. Following their inspection, the MCI has written to the Government of India asking that they not approve the college for fifth year admissions. The communication between the MCI and the Government, which is available on the MCI website, however does not state any reason for this.
According to Director of the college P. Jayakumar, the college expected to receive a detailed report within the next week. The report would also be available on the MCI website. There had been no intimation of the issues that the MCI had seen during their inspection and only after the final report could any comment be made, he said.
In a similar case, the MCI had written to the college in 2012 seeking clarifications on some of the deficiencies that the college faced. The main problem listed at the time was a 36 per cent shortage of faculty and a 65 per cent shortage of residents.
According to sources, since then there had been a number of recruitments, but many of the staff had also left the college. The college would wait for the final report before responding to the Government, Dr. Jayakumar said.

Be kind to yourself ","Why did I mess up that exam? I am so stupid. I can’t believe that I lost my passport; I really am scatterbrained. When will I be organised enough to live on my own? Most of my friends know what they are doing after graduation. Only I seem to be dilly-dallying with options. Why can’t I get my act together?
Often, we are our own harshest critics. We hold ourselves to higher standards than our peers and berate ourselves when things go wrong. But, engaging in self-blame does little to repair our situations and only aggravates stress, which, in turn, makes us prone to committing more blunders. 
In fact, research suggests that we may be better off if we are kinder and more compassionate to ourselves.
In an article in The New York Times, writer Kristin Wong quotes psychologist Kristin Neff, who says, “Self-compassion is treating yourself with the same kindness, care and concern you show a loved one.” According to Dr. Neff, self-compassion not only makes us more accepting of our drawbacks but prevents us from amplifying our flaws as well. Learning to view ourselves from a more human lens can actually make us more resilient, contrary to what popular belief might have you think. 
Compassion matters
Many people feel that if they are soft towards themselves, they are being self-indulgent. Further, they worry that kindness towards themselves may lower their standards and make them lethargic. 
But research by Professor Neff and her colleagues, published in Self & Identity, suggest that self-compassion is positively correlated with “mastery goals.” 
In an article in the Oxford Book of Compassionate Science, Kristin Neff and Christopher Garmer lay down three facets of compassion. The first, self-kindness, involves being “supportive and sympathetic toward ourselves” especially in the face of our own drawbacks or failings.
 Instead of criticising our shortcomings, we should exhibit more empathy towards ourselves. Our internal self-talk should be comforting rather than confrontational. 
The second aspect recognises our “common humanity” and provides a humane lens for seeing our foibles and frailties. Further, we accept that strife and struggle is part of the human condition and know that we are never alone in our grief, contrary to what the worrywart in us tells us. The third, mindfulness, allows us to remain in the present moment and view our suffering for what it is. A mindful attitude helps us dissociate ourselves from our thoughts, especially the counterproductive ones, which only serve to increase our pain. 
So, the next time you lose your keys or miss the deadline for an assignment, don’t let your self-critic take over. If your best friend had committed these mistakes, what would you have advised him or her? Exercise the same compassion on yourself. Being kind towards yourself does not make you selfish. Tell yourself that everyone errs at some point or the other, and that’s an essential feature of being human. Also, learn to watch your thoughts without reacting to them in the first instant. You don’t have to believe every thought that arises in your mind. If the relentless critic in you is raising its voice, you can choose to quieten it with softer, soothing thoughts. 
And, if you are feeling low, don’t despair that everyone else has it all together. Suffering and pain is universal. Even if you are feeling singled out for having one of the worst lots in life, know that there are many others who are crying with you. Just as you would reach out to help them heal, do yourself the same favour. You deserve nothing less.

Take the wheel
","Can you believe 2018 is almost over? You read about the umpteen celebrity weddings that took place and it feels like this was the longest year yet; then you think back to your life and it feels like time went by in a flash.
Lately, I have been reflecting on how I spend my time and what I have to show for it. I realise that, looking back at the past week, past month or even the past year (no “Friends” reference intended), life has moved in autopilot. Work, eat, sleep, repeat. The same routine day in and day out, with slightly more emphasis paid on the “eat and sleep” part during the festival season. We are now in December and I have found myself hard-pressed to recall any new skills I have learned, any new opinions I have formed on things that matter, or an activity I’ve done that made a positive difference to someone. When did life get so stagnant?
Silver lining 
On the bright side, if December is here, that means 2019 is around the corner; and what better way to ring in the new year, than by crafting an ambitious set of resolutions that one may or may not (let’s get real, it is most likely may not) follow! If you are stuck in the same rut that I am, consider the following things with me to get your resolutions to stick:
1. Don’t be too harsh on yourself: This is pretty important. No point in crying over spilled coffee. You can have a brand new start to your life any day that you choose. So what if this wasn’t a year of spectacular triumphs for you? Take the bull by the horns and show it who’s boss. In December 2019, the movie poster about your life will say “Running Successfully: 365 days. Raging super hit!”
2. Start small: If you can summon the enthusiasm to make giant leaps in changing your life, then more power to you. However, if you are having starting trouble, why not start small? In my case, I finally downloaded a fitness tracking app to see how active I am through the day. The results have frightened me sufficiently into increasing my step count, and this in turn is the first step towards my healthier avatar.
3. Figure out where your time goes: This takes a bit of discipline but is a rewarding effort. Start by putting down what you want to accomplish for the next 10 days. Then, keep track of what you are doing with your time, the kind of activities you do and so on. At the end of the 10 days, compare your goals to your analysis of your time. Did you achieve what you set out to do? What kind of activities hogged the most space? What do you need to start deprioritising in order to make room for something more important? Then, run the same activity again for the next 10 days, this time making an effort to incorporate the changes to your schedule, and review your results.
Turning off autopilot mode and taking control is one of the hardest things to do because you are already comfortably ensconced in a set routine, but once you take the plunge, you will be glad you did.

A sense of self "," In Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, Dumbledore tells Harry, “It is our choices that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities.” As Potterheads well know, the venerable headmaster’s words often hold lessons not just for getting through the difficult years of school, but for life. At first glance, it’s the sort of thing that an elder tells a young person, and the sort of thing a young person tends to dismiss. But it’s also the sort of thing that needs to be unpacked, thought about, and internalised.
We tend to think of abilities as features of personality, either innate or acquired. We may describe them as talents, skills, or aptitudes, but in general we are talking about what we are good at or can do relatively easily and well. Some of us are good with language, or numbers, or art, music or sports, and while excellence in any of these areas demands practice and persistence, we come to think of these as part of who we are. Thinking of ourselves as having certain abilities can be a definite confidence booster, and there is something to be said for recognising — and doing — what we are good at.
Complicated
But the first part of Dumbledore’s statement complicates it all somewhat. If our abilities — the building blocks of our persona — don’t show who we are, then what does? Our sense of self draws from a complex set of features, some of which (depending on our beliefs) are taken to be hereditary and others a product of environment, opportunity and nurturing. I’m not going into the big question of how and why these “abilities” come to be, but let’s assume for the moment that we have them and are aware of them. So, then, how do our choices — and not abilities — determine who we are?
Looking at it this way moves us away from the deterministic, or fatalistic, approach that makes one say: “Oh, that’s the way I am, so I can’t help it.” Or: “I’m made this way, I can’t do any better/different.” Dumbledore would see this as a cop-out. Instead, we need to look at how we use those abilities at any given time. You may be an excellent communicator, gifted with the ability to move people with your words. You could choose a career that uses this ability to speak or write in a way that educates and clarifies the world for others. Or you could choose to work with words in a way that persuades in not so straightforward ways. Those who possess extraordinary physical strength can use it either to create or destroy — it’s the same muscles that are used in both cases, to different ends.
Implications
Choice doesn’t only have to do with abilities of this kind — the very possibility of choice also contains within it several directions in which one might go, each with a different set of implications. It’s worthwhile considering what different options mean — for yourself and for others (and, where pertinent, for the world in general). Our choices may be constrained by many external factors, but we need to get away from the idea that they are constrained by “the way we are”! If there’s one thing in the world we can change, it is, possibly, the way we are.

The bailout was the last hope
","  What is the difference between ‘bailout’ and ‘bale out’? (Prabhu Kumar, Arakkonam)
It is also possible to spell ‘bale’ as ‘bail’. The phrasal verb ‘bail/bale out’ has several different meanings. When a pilot ‘bails out’, he jumps out of the plane wearing a parachute; he does this because there is something seriously wrong with the aircraft. The expression also has the meaning, to help someone who is in trouble. When you bail someone out, you help them get out of the jam they are in — usually, financial. When you ‘bail someone out of jail’, for example, you pay money for his release. The expression can also be used to mean to go back on your word; to go back on something that you had committed to — you do this in order to avoid a problem or some difficulty. These are just some of the meanings of the expression.
The aircraft went down very quickly. The pilot didn’t have time to bail out.
 Nitin promised to lend me the money, but at the last minute bailed out.
You get into trouble all the time. I am not going to bail you out of the next one.
The word ‘bailout’, on the other hand, is mostly used as a noun to refer to the money or financial assistance usually given by the government to organisations/industries, that are on the verge of going bankrupt. This is usually done in the hope that the loan will help the company recover. A ‘bailout’ can be given to a person, an organisation and to countries as well. 
Unless there is a government bailout, the textile industry will fold. 
How is the word ‘consummate’ pronounced in ‘consummate liar’? (K.Janani, Bengaluru)
There are several ways of pronouncing this rather formal word. One way is to pronounce the first syllable like the word ‘con’. The vowels in the second and third syllables can be pronounced like the ‘a’ in ‘China’. The word is pronounced ‘KON-se-met’ with the stress on the first syllable. It comes from the Latin ‘consummatus’ meaning ‘complete’ or ‘perfected’. Dictionaries define the word as ‘perfect or complete in every way’. The word can also be used to refer to someone who displays a great deal of skill at doing something. When used as a verb, the final syllable is pronounced like the word ‘mate.
Don’t believe a word that Vikram says. He is a consummate liar. 
 After her retirement, Nina led a life of consummate happiness. 
Do the two sentences ‘I won’t work for just anybody’ and ‘I won’t work for anybody’ have the same meaning? (C.Devender, Chennai)
No, they do not; they have different meanings. When you say, ‘I won’t work for anybody’, what you are suggesting is that you are not willing to work under someone. Perhaps, you want to be your own boss. Whatever the case may be, you are unwilling to work for or under someone. The second sentence, ‘I won’t work for just anybody’ suggests that you are willing to work under someone, but the person — your potential boss — has to be good at what he or she does. He or she needs to be someone who is well known or has a good reputation. You will not work for any Tom, Dick or Harry.
After 20 years in the field, I’m not going to work for just anybody.

Staying ahead, education-wise "," Spot the similarities between Netflix, PayTM, Instagram, iPads and AirBnB — We can hardly live without them today, none of them are regular words in the English language, and none of them existed 10 years ago.
 However, the last one amazes me the most. These companies that provide income to thousands of people everyday, were mere pipe dreams 10 years ago. Back then, a student wanting to be a “game designer” would be asked to “Be more practical”. There were no bachelor’s courses in data science or digital marketing. How then, was a student graduating supposed to know that her passion for fiddling could be fashioned into toy design? Or that writing could make him a leading blogger one day? How do students graduating today know what the future might hold? Here’s a quick look at what the trends add up to.
What is happening 
The big change-makers are automation, artificial intelligence, globalisation, among many more. This is expected to slow down job growth for manual labourers, factory workers, tellers, security personnel, and others. But, automation is not an enemy. It is an enabler that frees human beings from repetitive labour. Here are the exciting areas that these trends indicate growth in:
Creative fields: Rising income means more people with time and money to invest in life’s higher pleasures such as painting, sculpture, films, and so on.With budget for events going through the roof, enterprising performers will find avenues to showcase their art. Online markets for paintings and stock photographs have opened up avenues for many budding and amateur artists.
Healthcare: Life expectancy has increased by about 30 years since 1841, and healthcare continues to be a major growth area. Cheaper health insurance, multispecialty hospitals, and so on are expected to expand the reach of global healthcare.The demand for doctors, nurses, and medical researchers is expected to boom.
 Investing in education: This leads to increasing demand for school teachers, tutors and education counsellors such as Byju’s in India, Changingedu in China, and Tutor Group in Taiwan.
Scientific research:  Increasing investment in biotechnology (think organ culture, genetically modified foods, and performance enhancement drugs), renewable resources and reducing toxic waste.
Media gets bigger: The Internet has exploded the speed and reach of media — be it news, short film,animation, serials, or advertising. With over one billion websites on the Internet, over five billion Youtube videos being watched every day, and Netflix releasing over 700 original series just this year, media has captured eyeballs and mindspace across the world.
Technology:  Automated assistants that buy gifts for your mom’s birthday, smarthomes that turn off lights, health monitors that call your doctor and cars that deftly avoid pedestrians on roads — none of these are science fiction today. Data analysts, interface designers, game developers and cyber security experts will be in demand, especially those who keep upgrading their skills.
Managers and strategists:  Marketing insights, advertising gimmicks, leadership training and strategy consulting will remain game-changers. Leaders who think out-of-the-box will remain at the top. 
Builders have to build: As people throng cities, rush to work and fly to holiday resorts, the demand for better homes, roads, hotels, malls, and more. Architects, urban planners, civil engineers, interior designers and art consultants all contribute to creating increasingly dense, utilitarian and beautiful spaces.
And lastly, the market swells for personal service and personal consultants — therapists, image consultants, hair stylists, masseurs, gardeners and even dog trainers that work for individuals to make their high-tech, fast-changing lives more fun and productive.

For the love of art
"," In 2016, a casual discussion amongst a group of art enthusiasts resulted in a question — could a platform be created where artists all over the world could perform, and art lovers could have the chance to experience the beauty of their various art forms in a very unique way?
After a year of brainstorming and research into the minds of art lovers around the world, they hit upon an idea. With the intention of becoming a shared community for both online and offline art lovers to present, co-create and promote art around the world, the team of artists created Meraki Arts Hub. One of their first initiatives was Meraki Circles, where they could curate different art-based events. From that came the concept “Let’s Emote” — a one-of-a-kind event, where, for the first time in the world, they matched arts with emotions. They wanted to conduct an experiment — what if they, through art, could make their audience extremely happy and then extremely sad? How would they feel?
Evoking emotion 
The show, held on June 30, consisted of a series of art forms, each designed to invoke a particular emotion from the audience. “When you watch a movie, you experience an emotional overload. What is challenging is telling you the emotion in prior, then making sure you experience it. Here, for each art, we tell you beforehand what emotion will be evoked in you. Each act in the show will evoke one emotion, and at the end, with all of them combined — you will have experienced an emotional roller coaster,” says Prasanna Bharati R, one of the team’s founders.
Throughout the show, the audience was led through tragedy, sadness and anger, resulting in thunderous applause and a whirlwind of emotions when the curtains came down.
Through their other initiative, COFEE — Conservative of Future Entertaining Entrepreneurs, Team Meraki wishes to create an open and interactive community where any member of the public, if struck by an inspiring artistic idea he wishes to work on, can approach them with the idea, and if they wish, partner with Team Meraki to implement the idea.
Currently, Meraki Arts Hub is run by two teams — one in Chennai and one in Hyderabad. Several people in both teams are currently students, and all of them are artists in some way. “We have theatre artists, photojournalists, dancers, musicians, actors, and poets. We give students who are art lovers internships in fields such as graphic design, where they can experience what we do by helping out with sets and posters”, says Prasanna. “Anyone in the team can come up with any idea related to art. The idea is discussed, voted on, and if it gets votes from the team, we move on to the implementation phase. After that, each idea is given ownership to members of our team, and the team will discuss whether it is business-feasible or not”.
Looking further 
So, what is in store for the future? “We started off with ‘Let’s Emote’, and we are taking the show to different places. Every last Saturday in a month, we do a different show in Chennai, Hyderabad or Bengaluru. We are planning a show in Australia in September, and another show in the U.K., and one in the U.S. We plan to take the show to colleges and prepare each show with a college-level twist. We are also working with a few production houses right now to produce web series, with a series of very interesting topics that we hope will appeal to the Chennai audience. 
“We want to sustain art. We believe that there are two kinds of people in the world — those who know and love what art is, and those who don’t. We want to convert them to art lovers. We are experimenting to see if we can make the world love art, and if all of us can win,” concludes Prasanna.

Engineering goes creative
","
What are the things the college will bring to students that are new and useful?

Mahindra Ecole Centrale is a collaboration of Mahindra group with Ecole Centrale Paris, which is the national engineering college of Paris, and Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University (JNTU), Hyderabad. There will be four streams: Civil, Mechanical, Electrical and Electronics and Computer Science, but the system makes sure that the student knows a bit of everything before specialising. Students pass out with a B.Tech and an integrated MTech degree.
Every student will spend time at foreign universities. Ecole Centrale has tie-ups for this with 126 colleges around the world, including in places like China, Europe, USA etc. Students will spend the ninth semester there.

What will be the role of the Department of Creative Sciences?

The Department of Creative Sciences will at the outset get the students to see the connection between a. Natural Sciences; b. Creative Sciences; c. Technological Sciences and d. Management Sciences. In the area of creative sciences we will see how ‘creative’ artists and society have interacted/cohered with each other through literature, music, dance, painting etc in order to see the various synergies happening between societal forces and technological developments, often thrust into one’s life. Yet people have learnt to accept it or worked actively to reject it too. Imagine studying a film like Chaplin’s “Modern Times” or Dickens’ ‘A Tale of Two Cities’ or Gulzar’s modernist poems to understand the context.

Will the students be examined in the above courses?

Of course, there will be standard textbooks and assigned film viewings on which they will have to write assignments, debate in conferences and make competent short films also. There will also be a mandatory French language and culture course.
The slightly long-term goal is to develop a full-fledged Digital Media Technology department with a proper course structure, syllabus, labs and faculty specifications.

Is there only a five-year M.Tech programme on offer? Will admission to the programme be based on the JEE (Main) score? How much will school marks matter?

At the outset there is only a compulsory integrated programme lasting five years offering both a B.Tech and an M.Tech, to match with the qualification system offered by Ecole Centrale. Every student should have cleared his or her JEE Main which makes them fit for the IITs or NITs. They may start applying earlier and keep their options open. Since all applications are only happening online, they can go in and update it as much as they want till the closing date.

When will the full strength of faculty be recruited and when will the first batch begin their classes?

The first classes for Batch 1 will start on August 4. And the full faculty strength should be in place by May end.

You mentioned that bank loans are guaranteed for the students. Would you elaborate on this and the fee structure?

Every student who gets an admission is guaranteed a bank loan if they do not have the financial capacity. These loans are repayable 5 years after they graduate. Most importantly every graduating student is assured placement by MEC in some organisation or the other, in India or abroad. The Mahindra Group is large enough to absorb the graduates and will ensure that no student is left behind!

Please give us an idea of the fee structure and the number of seats.

The fee for the course will be about Rs. 4 lakh per annum and students are sure to get loans repayable five years after graduation. In total, there will be 180 seats in all for Indian students (60 each for Computer Science and Mechanical and 30 each for Civil and Electronics) and 27 seats for foreign students. The student-teacher ratio will be 10:1.

82 per cent students pass out from Krishna College
","Dr. V.S. Krishna Government College (Autonomous) has recorded a pass percentage of 82 in degree final examinations this year. Of the total 454 students, who appeared for the final year examination, 374 came out with flying colours. The pass percentage of different groups comprises B.A. 91, B.Com 84, B.Sc (Maths) 81 and B.Sc (Biology) 74.
Announcing the results at a press conference here on Friday, principal V. Chandra Sekhar said: “It’s only three years since the college got the autonomous status. Although we are happy about the fact that the pass percentage for the last few years has been satisfactory, our focus is more on its improvement”
It was an emotional moment for the students who understood the fact that nothing comes easy. “Studying five hours a day after college hours helped me excel in academics. You need to stay focused and plan your goal in advance so that you will face less stress during examinations,” Ch. Kalyani Pavani, final year student said.
While some of the students said they were confident about their marks, a few of them expressed apprehensions about the new format of the Andhra University Common Entrance Test – 2014. “We are absolutely clueless as far as the pattern of the test is concerned. We wish we had little clarity on the model paper and study material so that we can keep pace with the competition,” a student from Paderu Ch. Murali Krishna said.
The first and second year degree results will be announced by the month-end, he saidRector of Andhra University E.A. Narayana and Controller of Examinations K. Samrajyalakshmi and college’s Controller of Examinations Y.V.K. Durga Prasad along with the staff were present.

Erasing the margins
"," 



The MAEF schemes which include both grants-in-aid for construction of schools and scholarships to minority girls to pursue their education further, act as an impetus to empower these girls socially and economically. MAEF has provided 1,15,000 scholarships in 2017-18 alone and if this trend continues, it wouldn’t be long before literacy rate of minority girls’ population begins to alter substantially to a positive statistic.




When I first came across this scheme which has helped meritorious girls from minority communities since 2003-04, benefiting 3.89 lakh girls with about ₹392 crores in total, I wished I had known about it earlier so that my friends could have also benefited from it. This has always been the problem with the schemes — unawareness among prospective beneficiaries, mainly because of insufficient and inefficient advertisement.




 The extension of allowances which has increased to ₹10,000 and ₹12,000 for girls of classes IX-X, and XI-XII, is a commendable move. I hope that this scheme is advertised properly, especially in small towns and villages and girls who aspire to study can finally do so. Those who were denied education earlier and instead asked to help at home will for once be able to fulfill their dreams and see their dreams become a reality soon. 




Minority education should be promoted because it is a part of the fundamental rights — cultural and minority rights in Article 24 of the Indian Constitution. The government should take necessary measures to promote education with many such incentives. It goes with the spirit of deferential but equal treatment, to make sure that education be equally available for everyone irrespective of caste and creed.

Don’t be a desperado "," 
What is the difference between ‘spat’ and ‘argument’? (B Mallika, Secunderabad)
In both cases, there is a disagreement about something between two individuals or two groups of individuals. ‘Spat’ is mostly used in informal contexts to refer to a quarrel about something trivial. The word, which can be used both as a noun and a verb, also carries with it the sense that the fight or quarrel did not last too long. In a spat, people usually lose their temper. This is not necessarily true in case of an ‘argument’; it is possible for two people to have an argument without any shouting. The duration of an argument can vary — it can be long or short. Also, in an argument, people may choose to convince the other individual by appealing to logic. A ‘spat’ is usually an emotional outburst.
Neeraja had a spat with her teenage daughter in the hotel lobby.
Ramu used to spat with his sister almost every day.
The students got into an argument with the police.
How is the word ‘desperado’ pronounced? (T Jagdish, Erode)
The ‘es’ in the first syllable sounds like the ‘es’ in ‘less’, ‘yes’ and ‘mess’; the vowel in the second, sounds like the ‘a’ in ‘china’. The ‘a’ in the third syllable sounds like the ‘a’ in ‘bath’, ‘path’ and ‘task’, and the final syllable rhymes with ‘no’, ‘so’ and ‘go’. The word is pronounced ‘des-pe-RAA-doe’ with the stress on the third syllable. There are many theories about the origin of this word. According to some scholars, it comes from the Spanish ‘desperado’ meaning a desperate or reckless individual; a criminal who is prone to violence and who is not unduly worried about the consequences of his action. Others believe it comes from the English ‘desperate’; a word which was once used both as a noun and an adjective.
Desperados frequented the seedy bar in the small town.
A couple of desperados robbed the priest.
What is the meaning of ‘pittance’? (S. Shalini, Nellore)
This rather informal word rhymes with ‘kittens’ and ‘mittens’. When you say that your salary or allowance is ‘pittance’, what you are suggesting is that it is not much; it is a meagre amount. You do not make enough to make ends meet. In your opinion, and perhaps in the opinion of others, you deserve to be paid a lot more.
Das needed cash; he ended up selling the house for a pittance.
For the amount of work Geetha does, she’s getting paid pittance.
The word was originally used to refer to the generous sum of money that rich people left for priests and monasteries. In return, on the occasion of the death anniversary, the priests/monks prayed for the departed soul of the patron. The pittance was used to buy food and wine. With the passage of time, the word took on a negative meaning because the amount of money willed to the religious institutions became smaller and smaller — they became paltry.
Which is correct? ‘Let’s go to the cinema’ or ‘Lets go to the movie’? (J Praveen, Tiruchi)
If what you want to suggest is ‘Let’s go to the cinema hall and watch a film’, then ‘Let’s go the cinema’ is correct. It is mostly used in British English. Americans, on the other hand, say ‘Let’s go to the movies’ and not ‘movie’.
Shyam and Vidya are going to the cinema/movies this weekend.

Big recruitments in banks to continue
","Recruitments in the banking sector that have been big in recent years, generating considerable interest among job-seekers, are set to remain so for the next few years as well. This, however, does not make it any easy for the aspirants as with bank jobs gaining currency, the competition is also hotting up.
Indeed, it is intense as the Institute of Banking Personnel Selection (IBPS), which conducts recruitment examination on behalf of public sector banks, says the number of applications received has been a whopping 1 crore a year for the last two years. The number of posts was 50,000 on an average a year. The break-up, sources associated with the recruitment process say, is 20,000 officers and 30,000 clerical cadre posts.
It is in this backdrop a Bangalore-based firm, with which many past and present bankers are associated, recently introduced an e-learning programme to train the candidates. Unveiling the course and website of BReT Solutions Private Ltd., Canara Bank chairman and managing director R.K. Dubey underscored the significance of better preparation for the candidates.
Other speakers, including non-executive chairman of Karnataka Bank Ananthakrishna, said with the examinations being conducted online, the candidates need to tune themselves from that perspective too.
Canara Bank recruitment this fiscal, Mr. Dubey said, was likely to exceed last year’s 7,800. State Bank of India was planning an online exam around June for selecting 1,897 probationary officers. A key reason for the massive recruitment in the banking sector is the growing emphasis on financial inclusion — spreading to unbanked areas. With many employees who joined in 1970s retiring, more posts are falling vacant.

Popular choice

A senior banker, who did not want to be identified, attributed the popularity of bank jobs to the reasonable salaries, job security, improved status in society and the opportunity to serve customers. Recruitment by public sector banks was 50,000 for the past two years. The same pattern would continue for three more years, he added.
In terms of applications, there seems to be more from Bihar and States where job opportunities were relatively less compared with States where employment was available in manufacturing and services sectors. On the level of competition, the senior banker said the date of birth was the decider when hundreds of candidates were tied at the same score. Seniority in age gets them the job.
On the competition, a senior executive of BReT Solutions said that according to IBPS figures only 10 per cent of the estimated 2 crore candidates who took the examination got selected for interview. Of them, a mere 2.3 per cent got the final selection notice.
Chairman and managing director of BReT Solutions Ashok Hegde, a former general manager of Karnataka Bank, said in the absence of proper training, clearing the examinations was not easy.

It’s festive season
","What is the difference in meaning between ‘disburse’ and ‘disperse’? (Janani, Chennai) 
The stress in both words is on the second syllable; it rhymes with ‘curse’, ‘purse’ and ‘nurse’. ‘Disperse’ is normally used to mean to scatter or spread something over a wide area. It can also suggest that the thing being scattered is going in different directions. Things (clouds, seeds, and so on), as well as people, can be dispersed. ‘Disburse’, on the other hand, is mostly used in the context of money. When someone ‘disburses’ money, he is distributing it; he is paying someone. The word comes from the French ‘desbourser’ meaning to spend or ‘take money from the purse’. ‘Bourse’ means ‘purse’, and this perhaps explains why the treasurer of a college is usually called a ‘bursar’. He is the ‘bursarius’ or ‘purse bearer’ — someone who has access to the money. 
The police managed to disperse the unruly mob of students in ten minutes.
The funds for the project will be disbursed sometime next week.
How is the word ‘fete’ pronounced? (Sharoon, Bengaluru) 
Whether the word is used as a noun or a verb, most people pronounce it like the word ‘fate’. This is the standard pronunciation. In American English, however, some people make it rhyme with ‘set’, ‘pet’ and ‘get’. ‘Fete’ comes from the Old French ‘feste’ meaning ‘feast, celebration’. When used as a noun, it refers to an outdoor public event. These events are usually held to raise money for a charity. To ensure that the people who come to these events have a good time, the organisers have lots of food and refreshments on sale; they may also provide entertainment. In American English, any form of outdoor celebration is called ‘fete’. When used as a verb, ‘fete’ means to honour or praise someone publicly for their achievements. 
The author was surprised when the members of the media decided to fete him.
The church fete is tomorrow. Will you be coming?
What is the meaning and origin of ‘beware of Greeks bearing gifts’? (R. Uma, Tiruchi) 
This is a translation of a Latin expression that first appeared in Virgil’s ‘Aeneid’. When the invading Greeks find that they cannot conquer the city of Troy, they resort to trickery. They build a huge wooden horse and leave it near the city. The Trojans, believing that the horse is a peace offering, decide to drag it into the city of Troy. But a few among them caution the King that the Greeks are not to be trusted — that a wiser course of action would be to set the wooden horse on fire. Common sense does not prevail and the huge animal is dragged into the city of Troy amid wild celebrations. At night, the Greek soldiers hiding inside the horse slip out and open the gates; making it easy for the rest of the soldiers to enter Troy and capture the city. The expression, ‘beware of Greeks bearing gifts’ is mostly used to caution or warn someone that the enemy is not to be trusted. If the enemy is suddenly nice to you, do not trust him — you should become suspicious, instead. Like the Greeks, the enemy may have an ulterior motive. 
When I told my brother that my rival has been extremely nice to me all of a sudden, he said, ‘Beware of Greeks bearing gifts’.

Second home Down Under
"," I’m happy to call Adelaide my home away from home. I am currently pursuing my final year of the Master of Speech Pathology programme at Flinders University which is located in South Australia. 
I chose this city as my study destination for a number of reasons, the main being my course. The Speech Pathology programme is one of the only programmes with a problem-based learning curriculum where we learn all our topics through case studies. I personally enjoy this method of learning and I am able to implement what I learn during my clinical placements in different health and education settings. As the university functions in conjunction with the hospital, Flinders Medical Centre, we have many opportunities to access and learn the different aspects of Medical Speech Pathology.
Extra-curriculars 
 Our main campus is situated on a hill and this promotes fitness with the need for frequent walks up and down the hill but you are rewarded with amazing views of the city and the sea. There is access to many free and helpful services such as those for careers, student learning and health. The university also encourages professional development apart from the set curriculum and the Horizon Development Programme, which I am a part of, awards students who pursue such with extracurricular opportunities.
Some of the other reasons that made me choose Adelaide were the affordable cost of living, the multi-cultural environment, and the support for international students. Adelaide has kept up all these promises and offered a lot more. There is something for everyone here, a range of cuisines to taste, if you are a foodie, conservation parks and trails for people who enjoy the outdoors, art galleries and cultural performances for the artistically-oriented and a good mix of both beautiful hills and beaches.
The people have been extremely kind and welcoming thus making the move away from home a lot easier for me. Specific organisations such as StudyAdelaide, the universities Student Association and the International Students Office provided me with opportunities to relax, attend fun events and support holistic student well-being. If you ever happen to feel homesick, you could always participate in the different events conducted by the active and vast Indian community here.
I have been able to easily adapt to the Australian way of life and study and I am thoroughly enjoying my time here. I would encourage students to consider study in the beautiful and friendly city.

Planning the future ","I studied Architecture in Mumbai University. It used to take me around two hours to reach college, thanks to the Mumbai traffic. The serious lack of planning in Mumbai made me realise that I wanted to pursue a career in planning, to be able to transform and improve the conditions that people live in. 
I chose the country, Australia, first before choosing the university. The Australian policies and strategic planning inspired me to want to go there and study. University of New South Wales (UNSW) is the best university there that offers a course on Master of City Planning. 
Another thing that inspired me to go there was that I was selected for the Future of Change scholarship. I had to submit a two minute video on how a scholarship at UNSW will help me achieve my aspirations. I think that pretty much summed up the start of my journey to the campus there. 
The master of city planning course is well structured and helps you develop your planning knowledge alongside choosing from the various specialisations that the university has to offer. Apart from studying, I also work as an architectural graduate at an urban planning consultancy in Sydney, alongside tutoring a bachelor of planning course at the university. 
Living on campus
UNSW has a really great campus. It is very different than what it was in Mumbai. Living on campus has made me manage my time well, and I think I’ve become more independent. Tutoring has also helped me improve my communication skills, and it makes me realise that trying matters. And that it’s not just about learning, but being able to teach others what you’ve learnt. 
The main difference that I found in Australia is that there is no hierarchy in the educational institutions. We don’t address the professors as “Sir” or “Ma’am” there. We can call them by their names, and it’s not rude! 
So far, it has been a great experience. The programme is flexible which allows me to explore the city, tutor and work as well. I even had the opportunity to meet the Australian Prime Minister, which was one of the greatest experience that I had. 
I plan on working in Sydney to gain exposure before returning to Mumbai and implement what I’ve studied at UNSW and contribute towards the infrastructural planning in the city.

On the digital highway
","While we have seen currency changing forms — coins to paper and now the newer crypto variants — knowledge and education continue to remain the most important currency of every society. India is no exception. With a growing urban base, increasing Internet penetration, and rising millennial population, India is on the cusp of a major digital transformation. 
E-learning has the potential to be a harbinger of social change in India. With more than 400 million Internet users and more than 330 million connected smartphone users, and being a country for the second most social site users, India has immense opportunity to grow and tap the potential of technology in the field of education. 
Breaking barriers
There is an increasing realisation that initiatives like Digital India will have a major role to play in shaping e-learning in India. With focus on delivering education through digital platform, there is an opportunity to access learning sources through a global platform, providing accessibility to teachers as well as students, which can break socio-economic barriers to gaining quality education. 
However, to achieve the same, there is a need to have a targeted approach to improving education through digitisation. Integrating technology to our large and complex school system can have a major impact. In the academic field, development of e-learning teaching strategies that encourage greater engagement and also take into consideration different learning styles can help improve teaching effectiveness and academic achievement. 
Culture of learning 
The rate at which new technologies are being developed and adopted around the world is accelerating. While this acceleration of change gives us new opportunities to improve the learning process, we must not ignore what we have learned about good pedagogy from centuries of experience. 
Looking back, we have the example of equity and quality of education in ancient India which is unparalleled. From higher philosophy, which was usually referred as darshan shastra, to subjects like literature and science, vocational training had a very important place in our ancient education system. 
In medieval times, different education models were experimented with. However, the core system remained resilient and unchanged. In India, close relationship existed between the pupil and the teacher. 
The teacher paid individual attention on his students and taught them according to their aptitude and capability. We also find evidence of modern day skills deeply embedded in our ancient education system, such as memorisation, critical analysis, introspection, storytelling, hands-on method, and seminars. 
Way forward
The next few years will see India leapfrog in the field of education aided by technology. In the journey of reshaping education in India, it is important that a structure is put in place. There is a need for collective and equitable public-private partnership to address the large gap. 
The ecosystem should be spruced up to make teaching a profession of choice and not something that ‘happened by chance’. Teachers should be empowered in terms of improved competencies, better growth opportunities, and a sense of fulfilment. Furthermore, the education system should support the start-up ecosystem, and learning should be geared towards competencies. 
Much like in e-commerce and telecom models, we are seeing innovations and ideas that are India-specific. And these very ideas will increase the relevance of content, delivery, and access across the country. 
This will, in turn, lend itself to shaping the global e-learning industry as well. We are surely looking at exciting times ahead!

MBBS curriculum revised after 21 years
","From August 2019, students graduating from medical colleges in the country will be trained not just to be good clinicians but also good communicators. After a gap of 21 years, the Medical Council of India (MCI) on Friday finalised the new undergraduate curriculum that acknowledges the importance of ethics, responsiveness to needs of patients and their families, and communication skills.
The MCI’s Board of Governors approved the document, which revisits the 1997 syllabus in context of emerging diseases and scientific advances. The revised document has been put up on the MCI website.
“The new undergraduate curriculum regulations are more learner-centric, patient-centric, gender-sensitive, outcome-oriented, and environment appropriate. The result is an outcome-driven curriculum, which conforms to global trends,” says the three-volume curriculum document.
Called ‘Competency-based UG Curriculum for the Indian Medical Graduate’, the new syllabus marks a radical shift from old times when rote and classroom learning was the norm in MBBS training.
V.K. Paul, Chairperson of the MCI Board of Governors, told The Hindu on Saturday that a course called Attitude, Ethics and Communication (AETCOM), which will run across all the years of MBBS, is a new addition to the syllabus. “The emphasis now is more on training students in communicating effectively with patients, and counselling people for organ donations or other challenging procedures. For example, they will be assessed on how well they handle patient relations in sensitive situations, offer care, and obtain consent. All these things will count along with competencies and skills,” Dr. Paul said.
“In a first, the new curriculum provides clinical exposure to students in the very first year instead of the second. A month-long foundation course has been introduced to help students from diverse backgrounds transition better. The foundation course seeks to prepare students for the MBBS duration,” Dr. Paul said.
Another new element is the introduction of elective subjects. Now, students can pick subjects of their choice. Dedicated time has been allotted for self-directed learning and co-curricular activities. 
The new curriculum also encourages the use of medical mannequins and models for clinical learning even though the use of human cadavers for anatomy training will continue. 
There will be more emphasis on mental health and public health. 
Stating that students need to be trained in soft skills, especially in communication, K.S. Ravindranath, former Vice-Chancellor of the Rajiv Gandhi University of Health Sciences in Karnataka, said introduction of early clinical exposure and electives, apart from focus on doctor-patient relationship, will be a game-changer.

A solution mindset? What’s that?
","The organisation I work in, recently conducted a conference for which planning had started more than six months ago. Thanks to impeccable attention to detail and early discussions, it was a success. Not that there weren’t challenges, but we had a bunch of people with ‘solution mind-sets’ who solved them for us. 
Life comes with its share of problems — at work and at home. But, the key to dealing with them is to look for solutions that work, and help us overcome these problems. Sometimes, it may not be a perfect solution, but it may help us tide over a tough situation. And that is where a ‘solution mind-set’ — an attitude that always focuses on solving problems, rather than getting stuck when challenges arise — is rather handy. Of course, I am not referring to anything or anyone who is unrealistic and may propose impractical solutions, but to people with practical ideas. 
We before ‘I’
I have a particular colleague in mind when I write this. It has always been a joy to work with him because of his exemplary positivity and solution-powered thinking. Whenever any problem crops up, even under the heaviest pressure, he is cool, calm, collected and always smiling. Whenever I have approached him with a request or a challenge, his response has always been, “We will take care of it… don’t worry.” And these are never empty words or promises. He always follows this up with a resolute action which reassures me every single time. He even inspires me to think of the brighter side of things. Such an attitude not only helps you to seek solutions, but also helps the people around you. 
This quality or skill is especially relevant today when communications, relationships, and all sorts of interactions are becoming increasingly infused with technological advancements. Experiences are becoming dehumanised, automated and programmed. A solution mind-set, combined with positive thinking, enhances relationships, inspires human beings and truly makes a difference to another individual. Such an attitude has the power to turn even the dullest day into a pleasant one. 
This is why we need to cultivate this skill consciously and proactively, to improve experiences and relationships at work and in life. While it is imperative to develop and demonstrate analytical skills, logical reasoning and critical thinking, we need teams that excel in finding solutions and positivity as well. 
When things go wrong at work, we need cool, calm minds that help all of us focus on finding solutions rather than people who will pull us further down. Of course, post mortems are required once the crisis has passed. 
Perhaps management schools and corporate training departments will do well to include a module or course in solution mind-set and positivity. As the year comes to a close, it is time to start nurturing this skill which will always be in vogue. With more individuals like my colleague, we can achieve more in the New Year and years to come.

 Teaching through games would be a good decision to innovate the classroom experience for students. These techniques are already popular in countries like Japan and the U.S. They could also be successful in Indian education following the current trend where outdated rot learning does not help the students in the long run.

Paras Rajput, Graduate, BCA, IP University, Dwarka
 In gaming, the most important aspect that students learn is perseverance and acceptance of failure only to do better. Learning through games may become an efficient step in making students learn to deal with everyday hurdles and mental stress. This can also become a way to deal with the rising problems of suicide among students due to failure.

Vishika Rajput, II, Hotel Management, Ambedkar Institute of Hotel Management, Chandigarh
 While most of the technologies are transforming education into a fun mode of learning, it is also depleting the physical activities and practical ways of learning in day to day life. Completely focusing their attention on screens in an early age of schooling might become a problem. Therefore, efforts should be made to come up with a more balanced schooling system.

Anirudh Goel, III, Environmental Engineering, DTU, New Delhi
 It will help to revolutionise the learning and classroom experience. As per a research, playing video games can change the brain regions responsible for attention and visuospatial skills and make them more efficient. This in turn induces an environment of competition and enhances productivity transforming the scenario of a burden free classroom, prioritising knowledge and skills.

Beat those exam blues "," Test anxiety is an intrinsic part of the Indian high-school experience. Stress levels reach their peak during class XII and remain the same until entrance exams end, till a college admission is secured. The National Eligibility-cum Entrance Test (NEET) is one such entrance exam attempted by students aspiring to pursue medical and dental courses. The result for this exam was announced on June 4, set off a whirlwind of emotions across the country.
One of the main reasons behind the immense pressure felt by students writing NEET is the increasing competition, which has culminated in a fixation to perform well, academically. Often, mental and emotional health is completely disregarded, when the focus on scoring is deemed paramount. “Many schools tend to disregard mental health and emotional intelligence as the focus is entirely on scoring. The system has to change to accommodate different kinds of learners,” says Mina Dilip, a child psychologist from Chennai.
Gap year option 
Another practice that is becoming progressively common among NEET students is opting for a gap year after class XII to improve scores. “I had no choice but to take another year to study, and I am happy I made that decision. I would have missed out on so many experiences in my final years of school if I had spent all my time preparing for exams,” says Karan S. Cheeran, a NEET candidate from Kerala.
This practice seems to stem from a sense of being overwhelmed, which is one of the many indicators of stress. While stress has inevitably become a customary part of student life, it is imperative that one is aware of the fine line between what is considered ‘normal’ and what could be potentially toxic. “Fatigue, irritability, loss of interest in social activities, appetite, and disturbed or inadequate sleep are a few signs to watch out for. When parents notice these changes, they must keep an eye on their child. If a child mentions feeling overwhelmed, or expresses a desire to get away, immediate professional help must be sought,” says Mina Dilip.
Parents play a crucial role in this process; simply having their support can significantly alleviate stress. “My parents were hesitant about the break year at first, but I was persistent about it. So, they were supportive towards the end. That was one thing less for me to worry about,”says Meghna John, a NEET candidate from Chennai. 
“Students must prioritise their physical and mental health. They must maintain a healthy balance between academic pursuits and overall health and fitness. Little things such as following a good diet, taking adequate rest, and engaging in daily physical activity can go a long way during exam time. Preparing well in advance can help ease the anxiety and yield better results,” believes Mina Dilip.

Q1. In April 1932, a prominent Indian businessman, who was also an aviation enthusiast, won a contract to carry mail for Imperial Airways, and the aviation department of his empire was formed with two de Havilland Puss Moths. The first flight was from Karachi to Bombay, piloted by his friend Nevill Vintcent, on October 15, 1932, and later expanded to commercial flights.
After World War II, regular commercial service resumed under a new name, and later, 49% of the company was bought by the Government. After a bleak period financially, efforts were made to privatise it again, with the last such attempt in 2017. Which airline is this?




Q2. It is a snack consisting of two small round layers of cake and a marshmallow filling, with a chocolate covering. Exports grew in the late 2000s, particularly to North Korea, so much so, that in lieu of cash bonuses (deemed capitalistic), workers at the Kaesong Industrial complex (pictured) were given these. When the complex was shut down and reopened, this snack was replaced by noodles, chocolates, coffee and sausages, and the country’s own brand of these snacks.
This created a huge black-market demand for the snacks of the original brand, and in 2014, South Korean activists released 10,000 balloons with these snacks in North Korea. What is this ubiquitous snack?




Q3.____ is the name given to the lowest level of Buddhist hell. Its supposed to be the place where people who committed the gravest misdeeds may be reborn. A prominent musician chose that as his stage name, because his real name was already someone’s username on MySpace.

The paper trail
","Come exam season and students across all engineering colleges can be seen scurrying around for the right books to study from and breaking their heads over tricky questions. While many struggle to cram and get through the exams, others are clueless about how to prepare for it. To curb this last minute hassle, Paperhut, an innovative portal helps students in preparing for their exams. Offering previous years’ question papers and used books for engineering and MBA courses, Paperhut has grown to be a favourite in the student community. A start-up established by four students of Anna University, Paperhut now has over 10,000 users a day. “Paperhut was born when our professors said the simplest way to score 85 per cent was by going through previous years’ question papers,” says Krishna Murari, one of the founders. “Then as we tried to access these papers, we had to slog for hours in the library or head out to ask if our seniors had it. On an average, it took us about 3-4 hours to get the papers we wanted. We then contacted a bunch of friends from a few more universities across India, and it looked like everyone faced the same issue! Instead of cribbing about it, we decided to go ahead and solve this problem. And that's how Paperhut was born.”

Redefining study

The team of four consists of Krishna Murari, Raghavendra Ramesh, Sreekesh Krishnan and Thiru Venkadam.
Redefining the studying process for students during examinations and making it much easier, Paperhut makes old question papers and books accessible to universities across Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. They have partnered with four colleges in Tamil Nadu to offer their services, allowing the college management as well to share their internal papers and notes. Convincing colleges and universities to become a part of the portal is no mean task and Krishna Murari agrees. “While a lot of colleges have shown interest, we're facing a roadblock as the management boards in many are skeptical about adopting a newer technology in empowering their students. Communicating with colleges involves a lot of effort, including driving down to remote locations for each meeting to take it forward,” he says. But their high point comes during exams when Paperhut is put to its best use. “We spot a lot of students with question papers printed from our portal and that is a moment of pride and happiness for us,” he adds.

Developing content

Sourcing the papers from students, college seniors and Paperhut volunteers in colleges, they have an online tool which tracks and ensures that all the question papers reach them within a month of the end of a semester. “The question papers are then digitised and optimised before they’re uploaded in Paperhut,” says Krishna. He adds that the the pre-owned books are sourced from students, dealers in the city and college alumni. Quality checks are also done on the books to ensure its usability before putting them up for sale on Paperhut.
Having received the ‘Most Innovative Venture’ award from Microsoft at a start-up fest in 2013, Paperhut has progressed and is now Paperhut Education Private Limited. “We are excited to see how we can take this initiative forward to help students across universities,” explains Krishna Murari. “We are currently working on sourcing law, medical and chartered accountancy papers and we're halfway through it. We are also looking at expanding our student base, improving the logistics for Paperhut Books and see if we can do something about solving a few more problems that students face. It would help us in taking this initiative further if the managements across colleges could lend some more support in working with us,” he concludes.

Passion takes wing
","It is possible that Mahathi Narayanaswamy’s first baby cry sounded like a bird call. “My journey as a birder began in my pram days when my mom wheeled me around the campus and showed me the blackbuck and the egrets,” says the Class XI student, opening her laptop to show me her bird-work. 
The “campus” is IIT-Madras where her dad works. When she turned four, she began attending Prof. Susy Verughese’s annual summer birding camp for children. At age seven, she saw a large, colourful parrot on a mango tree outside her window and was hooked to the bird-world. After a brief pause over problem with eyesight, at age nine, she began summer birding, and at 12, went birding in winter. “I was rewarded with the sight of a brown-breasted flycatcher that migrated over Chennai. There has been no looking back since!” she says.
Through high school, she bird-watched in the campus with classmate Tanmay Jain. At home, she would read Salim Ali’s Indian Birds  volumes 2 and 11 — “my primers for bird-watching. These are mom’s; she is a birdwatcher too.”
Local surveys
In the last four years, she has recorded 122 species of birds in the campus, and along with Tanmay, she has surveyed and analysed the vegetation and bird species in the Guindy National Park and the IIT campus. She flips the pages of the neat, hand-written report that they submitted to the National Children’s Science Congress before giving me a gist of what they found: “The forests are similar, being dry-deciduous, except IIT has marshes and scrub as well. We identified 42 different bird species.”
Annual family outings are built around the bird theme. “We trek in the Himalayas every year in May-June, along with a few families here.” Her observations include the rise in house-sparrow numbers in the lower Himalayan villages — three to four species new to the western Himalayan region. “The steep high-altitude (2000-3000 feet) elevation makes treks tough, so sightings here are not well-documented,” she says. 
Mahathi logs her birding experiences at Indianfeatheredfriends.weebly.com and has joined bird portals for interactions with birders world-wide. Her profile is on birdcountofindia.com. She joins birdwalks/programmes organised by the National Conservation Foundation. She has attended Garima Bhatia’s workshops on birding. 
When she heard about the eBird online database, she began uploading her bird sightings. “It has reviewers for every district/state/country.” 
International experience 
Mahathi spotted an announcement about the Cornell Young Birders three-day programme in the eBird newsletter, applied, and was accepted. It was held from July 12-15, 2018 in Ithaca, New York. The event aims to bring together teenagers with a passion for birds and interested in pursing a career in the field. Participants meet people who have successful careers that involve birds — from ornithological researchers to tour leaders, to audio specialists and computer scientists. Preference is given to students entering Class XII and students who have previously applied.
“This was a major opportunity as India has negligible numbers of recognised university programmes related to birding,” she feels. “I met birders in my age-group from around the world, experience the university atmosphere in the U.S., and interact with scientists/researchers in the fields of ornithology and wildlife biology.”
The event featured two days of field trips, presentations by Cornell Lab of Ornithology staff including professors, researchers, and students, eBird and sound recording workshop, and a tour of Cornell Lab including the Macaulay Library and Museum of Vertebrates.
Mahathi plans on building a career around birds by choosing ornithology or ecology. However, “Even if I choose a different career, birding will continue to remain a passion. I may do a project that bridges my career and birds.” Mahathi makes a big pitch for birding when she says, “It is fascinating to see new birds; to be able to identify small differences in looks and behaviour of say, two babblers.” And yes, birding helps conserve the feathered species. 
Data on eBird help to infer how habitat change affects bird species, amateur birding-records help to make decisions related to city planning, public parks and gardens. So she listens to calls as she bicycles to the gate. “Anything that moves catches my attention.”

An IIT course with a touch of engineering, medicine and humanities
"," The field of medicine, though a science, cannot solely rely on just that. Dealing with humans, their emotional and physical conditions, it becomes necessary for practitioners of medicine to rely on the human and cultural aspect as well. While some of it is learnt on the job, there are now increasing opportunities for students of medicine to draw on the knowledge of diverse but relevant fields such as literature, art, psychology, history, anthropology, music and much more, through the study of medical humanities.
The field of Medical Humanities is relevant to both practitioners and students of medicine because they are dealing with human beings, and understanding the various ways in which people experience pain, suffering, and well-being is important to enrich their knowledge.
Different perspectives
Interestingly, IIT Hyderabad offers Medical Humanities Course for students of engineering and allied sciences. The purpose, the Institute says, is to introduce students to humanities and social science perspectives about the human body, health, and illness experience. 
The optional course (worth 1 credit) is conducted by Shubha Ranganathan, Assistant Professor, Department of Liberal Arts, and Haripriya Narasimhan, Head of Liberal Arts Department, at IIT Hyderabad, who explain its relevance to students of engineering.
“Apart from encountering experiences of pain and suffering in their own lives, as human beings, engineering students will often go on to do research on applications in the field of medicine. Therefore, a different perspective on technologies and human experience would enrich their understanding and may enable them to apply some of these perspectives in medical innovations.”
For instance, for perspectives from literature and art, in one of the classes, a guest lecturer looked at the description of post-traumatic stress disorder among male soldiers who returned from the World Wars in literature. The course also covered a special issue of the online journal Cafe Dissensus (2016) which looked at works of art produced by differently-abled people.
Cultural notions such as gender, and class, and hierarchy also play a major factor in influencing medical experience and practice. For example, doctors may respond to people from different class positions in a different manner, or they may interact with men and women differently, explain professors Ranganathan and Narasimhan.
The course, they say, helps argue in favour of studying humanities along with engineering. “Humanities disciplines show students a different way of seeing the world, that the world/life is not about problems and solutions only; that one needs to understand the history and the context before one can proceed to ‘solve’ any ‘problem’. This course will bring the ‘human’ element to the centre of discussion...”
An interdisciplinary course like medical humanities can also add to the niche knowledge that students acquire in their undergraduate programme. Recently, one of the classes featured a detailed discussion about the social angle to the issue of disability. The social model of disability emphasises the role of society in designing and building environments that are accessible, so that people with diverse bodies can live fully enabled lives.
“While I was speaking about the psychology of a patient to one of my doctor friends, he was shocked by the way I was explaining a patient’s situation when they go to a doctor,” says Prithvi Gude, a former student at IIT-Hyderabad. “I feel a student needs to have a knowledge of multiple things for his development. Hence, when this course was offered, I was very happy to take it and learn many things, which I never explored before.”
Course details
Duration: 5 weeks, 3 hours per week

Script a success story
","When Nishant travels to college, he finds a comfortable spot for himself in the bus and reads books on his smart phone.
He doesn’t subscribe to any newspaper. Instead he browses online. There are instant updates and information is just a click away. For him, going digital has been a convenient transformation.
The publishing industry in India is waking up to this new reader. It is transitioning into a new platform, where there is a possibility of reaching out to a wider audience at a relatively lower cost and creating new revenue streams.
Bangalore-based publisher Pratham Books was among the first Indian children’s book publishers to make their title “Muchkund and His Sweet Tooth” available in the digital medium.
The title has got more than 6,000 views on Scribd till date.
Editors, designers, and content providers need to be aware of the expectations of online readers. K. Srinivasan, who publishes a monthly public e-zine — PR-e-Sense, says, “People do not like to read too much text at a time, online. They dislike scrolling too much to get to the end of a story and want to access information as quickly as possible. Also, cluttered pages look worse on digital platforms, people prefer a clean design.”
Additionally, digital publishing requires knowledge of technology. Tina Narang, Publishing Manager at Scholastic India, corroborates, “[Creating] vanilla versions of a printed book simply requires knowledge of the software that converts the book into its e-version. However, digital versions of books that are created especially for this medium requires a designer with specialised knowledge of the software and the processes involved.”
Some of the software used in the industry are Adobe Photoshop, In Design, Illustrator and Flash. Programmers normally use “xcode” for iOS applications and “eclipse” for Android applications. However, these may vary between organisations.
Apart from software knowledge and technical knowhow, editors, designers and content-providers need to have the latest devices and know the innovations to stay ahead of their game.
However, simply “knowing” the technology won’t be sufficient. Suzanne Singh, Chairperson at Pratham Books, says, “Digital publishing requires people who can help create new engagement models with readers. We require people who understand analytics, social media and are digital innovators. These are early days in digital publishing... [but] we look for out-of-the-box thinkers who believe in the transformative power of technology...”

Education

Digital publishing is at a nascent stage in India and a lot of skills are learnt on the job; although a few courses are offered in this discipline. For example, Chennai-based Digiscape Gallery offers a number of courses in digital publishing. In association with Digiscape Gallery, Annamalai University offers a BSc course in digital publishing.Internationally, courses in digital publishing are offered at institutions such as the Oxford Brookes University in the U.K. and at the Columbia School of Journalism in the U.S.
Students interested in a purely media-based job profile, such as working for digital editions of mainstream media, e-newspapers and magazines can also choose to pursue postgraduate courses in new media or digital media.
Students interested in working in this field can look for jobs with websites of various national and local newspapers and magazines, as well as online-only news portals and e-magazines.
A few local book publishers have a full-fledged digital division. They usually have a small team that converts print editions into e-books, which are mainly epubs or pdfs.
Parthibhan Amudhan at BookBox, an organisation that helps publishers digitise their books, says, “There has been a marked rise in publishers looking for companies to digitise their books. At Bookbox, we produce animated stories to help improve reading skills and language learning using Same Language Subtitling. We make sure the content is easily accessible across all existing and upcoming digital platforms such as YouTube, Google Play, Apple Store, Kindle and DTH.”
However, with rising awareness, digital products are being taken more seriously by book publishers. For example, Penguin India launched the Penguin App for smart phones in 2011 and rolled out its e-book publishing venture in 2012.
Hence, opportunities for working with some big ticket book publishers as well as external agencies that specialise in creating digital products exist.
Although jobs vary between organisations, some profiles that students can look at are online editor, online journalist, web-designer, videographer and graphic artist. Digital publishing also requires production personnel as well as software designers who can develop apps and other digital enhancements to bring the content to life. Students with an IT background can also take up a promising career in this field.

Driving force
"," A typical Monday morning, I was impatiently awaiting my auto to get to work, all the while, mentally mapping out the zillion things I wanted to accomplish, this week. So engrossed was I, in my thoughts, that it took someone snapping her fingers in front of my face, to bring me out of my reverie. My auto woman had arrived, and without further ado, I was off to work. At the signal, a man in the vehicle next to mine made a passing comment at my driver — “These cab aggregators are giving more women behind-the-wheel jobs. Must feel good to don a man’s role and get out of the kitchen, right?” And that blatant, supercilious comment, laced with ill-concealed surprise that a woman could do it all, got the cogs in my brain furiously working overtime. Women from all walks of life, irrespective of class and creed, have perfected the balancing act since time immemorial. They have stormed every stage possible and emerged victorious too — whether it is the Mars mission, or at workplaces entrenched in Earth’s stronghold, many of them pull it all off with élan. Why then, the surprise? Who decides that engineering and coding are for men, and perennially relegate women to the kitchen-queen status?
Even as my brain continues to teem with such questions, there exists the reality that there are organisations across the globe that are taking a step forward towards gender parity and inclusivity. Uber has joined the exalted ranks of such organisations. Excerpts from an interview where five superwomen from Uber — Manyata Goyal, Charu Jain, Latika Vashishtha, Vanshika Srivastava, and Shivani Khanduja — describe their journey in the organisation, and the innumerable opportunities they have had, to establish their competence and combat stereotypes. 




Dreaming big
For Manyata Goyal, a career in engineering had always seemed the way ahead, right from when she was a starry-eyed 13-year-old who would sit in front of her computer, for hours on end, using a greeting card-making programme to design cards for her friends and family. Tinkering around and experimenting with different programmes then, paved the way for what she does now. “As a part of Uber’s maps team, I work on projects to improve the pick-up experience for people in markets with sub-optimal network conditions. The current project I am working on is about enabling transportation in emerging markets for users, in areas with poor network connectivity,” explains Manyata. 
Utter the word “coding” and the first image that is sure to strike most people’s imagination is a man at the desk, hard at work, cracking codes to save the day. This is where Uber’s Charu Jain and software engineer Latika Vashishtha are shattering stereotypes. 
An excited Charu, from Uber’s Vehicle Solutions for Rentals and Financiers team, quips, “My passion for writing code started in high school, when I began building C++ applications for fun. This love for writing code kept growing and I decided to pursue computer science in college.”
Now, she and her team build solutions for Uber’s vehicle rental business across the globe. “The work is gratifying. For instance, I recently had the opportunity of visiting our office at Sao Paulo, Brazil, to learn about the day-to-day challenges of the local operations team. We also met with some of our biggest local partners. This exposure helped us analyse how we are performing and scope out future improvements in these types of emerging markets,” she adds.
As a child, Latika loved solving puzzles and math problems. As she grew, so did her appetite for solving increasingly complex puzzles and problems, and she would frequently participate in Olympiads and quizzes. “Gradually, I discovered that engineering was similar and an extension of my passion. Coding allows me to dig deep into problems in mobility and therefore, my job excites me, constantly keeps me on my toes and allows me to innovate,” she adds, the excitement in her voice evident.
Challenges
Manyata explains how one of the first realisations that dawned on her was just how few women programmers there were. “Many times, I have been the only woman in the room,” she exclaims. “Fortunately, I have had strong female role models and supportive colleagues throughout my career. However, much like in the case of most women, it has not always been easy for me, given that tech still continues to be male-dominated industry. In my early days, there have been situations when I have had to be more persistent with my opinions and have had to back my ideas with undaunting perseverance,” she adds.
Shivani Khanduja from Uber’s uPromo team, who works on this financial platform for real-time credit and promotion liability analysis, doesn’t completely agree that the urban mobility industry is male-dominated. “Women are breaking barriers across industries and professions. From an engineering point of view, we are all working towards one common goal — make transportation reliable for everyone, everywhere. I have a mix of smart women and men on my team, and we are constantly learning from each other and getting better at what we do,” she insists.
 Vanshika Srivastava, a finance engineering in the organising concurs. “I joined here in 2017, and the journey, so far, has been enthralling. Here, the journey of an engineer is that of learning and implementing on repeat, with leaps of advancement. It is this cycle that enables me to innovate at a fast pace,” she says. Though it was challenging at first, it drove her to perform and fall in love with her job. “I started working on finance engineering with limited domain knowledge. Ramping up in Uber’s fast-paced development environment with deliverables that impact the company was a challenge, one that I loved though,” she admits.
Constant inclusivity 
So, what does Uber do to make its work environment inclusive? “We have a thriving LadyEng group that continues to take on new initiatives in keeping lady engineers plugged in and updated. We also get together as one group to discuss challenges and celebrate successes,” elaborates Vanshika. Shivani is quick to agree. “As someone new in the global workforce, I feel proud that there is a lot of focus around women and personal development. I am also inspired by seeing women leaders across the tech team that I am part of.” 
Charu adds, “As a woman, and one in tech, I feel comfortable working here. This women’s day, for instance, we started a series called Inspirational women of Uber where many women from different teams and roles were featured with their success stories. Also, we have started a Bengaluru chapter of the LadyEng series, where women in tech regularly meet and discuss ideas, concerns, issues and work together to address them,” she says, signing off.

Hard work key to his success
","Where there is a will, there is a way, goes the saying and a poor student has proved it true with his hard work and determination. He secured 455/470 marks in the Intermediate first year.

A student of RK Junior College in Vizianagaram, he aims to get a good rank and secure a seat in mechanical engineering. His routine: “I wake up at 4 a.m. every day and distribute newspapers for one-and-a-half hours. I return home and study till 7 a.m. I reach my college by 8 a.m. and return home by 7 p.m. and study till 10 p.m.”
“During examinations I used to sleep for not more than five hours a day. During the examinations I had a substitute to deliver the newspapers,” he says.
“A couple of months ago, I lost my bicycle when my father took it to the bus complex area and on return, he found it missing. I had to go to college on an autorickshaw and I borrowed my uncle’s bicycle for distribution of newspapers,” he says.

Double-edged sword?
","



Hiking the budget on interest-free loans for students will not be of any real help to students in an economy with exponentially increasing unemployment rates. 
This policy will further increase their burden and force them to participate in an education which acts as a catalyst for the private funded university, as well an all-exclusive education which will encourage more students to enrol in such universities, in the hope of a promising future. 
Instead, the government should be utilising the money to build more government funded institutions that encourages more students, irrespective of the economic background they come from .




This will discourage students from pursuing a career in research or academia, as the brunt of the loan will be borne by the student and an immediate need for the repayment of the loan will not allow them to continue with the research, which reaps results, over a period of time. 
Is this a move by the government to completely do away with government institution for an interest-free educationloan ? 
This is a question we need to ask in times where, unemployment of the youth has become an issue of paramount concern for all.
 



Availing educational loans need a different treatment as they involve the future of students and are an investment. Loans to genuine students who are in need, and want to pursue their education should not be considered for the interest by looking into their past results. It is, by and large, the middle-class and lower economic groups who tend to suffer in matters of educational loans, as they struggle to arrange funds for their child’s education and assorted needs. It also burdens the student, which creates job and health issues. 




Education loans alone will not help the government in improving the country’s educational scenario. 
The system should be such that students are in a position to do away with the vicious circle of loans and the interest that follows. 
With this move, the burden of interest is removed and it will be an option for students who are unable to pursue their dreams due to monetary deficits, as most graduates lack the appropriate skills to land them into good jobs.

Of literary experiences ","Studying 19th century French literature in one of the friendliest cities I have ever lived in, is proving to be exciting and rewarding. I am a PhD student in the School of Languages and Cultures at the University of Sheffield, studying the fictive works present in French novelist and playwright Balzac’s La Comédie humaine (a collection of around a 100 novels and short stories). These ‘works inside works’ are created by the characters of Balzac, and belong to a variety of domains (literature, philosophy, painting, music, science, law, and so on.), and exist in the texts as fragments
Having been obsessed with the works of Balzac for as long as I can remember, I learnt the language so I could read the works in original French. I studied in Sheffield for a semester during my master’s degree and I was impressed by the university infrastructure and the library services. My supervisor, Maxime Goergen, helped me focus my interest in the works of Balzac and guided me in developing a formal proposal for my research.
Plan ahead
For those considering a Ph.D, be clear about your area of interest so that you can approach the right people. Send your proposals well in advance to the academic staff who specialise in your field, with a description of their published research and research interests. Scholarship deadlines are always different from the programme application deadlines. So, it is imperative to plan in advance.
I find Sheffield to be a perfect mix of competence, innovation, and tradition with ample opportunities to grow and learn in an atmosphere where originality and critical thinking are appreciated and encouraged.
At my first ever academic conference, I had the privilege of presenting a paper on Balzac at the SDN (Society of Dix-Neuvièmistes) annual conference — one of the most prestigious academic clusters in my field of research. I shall also be presenting my research at Balzac’s house in Paris this month.
I enjoy the busy life in the school with interesting conferences and talks, almost every week. Postgrads are encouraged to participate in academic events not just in Sheffield, but in other universities in the U.K. and overseas as well.

Fuel your thoughts
","If you are a reader of my column, you are familiar with my advocacy of habit building and deliberation of routines that lead to fundamental shifts and growth. This is foundational to the belief, ‘we are what we do’!
Today, I am digging a level deeper beyond the deliberation of doing, to the level of our thoughts and subconscious. You would be familiar with the notion that our outer world is a reflection of our inner world. To me, this idea in continuum with the Do-analogy implies that ‘we become what we think (most of the time)’.
For decades, psychologists have worked to understand the functioning of the human mind. Across Freud, Carl Jung, Maslow and may others, a common conclusion has been that in every way, our mental programming, built on context and life experiences, plays a decisive role in the way we think, feel, act and accomplish through life.
Thought patterns
Programming manifests in our thoughts. The problem is that our mind is not always a safe place. Our thoughts often take a gravitational spiral towards self-doubt, self-denial, paranoia and mistrust. The truth is we give a lot of mind-space to what we hate and what we can’t do, when the anti-self reigns inside the head.
Psychiatrist and mindfulness expert, Dr. Daniel Siegel, who coined ‘anti-self’, advocates pause-breaks for deliberate self-reflection, a ‘time-in’, when we can check-in where we are at emotionally, understand the thoughts and choose how to behave and progress. To demonstrate, here are a few foundational interludes of time-in:
1. Do you believe that you are always moving in the direction of your dominant thoughts? In times of stress, have you ever stopped to assess the thoughts in your head? 
2. In what way have your dominant thoughts attracted people? How about circumstances and situations in you life? Could a different thought have influenced outcome? If you get another chance, what will you replace these thoughts with?
3. Determine the three important habits or thoughts about yourself and others that you could develop to be more prolific and productive. 
In the 2010 sci-fi Hollywood film “Inception”, written and directed by the visionary storyteller Christopher Nolan, the protagonist Cobb is a professional thief who steals information and commits corporate espionage by infiltrating the subconscious. As the plot thickens, he is offered a chance to have his criminal history erased, as payment for the implantation of another person’s idea into a target’s subconscious. This time, Cobb won’t be harvesting an idea, but sowing one. Should he succeed, it will be a new frontier in the art of psychic espionage. 
If I just got carried away with the story there, it is because the premise of sowing a new idea to impact a desired outcome is dramatic. For me though, the real-life promise of inception of new, open thoughts into the mind is equally dynamic and empowering. 
To infiltrate the mind, we have to know what inhabits it, in the first place. Reflection is an answer. Yet, to me, ‘you can choose another thought’ is advancement over reflection. What I am addressing here is mindful, deliberate thoughts by ceasing the flow of anti-self and sowing new possibilities.
Every time you sense a thought-overload, you pause in a time–in —‘What am I thinking?’ ‘What is that thought doing to me?’— akin to screening the worthiness of a thought loop. By questioning it, you will stop the flow and over time, you will learn to incept a new, curious, open and accepting thought. Dreamlike or lifelike!

How relevant are entrance exams?
"," 


By introducing entrance exams and not enrolling people to major positions holistically, we have been able to control the problem of nepotism in educational institutions, to a major extent. To screen candidates from a population of 1.3 billion is a herculean task, and entrance exams help in selecting people for elite jobs and universities. To overhaul the current system, it should consist of more segregation to give a platform for the growing population to compete.




 Measuring the effectiveness of an applicant through competitive exams is not an issue, but giving them a majority weighage (min. 80%) is the real concern. Merely conducting personal interviews and group discussions is not enough, especially with 15% share. Better techniques must be introduced to analyse an applicant’s effectiveness. So, while competitive exams are necessary, their proportion in the overall student analysis should be reduced.




 The overhaul in the screening process is required due to the changing facets of education and competitiveness. Past experiences show that we are more concerned with the knowledge, but to serve the purposes of these exams, a synthesis of aptitude, attitude, and critical mental framework is required. 
Further, some new changes should be introduced in the exam patterns like UPSC such as increasing the weightage of disaster management and setting a level playing ground for the optional part. Also, the assessment process should be modified in a multidimensional manner.




Exams such as CAT and GATE are measure to judge students’ effectiveness. Cracking these exams is not a piece of cake, as they require discipline and patience, and hard work is the pre-requisite. So, they are not just exams but a journey where we get a chance to analyse our abilities. Also, if someone is not able to crack these exams, it does not mean he/she is incapable, as students often associate these entrances with success in life.

Economics, a way of life
"," Students today would ideally like to select a field which imparts skills that stand the test of time both in the professional and personal realms. Here is how, economics, with its emphasis on quantitative, problem-solving, writing, and critical thinking skills, helps students prepare for the future:
Quantitative skills
Why it is good for you professionally: Data-driven analytics has become the industry’s new favourite buzzword, and the periodical, The Economist, has declared data to be the ‘new oil’, in terms of being a valuable resource. Having the ability to analyse and derive insights from data sets is a crucial skill in the professional realm, with the World Economic Forum’s forecasts predicting that by 2020, data analysis will be in high demand.
Why it is good for you personally: Every activity and choice we make is another data-point. If like many other people, you worry about the lack of leisure time in your life, tracking your daily schedule and its variations can help you find more efficient ways to commute to get some free time to catch up on reading or the latest TV shows.
Problem-solving skills
Why it is good for you professionally: Having the ability to find what is relevant and discard the irrelevant in performing a function helps streamline work processes. The World Economic Forum’s Future of Jobs report projects that 36% of all jobs across industries will require complex problem-solving abilities as a core skill by 2020.
Why it’s good for you personally: Our personal lives are full of different problems that we are often stumped by, especially when it comes to our relationships with people. Complex problem-solving skills can help you become the best organiser for vacations, events, parties, or even in organising a dinner with friends.
Writing skills
Why it is good for you professionally: The written word is the basic language in which business is conducted. With the massive volume of written communication being produced every day, having the ability to use the right word to convey the right meaning is critical to operating businesses
Why it is good for you personally: Much of how we communicate with friends and loved ones happen through the written word, sent through messages across various channels. Being able to write something compelling can be the difference between getting into your favourite college or not, due to application essays.
Critical thinking skills
Why it is good for you professionally: Companies are always on the lookout for candidates who understand the world around them. Disruptive startups have used critical thinking to disrupt the normal ways of doing business, and this is a in-demand skill today. Even in an automated and AI-reliant future, critical thinking can ensure that you remain relevant.
Why it is good for you personally: Critical thinking helps us be responsible citizens in a democracy. Our ability to hold our elected representatives responsible for their actions and understand their motivations more clearly requires us to be able to critically analyse what they say.

Happier days ahead
"," The introduction of the ‘Happiness Curriculum’ by the Delhi government is a milestone decision for the overall development and welfare of children. This curriculum was launched on July 2, this year, for all government schools students from nursery up to class VIII, in order to improve the current circumstances of diminishing self-worth and increasing mental problems among students. 
Blue Orb Foundation is one of the five leading companies that contributed in the modulation of ‘The Happiness Curriculum’. “The tendency of the education system is such that no emphasis is given to students’ overall development,” says Madhuri Mehta, CEO of Blue Orb. “As a mother of a young boy, I realised how students have been overburdened with excelling in every subject and are suffering under a lot of new age ethical dilemmas. The need of the hour is quite evident. The introduction of the happiness curriculum is to ensure the mental as well as emotional well-being of a child.”
“This initiative should be launched in all schools in order to promote stress dealing and problem solving abilities. If companies like Google have initiatives to introduce mindfulness for their employees, then young students who are just learning to deal with their stressful atmosphere should be taught these skills, so that they can become self-aware citizens,” adds Madhuri.
New initiatives
 “The curriculum is definitely bringing about a change in the current situation of government schools. Students get to interact and express themselves,” says Naraina, a Sanskrit teacher from S.K.V. “The introduction of meditation and thoughtfulness has increased the concentration levels of students and they take more interest in the classes. These classes have created a shared space of referentiality among the students and teachers. So, now teachers can impart knowledge and values by using familiar examples. However, due to the number of academic classes being reduced because of the inclusion of this course, teachers are finding it difficult to complete their course in a limited time.” The curriculum follows a similar book for all the classes. She suggested that this curriculum should be further specialised, in accordance with students’ age and need.
Pratiksha Pathak, a member of the spoken English Project, GSBV Tirampur says, “For the first few minutes, the teachers would let children interact with each other. At times, some teachers would also take them out for a stroll and make them observe. Gradually, it should lead to development of focus and concentration because not only would they report what they saw but also what they heard.”
“The set of activities involved are aimed at enhancing or developing a particular skill. Moreover, no one is penalised for not completing an activity. There was zero pressure to complete something within a stipulated time. So, they could innovate and conduct sessions as per their convenience and ease of the class,” she adds. “It is a good initiative, if implemented well. Lack of training and exposure can be negative but gradually that should be improved upon.”
The effect
Chavvi Sharma, a student of Std. VIII studying in Government Girls Senior Secondary School, New Delhi, shares her views on the curriculum stating, “The need to feel happy about oneself is important in a pressurising education system such as ours. This curriculum teaches us to feel confident about ourselves and rewards us with appreciation and encouragement when we follow the right path.”
“I always used to feel stressed when I didn’t score well or understand lessons being taught. I was shy about talking about my problems with my teachers and parents, but with the introduction of the happiness curriculum, I feel more positive. I have started interacting with my teachers which helps me to solve my problems,” says Babita, another student of Delhi Government School. 
“Parents from my colony were happy to see their children building perseverance. Children were told to collect rice bags for the underprivileged as a part of the curriculum activity. Many doors were slammed, and failure was disheartening. Yet, the constant efforts of students were able to feed hundreds of mouths. Such lessons will guide them through their lives,” Madhuri says, shedding light on the changes that this curriculum is bringing about in society.
Madhuri concludes, “Everyone knows what is right, but to be able to accept and solve life problems is what the curriculum will aim at. By learning about happiness, our children will be able to lead a more fulfilling life. Blue Orb Foundation offers similar courses for private schools and has already collaborated with many schools in Delhi and NCR.”

‘Journalists must be adept at using digital media’
","In this formative era of the digital revolution, journalists not only have to be effective story tellers but also integrate their writing skills and technical abilities to attract readers. They need to be adept at using the digital media and take up the challenges of devising new formats of presenting news.
Robin Jeffrey, visiting research professor, Institute of South Asian Studies, National University of Singapore, said it was a great time to be journalists in India in this emerging digital revolution that provided opportunity to explore new means to communicate.
Prof. Jeffrey was delivering the Lawrence Dana Pinkham Memorial lecture on ‘India’s ‘Bully Pulpit’: Media in a time of digital revolution’ at the convocation ceremony of the Asian College of Journalism here on Saturday.
Tracing America's golden age of journalism in the early 1900s, he said the era of American President Theodore Roosevelt saw the media revolution wherein he had the ‘bully pulpit’ or an outstanding platform as it was known then. The journalists then were known as muckrakers who exposed injustices through research and writing.
“India too is entering a phase of media revolution in terms of digitisation.” Drawing a contrast with the downward trend of newspapers in the U.S., he said the growth of Indian newspapers remained strong in the past 30 years.
Mobile phones and the Internet transformed the ability to gain knowledge and converge various medium of communication in them. Indian journalists could build upon the bully pulpit or the outstanding platform of digital media to reach out to readers. The digital media also foster social equality that is otherwise absent largely in Indian media.
Pointing out that despite the advantages, India’s global media presence was small, Prof. Jeffrey said: “The digital media provides a platform to project Indian voices around the world.”
Earlier N. Ram, Chairman, Kasturi & Sons Limited, elaborated on the crisis that newspapers face and how digital media here are yet to yield a viable business model to rely on.
In all 169 students received their diplomas from Prof. Jeffrey. Sashi Kumar, Chairman, Media Development Foundation, stressed on the need to tweak curriculum to match the changes in the industry. Nalini Rajan, Dean of Studies, Asian College of Journalism, spoke.

Beautiful, inside and out
","Today, beauty is emphasised as an important characteristic. attractiveness helps people fit into a demanding society that values and rewards appearance. The global aesthetic medicine market size is now estimated to reach more than $13 billion by 2021. and China have the largest population pool aged between 30 to 65 years, and rising disposable income coupled with the presence of a wide working population is generating demand for aesthetic procedures.
The introduction of technically-advanced systems enabling minimally invasive procedures is identified as the most influential factor. Moreover, rise in disposable income has greatly boosted the demand for cosmetic procedures. Thus, factors such as better awareness regarding the availability of these minimally invasive procedures and their products as well as affordable costs are leading to a spur in demand globally. 
Medical and personal care product industries are keeping up with this growing demand by a public interested in availing the latest techniques and products available in cosmetology and aesthetic medicine. A social phenomenon, dedicating a certain budget to beauty is now accepted as a norm. This translates into profitable economic activities, where physicians and cosmetologists play an important role and have a place of choice though the direct contact and care they offer to patients. Scientific and medical progress means that a wide range of solutions are available to the public, but only a trained practitioner will deliver effective treatment. 
Cosmetology is no more concerned with mere topical skin care. Laser treatments, injectables, facial peels and many more procedures, can be performed by a professional who has received adequate training, making his or her practice more lucrative. 
Opportunities galore
Cosmetology is also a full-time career option for trained technicians. With training in cosmetology, the professional can easily convey information and interest a patient in trying out safe, effective and sometimes life changing cosmetic solutions. 
Choosing to add aesthetic medicine as a speciality has the potential to enhance the physician’s revenues and to become a full-time career due to massive demand. Aesthetic medicine is one of the fastest growing sub-specialty that will continue thrive with technological innovation. Not only does it promise excellent outlook in terms of advancements in diagnostic, curative modalities and treatments, choosing to be trained in this is intellectually and humanely rewarding with beneficial career prospects. 
The real benefit of practising aesthetic medicine is the type of care that practitioners offer their patients. These procedures are elective and are performed on patients who do not suffer from life-threatening illnesses. They are usually healthy, but aesthetic care will have a positive impact on their lives. This, along with the lucrative business it represents, are the benefits any doctor can expect, by expanding his/her own practice or by recruiting an aesthetic physician position in a reputed hospital or a polyclinic.
The advantages of training in cosmetology and aesthetic medicine are manifold. They are fascinating disciplines that call for precision, patience, and allows a long-term relationship with patients. The results offered by the procedures are quickly visible and lead to immense patient satisfaction, making the disciplines rewarding. 
As a fresher, a candidate must have a basic understanding of beauty products, new trends and techniques. Some tips that will increase chances of employment:
A candidate must have completed a certificate or diploma course from a certified institute of cosmetology and aesthetic medicine.
If you are skilled enough to work as a professional under different circumstances, you are eligible for the job. Prior experience is helpful, but not necessary.
Attitude goes a long way too. Those who have confidence have an advantage over others.
There are multiple choices of beauty institutes, but aspirants should check the quality and facilities provided for practical training, certifications offered, training modules, faculty and post training employment opportunities, before enrolling of a course in an institute.
The pay package depends on the specific stream of profession chosen by a candidate. In India, a fresher can start at ₹ 1.5 to 2 lakhs per annum as a starting salary. With a professional degree, one can expect a starting salary of ₹ 50,000 per month.

Take the KVPY route
","The Kishore Vaigyanik Protsahan Yojana (KVPY) is a national fellowship programme in basic sciences, initiated and funded by the Department of Science and Technology, Government of India, to identify highly motivated students who could pursue basic science courses and research careers. Students of classes XI and XII, who qualify, receive a monthly scholarship up to their pre-Ph.D level or five years, whichever is earlier. The exam is administered by the IISc Bengaluru with only 2,500 students qualifying out of lakhs who apply.
The programme tests students at three levels: KVPY SA exam for students of class XI, KVPY SX exam for class XII and KVPY SB exam for first-year students of BSc, integrated five-year M.Sc, or integrated five-year M.S. 
Preparation
Students who are already preparing for exams such as JEE Main, olympiads or any other competitive exam through institutes need not worry much, as the pattern accommodates KVPY. Here are some tips. 
1. Manage your time with an effective study plan. Discipline is the key to following your timetable. Make a plan which is feasible, allowing you to utilise time effectively, while giving equal attention to all subjects and important topics. Keep aside an hour daily for self-analysis and correction. Segregate time for covering the syllabus concept-wise. While attempting the exam, it is always advisable to attempt the known portion of the question paper first. 
2. Utilise available resources efficiently. Understanding concepts is a must; choose study material which enable this. Make use of periodic physical interactions with expert faculty and group study to clear your doubts. Make short self-written notes for long-term memorising.
3. Evaluate yourself and reinforce your weak areas. Neglecting them can be your biggest mistake.
4. Stay connected with experts. Institutes which provide result analysis and doubt-clearing sessions on a regular basis could be useful. 
5. Judge your performance with periodic testing, after focussed study. Practise with as many mock tests as you can and make sure you go through previous year’s question papers. 
Subject-wise tips
Physics: The class XI syllabus forms the foundation of any competitive exam. Be thorough in it, especially if you are appearing at the SA level. Focus on topics such as optics, mechanics and electromagnetism. Do not leave any topic untouched, and go through thermodynamics, simple harmonic motion, and waves. 
For the SX level, practise numerical problems and keep all the concepts clear. Focus on kinematics, gravitation, fluids, heat and thermodynamics, waves and sound, capacitors and electrostatics, magnetics, electromagnetic induction, optics and modern physics.
Math: Basic knowledge of geometry and number theory is a must. Other topics include algebra, quadratic equations, series and progression, permutations and combinations, and basic geometry. Study of fundamental topics such as circles, trigonometry and sequence and series can guarantee good marks. Go through them at least once before the exam, as three to four questions based on them are expected. The SX level will include questions from integration, statistics, vector algebra and 3D geometry. Topics such as application of derivatives, matrices and determinants, and limits are high-scoring. 
Chemistry: If you are appearing for the SX exam, consult NCERT books for inorganic chemistry. Organic chemistry needs to be clear from the basic level along with regular practice. Focus on coordination chemistry and chemical bonding in inorganic chemistry, electrochemistry, chemical and ionic equilibrium, mole concept in physical chemistry and organic chemistry, atomic structure, and chemical bonding.
Biology: It is relatively easier to score good marks in biology in the SA category, compared to other subjects. If you are thorough with class IX and X NCERT and have gone through important topics from class XI and XII NCERT books, you can expect to score more than 80%. Genetics, cell and biomolecule, physiology (both animal and plant, especially photosynthesis in plants and control and coordination in both animals and plants), and health and disease are important. Read these topics from XI and XII NCERT selectively. Attempting mock tests and solving previous years’ question papers during preparation will help you score extra marks.

The language question
","India is a multilingual country; we publish newspapers in 35 languages. India’s languages are incredibly expressive; Himachal Pradesh’s 16 languages have 200 words for snow including one that means ‘falling when the moon is up’. Languages are fundamental to identity and social cohesion, but our shifting language policy is driven by the perceived primacy of one language, outdated assessments, and misjudging impact of choices. I would like to make the case for a sensitive rethink of language policy in education that bends towards multilingualism and recognises our needs of identity, creativity and economics.
Disruption
 Linguist, Claude Hagege says languages are not simply a collection of words; they are living, breathing organisms holding the connections of a culture. Ethnologue Editor Paul Lewis warns about the close links between language and identity; if people begin to think of their language as useless, they see their identity as such as well, and this leads to social disruption. Almost all higher education is in English and we must listen to Mark Tully’s argument that it must become a “genuine link language of the country, not just, as it is at present, the link language of the elite”. The demise of Indian languages has nothing to do with English; Firag Gorakhpuri and Harivansh Rai Bachan — two interesting poets of Urdu and Hindi — were professors of English literature. Our English is our own — recognised as a different syntax, phonology and lexical structure. But home languages are critical because they encapsulate our culture, who we are, how we think differently. We need a healthy attitude to languages that moves away from parochialism, build languages with time-tested traditions in homes, and scientific teaching of language in schools. Co-existence of many languages, races, cultures, and religions has been the essence of Indian heritage, with established traditions of a language at home, one for work and another for socialising, and we must retain that.
Creativity
Multilingualism is a key to creativity; it impacts cognitive development by affecting the function and structure of the brain, catalyses executive functioning, problem solving and task switching ability, and creates original thinking. In India, the role of English has become like Windows; an operating system because of higher labour mobility, it’s role in business and technology, and our economic trajectory towards services. Can that be enough? The Economist suggests that 2/3rd of 572 multinational companies credit multicultural teams for their success. The economic upsides of multilingualism are many but the most obvious is in jobs and wage premiums.
Harvard educator Nonie LeSaux suggests that language building needs an accumulation of experiences and interactions — at home and school — developing both skills and knowledge. Studies in African countries, possibly the only other linguistically diverse heritages, show that bilingual literacy teaching needs structured learning programmes, using high quality resources and training. Development of languages needs the support of aligned standards, sequenced curriculum, instruction, and assessments, and also renewed curricular approaches and resources. But our policies and assessments need updating first. We need to get to schools where identity, heritage and diversity are legitimised and there is freedom to work with languages based on the community needs, where early immersion in two languages replaces the jerky start or stop of the three language policy.
Countries are narratives and the stories we tell our children have long shadows. A multilingual India is more tolerant, more creative, and more innovative and hence more economically successful, politically stable and resilient than a monolingual one. People are ahead of politics on this issue but schools are held back by policy. Set us free so we can do two languages well.

Be the change "," University life is all about experiences. While you are busy studying and socialising, finding time for some voluntary work can definitely add value.
Volunteering helps in a number of ways. First and foremost, it is a great way to make a real contribution to a cause you feel strongly about. Look at the list of societies that are part of your university, and you’ll probably find all the big names already established there: Amnesty, Save the Children, Water Aid, Cancer Research, and the list goes on. Consider what you feel most strongly about — children, cancer, stroke, heart disease, animals, the environment, or something else. 
“I have always loved animals and when I got to know about the volunteering opportunities available at the Crocodile Bank in Chennai, I was ecstatic. From learning about these reptiles to talking about them at show and tell sessions, my experience was unmatched,” recalls Anjana Srimathi, who has passed out of Madras University recently and continues to volunteer during weekends.
Find your calling
Aniket Giri, a student of Kirori Mal College, Delhi University, chose to volunteer in a gender forum because it helped him escape his busy and noisy life. “It provided me with an opportunity to learn about society as well as myself, and the best part is that it gave me satisfaction,” says Aniket, who organises nukkad nataks, quizzes, debates and discussions on gender equality issues. 
Volunteering can also help you have amazing new experiences. The more involved you get, the greater the sense of satisfaction. From starting your own cause to holding a bucket outside a classroom to raise funds, from flaunting off your baking skills for a bake sale to emceeing a fashion show to helping build a well in a village... the list is endless. 
It’s not just about the fund raising; volunteering also means getting to meet people who share a similar passion. This is also a chance to learn a lot, because of the diverse set of people you’ll be working with — all bringing different perspectives, experiences and skills. Suman Kumari, a second year student at Lady Shri Ram College for Women, says, “I chose to volunteer with my college club which was under the National Service Scheme. We have organised workshops to help children with personal development, hygiene and so on. Though I volunteered only for a year, it was a great opportunity to meet like minded people.” 
Career catalyst
Volunteering also boosts your employment prospects. When you go for a job interview, having student volunteering work on your CV is always a bonus. No matter which industry you’re applying to, employers always like to see part of your wider personality, and what you really care about. This can also be an avenue for getting internships — and in turn jobs. 
Agrima Soni, a fourth-year student of BTech at BML Munjal University, says, “I believe that volunteering starts with a purpose and motive. Hence, when engagement meets opportunity, impact is created. I organise Zumba sessions and mind healing workshops for NGOs.”
Madhur Garg, Shubjam Goyal and Shruti Jain, also students of BML Munjal University, have volunteered at the Savera Club, a college club to help destitute children. “I have been teaching underprivileged students for the last one year. What began as a stint is now a passion. My week is incomplete until I spend time with the children. Some have even cracked competitive exams and secured admissions for higher education,” says an elated Shubham, a third year student. 
Rashi Verma and Monica Manoj of the class of 2018 at Manipal Academy of Higher Education, Dubai, went a step ahead and started The Ojas Project with the aim of empowering blue-collar workers in the UAE with free education. “We crafted a course plan, gathered a team of enthusiastic volunteers and kick-started the project with the support of our university. At the end of two months, we were overwhelmed to hear that our students felt more confident.” 
Online platforms
Today, our favourite excuse is that we have no time. Apps such as Donate My Time, which currently has 45 NGOs and 150 registered volunteers, help solve this problem. This app will help you get in touch with events organised by NGOs near where you live or work. Organisations such as CRY also offer a diverse range of volunteering opportunities. Through them, you can not only contribute towards the betterment of others, but also undergo a transformational journey for yourselves! 
With technology, volunteering has reached yet another level where you don’t have to be physically present to actually contribute. For instance, Helpers of Handicapped (HoH), a Kolhapur-based organisation, ensures that its 500 underprivileged students receive quality education by providing them with online access to teachers based in Kolkata. Platforms like these offer you an opportunity to volunteer by creating and managing their websites. 
Do you know that two hours of your time each week could “make a difference”, especially to the lives of underprivileged children? Make A Difference, or MAD as it is better known, began in Kochi in 2006, when 20 young college-goers decided to help empower underprivileged children by giving them quality education.

CERN sojourn
"," My college offers an opportunity to four students from multidisciplinary fields to conduct research internship at European Organisation for Nuclear Research (CERN), Geneva, Switzerland. Having a decent CGPA, I was selected for the interview. I was asked what I wanted to do at CERN and what my strengths and weaknesses were. I talked about the research I aimed to do at CERN, mapping my previous project at Jadavpur University, Kolkatta. I explained that entrepreneurship was my strength, and that’s when the interview took a different turn. A series of questions followed — difference between an entrepreneur and an engineer, and a physicist, and so on. I answered confidently and observed that the interviewer was convinced.
Before long, I was selected as a summer intern at CERN, funded by the Government of India. My head supervisor was Dr. Archana Sharma, the first permanent Indian scientist at CERN. 
The organisation has several experiments running together such as CMS, ALICE, LHC-b, and ATLAS. My supervisor would work at CMS, but I was asked to work on the ALICE experiment in the GEM lab under the supervision of two physicists: Chilo Garabatos, the project leader, and Robert Helmut Munzer. 
Challenge
My research interest was on the generation of time-efficient and cost-effective algorithm and its FPGA implementation mapped with the GEM lab. They had collected test data from the upgraded ALICE Time Projection Chamber (ALICE – TPC). However, the magnanimous amount of test data was in an unreadable format and couldn’t be analysed. I was responsible for programming that data into a readable format and analysing it using object-oriented data-analysis software, CERN-ROOT.
The work culture at CERN is amazing. There is no pressure, despite which everyone understands the importance of deadlines. I completed my work ahead of time and submitted a report when I was taken for an underground visit to the place where the actual particle detectors are located. They are located at different points of a pipe named Large Hadron Collider (LHC) which is 127 km in circumference, running 100 meters under the earth’s surface, stretching across France and Switzerland. I visited the part of the LHC named “CMS Point-5”. We were taken 100 meters below the surface of the earth in a lift and given a tour around the detector and the supercomputers. That five-hour visit to the LHC was truly a once-in-a-lifetime experience.

Shift in perspective
","Remember the iPod shuffle? The basic edition of the first generation of the digital music player was designed to carry up to 240 songs and play them in random order — each time you turned it on, it would “shuffle” the collection, so you wouldn’t know what would play next. While some might think of this as a disadvantage (after all, many of us like the sense of an orderly playlist that you can control), the company turned this into a quirky feature: “life is random!” went the ad, proclaiming randomness as something special — and something essential.
It is a point that often comes up in software design — is something a bug or a feature? In fact, the magazine Wired recently discussed the source of this idea and its frequent misuse to the point of becoming an apology for shoddy work. But (as even Wired acknowledges), there is some value to considering whether a bug could be turned into a feature. When does a “quirk” cease to be bothersome and become instead, a valuable characteristic? When does an apparent defect end up becoming a source of value? A skilled carpenter will work around the nuances of the grain, in a piece of wood, in such a way that it becomes an intrinsic part of the design of whatever it is he is making. Tailors add embroidery and lace to ordinary seams and turn them into highlights.
Gain perspectives
To turn a possible disadvantage into an advantage calls for a shift in perspective. It means looking at something with an analytical eye, trying to understand elements of it that are unchangeable and seeing how you can work with them, instead of wasting time trying to change or rectify them. It means, going beyond the tired cliché of “what cannot be cured must be endured”. Of course, to begin with, one must see whether indeed it is a simple error that can be fixed. For instance, is what appears to be a blemish on the wood simply something that is external to it, which can be cleaned up, or is it part of the wood’s natural colouring? The first instance represents something that can possibly be cleaned up, while the second can be seen as adding to the natural beauty of the material.
There is a lesson in here somewhere for the way we live our lives and think about ourselves and the things we do. What, in fact, is a “flaw”? What can be considered an error that can be fixed? And what is just an element or an aspect of something? Can recognising and understanding the so-called flaw open up a new way of looking at the task or the product? Does it lead us into a different space of discovery or action? Sportspersons who understand their bodies well also know how to not only adjust for (what might be considered) physical shortcomings but use those very characteristics in strategic ways. This is also the kind of thinking that has motivated the disability movement, where an individual’s perceived weakness (or impairment) is instead framed as a special ability.
Even when the “bug” is not something intrinsic to the material but has emerged as an element in the product or outcome, it is possible to recast it as a feature — much like the randomness that became a special feature of the iPod Shuffle.

Tanvi Hemani's quest for knowledge "," Tanvi Hemani is a model student. Not only did she top in three of her five subjects earning her an overall score of 446/500 in her Class XII exams, she is also an artist, an athlete, and a dancer. This may seem ordinary for many but for Tanvi it is more than just that.
Accepting challenges
Tanvi is hearing-impaired and has been so since birth. At the age of seven months, it was found that Tanvi had profound hearing loss. Her parents had to make some tough decisions regarding Tanvi’s future. After coming to know about Balavidyalaya, which is considered one of the best schools for young deaf children, they made the choice to relocate from Kolkata to Chennai. Balavidyalaya helps children develop verbal language skills by making the best use of residual hearing, the ability to hear some sounds in spite of total hearing loss. The idea was that over a period of four years the training would help Tanvi and other children like her to be able to slowly start talking and eventually get fully integrated into a regular mainstream school.
When the time came for her to start Class I, Balavidyalaya helped find a school for Tanvi. From a list of possible schools that have had a history of accepting hearing- impaired children into regular classes, she eventually got admission in Sherwood Hall, Chennai. The primary concern for her parents was how Tanvi would be able to adjust into a more regular social environment and interact with other children. But the transition was smoother than expected and there was no looking back. Although initially struggling a little bit with language and speaking, Tanvi went on to excel at her academics as well as in various extra-curricular activities. She is an avid basketball player, winning numerous awards in sports as well as winning a State-level championship in painting. She was trained by her mother in lip reading right from a young age. She is also trained to pick up on vibrations from her surroundings, especially in the case of emergencies. This was a skill which she honed that helped her learn both classical and western dance. At the age of 13, Tanvi received her first cochlear implant in one ear and therapy with which her speaking and listening skills have vastly improved and she is able to communicate much better.
There were many challenges Tanvi faced during her studies. With the support of faculty and teachers at Sherwood Hall, she had been able to overcome them. One faculty in particular was Mrs. Anita George, the school’s academic consultant. She guided Tanvi through her difficulties, encouraged and motivated her during her Class XI and Class XII. Tanvi has currently received admission in Stella Maris College to pursue a Bachelor of Visual Arts, her dream degree. 
It only goes to show, that with perseverance, hard work, motivation and having the right kind of support system to back you up in any difficulties, no challenge can be too hard to overcome.

Impeccable!
"," Housekeeping is an important aspect of running a hotel business. Regardless of the hotel category, a clean, hygienic and fresh atmosphere sends a strong message to customers. The field presents diverse career opportunities. 
Today, housekeeping units are adept at multitasking. This department is accountable for cleaning and maintaining the hotel building and premises, including the common areas, guest rooms, swimming pool, and so on. Besides main housekeeping duties, they also take care of gardening, laundry operations, superiority control, cost control and sometimes even guest relations. Apart from this, the section also handles procurement of items. In many hotels, the housekeeping division also helps the sales team in revenue generation. 
Skills
Hotel housekeeping requires a wide range of skills from emptying trash, cleaning windows and bed-making, to ironing and laundering towels and sheets, and cleaning rooms. Hotels train their staff in specific cleaning methods. This includes making beds in a particular standard, cleaning bathrooms using specific products, folding laundry to meet a set of criteria and so on. 
Housekeepers are required to use tools such as vacuum cleaners and mops, while also ensuring that they store cleaning carts with sufficient materials. Room setting is an important aspect of housekeeping, and these special touches are vital in setting a hotel apart from others. Washing, folding, ironing and dry cleaning hundreds of sheets, towels and clothes carefully, on a daily basis, is another aspect of the job. Housekeepers are also required to equip themselves with communication skills to aid in their interaction with guests. Students of hotel management can pick up these skills during their course.
Tips
To be successful, undergo hands-on training with valid certification and develop and maintain physical aptitude and strength. Keep in mind that hotels prefer experienced candidates since guest satisfaction is a crucial aspect of hospitality.
Opportunities
Admission to courses in housekeeping is merit-based or exam-based. Some institutes conduct entry-level exams to assess communication skills, personal skills, and so on. 
After course completion, students could get opportunities in hotels, resorts, tour and travel agencies, restaurants, lodges and guest houses in roles such as laundryman, linen keeper, tailor, laundry master, executive housekeeper, associate housekeeping manager and so on.

Power to change
"," The power to bring about change can be derived from knowledge. And such power has been given to me by the University of Sheffield, encouraging my ideas to fly high! As I was pursuing B.E.(Hons.) in Computer Science at BITS Pilani, Dubai campus, I always had one question — how could I use my knowledge for the betterment of healthcare services? 
My parents suggested that I specialise in biomedical sciences by pursuing higher education. And thus, the hunt for the best university started. The University of Sheffield is amongst the top-ranking universities in the world for biomedical sciences. Among the courses offered in this field, it was this university that offered the perfect mix of computational studies and bio-mechanics — just what I wanted! 
Pro-reasearch
The M.Sc. Computational Medicine is a cutting-edge master’s course which would allow me to be part of the first generation of patient-specific modelling specialists. The amazing research facility, short programme duration and excellent future opportunities cemented my decision to apply to this university. Without wasting any time, I applied and also asked for a scholarship. I was confident due to my academics and research proclivity that I would get in, each day waiting patiently for my dream to become reality. And finally, on July 28, 2017, I received the offer letter with a student scholarship.
In September of 2017, I arrived in the peaceful city of Sheffield to start the journey that was going to change my life. Soon, I was part of The Insigneo Institute for in silico medicine which has £40 million of research income. Being part of this prestigious and one-of-a-kind institute gave me the opportunity to interact with many different professionals and understand the latest research in the current medical device and hospital industry. 
Further, as part of the degree I am required to complete modules which give me an overall background in patient-specific modelling skills, a better understanding of clinical data and a closer look at medical device manufacturing. The course is designed in such a way that it also trains you in real-life applications. Modules like Regulatory Affairs for Medical Devices will help increase my demand in the industry. The course also includes an opportunity to carry out the research of your choice as part of a 60-credit project.
The cosy city of Sheffield and the welcoming environment of the university makes a student like me, living far away from home, very comfortable. The university has top-notch accommodation, student facilities, and staff that are always ready to help. The library and computer access facilities, The Diamond and Information Commons do not fail to amaze me as they contain all the latest books, journals and updated software.
Dream big, because they do come true — as they did for me in the beautiful city of Sheffield.

Just say NO
"," Appearances are deceptive for, not all victims of drug abuse look the part — they rarely don the dazed, lost countenance of one in the vice-like grip of drugs. Nor do they stomp around in desperate, frenzied rage, even if temporarily denied their dose of ecstasy. Naturally, a chance glance at 19-year-old Trishna* would in no way divulge the trauma she has experienced.
Suffice it to say, Trishna too went through the run-of-the mill experiences when she joined a reputed liberal arts institute in Haryana. What started off innocuously as hanging out with her batchmates, in a bid to acclimatise herself to them, resulted in her taking the plunge and “doing the drag”, as her friends urged her to try, “just once”. She elaborates on how it all began in the campus smoking room. “No, it isn’t designated by authorities. Rather, it has become a hangout where faculty and students who crave a smoke go to,” she is quick to clarify.
“That’s how it began for me as well. A friend convinced me to give it a shot and soon, drugs became my go-to solution. There were times when I had been high for a whole week. My studies took a hit; I lost focus and became unproductive. I would turn to drugs to assuage my fears of not clearing the semester... it was a vicious cycle,” she shudders.
Flights of fantasy
For 20-year-old Niranjan, an English literature student from a reputed Bengaluru university, it was the trip of a lifetime, or so he assumed, when he tried his first dose of Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD). The rush he felt — bouts of calm and alternative creative surges — floored him. Colours around him seemed brighter, and he experienced an inexplicable communion with nature. He could practically “feel” the dormant parts of his brain awaken, as though from slumber. “I have never been a brilliant student, but that day, the essay I wrote for my assignment was of another ilk, something I did not know I was capable of,” he admits.
“But that’s what LSD is known for, after all. It is said to improve creative performance. That is why I decided to try it that first time. I had to do something about my falling grades...” he continues, his voice almost a whisper, a twinge of guilt, palpable.
Guilt, because, his “first” time did not stop there, and he went on to trip on LSD many times until he was addicted. After a few attempts, he discovered not all trips were happy ones that resulted in enhanced performance. Before he knew it, he began suffering from depression when his doses failed to help him perform in class.
Reality ‘un’ check?
Consuming drugs to satisfy one’s immediate needs, and eluding reality that has become too terrible to handle, has become a common trend. “This stems from youngsters’ need for instant gratification. The practice of persevering for a goal seems incredulous to them, and they seek refuge in drugs,” says Dr. Yusuf Merchant, a Mumbai-based psychiatrist.
Most youngsters who consume drugs — especially in the case of LSD — ingest small doses, a process called ‘microdosing’. They fallaciously assume that due to the almost negligible quantity, they will not experience any adverse effects, he continues.
Santhosh, a 24-year-old architecture graduate from Chennai, concurs. He elaborates on how he went through a stage where he was thoroughly disillusioned with life. He got into what he naively believed was a lasting friendship, only to wake up to the harrowing cognizance that he had been used as a “rich kid” pawn in their nasty machinations. “I began ingesting drugs. It was quite easy to procure. I knew someone who would get me whatever I needed from a source who operated from within the Chennai harbour premises,” he says. “Soon, I was a mere shadow of my former self. I experienced bouts of rage and depression if I didn’t get my regular doses. Life, back then, seemed to be a blurry, endless pursuit of waiting for Friday, which meant smokes, drinks, and drugs.”
The way out
For Trishna, quitting cold-turkey was ironically the result of being assaulted by a drunk friend. “I was in the smoking room when he took advantage of me,” she recalls. “Drugged as I was, I was not strong enough to overpower him. That absolute powerlessness I felt, made me quit overnight.”
Santhosh, however, explains that quitting was a Herculean task. When he approached a gym trainer to train him and the latter refused, knowing he was a junkie, it was the last straw that broke the camel’s back. “The trainer eventually agreed to train me after a month, if I returned with a clean blood report,” he says. “It was a torturous process. There were times when I would bite or physically harm myself not to give in to temptation. That was in the past. It has now been well over a year since I quit,” he says, the pride in his voice evident.
But, epiphany is not everyone’s cup of tea. 
Prevention
Dr. Merchant explains how all governments typically focus on supply-reduction measures. Naturally, the more one restricts supply, more the demand. “When it comes to school or college-goers, the answer lies in prevention — something about which the government is doing nothing concrete. A step in this direction is to involve youngsters. For instance, in conjunction with the World Health Organisation, my NGO — Drug Abuse Information Rehabilitation & Research Centre — conducted a programme where we trained students between 18-20 years and sent them to schools. There, the young trainers conducted a targeted intervention for school kids and taught them to deal with stress and peer-pressure — common denominators for drug addicts,” he elucidates.
“Another possible solution could be a scenario where educational institutions enforce the rule that those caught with drugs in their possession will be suspended for six months and sent for corrective action. Counsellors should be appointed on campus to scrutinise high-risk students — essentially, those who are regular absentees or continually underperform — and insist they meet the counsellor irrespective of whether or not they are under the influence of drugs. Thus, even those mulling over drug-related curiosity will think twice,” adds Dr. Merchant.
In Chennai, the Lifeline Centre for Prevention of Children from Alcoholism and Substance (Drug) Abuse in Chengalpattu, the State’s first de-addiction centre, was recently set up by the Department of Social Defence for children and juveniles in conflict with the law. “This is the first-of-its-kind centre in not just Tamil Nadu, but in south India. There is a centre in Delhi,” explains Chezian Ramu, the founder. “However, both models are different — while the one here is an open model, the former is a closed model, which is merely another observation home. Here, we believe children ought not be kept locked under complete observation. Hence, we decided that this will be a space where youngsters will undergo the process of de-addiction voluntarily, as opposed to being forced by family or society to do so. In other words, once the parents bring the youngster, we will ensure that the individual understands the de-addiction process that he or she will undergo, before opting for it. The parent can stay back here with the child for a week so that he or she too understands the situation,” he adds.
While innumerable measures have been taken to nip drug abuse in the bud, success seems elusive. However, in the words of Dr. Merchant, “Youngsters indulge in drugs to get away from the ‘here’. If we can find ways to make the ‘here and now’ better, drug abuse will surely and steadily decline.”

And she scored one!
","Two camps, a ball, and lots of good wishes gave Sanjana Ramesh the golden chance to join Northern Arizona University (NAU) in the U.S. After participating in the NBA Academies Women’s Programme camp in May at The NBA Academy India, Sanjana has become the second participant from The NBA Academies Women’s Programme to sign a National Letter of Intent with an NCAA D-1 School. Sanjana is the second Indian-born female player ever to receive a basketball scholarship from a D-1 school. 
“It is a dream come true. I hope this will encourage more people to take to basketball,” says Sanjana, who will be part of the NAU’s women’s basketball team for the 2019-20 North American Division I college season.
The scholarship will cover the entire tuition fee and accommodation expenses. If Sanjana chooses to take up accommodation outside the campus, she will receive a monthly stipend. The scholarship will also cover food and medical expenses.
She is keeping her options open as far as the courses she plans to pursue at NAU are concerned. “I am mainly looking at business administration or psychology. I will probably opt for courses related to sports management,” she reveals. 
For Sanjana, what started as a hobby, has opened up a host of opportunities around the world. 
She has participated in Basketball Without Borders Asia, a three-day basketball development camp for the top male and female prospects from throughout Asia, and was named MVP of the camp for the girls division. She captained India’s U16 team in FIBA’s U16 Asia Cup in 2017. She was also part of the Indian team at the 2018 William Jones Cup held in Taiwan. 
Sanjana, who is currently in Class XII at Delhi Public School, in Bengaluru, speaks to EDGE about her love for the game and the exciting new experiences that it has opened up.
Why did you take up basketball? 
I initially started it as a hobby, but once I got into the Karnataka team, there was a shift in how seriously I started taking the sport. 
I had a liking for the game and felt I have natural skill for it. Of course, I had good coaches throughout school, club, and at the National level who encouraged me and trained me. 
How did the scholarship come about? 
I was hoping to know about the process and scope at the Basketball Without Borders camp. I thought the camp would be a good opportunity to understand if playing college basketball in the U.S. was a possibility. I participated in the NBA Academies Women’s Programme which preceded Basketball Without Borders 2018 Asia camp. While it was meant to improve the players’ skills, they were quite open to discussing opportunities and were quite encouraging for me to try NCAA Division 1 college basketball.
How do you plan to balance both basketball and academics? 
I have my list of goals and ambitions about what I would like to achieve in basketball. As far as studies go, I intend to learn to further my interest in certain areas like entrepreneurship, management, and psychology, and maybe try to link it to sports in some way. 
How do you hope to inspire more people to take up this sport? 
Over time, if I can convince more players to take up the sport, I would be proud of that. At the moment, I am trying my best to encourage junior players to aim higher like the NBA training camps that helped me boost my skills. 
Since the scholarship announcement, quite a few people have been asking me about the possibilities and about how to apply. Being in a position to help out is something I take great pride in. Even after moving to the U.S., I intend to continue to follow up and I will always be in touch with Indian team members whom I know well now, and especially players in my age group. 
I will keep motivating players who are in my age group and younger to me. Many talented players are coming up and the numbers will continue to grow.

Language of collaboration ","I recall a game from my days as a corporate training facilitator, which was a favourite with some companies. Teams would be taken on a short, one-day trip to a nature spot. They were encouraged to participate in leisure activities, relax and have fun. The particular game I am referring to required one member of the team to stand on a slightly elevated platform, with her back to the rest of the team standing on the ground. And then, on the facilitator’s cue, she had to close her eyes and fall back. The team would catch her, avoiding any injury. It was basically a blind, free fall and the litmus test of trust within your team. 
Though this was a fun, team-building activity, it helped uncover any inherent tensions or “beliefs” in a set of people working together. In teams that trusted each other and had a strong sense of bonding, the fall wouldn’t be an issue. But in the absence of those, the fall is a difficult task because you are not sure your team has your back. 
Organisations the world over now favour collaboration over individualism. While an individual’s talent matters, how she contributes to the team’s talent and strengthens the team as a unit, becomes more critical. 
This leads to the pivotal question: What makes a great team and how does a team develop mutual trust? In these days of agility, when our workplace encourages quick problem solving and faster business results, teamwork becomes especially critical. 
Team playing as a skill, is driven essentially by the desire to make the team succeed. This desire is fired by the motivation to help each other, communicate to each other clearly and honestly at all times, all the while led by a shared sense of purpose. It is, to a great extent, the leader’s responsibility to ensure such an environment is created in the team so that its members feel valued, secure and inspired. When the leader of a team creates the end goal and empowers the team to accomplish it, the team members feel inspired to pursue it.
But the onus is not on the leader alone. Once such an environment has been created for us by the leader, we must be able to apply our individual talent and autonomously take decisions that help the team. Such decisions must be made transparently and honestly, creating trust. Individual opinions must be sought and considered, contributions valued and responsibilities shared. All the while, open communication must be practised. 
Whenever possible, the team must also relax and have fun together in informal scenarios, which makes them feel at ease in each other’s company. Team lunches or trips are all ways in which teams can come together to have fun. But the leader must ensure that the camaraderie outside work is complemented by camaraderie and mutual respect at work. 
It is like playing cricket. Individuals in a team may have their strengths and weaknesses, but come together to win the game. As long as we speak the language of collaboration, taking that leap of trust shouldn’t be difficult. The team will have our back.

CKP students reach out to common man
","For the first time, the graduating students of College of Fine Arts, Karnataka Chitrakala Parishat (CKP) are showcasing their works outside their premises in an attempt to connect with the public. The works are being exhibited at Rangoli Metro Art Centre. The show commenced on Sunday and will continue till May 11. Titled Overlap,the show consists of works from both conventional and unconventional media. Post-card drawings and paintings are the main attraction, apart from prints and sculptures. Such a vast gamut of genre, style and ideas don’t easily gel, but the 110 feet wide Vismaya Gallery of Rangoli is an apt place for such an exhibition. “The aim is to throw open art works, which were endorsed in art school, to the public and engage in a dialogue with the common man,” said G.R. Mouna, whose work is on display.
According to H.A. Anil Kumar, who teaches in CKP, a certain stigma is attached to art school education, that it is something elitist and non-communicative. This would be proved wrong by interacting with the public, he added.

Stay competitive ","For generations, having an MBA has been considered one of the most sought after paths to success, in the business world. Every student is truly aware of the lucrative edge that an MBA in sales and marketing, finance, human resources, operations and IT could give them. In this modern era, the dream of studying at a top business school, passing with exceptional grades, getting a top management position and a handsome package, has been ingrained in students. 
Every year, approximately 1.8 to 2 lakh students appear for a mainstream MBA exam. This is not just restricted to final year college students or fresh graduates, but pre-employed professionals as well. It is a crazy rat race, and the consequences aren’t always pleasing. Not only is the probability of getting through a top college low, but employment is also a cause of worry. After all, general business programmes are in abundance and with everyone opting for the same course, there is no freshness that comes out. Everyone wants to be globally relevant but at the same time wants to work within sectors of the Indian economy. A strong inclination towards doing something unconventional is linked with the unlikely possibility of succeeding in the job market.
Evolving demand
Innovation is the key to staying competitive. As the cultural framework of the country evolves, a number of management institutes have realised the need for swerving away from traditional courses and offering niche management degrees. They are attempting to differentiate themselves in a crowded MBA marketplace with tailor-made courses that are relevant, compelling, dynamic, and not available elsewhere. They have not moved away from the traditional MBA; instead, they have drawn up a gamut of niche MBA programmes in order to adapt to the changing demands of the industry and students. These courses are a perfect blend of theory and practice, preparing students to meet contemporary global needs.
The following courses offer tremendous potential as well as a global competitive edge. 
Energy and environment: An MBA in energy and environment currently offers plenty of opportunities waiting to be tapped. This course is not only well-equipped to train aspiring professionals towards managerial, economic, legal, political and relevant technical competence, but also makes them a crucial link between the world of technology, business and sustainable development. It encompasses sectors such as power, renewable energy, energy efficiency, oil and gas, climate change and sustainable development, green buildings, corporate sustainability, global standards and environmental management.
Agri-business: This sector is growing rapidly, with the food and agriculture business all set to triple itself by 2020. An MBA in agri-business presents a challenging and exciting opportunity to help contribute to and engineer this demanding and dynamic revolution. This course works well in fields such as agriculture and WTO, agricultural export-import and agricultural finance, as it broadly covers marketing, finance, taxation and supply chain management.
Multiple B-schools provide high-quality niche MBA programmes. It is time to check out these contemporary career options that could not only match your interests but also help you improve your prospects.

Cherry-pick your habits
","Habit is when you crave your mug of beer, listening to Pink Floyd on your playlist while running on the treadmill. This exaggeration is to underscore my preoccupation with habit building and the opportunity I see us having in choosing a new one! Habits are ingrained, have automaticity, emotional memory, and have subcutaneous hold over us. Perhaps this, and many indolent reasons had me believe in my slavery to certain habits till late.
Habit loop
“The habit loop is a neurological pattern that governs any habit. It consists of three elements: a cue, a routine and a reward. Understanding these components can help in understanding how to change habit or cultivate new ones. The habit loop is always started with a cue, a trigger that transfers your brain into a mode that automatically determines which habit to use. The heart of the habit is a mental, emotional or physical routine. Finally there is a reward, which helps your brain determine if this particular loop is worth remembering for the future… The cue and reward become neurologically intertwined until a sense of craving emerges.” — An excerpt from Charles Duhigg’s The Power of Habit. 
To me, craving is most central to the debate on habit; it drives all habits and is critical to assess what is a habit and what is not. The strategic aspect in all habits — insidious and desirable — is that they get built on the expectation of reward: what do I get (or feel) off this habit.
To tell you how my understanding of habits evolved, I’ll take the reminiscing route into a habit once integral to my life. 
The habit: relaxation and fun equals drinking. 
The first time I drank alcohol, I hated it. But I liked the headiness it gave me and that lured me back to my next, until I loved the taste, the act, and the after-effects of an alcoholic binge. To confess, the habit rewarded me lasting memories of friendship, abandon, and experiences that always bring me a smile.
The question is does the habit serve me today? Was it possible — once I’d tasted the reward and repetitive influence of this habit as my only way to unwind — for it to lose its sheen and be replaced with a routine equally rewarding? The answer is a yes.
The habit would have persisted if I hadn’t found a cohesive reward from another source sometime later. It was the experience of unlimited alertness in a physical routine and discipline. In war language, the headiness of alertness was pitting against the lightness of oblivion.
It is the alertness I now needed in the midst of a physical routine that demanded my entire being to be alive and together for its completion, because the demand was to remain alert in mind, till only the body gave up. 
In Zoya Akhtar’s seminal movie, Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara, Laila, the diving-instructor, describes her experience of deep-sea diving as meditative as different from addictive. It is similar to the alertness in a bungee jump when one is fully awake to every sensation in and around versus the memory lapse between the fourth peg of alcohol, getting home and waking up in bed the next morning! So, here’s how the habit loop developed in my case: it replaced the routine of drinking to unwind with a daily physical routine — a far more energising reward with immeasurable repeat value. Repeated craving for the reward has built a default habit of physical activity as my preferred way to relax. 
To put it in perspective: I do enjoy my drink, but I no longer need a drink to enjoy. 
Going back to the idea that habits are mental and emotional too, frequent anxiety, procrastination, self-doubt, and victim mentality are also habits. When they get in the way of a rewarding life, we have a choice of cherry picking new habits and cultivating them, towards happy and engaged lives. 
Any habits you wish to swap?

A class with a difference
","When I entered the Easy English School, Wakeshwar Vidyalaya Peth, Pune, an initiative by ITNL (IL&FS Transportation Networks Ltd.), it did not matter that I had had a long day’s travel behind me, or that the pitter-patter of the rain just did not seem to give up; what mattered was that this basic abode of learning housed energies, which were beyond just the average. For, perhaps, the ‘nth’ time I understood in life how many things, we humans, just take for granted in the run of a day, and that includes, of course, the countless blessings bestowed on us in our respective lives. I reminisced, with a sense of déjà vu, how difficult it is to learn something new, especially if the resources are the bare minimum; but, mind you, bare minimum is sometimes so much more than what these words just give away.
Unknown domain
I was invited by the headmaster of the school, Mr. Ashok Valse, to visit one of the classes in order to interact with the students, for whom English had not been a mother tongue, but who had gathered their guts, resources and wits to venture into a domain unknown — learning a language hardly used in their day to day lives. It reminded me of my days when I took to learning German — my ‘mother tongue’, whose learning evaded me till my later years. I understood the challenges of learning a foreign language, a language hardly used, but yet the will to master it — either to prove a point or to just to evolve. These youngsters were no different. 
I could relate to the efforts they made, when they placed words together to make sentences, when they struggled with vocabulary or shyness and insecurity, or when the mind would just go blank in front of an audience. I did understand, I did relate, but what caught me off guard was the determination to shine, no matter what. 
With reverence
Lalita Kashid, the English teacher of the class, is a lady who has carved a path for herself. Most of the language learning she now imparts has been self-learnt, polished with the passage of time, and experience, making her quite a force to reckon with. Her students adore her — not only because she is their teacher, but because she brings along with her a zest for learning, and an energy for living life to the fullest. Lalita invites Shrushti, a young girl, around 14 years of age, to speak in front of the class on the subject of superstition, which won the youngster the top position in a competition. Shrushti obliges; with powerful intonation and expressions, she completes her speech, leaving us all stunned — a young girl, from a village, in the middle of nowhere, aligns and modulates her thoughts so well! Her inspiration? Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, and his book Wings of Fire. Tanvi, another student, from the same class, talks about her family, comprising of 12 members; her narration captivates because of the meaning and emotion it carries. Sanika talks about how education is vital for the development of the girl child, and hence the community — the correlation of both these subjects is, in itself, a realisation. The expressions begin to flow as the class begins to ‘open up’ to a set of strange faces. We absorb and assimilate the experience.
It helps me re-assert to myself that for an individual to teach or learn, it is not the only the infrastructure and technology available that matter; they are, of course, facilitators; what matters is the human touch, which help transform pedagogy from mere transmission to transformation, accompanied with grit and determination to make a difference.
As I take my leave from the class, I look at the cheerful faces, with eyes that host a million dreams, and I replenish that fire in me to live life to the fullest, now and always.

Polish sojourn
","It has always been my dream to go to a European country because of the varied cultural exchange. I completed my Bachelor of Architecture from Bharath University, Chennai and I wanted to get out of my comfort zone at home and explore the world outside my country.
Most people go to the US for pursuing further education away from India. But I preferred Europe. The primary reason I chose Europe is that all I would need is a single visa to travel to other European countries. There is also a student exchange programme called ‘ERASMUS+’ which allows students to travel to other European countries to experience different cultures, and learning with people with different approaches. As part of this programme, people from various universities across Europe visit Poland every year.
I chose Gdansk University of Technology in Poland for my education, which is the largest technical University in the Pomerania region. It is one of the oldest technical universities in Poland. Its architecture department has been ranked among the topmost in Europe and Poland. It is very well known for its neoclassical architecture, and is the sixth most beautiful university in Europe. Gdansk is a city filled with students and they are the front and centre of the city, and are found in every nook and corner. 
Wholesome
I am currently pursuing my masters in architecture here and it is simply amazing. The students and faculty are always open to fresh ideas, and are very encouraging. The faculty takes architecture to a whole new dimension with their teaching methods which always include a lot of group work. Despite being the only Indian in my department, I feel included, and part of the group. I have made a lot of friends from various parts of Europe who have helped and supported me all along.
While the education is definitely the best, that is not the only thing Poland has to offer. The cost of living here is much lower compared to most other countries. The whole city has special discount prices exclusively for students. Trams, buses and trains — all of these make it a very well connected place and ensure hassle free transit. The food here is varied, easily available and above all, tasty. The Polish make traditional dumplings called ‘pierogi’, which always remind me of ‘kozhukattai’, a delicacy from my community back home in India. The people are hospitable, warm and welcoming as a summer breeze and they always try to make foreigners feel at home.
Another thing about Poland is the language, which is one the most beautiful languages I have come across. With its beautiful and tidy beaches, top class education and affordable living, it is one of the best places to live in.

A rare treasure preserved
","When Varghese Angamaly (K.P. Varghese) got this book way back in 1985 the only thing that interested him was its antiquity.
Printed in 1804 at the Propaganda Press, Rome, on handmade paper using the ancient stone press, some of the pages of this book on Sanskrit grammar was moth-eaten, but still in a remarkably good condition. It became a prized possession in Varghese’s personal library.
The book, Vyàcarana seu locupletissima Samscrdamicae linguae institutio by Paulino A.S. Bartholomaeo who is known by several other names, the most popular one being Paulinus Padre, is credited with being the author of the first edition of the first Sanskrit grammar book Sidharubam seu grammatica Samscrdamica (1790) to be published in Europe. This work, together with Paulinus’ Vyàcarana and the grammar of Paulinus’ predecessor in Kerala, Father Johann Ernst Hanxleden (Arnos Padre) helped to cast light upon the sources utilised to teach Sanskrit grammar in the 17th and 18th centuries.
A published short story writer, Varghese who also writes travelogues and articles in most of the leading regional publications, browsed through this work occasionally and kept it back safely. “A couple of years back I chanced to read a book by Father Abraham Adapoor, a scholar who has made seminal studies on the life and works of Arnos Padre. He created a flutter by stating that the works of Paulinus Padre, all of them, were not original. The argument was that Paulinus, who had spent time in Kerala returned to Rome with the works of Arnos Padre, copied them and had them printed under his name. That was when I realised that I had one of the ‘original’ books of Paulinus Padre. I wrote about this in a regional weekly. Father Adapoor met me, took photo copies of some of the relevant pages but the controversy raged on,” says Varghese.
Things took a different turn after an interview with Carmela Mastrangelo, an Italian Sanskrit scholar, was published in The Hindu MetroPlus (February 27, 2014). Carmela’s noteworthy work was on Sanskrit grammar in 18th century Kerala pivoted on the work of Paulinus Padre. This was the subject for her PhD thesis and it aimed to reconstruct the history of the studies on Sanskrit grammar in Kerala through the work of Paulinus Padre, who settled in Malabar from 1776 to 1789. She focussed in particular on Paulinus’ Vyàcarana. Carmela states that Paulinus Padre brought Sanskrit grammar to Europe, studied in Italy but his work was hidden by the Englishmen of the Asiatic Society. Soome of the manuscripts have been lost, but some remain in the National Museum in Rome, she adds.
“I managed to get in touch with Carmela, who confirmed that the original manuscripts of Paulinus’ Vyacarana were still there in Rome. I told Father Adapoor about this and he was convinced about the originality of Paulinus’ works. And now I realise that the copy I have with me is the only one available in India making it so invaluable.”
This book of 331 pages is on Sanskrit-Latin grammar but provides interesting information on a whole lot of other subjects. “There are certain observations like origin of name of places like Kozhikode, it has an introduction by Cardinal Stephen Borge, it has a dictionary with sketches and the most interesting aspect is that Sanskrit is not used in Devanagari script but in Malayalam.”
Varghese, a retired bank manager, is the author of three books - Angamaly Rekhagal (2002) on the local history of the place, two short story collections, Punitha Varuvel Bandset (2013) and Kovilkalakal (2013). “I’m working on a novel and a travelogue titled Red Sea to Dead Sea. History excites me and that’s why after graduating in Commerce I took a post-graduate degree in History. Every travel is an exploration, a revisiting, of what I have read in those history books,” says Varghese.
Varghese has now decided to donate this rare copy of Paulinus’ Vyacarana to any institution, “preferably one involved in teaching Sanskrit and will promise to preserve this with care for posterity.”

Dynamism in the classroom
"," Teachers are the backbone of any society. As they lead the young generation of any nation, they have always stood out as the most revered community. However much water has flown down the bridge over time. Today’s teachers are feeling the heat and resentment, as they face the many challenges in this profession. 
The foremost seems to be the discrepancy in the salary of private and government school teachers. While it is good that the government teachers are getting their due, private school teachers are overburdened with work and still do not get paid accordingly. The slightest lucrative opportunity elsewhere makes a teacher manipulative hoping to grab it. This results in high attrition rate and even the sense of belongingness to an institution suffers a setback.
Attending to needs
The second challenge to a teacher is posed within the class in the form of a diversified class. Teachers often not only grapple with the diversification of content but also the diverse needs of students within the class. Here we are talking about differently-abled children. A teacher needs to be sensitive to the needs of these children while doing their bit to sensitise other children for making an empathetic classroom. Teachers are expected to prepare different lesson plans to teach all categories of students across their class. This becomes challenging when there is the responsibility of course completion as well as preparing students for assessments within strict deadlines.
Next comes the tackling of knowledge outburst through technology. There is the ever expanding content within subjects which needs to be made concise and relevant for the students. The subjects today are not compartmentalised, but merge into each other demanding integrated learning from teachers. 
Today a teacher who is a jack of all arts and even master of one can only survive. They have to keep their antennae up for any new information and breakthroughs in the academic space. At times even the creativity and ingenuity of the teachers is compromised in the race to acquire more content knowledge.
Bigger role
 Further, while a teacher’s role is concentrated to a facilitator in academics, they also have a greater role to play in the emotional well-being of the child. The family orientation of today’s children leaves little space for his or her self-expression so a teacher’s role is crucial in becoming a guardian to a student. They need to talk to children as a group and personally too, more often. This paves the way for a compassionate classroom and better relationship dynamics between a teacher and student. Thus, a teacher now shares the liability of a parent too in handling the personality of the child in and outside the classroom.
In a nutshell, a teacher’s profession demands dynamism on their part to survive, thrive and accomplish the highest goal of moulding a young mind. A well trained teacher who loves this profession can only wade through the stagnancies on the job. A teacher should be given the support and motivation from the institution and society to strengthen his/her ideals. They should be given free time for capacity building in the area of their interest. They should also be given highest incentives for the job that involves emancipation of the human morale and ideas to its fullest level.

Group of schools refuses to begin RTE quota admissions
","The Tamil Nadu nursery, primary, matriculation and higher secondary schools association on Monday announced that their schools would not admit students under the 25 per cent quota mandated by the Right to Education Act, 2009 until the school education department committed on a time-frame for reimbursement of fee for admissions made in the last two years.
Starting May 3, schools in the State were supposed to start issuing admission forms for seats under the quota. K.R. Nandakumar, secretary of the association, said that they have been providing admissions for the past two years and had opened bank accounts as instructed, but were yet to receive the amount. He added that matriculation schools are also grappling with issues such as students migrating to CBSE schools because of Tamil being a compulsory language in many classes. The Association claims to have around 10,000 schools as members.
As per the Act, the government has to reimburse the schools for the admissions made. In Tamil Nadu, the amount to be reimbursed is either the fee fixed by the government-appointed private fee determination committee for the school or the amount spent by the government per child, whichever is lesser.
A school education department official said that schools would get the amount in 3-4 months and that they should not refrain from issuing admissions forms. An official said that last week, matriculation schools were asked to follow the government schedule on RTE admissions so that all seats could be filled this year.
Activist A. Narayanan said that the 25 per cent seats must be non-negotiable and should not be opened up for the general category. “In the survey conducted last month by volunteers from Becoming I Foundation, they found that close to 30 schools had the admission forms ready. Not conducting admissions is not the way forward. The department should have also been proactive,” he said.
According to a department official close 50,000 students were admitted in the State under the 25 per cent quota in 2013-14.

Retain teachers, not their certificates
","Recently, there were reports in the mainstream media that a young assistant professor who worked in a private college in Tamil Nadu committed suicide after the college allegedly allegedly refused to return his academic certificates that were retained by the college authorities at the time of his joining the institution. The sad news shook the conscience of those in academia who resorted to social media to discuss the legal and ethical aspects of private educational institutions withholding certificates. It is learnt that a few of them even wrote to the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) highlighting the problems encountered by employees who struggle to get their certificates back when they need to move to a better job. The impact is that now the AICTE has issued a public notice stating that it is illegal and unethical to withhold employees’ certificates. It has even issued a warning that it would withdraw the approval given to the colleges that flout the rule.
Violating rules
Most private educational institutions (schools, technical institutes, colleges, deemed-to-be universities, and so on.) retain their staff’s academic certificates at the time of issuing employment contracts to them. Some institutions collect all the certificates including mark sheets and retain them, making it really hard for the staff to apply for any other job during the academic year. It is true employees have a tough time recovering their certificates from their employers in many educational institutions, when they decide to quit their jobs. Many have to forego their better prospects as they are not able to recover their documents in time.
Is this problem unique in India? Yes, it seems to be. I worked abroad for five years. At the time of recruitment, my certificates were verified by the Educational Consultants India Ltd (EdCIL), Noida and during my service at the Kigali Institute of Science, Technology and Management, Rwanda, my academic certificates were quite safe at home in India. There were over 50 expatriates at the Institute and there was not a single case of anyone quitting the job without proper notice.
Indians who run educational institutions in Gulf countries retain all the original documents including the passports of expatriate staff. I have heard numerous tragic stories of Indian expatriates working in Indian schools who could not visit India when their presence at home very much needed. Isn’t withholding one’s passport a human rights violation? Yes, it is.
Is it a good practice to withhold teachers’ academic certificates and other original documents? Why do educational institutions indulge in such practices? I discussed this issue with some heads and administrators of some private educational institutions. A Principal of a well-known school said, “We retain the certificates of our staff only for security reasons. We do face problems when a teacher quits our school in the middle of an academic year. To prevent them from quitting we have to keep their original documents with us.” When I countered her with the question whether it would be difficult to find a replacement for anyone who resigned if the institution paid a competitive and decent pay to the staff and created a good working environment for them, she just flashed a smile. Yes, finding a suitable replacement is not at all difficult as there are many well-qualified and good teachers waiting for well-paid jobs.
Make changes
 Here is a different view. Another head of an educational institution said, “Teachers should not be treated as bonded labourers. Instead of keeping possession of any teacher’s original documents and certificates, educational institutions should issue employment contracts in which all terms and conditions are clearly specified. The contracts are signed by the employer and the employee and be honoured by both the parties.”
When teachers serving in government educational institutions and employees working in companies keep their original certificates with them, why shouldn’t those who work in private educational institutions be allowed to keep their original documents with them? The fact that there are some rare cases of teachers absconding should not make employers distrust every teacher. Academic certificates are the intellectual property of those who have received specific education after years of study and hard work. Therefore, the certificates should be with the owner and not with anyone else.
Employers can always state that they retain the certificates of employees with the latter’s consent. If there is a rule which specifies clearly that even with the consent of employees, employers should not keep possession of employees’ academic certificates, then employees will be safer. In the absence of such enforcement of laws, employees will have to be at the mercy of their employers.
Employers need not keep possession of any employee’s certificates for these reasons: i) Employees are at the receiving end because they have to get service certificates from the employer. At times, the employer serves as a referee when any employee quits the organisation and joins some other organisation. ii) If the employee has signed an employment contract s/he has to abide by the terms and conditions in the contract and legal action can be initiated by the employer against any employee who violates the contract. iii) No employee will dare to quit an organisation without proper notice because s/he has to get many other formalities completed before joining another organisation.
Retaining good teachers and not retaining the academic certificates of teachers should be the motto of educational institutions. Certificates are the intellectual property of those own them. Retaining the certificates of employees is akin to depriving them of their rights to own their property. It is true employees need jobs and at the same time employers need employees. Without employees, the word “employer” is meaningless. Both employers and employees are mutually dependent on each other. Employees need not be at the mercy of employers. Good employers make employees feel that they are co-workers and not servants. Therefore, they should have mutual trust and respect for each other.
Employers should be benevolent and happily bid farewell to any employee who decides to quit their job in order to move on to greener pastures. When will our educational institutions show such a gesture of goodwill?

Power through your predicaments
","I am a 19 year-old engineering student and have no interest in making a career out of it. I want to drop out and pursue a career in motion graphics and VFX. Should I go ahead with it? - Mukunthan I
Dear Mukunthan, 
I understand you are struggling with your course, but how can I decide on your behalf? How good are you at motion graphics and VFX? What has been your previous experience with it? Have you tasted success, or is it something you fancy? If you are seriously considering dropping out, I suggest you do a complete career and personality profiling to know what field and course best suits you. It makes sense to take a calculated risk than just shoot in the dark. Good luck.
I am a mechanical engineer and have sat for many recruitments, but cannot pass them. Now, I am unsure about what to do next. The dilemma is perturbing. Do I wait at home for the next round of government jobs or do I apply for private ones? If I do apply for private jobs, then, by this time of the year, is it possible? My morale is declining. Please help. - Rahul Choudhary
Dear Rahul,
It is disheartening to hear that you are unable to get through a good placement. What is the feedback that you receive after the interview and the recruitment process? In future, please ask the panel to specify and articulate the areas that are not working for you, so that you can consciously improve in those. Private jobs are always open to hiring as and when there is a vacancy or a position that opens up. Sign up on some company portals that interest you. Also, sign up on online job portals and meet some aggressive head-hunters and placement offices. Discuss your area of interest in detail with them and explain the role/s that would excite you. Identify for yourself, what in the government sector interests you and meet a consultant who can perhaps guide you further for that as well, side by side. Accordingly, start your preparation for those exams.
I am 23, and am pursuing my LLB after graduating in commerce. After graduation, my parents asked me to opt for bank coaching and to get a secure job. But, I wanted to study further. It was my decision to pursue a career in law. Now, the course is in progress. But by this time, my friends have completed their studies and some of them got placed well too. At this point, I’m stressed. Even though my parents are supportive, they are not financially sound. I seem to have made a big mistake in my career. Now, I would like to do my master’s in law at Amity University, but I am in a dilemma over whether to study further or apply for a job. - Aparna Chandran
Dear Aparna,
It is but natural what you are going through. Relax. You made the right choice; don’t fret over it. Everyone has his/ her independent destination in life, and no two people take the same route. So, don’t let anyone overwhelm you.
When do you finish your course? Would you need to intern next or can you start working immediately? Have you considered working for a few years to be financially stable, before you do your master’s? Identify what part of law makes you happy and find a job in that area, specifically. You are young and there are many opportunities out there immediately after your course. Start networking and exploring options of where you would want to work and set the intent and the ball rolling. All the best.
I’m 17 years old, currently in Class XII, and also preparing for the JEE 2019. I have always been a good student throughout school, but things started to change as I progressed to class XI. I joined a reputed institute to aid my JEE prep. Things were easy-going at first, but I felt the stress, after some months. I don’t know what initiated such pressure, but it worsened when I entered class XII. I developed the habit of overthinking, because of which my mind has become so tired that I am unable to focus on my studies. This happens every day. As a result, my performance suffered at school and the institute. I just can’t make-up my mind to study. I see most of my friends studying for hours, but I am unable to. My determination has weakened. What should I do? Please guide me - Kshitij
Hi Kshitij,
You are perhaps going through severe performance anxiety and tend to overthink. Please breathe. The boards and JEE are just exams; yes, important for sure, but they don’t define and limit you. Set your personal goals, don’t worry about who is doing what and studying for how many hours a day. Be well-versed with the exam portions and focus on your journey. Make sure you are well rested, eat well, hydrated and work towards a timetable with specific goals. Where do you see yourself in May 2019?
This is the final leg; you need to be calm, rational and focused. Without that, you will make a mess of your class XII exams and that will bring down your confidence to do well at the JEE 2019. Regret is a wasted emotion. Please reset your ‘determination switch’. We are already in December and you only have a few more months to go. With the pre-boards and the revisions, you will be more than ready. Put your best foot forward.

The number game
"," The world is divided over math — almost everyone is taught the subject in some form or the other. By the time people hit their teenage years, the battle lines are drawn — “I love math” or “I hate math”. Well, I love math though I fully empathise with those who don’t — what do a bunch of squiggly symbols mean for the real world, anyway? Can we talk English, please? Or Marathi? Or perhaps…. Swahili, instead? For those for whom math is play, though, the world looks promising.
There was a time when a love for the subject primarily led you to academics or areas such as engineering or accounting. But today, “purer” applications of mathematics have emerged, giving you the opportunity to play with math while engaging with industries and customers. Here are a few such avenues. 
1. Big data: There is stock analytics, sports analytics, market analytics, health analytics, consumer data analytics — data is everywhere and businesses love to let creative mathematicians uncovers patterns and stories. For example, the Square Kilometer Array project aggregates data from thousands of radio telescopes, unmanned rovers, probes and observatories to figure out how the galaxy was formed at the “cosmic dawn”. Music companies collate data from sources including downloads, social media buzz and sales of merchandise to make the top charts and plan music releases, concert locations and dates.
2. Software: Emerging areas such as virtual reality, game development and artificial intelligence challenge mathematicians to define space, logic and response options to capture complex decision-making situations and train software to make sense of them. AlphaZero, the latest computer program that won or drew all 100 games against winning chess programs, taught itself the game in just four hours! Speech recognition by Alexa or Siri follow complex algorithms to make sense of the many things a speaker could mean. Another example is algorithm based stock trading where the computer analyses stock markets across cities, countries and industries to intelligently respond to stock movements and make four to five times the return that highly experienced human traders can.
3. Animation: Do you love geometry? Animation software goes into the geometric depths of every facial expression and bouncing ponytail. Animation variables or ‘avars’ are used to define the position of each segment of the skeletal model for characters. Woody in “Toy Story” used 700 avars of which 100 were in the face alone. Rapunzel’s hair in “Tangled” required co-ordinating the three-dimensional movement of 173 strands of hair in every scene.
4. Financial modelling: This area goes beyond accounting to predict the behaviour of people and markets, and design win-win financial solutions.
5. Actuarial science: Scientistsanalyse the likelihood of future events, represent risk in numbers and design financial instruments to create win-win solutions — for instance, life insurance policies with premiums linked to health indicators and even body part insurance. 
“A math degree provides students with the perfect platform to secure some of the hottest jobs in town such as actuarial analysts and data scientists. These jobs deal with analysing and interpreting large volumes of data in a logical way. It is important that students view mastering of mathematical concepts as a way to solve real world problems and not just as a means to pass exams,” says Jose John, Director and Appointed Actuary, Max Life Insurance Co. Ltd.
6. Bioinformatics: This field involves the application of math and computer technology to gather, store, analyse and integrate biological and genetic information. One fascinating area is gene sequencing, which is a bit like putting together a jigsaw puzzle with or without the target picture in front of you. Computer programs help examine the risk of genetic disease in patients, the evolutionary history and relationships of organisms, and help with forensic identification of criminals using their unique DNA sequence.

‘Rent-a-lab’ policy to bring revenues to institutions
"," The government has proposed a new policy that could transform scientific instruments in government labs into lucrative assets generating a steady rental income. It plans to hire out to researchers all lab equipment that cost more than ₹10 lakh. This would also reduce the amount of time such expensive instruments remain idle.
“To promote ease of access, sharing and monitoring, the granting agencies will henceforth tabulate and put all equipments funded by it costing more than ₹10 lakh on the Internet, to be accessed by researchers,” says a note on the website of the Department of Science and Technology (DST).
The policy, called the Scientific Research Infrastructure Management and Networks (SRIMAN), wouldn’t, “for the present,” apply to strategic sectors. The policy is open to public comments for a month.
Explaining the policy’s rationale, the government noted that it was “common” to find in Indian laboratories, expensive equipment lying idle. A “large number” are not shared and are plagued by issues such as maintenance and availability of spares.
“This adds to the burden of research infrastructure costs,” the document noted.
The new system, according to the policy, envisages institutions declaring on a website how often their instruments would be available for use by those outside the department or university. Those who would like to use, for example, a DNA-sequencing machine, would have to pay a fee and specify the purpose and time they would want it for.
Currently, the practice of researchers bidding for time-slots to use lab instruments is typically seen more with very expensive equipment, such as radio telescopes and particle-accelerators, which cost crores of rupees. A biologist with a government lab, who didn’t want to be identified, said the policy had set a “low bar (₹10 lakh) for instruments” and that could mean that the government could potentially deny funds to buy equipment to researchers. “₹5-10 lakh is no longer a prohibitive cost for the kind of research and results expected today. Because the bar is so low, a researcher could be asked to spend time scouring for minor equipment [to lease],” he said.
“There are several universities that cannot afford expensive equipment. At the same time, these aren’t used beyond 20%-30% of their life time,” said Ashutosh Sharma, Secretary, DST. The larger plan is to develop “clusters” of instrumentation facilities.

Another scam in the making?
","Applications for Eamcet’s medical stream has crossed a record 1.13 lakh – the highest ever in the exam’s history. What’s intriguing is that this list includes about 100 students who secured good ranks last year have applied again, raising fears of malpractice.
The applications of SC, ST and BC candidates, who were ranked above 5,000, and OC students who were ranked above 3,000 in 2013, and have applied this year, are being verified. Most of these students might have already been admitted into MBBS or BDS courses, and this has raised questions.
Moreover, these students have applied with the late fee, indicating that they were not long-term coaching students, who generally apply in advance. There could be genuine repeaters in some cases, but officials leaving nothing to chance, given that scams related to medical exams have surfaced in the State and across the country over the last two years.
“We have prepared a list of such suspicious candidates and will send them to the police for verification,” EAMCET convenor N.V. Ramana Rao said.
Officials are surprised that despite a late fee of Rs.5,000, 11 candidates on an average have been applying daily.
Prof. Rao said they were extremely cautious in view of the recent PG Medical Entrance Test (PGMET) scam that rocked the State, and also because of efforts to leak the paper using gadgets a few years ago.
In 2010, some candidates had fixed cameras and phones on their shirts to leak the paper, but were caught minutes before the exam began. Since the number of exam centres has also gone up this year – 520 (engineering) and 234 (medical) – extra care is being taken.
A meeting with the DGP and Intelligence officials has been planned on May 12 to discuss the preventive steps to be taken, Prof. Rao said.
Interestingly, applications for the engineering exam have come down by 8,000 this year.
Officials still expect the total number to cross four lakh as about 10,000 additional students have opted for mathematics and biology courses for their Intermediate course. Last year, 3.90 lakh candidates appeared for the test.
Prof. Rao said around 4.30 lakh Intermediate students are in the MPC stream this year and 1.56 lakh in the BiPC stream. Officials estimate that around 68 per cent of MPC students appear for the engineering exam while 70 per cent of BiPC students take the medical test.

Believe and visualise ","I scored 94.7% in my class X boards. However, the main motivation for me to study was to impress a girl. When she rejected me, I totally lost a reason to study. Even then I tried hard in class XII. But, my efficiency plummeted. I scored 93.8% in my boards but failed to crack IIT. I joined NIT Durgapur for my B.Tech in ECE and I do not like the curriculum. I have lost the drive and thus score average marks. Please help me to regain my drive. – Anonymous.
Wow! 95% and 94% is rather impressive. You are still the same person who scored these marks in the X and XII! You need to believe it, that’s all. Please thank that girl for having ignited the motivation in you. Now you know you can, if you really want to. You seem to be disinterested, bored or perhaps heartbroken? You just need to switch on again! Equip yourself with a sound education (and you know you can do this), set a goal that you want to achieve and work towards that. You will find the girl of your dreams when the time is right. Can you move from ECE to another stream now mid-semester? What would you enjoy studying? Where do you see yourself post your B.Tech? Masters? India or overseas? Work aspirations? What industry? The best will happen, believe it and visualise it.
I completed my graduation in 2013 and started preparing for Civil Services. I wrote IAS and PCS Mains and still in the process of PCS Mains’ second attempt. I could not get the best guidance at the right time, otherwise I might have done a post graduation in some field. Now I wish to know what options I have to start earning by working in something? Are there any opportunities for those who prepared for IAS and can directly do something based only on interview, without pursuing further education. I need to start earning now. Also what courses I can opt for while working? Are there any good distance education courses in fields like journalism or law which I can join while having a career after a few years? – Sumit Sharma
Dear Sumit,
Yes, it is a tiring, excruciatingly tough, painfully long, and difficult process to crack. Unfortunately despite your attempts, there is no extra privilege provided during hiring and interviews for those who have prepared for IAS for many years though you can certainly share the information with the HR / interview panel.
What have you done your graduation in? Yes, it’s been a while since you graduated and you should start earning. Find a job that interests and excites you, get in touch with good friends and family (that are well placed and can provide you with suitable openings and leads), meet HR placement consultants and explain to them what you would like to do. You can shortlist a list online, with your city preferences. There are various online and distant education courses certified from national and international universities that you can sign up to, once you find a job. You will find a rich directory for these online as well, if you look for the specific courses. Good Luck!
I scored 70% in Class X and XII, after that completed my Bachelor’s in Technology (Mechanical) and secured 65% marks. I never had any interest in engineering. When I was in the final year I accidentally cracked my GATE exam, and everyone started thinking I am studious. But honestly I am not and I have no idea how I cracked it. Although my GATE score was just at par, it was considered a huge achievement since there were only two of us from my branch who cracked this exam. At that time I had no idea what the benefits of clearing this exam were. After completing my Bachelor’s I didn’t get campus placement and afterwards I wasted about nine months in Delhi preparing for SSC CGL. After completing the course I returned home and found a job as an installation engineer for three months and later realised that it wasn’t for me. Later I decided to go for Masters and got admission in Thapar University. After completing Masters, I worked hard with my partner and opened an automobile company. It’s been two years of successful working in the company and now I’ve realised that I am still not happy and want to go into civil services via SSC CGL. I am already 27 now and worried because the age limit for SSC CGL for the general category is 30. Should I try for SSC now or should I continue with my business? — Nischay Chauhan
I do believe that you are seeking the true meaning of your name — “Nischay”— a resolve, a final decision, and surety of your identity perhaps. What do you want to do in life? What gives you joy and happiness? You have a Master’s degree in mechanical engineering and running a successful company but what is it that you are seeking deep within? How are you so sure that you are cut out for SSC CGL and that it will be an answer to your search now? Would it be possible for you to meet with a proficient counsellor who can work with you in greater depth and help you understand and identify your interests, hobbies, fears and concerns. I would like you to be a little more realistic and not romantic. You certainly don’t want SSC GCL to be another escape exit for the next two to three years. 
My daughter completed her Class XII with a very good score of 95% in the commerce stream. With a keen interest, she took up economics as joined B.A Economics in Chennai. She wants to do her postgraduation with economics as major subject. What are her options in Chennai and other cities. She is not keen on pursuing MA or M.Phil. Please advice. — Sandhya 
Dear Sandhya,
Your daughter can do a MBA in Business Economics, M.Sc. in Applied Economics or, Mathematical Economics, a MBE — Master of Business Economics or a PG diploma course like Applied Economics or Econometrics. What does she want to do? Depending on that she will need to start looking out for colleges and universities across the country that offer the course of her choice. Madras School of Economics, Delhi School of Economics, St. Stephen College, Delhi University, Indian Statistical Institute Kolkata, Sri Ram College of Commerce, IIT Kanpur and Banaras Hindu University are some of the very well reputed institutions.

SC posts hearing on nursery admissions issue for Monday
","The >Supreme Court on Friday posted for Monday the hearing on the issue of >nursery admissions in the national capital and said that the relief in the category of inter-state transfer can be provided only to those who have filed a petition in the court.
A bench, headed by Justice H L Dattu, asked the counsel appearing for the parents of the admission seekers in the inter-state transfer category to place before it the list of the applicants.
The court made it clear that it cannot pass a general order and relief will be confined to those who are applicants before it.
Senior Advocate Raju Ramachandran, appearing for the Department of Education, submitted that after consideration and consultation with the major schools it was not possible to increase the number of seats by 5 to 6 for the inter-state transfer category.
The apex court had on April 11 put nursery admissions on hold again in Delhi schools after it put a halt on the operation of the >High Court’s April 3 interim order directing that those children who applied and were selected in draw of lot for neighbourhood and other categories, be admitted.

Lessons from leather ","BITS Pilani has a unique, standalone system in place which allows its students to get hands-on experience in the real-world projects through a programme called Practice School (PS). It’s an ideal platform for us to learn about an organisation’s culture and functioning. I was lucky to get my first preference, the Central Leather Research Institute (CLRI) in Chennai. It has a huge database and an economics department in place, which definitely was an ideal place for me, given my interest in applied econometrics.
On the first day, we reached the institute early morning and our schedules for the next two months were explained to us. For the next two weeks, we were given orientations of the numerous departments by department heads. Students, during the same time, were allowed to choose their own departments and the available projects on which they would be working. As I was certain about my preference, I went ahead and talked to the head of the economics department. After a detailed discussion, the faculty was convinced and agreed to mentor me for the project.
Headway
Initially, I was asked to look into the qualitative aspect of a project which did not intrigue me enough. So, I decided to share my concern with a member of the faculty. He explained how he was from the sociology department but would nonetheless speak with the scientist for my benefit, and a meeting was scheduled the next day. The meeting was unexpectedly fruitful, and he promised to help me with my project. The next couple of weeks were spent in discussing the details and other plausible explanations to the various prospects of the chosen project. 
My project involved analysing the factors responsible for the export performance of leather garments in India. This topic required a great deal of knowledge about the leather and export industry, and so I spent considerable amount of time in CLRI’s library going through the previous research papers and other relevant material. After collecting relevant data, a regression analysis was made to find out the significant factors that determined the price of the exported leather garments such as the availability of raw material and disposable income of consumers. I drew the conclusion based on my findings and suggested that we include other parameters like seasonal effects in the regression to obtain better results. The final report had some unexpected results and I discussed the possibilities of them being true. It opened a new channel of thoughts for which I was praised, given the time constraint in which I finished my project.

Exploring the new ","It is a hard decision to leave your country and family to go to a place you don't know much about, but if you have the right attitude and determination, it makes you independent and confident. That is when you tell yourself, “this is my chance and I can do it!” I left India with this attitude, not because I didn't like it there but because I wanted to explore the new. I wanted my creativity to find expression, both in engineering and music, which is why I chose to pursue my bachelor’s at Pennsylvania State University. 
A new world 
 Initially, I was nervous but I found that I could live on my own terms. Some might think that these choices are too risky to give to an 18-year-old, but I manage them well. I play music and study, but I do them on my own terms. I work on projects that have nothing to do with academics but everything to do with the world. I am thirsty to learn.
Each student has his/her own unique experience of college life in the U.S. and for me Pennsylvania State University is in every way the college I had hoped for. In the past one year, I have done a project with General Motors and performed at a couple of music festivals too. I have also been accepted into the honours programme at the university and I am hoping to do research in the field of alternative fuels. The U.S. academic system is flexible at the bachelor’s level. Students can choose the classes they want and when they want to take them, which gives them opportunities for extra-curricular activities.
Special moments 
Another new experience for me was taking up an on-campus job in the first year. Until then, I had never worked for money. I wanted to feel responsible for my finances and earn some pocket money for my weekend movies. I worked at my campus dining commons, cleaning tables and serving food. Initially, it was hard but I slowly grew into it. I worked hard and made a little money; when I spent it, I knew I had earned it. It is moments like these that make my experience in the U.S. special. 
While academic experiences always stay with you, it is these diverse and out-of-the-classroom experiences that teach us about the world outside. Pennsylvania State University gives me the opportunity not only to study electrical engineering with music technology, but also shows me who I am and who I can become.

Robotic puppeteer ","Not all things traditional are boring. Some, in fact, are downright interesting, especially when it involves the age-old tradition of storytelling with puppets and music. Now, mix tradition with today’s uber-cool technological advancements, and what you have is best of both worlds. 
Meet Jamoora, a music-interpreting robot designed by Varnit Jain and Anant Sharma, students from the Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology, Delhi (IIIT-Delhi), and faculty, Aman Parnami. The robot is named after jamoora or jamura, a performer who plays a specific type of sidekick role — one who demonstrates unquestioning obedience to the master's directives — in the traditional folk theatre.
The bot can be controlled using music and voice commands, instead of the usual manual command. “Our premise was to use robots that can be controlled without using hands. In the context of Indian puppetry, which is unique to our culture, there is usually an individual controlling the puppet and two or three others playing the music. But, what if there is just one person? How can he or she manage all aspects of storytelling, puppets, and music? With the help of this puppet, we play live music and narrate a story, and the robot emotes accordingly,” says Varnit.
Professor Aman Parnami elaborates on how the idea came to be. “At Weave Lab, our mission is to ‘weave interactivity into everyday objects and experiences’, and the call for participation in the Student Innovation contest to be held during the 31st ACM User Interface Software and Technology conference aligned with our mission. With the excitement to participate in this conference, I began looking for students, and couldn’t have chosen better people than Anant, a vocalist and musician, and Varnit, a programming expert, who were already working with me on other projects. We held several brainstorming sessions and ultimately zeroed-in on one idea that we all loved. Thus, Jamoora came to be,” he explains. 
USP
“We are using voice commands for explicit control of the actions of the robot, and music is used to express the way the action is to be executed,” explains Anant. He elaborates on how there is a direct analogy with dance, where the act of dance can be triggered by someone instructing people to dance. However, the movements and the intensity are driven by the music being played. “We use this concept by incorporating Indian classical music for music detection,” he adds. “The robot can be programmed to perform many functions. Raga detection can also be programmed, and can be improved to include western scales as well. This can be used as a tool kit for kids to create and perform their own stories. We often think of creative stories as children, but do not have a good means to express them.”
Functions
The robot is made for puppetry. The functions that can be performed by the robot are open-ended, depending on the performer. However, the hardware demo that the team created could make the robot perform actions like lifting objects, walking, running, and filling a vessel with stones to make water available for drinking.
Anant explains how the working of the robot will help in recognising the potential of inclusion of multiple functionalities in it. “Jamoora communicates through our laptop, where the processing happens. The laptop receives two signals, an audio signal from a keyboard/harmonium and a speech signal through the microphone of the laptop. The madari gives commands to Jamoora using keywords woven into a script. The way Jamoora executes these actions is controlled by the Hindustani classical music played with his command. We used the speech recognition library in Python which uses Google Speech API to detect the speech. Jamoora looks for the keywords in the detected sentence and executes the actions accordingly.”
Consequently, he adds, the audio signals received from the keyboard is processed in SuperCollider and sent to Python, where their algorithms detect the Hindustani classical raga based on the notes, and identifies the corresponding emoptions. For instance: 
Happy - Desh
Gloomy - Jaunpuriya
Angry - Shree
Serious - Kaafi
“Jamoora, now has information about the action and the way the action needs to be executed. The parameters of the movement are now changed according to the action to be executed and the emotion detected,” says Anant.
Benefits
 Jamoora, in its current form, is an excellent example of the fusion of technology with more human aspects of such as music and storytelling, believes, professor Parnami. “That is why we have been exploring other applications in the domains of entertainment and education technology. For entertainment, we are looking at it as a toy or a controller for smart home applications, whereas for education, we are viewing it as a tool to teach children about music, robotics, and storytelling. We are also open to other uses of our concept. Since music is an input to the system, a therapeutic use of it will be more of a side-effect rather than the direct purpose. However, if puppetry has an overall positive effect on patients, the bot will be suitable.”

Anybody can teach? ","Few weeks ago, I read of a government servant, in Uttar Pradesh, holding a senior position, going to teach at a government school each Saturday. The newspaper article, of course, was highly appreciative of the ‘noble’ deed and how it would benefit the school. It also encouraged others to take up similar action. 
The article reminded me of a summer vacation, during school days in Gujarat, when we were supposed to teach the alphabet (or was it numbers or both) to underprivileged children. We were also given a book for this. But, neither I nor my friends ‘did’ anything on this front. We had no idea what to do.
Strangely, even schools display this behaviour. Last week, while reading a book on ‘schools that educate differently’ I got to know of one in West Bengal which used to send 150 students, each week, to the villages. This was to ‘reach out to the underprivileged students in the villages’. I had a series of questions including: Why are all students in villages underprivileged? Did the students in villages teach the city students farming or cattle-rearing? 
Not up to the mark
In most cases, where it is assumed that the task is so easy that anyone can take it up, either the task ends up not being taken up at all or is taken up in a manner that is way below the optimal. One parallel that comes to mind is that of wildlife conservation organisations’ approach to nature education. When it concerns difficult activities such as research and monitoring, they look for specifically trained people. However, when it comes to a simple activity like nature education, they convey the message that anyone can take it up. In the end, few organisations, if at all, end up carrying out nature education in a manner that matters. 
On the one hand, schools and other education institutions are struggling to get good teachers and facilitators to meet the needs of the day. They are increasingly investing more in the existing people so as to enable them to deliver better. These include efforts not only towards ‘content and pedagogy’ but also touch upon areas of ‘motivation and personal conduct’. While on the other hand we have this belief that anybody can teach. 
So, what leads to this belief? Is it the arrogance of the urban over rural or that of the affluent over the deprived? In other words, of those speaking and writing English over those more familiar and comfortable in the vernacular. Does this depict the position in which we hold our teachers or a power position that we, adults, hold vis-a-vis the children? Is it about priorities? 
Or is this just how we address our craving to ‘do good’? But, we do not appear to be in a rush to become drivers or doctors for one day a week. So, is teaching perceived to be easy and hence the only area where we exhibit this behaviour? 
Flexibility and change are welcome in the classrooms, but a potter teaching pottery is different from a banker working in a city (consuming resources like city dwellers do) and then going to teach nature education at a village school. While the potter may end up acquainting students with a craft, the city-bred individual may end up meeting only his (or her) needs and not that of the students. 
Coming back to the government servant, I wondered if she felt the need to get familiar with the school, its teachers and students and their needs before teaching. Did she plan with teachers and the principal and check on other aspects which mattered. This ‘other aspects’ can be a long list in itself. With all the good intent, was she adding value to the school’s functioning or disturbing the schedule? What is the message that she is giving? That anybody can teach?

Stand up, fight back
"," Bullying seems common, but what is it? It is verbal or physical abuse with aliases being ‘intimidate’, ‘harass’. It is the sadistic feeling of joy one enjoys when victimising the vulnerable target. Who is bullied more — men or women? Bullying knows no gender; although women are easy targets, sometimes, men have no escape either.
No convincing answer exists as to whether bullying happens more in university/workplace/home. Whilst your senior in school or authority at work victimises you openly, bullies exist at home too. The act is a torment trap from which victims know no escape. In principio, understand that bullies are human. We can handle bullies with inner strength and mental power.
Reasons for bullying range from bigoted attitudes, poor upbringing, insecurity, aesthetic appeal, employment, earnings, and more. Irrespective of the fitting reason behind this vilifying act, not all emerge stronger. Many have altered their circadian clock to end themselves. So, how do you handle bullying? 
Say no to self-pity
Whilst addressing this, I confess for no want of self-pity that bullying in my life started in my early teens whilst growing up in a traditional joint family system in Chennai (then Madras). My naiveté being profound, initially, I never realised I was been bullied. I was at a crossroads; having none to share my trauma with, as I was a single child, any solace I got was from my high school friends. I laughed outside, despite my mental turmoil within. However, external intimidations fed my mental strength with which I excelled in my higher secondary examinations. Mouths that previously bullied my academic modicum, now remained shut. I experienced a surreptitious self-confidence that bullies could be handled. Success followed successively, until, some in my family started bullying me for my wheatish complexioned, average looks. Recollecting it, it is amazing to see how people are enslaved to this feeling, not realising anything you love looks beautiful to you. Contrarily, my employment status was important to others, and my independence and poor knowledge of religious dogmas has now made me the talk of the town. Bullying has followed me like the little lamb that followed Mary to school. At work, harassment began when my male chauvinistic superior, from a different cultural background, began misusing his authority on me. Determined, I fairly succeeded in alerting many within the organisation. Finding opportunities my way, I have progressed further in my academic profession. Narrating my experiences was not to invoke solace but to make you aware harassments still exist.
Knowing that there exists a pusillanimous majority, getting many cues from victims can help save their lives. A look of disinterest on their face; a sense of depression in their conversations are clear signals; enquire if they are okay or require help. 
Instil confidence to harness the mental strength lying dormant in these victims.
Those suffering bullying, remember, seeking assistance helps. Talk to your close friend or confidante, else to a professional. If bullied, speak out boldly to let your trauma known. Do not despair; with mental strength, you can fight back. Becoming vulnerable victims is not an effective solution.

A panacea for exams ","Much has been said about the ill effects of the exam system on a student’s psyche, yet they seem indispensable to our education system. Since they are here to stay, we must make the most of them, with some help from teachers. 
Here’s what teachers can do to make the students see the pros of exams. 
First, there could be special orientation classes conducted periodically to help students learn the ‘art of examination’. Students could be made to understand the importance of exams and the process of giving one, one of which is being prepared to face the challenges that life may throw at them. 
Second, exams could be made easier to take on by helping students learn time management and the importance of planning ahead. This will save students from stress and anxiety. Teachers must help them understand that just learning is not enough; the way the answers are presented is what will earn them marks. 
So, teachers could conduct mock tests to train students in this aspect, thus giving them confidence before facing the actual exams. 
Individual focus
The next level of preparation narrows down to individual needs of the students. The teacher must have a clear understanding about the specific problems of her students: some may be overconfident, some may prepare well and yet feel anxious, and others who do not care to prepare for the exams at all. 
Teachers could hand-pick students based on their needs or problems for exam-related counselling and remedial classes, if necessary. They could also employ peer-to-peer counselling by getting students who excel to share their learning strategies with others. This will have a lasting impact. 
The examination system should be a means to breed competition not among other students but with oneself. Students should be rewarded when they outperform themselves by providing extra time to indulge in their interests and hobbies. 
And lastly, a teacher must never give up on a student even if she faces failure. It is the duty of a teacher to help a student through a rough patch. 
Resilience is the richest lesson a teacher can impart to one’s students, and this will also have a far-reaching impact in their life. 
The teacher needs to work with the student on his shortcomings with a fresh approach that stems from a careful analysis of his personality and profile.

Fuel your fitness quotient
"," Fitness is the new cool. Generation Z is preparing for the long haul. They hope to be on their feet for many decades to come — and to be looking just the way they look now. Young and well turned-out —50 is the new 30. 
At $3.7 trillion and growing (as per Global Wellness Economy Monitor, January 2017), global wellness is a high growth sector to work in. Career in fitness and mind-body training, health foods, health tourism, alternative medicine, anti-ageing and, of course, weight loss, are promising.
Fitness trainers
Perhaps, the best-looking specimens of our species outside of showbiz, fitness trainers are the sleek and well-toned leaders of the fitness revolution. They focus on exercise and muscle health, including cardiovascular training, strength training and stretching. They design fitness programmes, connect with clubs or fitness centres, reach out to potential clients, run fitness classes and monitor their clients’ progress.
Personal fitness trainers work one-to-one with those who can afford them, to build and achieve short-term and long-term fitness goals. They often work with celebrities to maintain body tone.
Group fitness trainers work in clubs, spas, health resorts and community centres to run regular fitness lessons across age groups. Some may set up running, cycling, and fitness groups, with large sponsored events as well as branded fitness gear.
Specialised fitness trainers advocate a whole system of fitness that includes nutrition, exercise and philosophy. They could specialise in yoga, pilates, martial arts, and so on. Yoga and pilates instructors conduct group and individual classes. Martial arts trainers are often practitioners with professional fighting experience, who now teach.
Nutritionists or dieticians 
Trained in the science of eating, these professionals have intimate knowledge of how our body uses food. They study catabolism (how the body breaks down food) and anabolism (how the body repairs and creates cells and tissue), food groups, body types, nutrition cycles, deficiencies, and food allergies.
Clinical dieticians may work with hospitals to plan patient menus according to their dietary goals and restrictions. They may work with specialised patient groups such as diabetics, those with renal or liver diseases, children with food allergies, and so on. 
Nutrition managers work with organisations that serve food on a large scale, manage menus and take steps to avoid large-scale contamination of food or the spread of food-based illnesses. This includes working with large hotels, school canteens, hospitals, office cafeterias, health resorts and spas.
Public health nutrition includes working with the government to design public health policy in government schools and define minimum health and nutrition standards for children, lactating mothers, or others impacted by the public health system.
Educators and researchers work with think tanks and universities designing training curricula for nutritionists, examining policies and their effectiveness, and researching the role of nutrition in handling diseases.
Private consultants work with people across ages and professions to provide one-to-one guidance on making and managing a personal nutrition plan. 
Compensation
Fitness trainers and nutritionists working with hospitals, clubs, hotels and so on getpaidbetween ₹ 15,000 and ₹ 40,000 per month at the starting level; when they work with gyms and clubs they could earn about ₹ 1 lakh a month. As they take on more managerial and revenue generating roles, salaries rise. 
Personal trainers and nutritionists who work with individuals can charge anywhere between ₹ 500 to ₹ 1 lakh for a session. Personal trainers of repute charge between ₹ 1.5 lakh and ₹ 5 lakh per client per month. Sounds too wide a range? Of course, you need to be a celebrity trainer with high-profile client credentials to demand those kind of rates! Aamir Khan bulking up for “Ghajini” or Bhumi Pednekar rapidly losing 30 kgs after “Dum Laga Ke Haisha” will give you a view of the challenges involved here.

OMC gets MCI nod for 9 super-speciality courses
","Finally, there is some good news for beleaguered medicos appearing for the PG medical entrance test this year, many of them for the second time after the question paper leak scam. The Medical Council of India (MCI) has green-lighted nine super-speciality courses at teaching hospitals under the Osmania Medical College (OMC) from this academic year.
It is rare super-speciality seats like Master’s in neonatology (for treatment of newborn infants) and surgical gastroenterology that have received approval from MCI.
“It’s a boost because getting such super-speciality seats means that we can now have access to speciality doctors in the government sector in the future. This is also an MCI endorsement of our capabilities,” OMC principal Putta Srinivas said.
In all, MCI has permitted two seats each in surgical oncology, urology and neurology, and one super-speciality seat each in nephrology, surgical gastroenterology and neonatology. Doctors appearing for this year’s PG entrance test will thus have access to the nine seats.
Since 1971, health authorities have been trying for MCI approval for a super-speciality seat in neonatology at the State-run Niloufer Hospital. Another rare speciality course, surgical oncology, which deals with the surgical management of cancer, has received MCI nod for two seats at the MNJ Cancer Research Institute.
“We need such PG seats to produce speciality doctors who can contribute a lot to government hospitals. OMC and OGH underwent extensive inspections from the MCI team before getting permission,” Dr. Srinivas said.
Estimates suggest that each of these super-speciality medical seats will be worth anywhere between Rs.2 crore and Rs.3 crore in private medical colleges.
“Now such seats will be available only for meritorious students, for free,” he pointed out.

Making knowledge work ","The University of Bradford is one of the best technology universities with cutting-edge research experience that tackles major global challenges of the current times.
The university's mission is ‘Making Knowledge Work’ — making a real difference to people’s day-to-day lives and is at the heart of all that the university does. It has adopted three academic themes relating to the grave problems of the world: advanced healthcare, innovative engineering, and sustainable societies.
Newer challenges
 “The world is facing global challenges on a scale not seen before: ill-health, poverty, climate change, energy supply, food security, migration and terrorism. The university is conducting the research needed to understand these problems, and is teaching the next generation of world leaders who will have to find the solutions,” said Professor Brian Cantor, Vice-Chancellor of the UK-based university.
“We are very strong in automatic engineering. One which looks like a fairly traditional engineering programme in our university, in real are a cutting edge programmes. We are continuously refreshing the old programmes and introducing new ones, as outdated courses will not offer good jobs and will become obsolete in the dynamically growing technological world. We are launching the first applied undergraduate AI programme in Britain next year.”
He also said that the university has a strategic partnership plan with educational institutions in India. “We already have existing partnerships with CSIR-Indian Institute of Toxicology Research, IIT Kharagpur, IIT Madras, LV Prasad Eye Institute and University of Ahmedabad. And we are working on signing MoU’s for student exchange, staff exchange and research collaborations with IIT Delhi, IIT Mumbai, IIM Bangalore, HR College of Commerce and Economics to name a few,” he said.
Inviting students to study at Bradford, he said, “We have launched two programmes for scholarships. The first programme provides a £3,500 scholarship to all students of India. And the other programme will aim at awarding a 50% scholarship to students depending on their merit and entrances.”
“The traditional links between the Bradford University and Indian universities have always been strong, however, due to strict visa policies, the inflow of Indian students have declined over the years. However, we are trying to re-stimulate the bond by giving good scholarships to all Indian students,” he adds.

Fabricating a career ","Having studied subjects such as electronic devices, digital design, microelectronic circuits, and microprocessors in my second year, I developed an interest in experiencing the fabrication of chips. My first stint with very-large-scale integration (VLSI) began when I got an internship at the Semi-Conductor Laboratory (SCL), Department of Space, Government of India. SCL is engaged in the research and development in the area of microelectronics and has developed a number of key very large-scale integrated circuit (VLSICs), a majority of which are Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) for high-reliability applications in industrial, defence, and space sectors, under this programme.
We were assigned a project titled Development of USB Interfacing using PIC microcontroller for data acquisition in the VLSI Testing Division (VTD). First, we were taken for a tour of VTD Division. We were asked to wear a coat before entering the testing area. We then entered a chamber where we were blasted with high-speed air from all directions, so as to remove any dust particles on the coat. The testing area is known as ‘clean room’, having a class of 10,000 (a parameter used to measure the number of dust particles per cubic foot of air). There, we found many machines placed sequentially, including two huge testers, a temperature-pressure calibrator, and many PCs.
On field
As a part of my project, I needed to study about the functioning of USB module associated with the PIC18F67J50 micro controller. A part of my project was already done by my seniors, so, I had to first study their work to complete the project. Starting with the study of data-sheet of PIC18F67J50 micro controller, I studied different processes including USB protocol, different types of descriptors, oscillator settings, and enumeration process. Side-by-side, I wrote codes in C programming language so as to implement the knowledge gained through the studies. I was working alongside learned technicians and scientists who helped me at every stage.
As our project advanced, I started developing an interest in SCL’s work culture. There were many presentations and demonstrations from students, employees, and people from other companies who came from India as well as abroad, to market their products. The dedication with which people worked at SCL motivated me. We were also given a tour of VLSI fabrication lab where all the ASICs and Micro Electro Mechanical Systems (MEMS) were fabricated. The main fabrication area was a clean room of class 10 which meant that there were less than 10 dust particles per cubic foot of air. So, we had to wear special shoes, coats, and masks before entering the area, as even a single dust particle could produce an error in the chip. 
As the last week of my internship neared, I focused more on developing reports and preparing for the final presentation. By this time, I had gained a lot of information about the working of industries and the work culture.

‘We used to debate with our teachers’
"," While recalling his formative years, Kannada poet-writer-folklorist Chandrasekhar Kambar discusses the inspirational role played by his teachers.
Born in Ghodgeri village in Belgaum district, Kambar spent his childhood as a cattle herder until his uncle placed him in a government school. Kambar’s parents were blacksmiths. Accomplished novelist Krishnamoorthy Puranik was among his early teachers. At school, every week, one class was dedicated to poetry. Puranik encouraged the students to write their own poems and read them out to the class, recalls 82-year-old Kambar.
Kambar started writing stories when he was bored or to cope with personal problems. Puranik saw great potential in Kambar as a writer and therefore asked the boy’s parents to send him to Shivalinga Mutt where he would receive better education. Kambar would later go on to pursue his BA at Lingaraj College in Belgaum, where renowned scholars, which included A.K. Ramanujan and Bhoosnoormath, were his teachers.
“They made the class lively by interacting with us. Thanks to them, I started liking John Keats very much. Even after class hours, we would have discussions on a wide range of topics. We would often enter into a debate with our teachers,” says Kambar, who is president of Sahitya Akademi and a Jnanpith awardee.
When he went to Dharwad to pursue an MA degree, musician Rajeev Taranath influenced him, and later writer Kirtinath Kurtkoti. Among the qualities he has imbibed from his teachers was an ability to be inspired by one’s surroundings. His village became the inspiration for all that he wrote.
“The singing voices of villagers and drum beats would transport me to a world of myths, metaphors and symbols,” he says, adding that his songs were all born there. “I grew up as a cattle herder and during that time, the Britishers had quarters near the Gokak Falls. The villagers seemed to be charmed by anything English. Even though I was only a child, it bothered me that we were trying to mimic them, despite having a rich culture of our own. That was the theme of my first ballad which I wrote while at college,” he adds.
Much appreciation
The ballad became so popular that during his stint at the University of Chicago, Ramanujan asked him to post it to him, and the professor popularised it further. Kambar’s works were always appreciated and he was encouraged to write more.
“In the college magazine, my poem would appear on the first few pages. My poetry had long narratives and was steeped in folk culture drawn from my village,” says the Padma Shri awardee.
Kambar also used to constantly communicate with well-known poets of those days, send his works and seek feedback from them. His plays were also inspired by folk literature. He would grab any opportunity, be it a youth festival or a gathering of literary personalities, to offer his work as a recital. “I loved to sing” he says. To youngsters keen on writing, Kambar says: “Start by expressing in your mother tongue, you become more creative.”

Eyes set on bigger things
","A large number of students wrote the Common Entrance Test held in 21 centres in Dakshina Kannada, keeping their options to look elsewhere open. While 6,250 students wrote the Biology paper in the morning, 10,340 students wrote the Mathematics paper in the evening.
Gaurav Nayak, a student of Sharada College, and another student Soundari K. said they were eyeing seats in National Institute of Technology and Indian Institute of Technology. The two have written the Joint Entrance Examination (Mains) held in the second week of April. The marks scored in the JEE Mains will be considered for NITs. The two have qualified for the JEE (Advanced) — examination for IIT admission — which will be held on May 25.
Mr. Nayak’s classmate Kishan Bhat said his preparation had been focused on the JEE. “No separate preparation the CET. I am also writing the entrance examination by MAHE,” said Mr. Bhat, who plans to pursue mechanical engineering degree.
Vikas P.U. College’s Akash Patil, a medical seat aspirant, said he would be writing the undergraduate entrance test to be conducted by the Consortium of Medical, Engineering and Dental Colleges of Karnataka (COMEDK) on May 11.
“I have done well in the two papers. I hope to get a seat under the CET,” he said.
Swati Dilip Nayak of Sahydri P.U. College, said though questions in Mathematics paper were direct she did take a minute more to answer some questions. “Time for mathematics paper could have been increased,” she said.
The CET examination on Thursday went off without a hitch in all the 21 centres. SDM College Ujire and SDM Residential College were the two new examination centres this time. As many as 728 students from Belthangady are writing examinations from the two centres. There are 10 centres in Mangalore, six in Moodbidri and three in Puttur.
Vasudev Kamat, who is holding charge as the Deputy Director of Pre University Education, said there were no complaints or confusions in any of the examination centre.
Five officials comprising — two sitting squads, question paper custodian, central observer and Chief of Examination centre — were posted at each of the examination centre. Of the five, three officials were from other districts.

‘My true calling’
"," I came across an online internship platform in my first year of B.Tech. I became a student ambassador for the platform, and was responsible for spreading awareness about internships and the opportunities for students. Next, I worked as a campus ambassador for the entrepreneurship cell of IIT Bombay.
Ninja intern 
Later, I applied for an internship at Nearbuy and was hired. I was involved in digital marketing and content writing, which pushed me to explore a variety of fields. My tryst with internships didn’t stop there, and I applied to a business development internship at Unacademy. I got the chance to meet clients, and troubleshoot issues faced by potential educators. By the end of the two months, I had got 15 new educators on the platform. 
I then applied to a two-week internship at the United Nations Volunteers for their International Women’s Day 2018 campaign. My tasks were related to digital marketing, event management, and content writing, on Google Classroom. After that, I was selected as a youth marketing volunteer at the Kailash Satyarthi Children Foundation for their nation-wide movement against child trafficking and sexual assault on women, known as Bharat Yatra. My tasks were to closely follow the movement since its genesis and promote the event on social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter. I was also responsible for content writing and spreading awareness about Bharat Yatra on my campus. The best part of this internship was meeting with the Nobel Laureate Shri Kailash Satyarthi and actor Vivek Oberoi at Bombay Stock Exchange, Mumbai, during the curtain-raiser event of Bharat Yatra. I will always cherish how Shri Satyarthi embraced me and encouraged me to work towards the betterment of society. I even got the opportunity to be the gender champion of the Internal Complaints Committee of my university, owing to my previous volunteering experiences. I now work towards preventing gender inequality and sexual harassment in my college.
Throughout these stints, I realised how internships not only help us gain confidence and hone our communication skills but also figure out our true calling. I had no clue about the field in which I wanted to pursue my career when I started college, but now, six internships later, I know that I wish to work towards social and economic upliftment of women in our country.

Insights into diplomacy
","The World Health Assembly (WHA) is the annual decision-making body of the World Health Organisation (WHO) which organises a summit annually and is attended by delegations from WHO member states, non-state, and other recognised stakeholders. International Federation of Medical Students Associations (IFMSA) is the representative body of 1.3 million medical students from 137 NMOs in 127 countries around the globe, and engages with WHO in multiple ways, including identifying delegation to WHA every year.
Preparation
I was selected by IFMSA through a rigorous selection process to attend and represent IFMSA and India at the 71st World Health Assembly which was held in Geneva in May. The delegation comprised 55 medical students from around 30 countries representing voices of medical and allied health students 
To prepare the delegation for highly-complex and fast-paced WHA, IFMSA organised a Youth PreWHA Workshop on Global Health Diplomacy and Governance just before the WHA, which aimed at preparing us through strengthening our advocacy skill-sets and improving their knowledge on global health topics central to the 71st WHA. The four-day workshop included keynote speeches, panel discussions, career events, and technical know-hows on preparing policy briefs and presenting it at the WHA.
We prepared policy briefs and presented them at the WHA in four streams: universal health coverage, discrimination in healthcare, antimicrobial resistance, and non-communicable diseases.
As a delegate, I had the unique opportunity to attend the opening ceremony, plenary meetings, Committee A and Committee B meetings as well as technical briefings. Overall, the experience was an eye-opener.

One step at a time
","You return home from college with your head buzzing with all the things you need to get done. Being the class monitor, you have to coordinate the logistics of the upcoming class picnic. So you quickly post a note on your Facebook page asking your friends to sign up. Before you start working on your Chemistry record book, you plug your iPod into your ears to listen to the song your friends were discussing this morning. As you start recording your observations of the Chemistry experiment, your cell phone beeps. Your friend sends an SMS asking whether you are coming for tuition. You respond and then get back to your record book. Within a few minutes, your mom calls saying that she will be late. While talking to her, you quickly check your Facebook page for updates. Twenty-four friends have responded. You quickly send another message on What’sApp asking about the picnic. You also text your friends saying the song is really cool. You then get back to writing your Chemistry observations.
Sounds familiar? In today’s wired world, we all engage in some form of multitasking, often without realising it. How many of us are guilty of reading an SMS while we are conversing with someone else? Or, of checking Facebook updates during a boring lecture or shooting off a quick email while wolfing down the breakfast. And, despite warnings to the contrary, people continue to talk on their phones while driving, even on two-wheelers.
How would you characterise the work habits of those who juggle multiple tasks with relative ease? Efficient, competent and productive? Or disorganised, disordered and sub-optimal? We generally think of someone who does myriad jobs as being very productive. After all, time is a scarce resource and we would like to pack in as much as possible into every minute. But contrary to popular belief, research suggests that multitasking may not be the best way to go about accomplishing our goals. In fact, toggling between tasks actually compromises productivity rather than promoting it.
In a series of experiments published in the Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception & Performance, Professors David Meyer and Jeffrey Evans studied what happens when people switch between two tasks, such as doing math sums and categorising geometric shapes. They found that subjects lost time when they had to switch between tasks, and it took them longer to make the switch if the task was more complex or less familiar. When we flit from task to task, our brains have to not only adjust to the fact that we are making the switch, but also activate the demands of the new task. Thus, as we go back and forth between tasks, we may end up spending more time on them as opposed to completing one job at a time.
Communications specialist Clifford Nass of Stanford University and his colleagues, compared the cognitive performance of those who multitask on electronic media regularly versus those who do not. In all three experiments, the performance of high multitaskers was compromised compared to their serially focused peers. Thus, students who multitask often were poorer at ignoring irrelevant stimuli and were worse at remembering which items were repeated on a test.
Further, to the surprise of the researchers, the multitaskers were beaten even on a task that required switching between two sets of stimuli. Ironically, chronic multitaskers were worse than others even at multitasking! As Nass bluntly states in an interview in Stanford Report, “Everything distracts them.”
Even as you juggle between tasks, and flit from screen to screen, do you find that your ability to pay attention for a sustained period of time is diminishing faster than you would dare admit? If you answered yes, you are part of a growing tribe of Netizens who find it to difficult to concentrate on a single task.
Author Nicholas Carr aptly captures this phenomenon when he writes in his book, The Shallows, “the Internet seizes our attention only to scatter it.” The longer we shift and shuffle between Facebook, WhatsApp, Gmail and cricket scores, our brains get used to the instant but superficial gratification that the Internet provides. While every generation is more tech-savvy than the previous one, and is thus more prone to multitask earlier in their development, we may gradually lose other essential life skills like the ability to concentrate, deliberate and reflect. MIT professor Sherry Turkle cautions us in her book, Alone Together, that multitasking provides us with a ‘high’ that deludes us into thinking we are being more efficient.
And, finally, for those daring souls who swear that talking on their mobiles is not an impediment to driving, the findings of Professor Brian Scholl and his colleagues will hopefully deter them from this highly unsafe practice. In an experiment, they found that those who spoke on their mobiles while performing a task missed seeing an unexpected object in 90 per cent of instances compared to 30 per cent for those who were not talking on a mobile.
In the interests of both safety and efficiency, we need to curb our multitasking instincts. Slow and steady is better than frenzied.

Crossing the border
","The prospect of studying abroad can be both exciting and daunting. With extensive research required for making an informed choice of a country, university and course, the process is quite taxing. Yocket, an online platform, seeks to simplify the process and guide students in firming up their plans.
The essence of Yocket is its large and active community of study-abroad aspirants. “Aspirants can connect and seek help for planning their foreign education from current students, alumni, experts and representatives of international universities,” says co-founder Kashyap Matani. From guidance on test prep to comparing universities, from writing essays to applying for loans, Yocket aims to be a one-stop solution for aspirants.




A host of features
According to co-founder Sumeet Jain, the platform derives its power from the network. “Students are currently dependent on the information provided by counsellors. Yocket makes things transparent. We also connect users with similar interests and profiles to enable them to discuss plans and make an informed choice,” he says. Available as a website as well as a mobile app, the platform enables not only networking but also a handy set of features carefully curated to meet the needs of aspirants. Yocket also eliminates the constraint of geographical distance — every year, the platform hosts a graduate virtual fair, in which representatives from universities in the U.S. interact with students online.
Pressing need
The motivation to start the platform came when the co-founders were running another platform, stupidsid.com, a website providing college reviews and study material for students in India. A large number of queries about studying abroad, and a general obscurity in the process that led to several wrong choices, made them aware of a pressing need as well as a business opportunity. Today, Yocket not only helps in aggregating university platforms from across the globe, but also gives students access to reliable counsel.
Why not Indian universities? “Yocket’s vision is to make international education more achievable. We do plan to cover Indian universities, but from the perspective of international students who wish to study in India,” answers Kashyap.
Plans for the future are in plenty. “We are currently catering to graduate students. We will soon be expanding to cover undergraduates as well. We aim to make Yocket a default platform for all international students,” signs off Sumeet.

Confidence boosters
","After learning from a cousin about the importance of internships for a college student, I started looking for internships through online platforms. I read about one of them in a reputed newspaper. So, without wasting much time, I applied for a few internships. Being an English literature student, I chose the field of content writing.
As I live in a tier-two city with hardly any in-office internships, I was not sure what to do, in the beginning. However, after reading about virtual internships, I thought of applying for the same. Initially, I was rejected by some companies, but I figured being a first year-student, the competition was more intense. So, I started to keep a track of my mistakes and read articles about writing a good cover letter.
A great start
My efforts paid off and I received mails stating that I had been selected for two internships — at Hunterest and Storieo. And excited as I was, I took up both of them. 
The selection for Hunterest was through a simple telephonic interview in which I was asked about my educational background and why I was interested in that internship. Storieo required its interns to have a special interest and skills in creative writing, and my resume must have provided that bit of information as I had included all relevant details, and was duly selected.
For Hunterest, I had to write two to five articles regularly on various topics such as lifestyle, tech, food, health, travel, and so on.
 Storieo, on the other hand, is a website which publishes short stories and book reviews. There were no deadlines or regular submissions. I could submit a short-story at my leisure and could extend the internship after every two months if I wished, until I completed 20 stories, which was the allotted target.
After the Hunterest internship got over, I grabbed my third internship at Trekteller. During this, I had to write three blogs every day on assigned topics, after doing research on the Internet.
The organisation works internationally and I was required to cover cities such as Paris and a few Australian cities for good hotels, spas, shopping centers, and restaurants that could help tourists.
So, I have worked as an intern for three organisations now in a span of seven months. I have learnt about the inverted pyramid structure for writing good articles for websites and e-commerce platforms. I have also learnt how to write good blogs while unearthing the storyteller in me. 
These experiences have brought out a confidence in me that constantly pushes me towards the frontiers of growth and self-development.

Want to be a phlebotomist?
","Blood bank technology and clinical lab technology fall under a wide range of fields in medicine. Technicians are usually trained as phlebotomists and work with patients to collect various settings, blood and labelling. They usually work in medical laboratories and blood banks, where they store blood of the donors for transmission. Apart from this, they ensure that the type of blood collected is safe and also examine the level of healthy molecules in the blood.The course which such technicians study come under the National Skills Development Corporation and by doing this course, one can be assured of a good future, and also contribute to the Prime Minister’s Skill India Mission. 
Nature of work
Most activities are office-based. Technicians work only in blood banks and laboratories, doing research with donor’s blood to know the type of blood, and especially to see how safe the blood is. It is the blood technician’s job to store that blood for emergency. Apart from this, it is the job of a blood bank technician to check the blood of patients in the hospital’s lab and to collect related information. In addition, the technician also makes a record of blood. Those candidates who want to pursue their career in this field must have the flexibility to work independently and should also have good analytical skills.
Course and qualifications
Aspirants must have a diploma or certificate course in blood bank technology from any recognised institute approved from the accredited Board after passing class XII. The course duration is one or two years, which varies from one institute to another. During this course, candidates are given attention in practical training, in where they are taught to check various kinds of blood samples. Apart from this, essential elements of the different types of blood are explained. They are also taught how to deal with emergency or any kind of disaster. One can also apply for a government post by passing the SSC exams. The main aim of the diploma is to train students and turn them into skilled technicians who ensure the smooth functioning of a blood bank.
Opportunities
 Graduates have new job opportunities in government and non-government departments. Apart from this, candidates can also work in private hospitals or labs. At present, there is a scarcity in the medical lab market and large companies such as Dr. Path Lab and Ranbaxy have opened their labs in every city, which have a lot of demand in the blood bank department. 
 Based on experience, one can become a research and blood bank specialist, where one can get initial salary from ₹ 10,000 to ₹15,000. But on the basis of experience, the salary increases. One can also set up labs, or work in private lab.

Going forward: Offline
","The Common Law Admission Test (CLAT) has been the gateway to step into the premier National Law Universities since 2008, and every year, a growing number of students write this entrance test to join these coveted law schools. CLAT, hitherto, was conducted by different National Law Schools on rotation with no permanent board/committee. In the last couple of years, CLAT has been plagued with errors in questions and answers, besides technical glitches in the conduct of the entrance test, thereby shattering the confidence and dreams of thousands of students.
Changes 
 In early October this year, for the first time, a CLAT consortium was formed to regulate the exam. The CLAT consortium has announced the date of the next exam as May 12, 2019. In a major move, the consortium has decided that CLAT 2019 will be an offline exam. This decision was taken following complaints from students across the country in the last few years about technical glitches in the conduct of the online CLAT exam. Though the exam is conducted by different law schools in rotation each year, this year, a permanent CLAT Secretariat has been established in the National Law School of India University (NLSIU) campus in Bengaluru. This is a much-needed system to streamline conduct of the exam. CLAT 2019 will be conducted by an executive committee of the consortium consisting of NLSIU (Bengaluru), NALSAR (Hyderabad), NLU (Bhopal), and CLAT Convenor of the year, which is NLU (Odisha) and the CLAT Convenor of next year along with few other member universities. The exam is expected to shortly launch its permanent website which will carry all pertinent information relating to CLAT 2019. With this arrangement in place, it is hoped that the exam will be devoid of errors and lapses.
With about six months to go for CLAT 2019, law aspirants must start preparation right away.
 Systematic planner
CLAT is a simple aptitude test which tests a students’ competence in subjects such as English, arithmetic, general knowledge, and logical and legal reasoning. Though the content of the exam is simple, it is the time factor and negative marking, which makes the entrance test challenging. The question paper has 200 questions to be tackled in 120 minutes and 0.25 marks deducted for every wrong answer.
English
This section tests the students’ vocabulary including Latin words, grammar skills and comprehension ability. Students who are voracious readers and those who have an eye for grammar usually do well. However, many students, these days, have trouble with this section owing to decline in reading habit.
Arithmetic
This segment tests students’ basic math skills by testing them on topics such as profit and loss, ratios, time, work and distance, simple and compound interest, averages and other general math topics which are learnt in the middle-and-high-school level. Since time is a constraint in this exam, students need to employ strategic thinking and “short-cuts” to arrive at solutions.
General knowledge
This segment aims at finding out students’ awareness of current happenings and general topics. A good memory and systematic preparation of a wide gamut of topics such as world organisations, history, everyday science, books and authors and such other topics are required. Reading newspapers is an indispensable requirement to ace the current affairs questions asked in this section. The availability of several current affairs apps and dedicated general knowledge websites have made students’ preparation quite easy.
Logical reasoning
To assess the lateral thinking of aspirants, this segment has been designed. Word and number analogy, direction sense test, puzzles, relationship tests, syllogism, critical reasoning form the core of this section. Thanks to the oympiad exams initiated by schools right from primary level onwards, most students can crack this section with confidence. However, the key to high score in this section is loads and loads of practice, as students need to hone these problem-solving techniques.
Legal reasoning
The selection test to study in top law schools will be incomplete without testing basic analytical reasoning ability of law aspirants. Since every legal professional needs strong deductive reasoning skills, this section has questions which include a legal premise followed by a situation and four plausible conclusions. Students are expected to choose the most appropriate answer on the lines of the given legal principle while remaining unemotional. This segment also tests students’ awareness of contemporary legal developments and basic legal awareness. Working out the past year papers of CLAT will give you a clear idea of what to expect in this section.
Tips and strategies 
1. Begin your systematic preparation well in advance, preferably six to eight months prior to the examination. Last–minute preparation hardly helps.
2. Take sample/mock CLAT tests to assess yourself. This will help you understand your strengths and weaknesses.
3. There are no quick-fix methods to tackle your poor vocabulary. Reading is the only time-tested method to enlarge your vocabulary, however, reading vocabulary building books does help.
4. Reading newspapers and quality books has in-built advantages such as widening your current affairs knowledge, improving your reading speed and building a robust vocabulary, all of which are required for a successful career in law.
5. Since time is a vital factor, taking mock tests and doing practice tests at regular intervals will improve speed.
6. Since the level of math tested is of basic standard, students should take it as an opportunity to develop basic arithmetic ability, which will be useful later in professional life.
7. Students aspiring to study law must develop a keen interest in the functioning of the Constitution and other laws. Further, a strong interest in political and international developments will kindle their enthusiasm to pursue law.
8. While there are excellent job prospects upon completion of law degree, students should not have myopic view of just placements and salaries, rather cultivate a desire for knowledge in all facets of law and hone excellent communication and reasoning skills to become a top-notch legal professional.
9. The preparation style for an entrance exam vastly differs from that of a Board exami. Constant test-taking and analysing test performances and varying strategies in approaching the exam hold key to success in this exam.
10. Finally, a strong will power, tons of hard work, perseverance and valuable guidance are truly the secrets of success in not just CLAT but any entrance test.

The math way of life ","Being a mathematics and physics teacher, I have had the privilege of interacting with thousands of parents and students from diverse backgrounds. Also, being a part of one of the world’s largest education companies, I have also had the opportunity of interacting with some of the finest educators from around the world. 
In all of these conversations, a question I am asked often is why, despite a rich ancient mathematics culture, India does not produce great mathematicians. Is it a reflection of the quality of math education in the country? Does it demonstrate a common aptitude amongst Indians? Is there a ‘gene’ that determines whether you excel in this subject or not? Well, I have a slightly different way of looking at it and I believe there is no better time to share this than with the National Mathematics Day around the corner on December 22.
Being good at math versus being a good mathematician are two very different things. A mathematician is someone who is a specialist or an expert and is most likely pursuing research in this field. Being ‘good at math’, however, can be evaluated in various ways.
Everyday use
What is math at the core? It is merely a way of thinking. It is a universal language and the omnipresence of numbers makes it an integral part of our very existence. Be it calculating the distance to work or assessing the amount of weekly groceries, math is a part of our everyday decisions. According to me, your way of approaching problems analytically and logically determines how good you are in the subject.
If your way of thinking is logical, you can apply it to problems you face across computer science, coding, business, investing etc; research mathematics is not the only way to demonstrate our mathematical strength. Formal education and degrees aside, I strongly believe that conceptual clarity in math along with strong fundamentals can help students excel in any field.
Tackling the fear 
While the importance of math is uncontested, I see a common aversion to this subject across students of all age groups, especially young adults. Traditionally, maths has been taught in an abstract manner which makes it one of the ‘most feared’ subjects. Understanding and exploring math concepts is still driven by the fear of exams instead of the love for the subject. In fact, the fear of maths continues to live through most of our adult lives too.
In my teaching experience, though, I have not come across children who are unable to do math if you teach them the right way. The reality is that all kids are smart and it is our responsibility to identify what they are smart at and leverage that to teach them. For example, some students struggle to remember formulae. If you try to make them memorise it, they will never be able to perform well. However, the same child could be great at visualising things. Taking them through the same concepts visually — through a video or by taking them outdoors, and you will see they are able to grasp the idea easily. For all parents and teachers, the focus should be on explaining concepts using multiple formats because the reality is that different kids learn in different ways, and we should stop trying to fit them in the same mould.
It is also critical that we change our attitude towards mistakes. Take an example of your favourite video game — you don’t always finish it in one go. Yet, you don’t stop trying. That is because, instead of telling you that you are ‘bad’ at it, you are instantly given the option to try again. That is how math learning should be. Criticising mistakes and errors creates life-long inhibitions that prevent the child from trying again. Mistakes are not failures, and if treated right, there is no reason the child will not give his best in grasping the subject once again.
The biggest disservice we can do to our children and students is letting them believe they are ‘weak’ or ‘incapable’. Children, from their formative years, should be taught to understand and experience the ‘intellectual adventure’ that mathematics can offer them. Problem-solving is the heart of mathematics and learning this as a life-skill has long-term positive consequences which the students will cherish for life.

Dynamic headstart "," Tech Bee, HCL’s early career programme, aims at preparing students for entry-level jobs in the company. Srimathi Shivashankar, Executive Vice-President, HCL Technologies, gives a breakdown of the details. 
The programme
The Tech Bee programme is presented by HCL with SSN College of Engineering as the academic partner. The 15-month programme will train students who have completed Class XII and want to take up early careers. It will culminate in a diploma awarded by SSN. Upon successful completion, they will be provided assured jobs with HCL.
Vision
We look at these students as an alternative talent pool whom we can absorb into IT. When we have diversity in the workforce, it brings innovation and very different energy levels. Further, the current generation is choosy about what they want to do even in entry-level jobs. They want their careers to evolve over a period of time, but rapidly as well. They want dynamic job roles. In some households, there is also a need for children to start their careers early. Based on both the behavioural perspective as well as the demographic dividend which we want to leverage, this is the best time to pick up talent to bring into our larger talent pool.
Structure
The programme combines training with skilling. It comprises nine months of classroom training, on engineering and software fundamentals, and six months of job-specific training. While the training will take place at SSN, the students will be deputed at HCL for the last three months where they will be assigned to projects before they get absorbed as full-time workers. 
Curriculum
The diploma programme aims at providing a strong IT foundation and make students ready for entry-level roles in application and infrastructure maintenance. Students will receive technical foundation training, technology/domain training which will be stream-specific, and hands-on project work. They will also learn the fundamentals of IT, software tools and processes, and be exposed to emerging technologies.
The course content and learning pedagogy are mapped to our entry-level jobs. The four diploma streams are in mechanical automation, software engineering, support engineering, and products and testing engineering.
Career
During the programme, students will be paid a stipend of ₹10,000 per month. On completion, they will occupy engineering-level jobs at HCL, in KPO, development, support, testing, mechanical automation and so on. They could also continue their higher education while working, with the option of enrolling into IGNOU for a work-integrated 5-year MCA programme. This way, students will not be compromising on higher education. Weekend sessions for the course will take place at HCL.
Eligibility
Students from any stream with a cut-off of 85% (State Board) or 90% (CBSE) in Class XII, with Math or Business Math, can apply. Screening and selection will be based on an online exam, interview and group discussion.
Fee and scholarships
The programme fee is ₹2 lakh plus taxes. Students need not pay the fee upfront. They can pay it from the third year of work with us, on an EMI basis. Based on the performance during the training, the full fee or a part of it could be waived.
Applications for the Tech Bee 
programme are open. Visit www.hcltss.com or contact 1800 200 1117.

Connect with your virtual teacher "," It’s not easy to take up the job of teaching when you love the comforts of your home, do not like being told how to teach and want a good pay at the same time. However, e-teaching is here to change it all and provide you with what you want.
With the pioneering of digitalisation in India, education sector has taken complete advantage of the opportunity of online education. E-learning in India is not new yet it is, in a way of approaching the students. With the advantages of studying at the comfort of your home, re-watching a video to clarify or revise and studying at a time comfortable for you, e-learning is giving a tough competition to the classrooms.
Virtual classrooms
Not only is it helping students but at the same time it is also a hot job these days for teachers who want to teach from home and do not want the hassles of arranging tuition classes. Not only does it save you time and money it also gets you to reach a far greater number of students than classroom teaching, and that’s what a lot of teachers these days are looking for.
Teachers can devote their time to prepare lessons comfortably just the way students can watch the videos at their convenience. The approach teachers take are not bound to organisational rules and have freedom to teach different topics. Not only do teachers prepare lessons but also solve doubts and pretty much cover all the aspects of classroom learning. 
Through e-teaching, teachers are able to help students to gain from the video lessons they provide through virtual teaching. The moral responsibility of imparting education to underprivileged students who are unable to afford expensive coaching is also solved by e-teaching to a great extent. Teachers can reach out to places where it is otherwise physically difficult to teach. It aims to provide education to all and to uplift students who can’t afford expensive coaching and travelling costs.
Sometimes, it is not possible for institutions to hire the best teachers due to financial constraints and sometimes the teachers do not like being associated with coaching classes. In fact, even the age factor can be negated when you teach online because you don’t have to consider the long hours of staying in school or the continuous coaching classes for hours together.
There is no spoon-feeding and hence students have to think on their own, try problem-solving without any help which benefits what they have been taught.
The constant increase in popularity of online courses among students are making teachers too take the path of online teaching as their main job. With accessible technology and the comfort it offers there is no looking back for the ones who opt for online teaching profession.

In the times of VR ","In 1990, the box office watermark “Matrix” and its 360° pans, slow-mo bullet trajectories, left audiences gobsmacked, and the iconic visuals lingered in geek memories for years. This film set a benchmark for virtual reality (VR)in the entertainment world, and since then, technology has taken a dimensional shift from the regular to the out-of-the-box. 
VR has been extensively employed in the gaming industry. Its foray into education is relatively new and yet to prove its potential. However, it has the potential to revolutionise learning, retention and content delivery exponentially. One can learn to play musical instruments, fix a computer, and draw a painting in the virtual world. It is true that some gifted teachers have made classroom experiences unforgettable and met teaching outcomes outstandingly. 
High-impact learning
With VR, students feel that they are in a different place, doing something hands-on. It enables a high impact learning experience and helps them engage more with the content, besides giving them the space for exploration, and trial and error. They learn through constant simulation that helps them apply their knowledge faster, think quicker and experience real-life situations. 
VR has the potential to render physical tools and equipment, and place them in the hands of a student at no extra cost. Witnessing atomic collisions inside CERN’s Large Hadron Collider slowed down and virtualised to understand the action of electromagnetic forces might have sounded like science fiction 20 years ago. But today, virtual reality has changed the face of chemistry labs, engineering workshops and physics classrooms, altogether. Micro learning using VR can enhance learning practice and help students get first-hand experiences of different environments and retain what they learn, longer than usual.
Enhanced visual thinking
The capacity to create involved ecosystems enables the teacher to deliver knowledge in a more relatable and vivid manner than words. VR opens doors to the visual possibilities that students can access, explore or interact with. This makes understanding any new concept more natural and think on-their-feet. The other most important aspect of VR in a classroom is the instant emotional reaction of the students in various situations. It allows for the facilitator to monitor how students are responding to the learning and measure how immersive their learning is. 
Map individual learning 
VR-enabled classrooms allow real-time assessment of students with different capacities. There will always be students with different rates of lesson absorption, retention and ability for application. Checkpoints can be built into programmes that instantly test understanding, and learning pathways can be personalised to assess previously learned concepts upon which advanced lessons are based. 
 Access
Stephen Hawking will not be remembered as the only person who could tap virtual encyclopaedias on a wheelchair. VR can provide a platform for the differently-abled student. They can become a part of any classroom merely with the addition of a headset. VR can empower every learner with the tools to fulfil potential. 
In India, over seven million children are yet to be enrolled for elementary education, over 20% students drop out of schools and colleges after secondary education due to non-availability of educational establishments in rural areas. VR can change the way education is served in remote areas. A universal classroom can become a reality. Students can become a part of global education systems and instantly access latest breakthroughs in knowledge, practice and technology. 
No threat
It is important to understand that it would be incorrect to assume that VR is a threat to mainstream teaching jobs. In truth, VR is not designed as a substitute for the teacher but as a supplement. With it, teaching does not need to take a back seat, nor should it take place in a completely rendered, virtual environment. Augmented reality will allow teachers, trainers, facilitators and institutions the option to insert the digitally rendered VR elements and graphics into the real world to help students attain learning goals more efficiently. 
Industry 4.0 ready
Technology is changing industries at a pace that it must be constantly monitored, analysed and upgraded. For this task, experience and problem-solving skills are needed from the get-go. VR allows learners to obtain this proficiency in controlled and simulated settings. Students learning in virtual reality, and using its associated supplies, will become acclimatised to a new, innovative culture and be ready to embrace the possibilities of similar emerging technologies as they arrive. Virtual reality will help nurture creativity and critical thinking in students and help them become job- ready in the dynamically-challenged organisations of Industry 4.0.

Firing the right shot
","I was always interested in space and defence technology and was used to reading articles to keep myself updated. After my second year, I did a six-week internship in the Small Arms Factory (SAF) of Indian Ordnance Factories Board, the Ministry of Defence in Kanpur. SAF offers opportunities for students from various departments with its sections consisting INSAS assembly, tool room, computer numerical control (CNC) machine section, MAG gun section, small component section, electrical department, IT cell, and a cell for management students. 
There are two ways to get this internship. If you are an ‘employee’s ward’ in which if you know any employee currently working under the Ministry of Defence, you can directly contact their HR department. The second is the one I went through — contact the senior general manager of the factory and send him your resume and a covering letter. If he finds your application suitable, the manager will forward it to the HR department. 
Levels of screening
The selection process is a bit challenging as they get 1000’s of applications for this internship and only 100-120 students are selected during summer. You have to undergo an interview with IES/IAS officers. 
During the interview, your knowledge on what you want to pursue is tested. They also check for your area of interest according to which you are allotted a section in the factory. The interview was unexpectedly easy for me as I had good grades and had an intensive knowledge about the defence field.
I was allotted INSAS Assembly Section which assembles INSAS rifles and INSAS Light machine guns (LMG). INSAS rifles are used by the Indian armed forces along with some foreign users. 
My work was to study the faults and the firing results of the rifle and to provide remedial measures to improve them. INSAS rifles, which are assembled in SAF, undergo a series of firing tests in the firing range by army/navy shooters who test it thoroughly. For me, the best part of this internship was to carry the INSAS rifles and to perform the shooting in the range. INSAS rifles have many faults such as BNC, cover fall, RBNC, light strike, and extract. And, to improve these faults, one needs to understand the details of the manufacturing of different parts of the rifle which are manufactured in the factory itself.
The people working at SAF are highly talented and have good knowledge of their specific sections. They are open-minded and ready to clear doubts. This internship gave me an opportunity to apply my theoretical knowledge and get an in-depth understanding about guns and machines. 
As mechanical engineering students, we usually deal with lathe, shaper, milling, and other machines in college while in the industry, the machines used are giant sized. Seeing closely how these machines operate and how gun components are manufactured was one of my major takeaways from this internship.

Persistence pays
","Epitomised by Malcolm Gladwell’s 10,000 hours rule, success eventually boils down to ‘persistence’. If you pull in efforts over a period of time (called rigor), you will succeed — get into a college of your choice, learn a new skill, make your business successful, and so on. I have seen this principle manifest itself in pretty much all situations. Given that all people have a certain basic intelligence, and the IQ variation for most is within 10%, success (or lack of it) can only be attributed to rigor and resilience. 
Here are some student experiences to elaborate upon this point. A student was sure that the only school that he wanted to study at was the Harvard Business School (HBS). A laudable objective, but with acceptance rates well under 10%, HBS was not going to be easy! Further, he was an Indian male — one of the most over-represented demographic at HBS. To make matters worse, he was average — no spikes in academics, nor in sports or extracurricular activities and a fairly average professional experience at an IT services firm. His GMAT scores were also just about average — at about 710/800. The first time he applied, he could not get in. He applied for the second time but could not make it then either. The third time, he did not want to apply (and had already secured admissions from some other great MBA colleges) but eventually put in an application. His story, this time, was unusual. He talked about his resolve of getting into HBS at any cost. He talked about his past attempts and his failure to make it to the coveted institution. He also talked about the impact that it had on his career and personal life. And he capped it all with a dare — that HBS should consider itself lucky that someone is so persistent about getting there. Not taking him would be their loss and not his. He got an early decision admit at HBS with 50% tuition waiver. This is a story of persistence. Of not giving up. 
Perseverance is the key
Often, youngsters come to me with a clamour that they want to do something new in life. These are prospective college applicants, young entrepreneurs, people who are trying to develop a new hobby or interest, and so on. My usual response is a question — ‘How long have you been at it?’ The answers have always surprised me and hold the key to their lack of ‘success’ in their ventures. Most tell me that they have been at it just for a couple of days to a few months. Unless you have spent time at a particular vocation, you cannot succeed.
Another student came to us in the first year of her undergraduate studies. She had more than two years before her MIM application was due and she wanted to build a narrative that was powerful and representative of who she was. Over time, we realised that she was passionate about smells — she was particularly captivated by the smell of the ‘first rain.’ She chose to explore her interests in that area and went on to research and develop deeper skills and understanding of the subject. She travelled to the narrow by-lanes of Old Delhi, explored the process of ‘holding a smell in a ghara’ in the suburb of Kannauj, learnt to mix oils with Hyderabadi artisans in Begum-Bazaar, and explored a design-thinking approach to build out bespoke smells (more western method) in Bengaluru. This is an adventure of persistence woven through more than two years of labour. Her narrative was on ‘smells’, and in her application, she expressed an intent to be a part of luxury and leisure industry. She got into the best European colleges and is currently pursuing her master’s in luxury management.
A student wanted to be a soccer player. He kept coming back to it — as a player (he was a national level soccer player), possibly a coach (briefly he flirted with the idea), event management at local events and even soccer entrepreneurship. However, none of those turned into a durable career. However, over the course of three years that he spent at these soccer related vocations, he matured as a soccer enthusiast and in the process, built a ‘love for soccer’ profile that was unparalleled. He later applied to one of the most coveted programmes in sports management — the FIFA master’s (International master’s in management, law and humanities of sports) jointly conducted by three universities in England, Italy and Switzerland. This became a stepping stone not just for a promising career with Real Madrid as an assistant team manager, but also for realising his passion. Persistence eventually paid off.
You need to spend time in building your narrative to get into a top-notch school. Eventually, it does not boil down to your academics or generalised scores, but on the story that you are telling. And the only way that this story can become potent is by building this narrative over a period of time. Evidence-based inputs which give credibility to this story are a prerequisite to make it powerful and realistic.

Trading options for everyone
","In one of the earlier columns, we have seen how index funds can be used to get exposure to the stock market in a low cost way. We also learnt that by using direct mutual fund schemes, we can bring down the cost of the funds even further. In today’s column, we will revisit the concept of index funds and direct schemes of mutual funds. After that, we will also learn about a new financial product called the ETF or the exchange traded fund.
Simple alternates 
Do you recall what an index mutual fund is? A mutual fund is a collective investment scheme which enables small investors to pool their assets and build a portfolio. Say you have ₹10,000. You want to start building a diversified portfolio. You check out the market and you find that you can buy around 15 or so blue chip stocks after which you run out of money. You were looking to build a portfolio of around 25 stocks. How do you solve this? Enter the mutual fund. By collecting ₹10,000 from 1,000 people like you, the mutual fund can build a large, well diversified portfolio, out of which you get a share (1/1,000). This is a clever idea. 
Mutual funds have fund managers who actively select stocks for their portfolio with the aim of delivering better returns than the bench mark indices. Often, they fail in this endeavour as “beating” the market consistently is not easy. So was born the index fund, which simply “tracks” the performance of a stock index like Nifty or Sensex. In this case, the fund manger does not have to do anything clever and he also does not need an army of highly paid analysts. Therefore, the costs associated with manufacturing and distributing the index funds is lower. And all this savings come to you — the investor. You can do even better by cutting out the middle men and directly buying the index fund from mutual fund companies via the “direct plan”. The cost savings may look marginal — a percentage or so here and there, but remember, these are costs that you save every year. Over a period of several years, such cost-efficient investment products deliver great returns to investors.
ETF is another interesting investment product. This product is listed on stock exchanges like the NSE and you can buy and sell them the way you would buy and sell a stock. That is pretty neat, isn’t it? You can get the diversified exposure of a basket of stocks just by executing a single transaction without the need of an advisor. Cheap electronic trading platforms like Zerodha can be used to buy and sell ETFs. The financial outcome of an ETF is not very different from that of an index fund. In fact, most ETFs are manufactured by asset management companies. Yet, there are interesting differences between the ETF and index funds. In our next column, we will see what these differences are. Meanwhile, if you are really curious, you can do your own research and email me the top ETFs in the Indian market.

As trade war looms, China cuts some banks’ reserve requirements ","China’s central bank said on Sunday it would cut the amount of cash that some banks must hold as reserves by 50 basis points (bps), releasing $108 billion in liquidity, to accelerate the pace of debt-for-equity swaps and spur lending to smaller firms.
The reserve reduction, the third by the central bank this year, had been widely anticipated by investors amid concerns over market liquidity and a potential economic drag from a trade dispute with the U.S.
Bigger than expected
But the 700 billion yuan ($107.65 billion) in liquidity that the central bank said will result from the reduction in reserves was bigger than expected.
Expectations of a cut had risen after the State Council, or cabinet, said on Wednesday monetary policy tools including targeted cuts in banks’ reserve requirement ratios will be deployed to strengthen credit flows to small firms and keep economic growth in a reasonable range.
Economists are not ruling out further reserve requirement reductions for the rest of the year as borrowing costs rise due to Beijing’s clamp-down on leverage in the financial system, a campaign now in its third year, while uncertainty over Sino-U.S. trade ties persists.
The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) said that the latest targeted cut in some banks’ reserve requirement ratios (RRRs) - currently 16% for large banks and 14% for smaller banks - will take effect on July 5.
The PBOC said the cut will release about 500 billion yuan ($77 billion) for the country’s five large state banks and 12 national joint-stock commercial banks. Lenders are encouraged to use the money to conduct debt-for-equity swaps.

India seeks revision in price of gas via TAPI line
","India has sought re-negotiation of the natural gas price it is to source through a proposed $10 billion Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India (TAPI) pipeline due to slump in global energy markets, a top source said.
 The four nations had in 2013 signed a gas sale purchase agreement (GSPA) that bench-marked the price of natural gas that Turkmenistan is to export at 55% of the prevailing crude oil price. This translates into a price of about $7.5 per million British thermal unit (mmBtu) at current oil prices at the Turkmen border.

‘Anchor bank for PSB consolidation put on hold’
"," The concept of having 5-6 anchor banks and merging weaker banks with them to drive consolidation among public sector banks (PSBs) has been put on the back-burner. Instead, an alternative proposal is before the Finance Ministry, according to T.N. Manoharan, chairman, Canara Bank.
“The major hurdle comes in the form of culture when it comes to integration. Instead, one of the suggestions made to the Finance Ministry is classifying banks into three categories,” he said.
One is a universal bank which does all kinds of banking, including corporate lending. The second type includes national retail banks that would focus only on retail lending. Regional retail banks constitute the third type. Mr. Manoharan and Shyam Srinivasan, MD and CEO of Federal Bank, were speaking on the topic ‘Banks-from the brink.’ The Canara Bank Chairman also said Finance Minister Piyush Goyal was keen on the concept of a ‘bad’ bank and if it went through, it would help public sector banks to start afresh. 
 Infra projects
 “Contrary to public perception that bad loans are due to wilful defaulters and indiscriminate lending, it is only a small segment,” said Mr. Manoharan. “The real issue is commercial banks lending to big infrastructure projects, which got into problems,” he said. 
Mr. Srinivasan said that the phase of recognition of bad loans was over and now, the focus was on recovery.

Texprocil in talks with textile sector on alternative plans for export subsidies
","The Cotton Textiles Export Promotion Council (Texprocil) will shortly submit its suggestions to the government on alternative programmes to replace some of the existing export promotion schemes for the textiles and clothing sector.
The council had engaged a consultant who is expected to submit a report by the end of this month. The consultant and the council are holding interactive meetings in different textile clusters now. Three such meetings had already been held and a similar number will be organised. A. Ravindrakumar, joint director, Texprocil, Harsha Vardhan Singh, chairman of IKDHVAJ Advisers (consultant) and Jayant Dasgupta, an international trade consultant, told The Hindu here that India had to phase out all export subsidies by 2018 as its share in global textile and clothing exports crossed the 3.25% threshold in 2010. 
Further, the U.S. had recently challenged some Indian export subsidy schemes at the World Trade Organisation (WTO). Schemes such as MEIS, EPCG, and SEZ had to be replaced.
However, India’s textile and clothing exports are less than the 2015 level. “In this context, if India is to remove the export benefits, it will be a further blow to the industry,” said Mr. Singh. Under the MEIS, made-ups and garments get 4% subsidy and fabrics 2%. The EPCG scheme is used widely by processing, weaving and spinning industries, they said.
Helping units scale up 
The objective of the suggestions would be to provide incentives and benefits to help all the units scale up, improve their competitiveness, encourage use of technology and enable them to go in for certifications. The alternative schemes should benefit both domestic and exportunits, they said.

Bengal ties up with bourses to help SMEs tap capital market
","The West Bengal government has signed pacts with BSE and NSE to raise awareness among the State’s MSMEs to tap the capital market as an alternate funding source.
The State has the highest number of micro, small and medium enterprises — 52.7 lakh in 2016-17, employing about 1.1 crore people, according to official statistics.
SME listing provides higher visibility at national level and this initiative is part of the government’s plans to expand their funds base. Bank credit to MSMEs in last seven years is estimated at ₹1.74 crore, according to the MSME and Textiles Department of West Bengal Government.
To start with, the State government, is planning to get 100 SMEs listed on NSE Emerge platform by 2020. Through the pact, BSE will encourage them to tap domestic capital markets as an option for accessing capital for expansion while gaining national-level visibility. BSE will provide intellectual and manpower support in such awareness programmes. About 18 companies from West Bengal are already listed on the BSE SME platform.
Ajay Thakur, head of the BSE SME platform, said that it was a myth that only large companies could be listed. West Bengal, being the largest hub of SMEs, would benefit immensely because of this MoU. Currently, six companies from varied industries in the State are listed on the NSE Emerge platform with total fund raising of about ₹44 crore.

Cargill Business Services to add 1,200 employees
","Cargill Business Services, the Indian subsidiary of Cargill, the largest privately owned company in the U.S., has opened a new 1,200-seater back office facility in Bengaluru, taking the overall staff strength in the technology hub to 3,200 people. 
“We serve our internal stakeholders and work on finance, information technology, human resources, transportation and logistics and source to pay functions,” Lalitha Indrakanti, managing director of the centre, said in an interview. “Bengaluru is a global center for Cargill.”
Cargill, headquartered in Wayzata, Minnesota, is a provider of food, agriculture and industrial products and services. Cargill started Indian operations in 1987 and the Bengaluru facility, its biggest business service centre globally, was opened 2015.
India’s outsourcing industry helped Indians prepare for dealing with global stakeholders and markets, she said. 
“If you are trying to cater to an Australian farmer or a trucker in U.S….the interaction depends on the kind of work they do. If at all anyone is equipped to do that it is India. Historically, the outsourcing industry has prepared us so much that we found change management tougher at the other end,” Ms. Indrakanti said. 
“If you pick up anyone here [Cargill Business Services], especially the lateral hires, they have worked with global stakeholders. So our experience of working with global stakeholders is far more than others. That talent exists in India,” she added.
Cargill Business Services, after four years of its operations in Bengaluru, is looking for new sectors to ramp up growth.
“Now, we are looking at the next strategy to grow. What are the new things we should be doing... As part of this, we have been doing a strategy project for the last five to six months to identify areas of growth for the next two years. What we are trying to look at is what has been the industry historically doing….whether we have a similar organisation like us….and what are the functions they are supporting, what are we doing and where are the gaps,” she said.
“We believe that as a result of this, new functions will emerge like environment, health and safety, corporate ethics and compliance. There are various other core corporate functions that exist today that could be probably done from here.“
Cargill, the parent company, employs 1,55,000 people in 70 countries.

‘Third eye’ to monitor traders on GSTN "," India has deployed business intelligence or ‘third eye’ technology in its Goods and Service Tax Network to detect defaulters and will install radio frequency identification tags on trucks transporting goods to check on compliance in the e-way bill process, Sushil Kumar Modi, who heads the GSTN panel, said on Saturday.
“There is minimum manual interference now when there is a requirement to file returns as everything regarding payments is online,” Mr. Modi told correspondents in Bengaluru. “We have business intelligence in our network. You cannot dupe the government department.
‘Discrepancies stand out’
“In the third phase of IT development, we have sent to States the GSTR 3 and GSTR 1 forms. They both have to match. If there is a discrepancy then the third eye will detect. Notices will be served.”
Mr. Modi, who is also the Deputy Chief Minister of Bihar, said the “business intelligence” within the network can generate more than 15 kinds of different registrations. “Business intelligence can give a 360-degree view of the taxpayer.”
“States can take action against the defaulters. The system, through bid data analysis, will send an alert to those who purchase goods from traders who have not paid the tax as ‘non-filer’,” he said. “The government has started serving notices to defaulters since April.”
The government is also planning to install sensors at entry and exit points of each State’s borders and deploy RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) tags on trucks to monitor e-way bills.
“Currently it is implemented in Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh. We will introduce it nationwide,” he said.
The government is also mulling simplification of tax return forms, he said. The GST Council has approved a new procedure to simplify the returns and the law committee will seek the approval of GST Council to implement the changes during the forthcoming meeting on July 21.
Infosys, India’s second-largest software exporter, is developing the information technology infrastructure to implement the new changes.
“In GSTR-3 one needs to file 37 returns in a year,” Mr. Modi said. 
“Now we are practically reducing it to only one page or maybe two pages. For business to consumer companies, it will be a three-line return form. It will be the simplest return form India has ever had.”
‘Raising threshold’
The Law Advisory Committee set up by the Ministry of Finance has suggested increasing the threshold of the composition scheme to ₹1.5 crore from the current ₹1 crore, he said. 
“The GST Council will take a call on when to amend.”
“It has also recommended a special class of dealers for the reverse charge mechanism, For service providers, the norm suggested is between 10% (of turnover) or ₹5 lakh whichever is lower.”
Another suggestion of the committee was that if restaurants, travel firms, healthcare companies and beverage outlets provide transport for women in the night shifts, they can avail of input tax credit, he said.
The funds left in the compensation cess, which is used to compensate the States for revenue shortfall suffered due to the GST roll-out and amounts to ₹22,000 crore as of March, will be distributed among the Centre and State governments, he said.
“Under the IGST there is about ₹22,000 crore in the kitty,” Mr. Modi said. The Integrated Goods and Tax (IGST) is charged on goods that get transported between States.

Prabhu seeks report from DGCA on grounding of nine A320 Neo aircraft ","Minister for Civil Aviation Suresh Prabhu has sought a detailed report from aviation regulator DGCA on the grounding of A320 Neo planes due to snags in Pratt and Whitney engines.
The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), has in the meantime, submitted preliminary details on the status of the planes grounded and said that nine A320s – seven of IndiGo and two of GoAir – were on ground out of the total 60 A320 Neos with PW engines with these two airlines.
The regulator also pointed out that the groundings were due to combustor distress, but ruled out safety concerns. 
“There are no safety concerns as such distress is found during routine scheduled boroscope inspections of these engines,” the DGCA informed the Ministry, adding that it was in touch with the manufacturer and no additional measure was required on the issue.
The new A320 neos inducted by IndiGo and GoAir since March 2018 as well as new spare engines have combustors with better life, the regulator said and emphasised that the measures taken by the engine manufacturer had “significantly reduced the engine problems.” IndiGo has a total of 41 A320 neos with PW engines, while GoAir has 19.
Engine removal 
“Engine removals are being planned and coordinated with the airlines as we continue to successfully retrofit the fleet with the latest configuration engines. Some aircraft will be out of service temporarily as they perform these removals,” Pratt and Whitney said in a statement.

IBC eyes UN model for cross-border norms
"," The government is looking at the possibility of adopting a United Nations legal model for cross-border insolvency cases as it works on strengthening the insolvency resolution framework, according to a senior official.
 The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) has sections pertaining to cross-border insolvency matters but are yet to be made operational. The Insolvency Law Committee, headed by Corporate Affairs Secretary Injeti Srinivas, is studying the feasibility of introducing cross-border insolvency provisions. “The committee is looking at the adoption of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law model on dealing with cross border insolvency,” he said in the ministry’s latest monthly newsletter.
 He also noted the existing Code provides for two sections — 234 and 235 — relating to cross-border insolvency, which allows the Centre to enter into an agreement with a foreign country for enforcing the provisions of the Code, which is considered insufficient and time-taking. 
An official said in case the UN model is adopted for cross-border insolvency matters, then sections 234 and 235 could be dropped from the Code as they pertain to only bilateral pacts.

‘Acquisition is about synergies, cost reduction’ ","Kumar Mangalam Birla, chairman of Aditya Birla Group, spoke after announcing the $2.6 billion acquisition of U.S.-based Aleris Corp. Edited excerpts. 
How confident are you in getting approvals in U.S, and China when the first buyer from China could not get government approval to buy Aleris?
There are couple of areas where we are competent than the other company. They had zero presence in the U.S. and we have significant presence in multiple locations. 
We have operating facilities across locations. We are constructing a new plant Kentucky. We have been in business in the U.S. for decade building trust. The Chinese company, which was competing with us, had neither presence in the U.S. nor made any investment there. 
As an industry, we are making 1.5 MT of sheet that go into automotive sector and competing with steel. No matter the process will take time. 
How do you see the see the deal in the light of resistance to foreign companies taking over assets abroad?
Think about this acquisition, we are not going to see any redundancy in operation. No job losses. This deal is about growth. We will be taking over certain plants and continue to grow these plants across the world and particularly in the U.S. It is completely about growth than anything else. 
It is about making solutions available to customers. It about achieving synergies and cost reduction to make the operations more resilient.
 Why are private equity investors quitting when their $900 million investment is going to yield returns?
It is better for them to answer, but I think the private equity investors do not lock their investment in an asset for a long time. 
They want to exit after a point of time booking their profit. This, incidentally, fits into our search for growth.
Vodafone-Idea got DoT approval for merger. When do you think the merged Vodafone and Idea will start operations and what would be your strategy when the price war is still on? 
We should start operations in next few weeks. We are still in the process of framing the strategy which will be revealed soon. We will make substantial investment in telecom sector going forward.
Do you think rising lending rate and surging inflation will affect India growth story?
 Our economists are expecting India to grow at over 8% and it will be one of the fasted growing countries. It is back on strong fundamentals. Some of the sectors are coming back strongly. 
Rising lending rates and inflation will have an impact but not much to hamper growth completely. It is part of doing business in any part of the world.
But, you were not very optimistic during UltraTech AGM?
During UltraTech AGM, I said that the economy is not looking rosy because of structural concerns like oil prices, inflation etc. Cement is looking up, roads and infrastructure sectors are doing well. I don’t see any problems with the economy. I see green shoots coming back in fact.
What’s the difference between Novelis and Aleris acquisitions?
I think Novelis was driven by the fact we wanted to move the portfolio to have a share of much higher value added products, higher margins, less volatility. 
It’s proven in the last 11 years, I think Novelis today is a well-regarded and valuable company. 
Aleris is a step forward in that direction giving us wide range of customers, new verticals like aerospace... very significant.

Consumption, govt. spending to be growth drivers
","Equity markets may well be trading at near all-time highs but the rally is taking place only in select stocks.  Mihir Vora, chief investment officer, Max Life Insurance, shares his thoughts.
The equity markets are at very high levels. Do you think it is a good time to invest in the markets or should one wait for a correction?
Markets are at near all-time highs but there is great polarisation of returns within the market and the benchmark. Stocks which are perceived to have visibility of earnings growth have been bid to extreme levels while those out-of-favour have been beaten down to yearly lows. The Nifty is held up by only eight stocks and it has become more acute in the past six months. This is seen in the large-cap benchmark stocks as well as in the mid-cap and small-cap segment. Mid and small-caps have corrected quite a lot and given up 2-3 years of outperformance versus the large-caps.
On the positive side, profit and growth numbers for the June and September 2018 quarters will be quite robust, given the low base of last year. The key to markets for the next few quarters is whether this momentum will sustain through March 2019. Valuations on an aggregate are still on the expensive side. Markets should consolidate and digest the global news flow on multiple factors viz. a) oil b) Chinese currency c) rising global yields d) trade and tariff issues. Locally, consumption and government spending look robust and should continue to be the growth drivers, continuing the trend that we have seen for quite some time.
What will be the impact on stock markets if there is an increase in crude prices besides a further fall in the rupee level? 
Crude prices, interest rates and the rupee are all very interlinked. If oil prices sustain at current levels, then we should be able to absorb it over a few quarters. However, if prices continue to rise, India as country becomes vulnerable again. Sentiment can change. Insurance products are not so closely linked to stock markets since we have a mix of products — from investment-oriented products to products which offer more protection. However, if markets and the economy do badly for a sustained long period, it may impact the flows.
Mutual funds have been seeing steady fund flow through SIPs which, in turn, is increasing inflows into the stock markets. How about the flows in the insurance segment and their stock market investments?
We continue to see steady inflows due to new sales, renewal premiums and income on existing portfolio. 
Like other segments of the financial sector, insurance also saw a sharp increase in inflows after the demonetisation event. The rise this year may not be as sharp as last year due to the high base, but the trend of savings being channeled to financial assets is likely to drive steady growth.
LIC is the largest domestic financial institution in terms of investments in the stock markets. What role do all the private sector insurance firms, including Max Life, play in the market especially when foreign investors are on a selling spree?
As we have seen in the past three years, the size of the local institutions has grown quite significantly. In the past few quarters, the selling by FIIs has been absorbed by the local institutions. Given the improved penetration of insurance and mutual funds and efforts to further improve the same, financial savings should continue to grow at a healthy pace. Moreover, the move by EPFO to increase allocation to equities and the rapid growth of the NPS schemes should further increase sustainable flows to equities annually.
In terms of relative size, FIIs holdings are still three times bigger than local holdings. Over the long term I don’t think that FIIs will remain net-sellers since they also get long-term inflows and they need to make asset allocations. India is a fast-growing economy of a certain critical size and it can absorb large amounts of capital — very few markets and countries offer this opportunity. In the past 20 years, FIIs have been net sellers of equities in only two or three years.
How has been the growth in the AUM of Max Life Insurance? Also, how do you see the growth going ahead?
Our March 2018 assets under management (AUM) were ₹52,683 crore, a growth of 19% over the previous year. Five years ago, we were at ₹20,434 crore, so we have grown at about 21% compounded over five years.
What has been the trend of your stock market investments?
We have seen good growth in our equity exposures. In the ULIP funds, the exposure is as per the fund benchmark allocation and the inflows are invested accordingly. In our traditional funds, we have increased exposure in the past five years. Overall, our equity assets have doubled in the past five years.
SEBI has reduced the individual anchor allocation size in SME IPOs to ₹2 crore from the earlier ₹10 crore. Do you think this will lead to insurance companies also looking at investing in the SME segment?
Given the size of the corpus of the larger companies like ourselves, it is unlikely that there would be a significant allocation to micro-cap stocks. We have been reducing our mid and small-cap exposure over the past year.

Modi urges AIIB to boost lending 10-fold to $40 bn ","Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday urged the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) to boost lending tenfold to $40 billion by 2020, and to $100 billion by 2025, in order to speed up infrastructure financing across the region.
Addressing the third annual meeting of the China-backed multilateral lender, Mr. Modi sought to woo investors by highlighting India’s economic progress and policy environment.
“India is one of the most investor-friendly economies in the world,” Mr. Modi said. “Investors look for growth and macroeconomic stability. They want political stability and a supportive regulatory framework to ensure protection of their investment.” He cited a recent sovereign ratings upgrade as reflective of the country’s strong economic fundamentals. “India has emerged as a bright spot in the global economy which is driving global growth as well,” he said. “We have liberalised the FDI regime. Today, most sectors are on automatic approval route.” He said the size and growth of the Indian market holds much potential and that the country’s per capita income had doubled in the last decade.
‘Economies of scale’
“The size and scale of requirement in India gives the added advantage of economies of scale for investors,” Mr. Modi said.
The AIIB started operations in January 2016 and has so far approved 25 projects in a dozen countries with a total financing of more than $4 billion, which Mr. Modi described as a ‘good beginning.’

NCLT orders liquidation of EPC firm Jyoti Structures ","The National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) on Wednesday rejected a resolution plan for Jyoti Structures and directed the resolution professional to file applications for liquidation.
Jyoti Structures, an engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) firm, is set to become the first out of the list of 12 companies that was handed to banks by the Reserve Bank of India for resolution to be headed for liquidation.
According to bankers, the EPC firm had a debt of more than ₹7,500 crore and more than a 80% haircut was proposed. State Bank of India, ICICI Bank, Bank of India, IDBI Bank were some of the lenders.
The detailed order from NCLT on the issue would come out on Friday which would throw light on the reasons behind the rejection of the resolution plan. The revival plan was submitted by a group of high networth individuals (HNI) led by Sharad Sanghi.
Jyoti Structures may challenge the decision at the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT).
On June 13, 2017, RBI had recommended the banks to take 12 defaulting borrowers, each with an exposure of ₹5,000 crore or more, for insolvency proceedings. These accounts contributed 25% of the total gross non-performing assets of the banking system.
Some of the other borrowers in that list of 12 accounts include Bhushan Steel, Essar Steel, Lanco Infra, Bhushan Steel and Power, Alok Industries, Electrosteel Steel and Amket Auto among others.

SEBI’s MF reclassification hits small cap universe "," The capital markets regulator’s decision last year to reclassify mutual fund schemes to help bring uniformity in investment strategy and asset allocation seems to have made the small cap universe a big casualty, with a bulk of the mutual fund flows going into large and mid caps.
An analysis by domestic brokerage Prabhudas Lilladher has found that between January and June, when mutual fund houses churned their portfolios to comply with the new regulatory guidelines, mid cap and large cap stocks witnessed net buying of ₹14,500 crore and ₹21,900 crore, respectively. The same period saw net buying of a paltry ₹22 crore in small cap stocks.
This assumes significance as the period prior to the churn saw net inflows of ₹5,650 crore in small cap stocks, while large and mid caps reported net inflows of ₹8,170 crore and ₹14,320 crore, respectively.
“Our analysis indicates that small caps bore the brunt almost entirely due to the SEBI circular on mutual fund reclassifications while for mid caps, the subsequent changes to Nifty Midcap index apart from the SEBI circular caused a vast rotation between stocks,” the brokerage said.
Money flows
“Money flows continued into mid caps, while small caps were abandoned and within mid caps, the index exclusions were sold into while the new incoming ones/ones in status quo were bought into substantially,” it added. While SEBI issued the MF reclassification circular on October 6, 2017, the NSE issued a circular on index replacement on February 21, to become effective from April 2. The NSE move led to 46 stocks being replaced in the Nifty Midcap 100 index.
Interestingly, this also explains the rally this year with benchmarks touching new highs even as broader indices are way off their highs touched in January. While the benchmark Sensex has gained more than 12% in the current calendar year, the BSE Midcap and BSE Smallcap indices are down 7.10% and 11.80% respectively.

Panel to review third party motor cover costs
"," Insurance regulator IRDAI has constituted a 16-member committee to examine motor third party insurance pricing aspects and make recommendations on the premium rates for 2019-20.
This is for the first time the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India has formed such a committee, an official familiar with the development said. Apart from examining the third party cover pricing aspects, including data related ones, the committee has been tasked to revisit the classification of vehicles, in view of the development in the industry. Its term will be till December 31, IRDAI said in an order constituting the committee, recently.
The composition of the committee, with IRDAI Member - Non Life P.J. Joseph as chairman, is diverse from a stakeholder perspective. Besides two others from the authority, the panel will have a senior official each from the Centre’s Department of Financial Services as well as the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways as members.
Five of the members have been drawn from general insurance companies.
Figuring in the committee, on behalf of users, are All India Motor Transport Congress president S.K. Mittal (as main member) and AIMTC vice president Mukesh Dave (as alternate member), additional secretary of Bus Operators Confederation of India D.R. Dharmaraj Bala, and president of the Federation of India Automobile Associations Nitin G. Dossa.
Others on the committee are Chief Operating officer of ‘Consumer Voice’ S.P. Chakraborty, Head-Technical of General Insurance Council Arvind Shenoy and Motor Vertical In-charge of Insurance Information Bureau of India (IIBI) Jacob Thomas.
The regulator’s decision to form the committee comes in the backdrop of a cargo transporters strike to highlight various demands, one of which is for a roll-back in the third party premium hike. As per the new rates notified by IRDAI in March for 2018-19, the increase in the premium has been over 25% for certain category of goods carrying public carriers (other than three wheelers).
IRDAI, however, was unlikely to discontinue the existing practice of arriving at the premium rates based on data provided by the IIBI and those pertaining to the claims paid and gross written premiums. The committee’s recommendations, sources said, was expected to provide newer insights while deciding on the premium rates.
On classification of vehicles as a terms of reference, sources said the committee would look at the categorisation of cargo vehicles, in terms of their GVW rating, to explore the possibility of merging certain categories.

Marriott to bring two more brands to India
","Marriott International Inc., which has 30 brands under its banner, is planning to bring two more brands to India soon, said a senior executive of the hospitality major.
“Today, we are unveiling the 105th property of Marriott (Sheraton Grand Chennai Resort and Spa) on the East Coast Road,” said Shibil Malik, general manager, Sheraton Grand Chennai Resort and Spa. “Very soon, we will be unveiling Tribute brand in Kochi.”
The 125-room Sheraton Grand Chennai Resort near Mamallapuram is the maiden venture of Marriott in the premier resort (beach) sector. It is developed by city-based realtor Amarnath Reddy, who has been named the MD of this venture. 
“We have invested close to ₹200 crore for developing this property, including land. The project has been funded mostly through internal accruals and debt,” he said.
Mr. Reddy is also planning to set up either a four-star hotel on ECR or a boutique hotel in Chennai city. This would entail an investment of ₹120 crore. Details about the location and number of rooms would be finalised soon, he said.
“This is the sixth Sheraton hotel in India and the first in resort space. We are promoting it as a destination within destination. The room tariffs are priced 15% to 20% higher than the existing hotels on the East Coast Road and some days it might be on the lower side. There are 750 hotels in this corridor. We are not competing with others as this corridor has space for more hotels,” said Mr. Malik.

Amazon keen on getting digital content right
","A year into its India journey, global e-commerce retailer and e-reading device maker, Amazon, says that getting publishers to work seriously on India-specific pricing and working with them to get more content digitised is on the company’s “shortest current list of priorities”.
While at present the company appears to be more focussed on its growing e-commerce marketplace in India, Amazon’s top executives told The Hindu that the company’s vision for India includes being able to make deeper inroads into the content business, including the vital education sector.
Grandinetti Russell, Vice President, Kindle Content, said that though it’s early days for the company in India, the short-term plan is focussed on getting the English language digital content game right and in the long-term being able to get books in as many regional Indian languages as possible on the platform. “Even in the English language, we still have a long way to go to bring all the local titles that should be there, and in getting more books digitised. The second is, of course, to make books available at prices that are a good balance between consumer interest and business outcome. Getting publishers to be thoughtful about their pricing in India is on our shortest list of priorities today,” he said, alluding to alternate business models that will be required to be able to facilitate lower pricing for the Indian market.
In terms of content, Amazon has its eyes set on the vast untapped potential offered by the education sector in India. While the company does not yet have a concrete roadmap on this, Mr. Russel said that the education sector offered an interesting opportunity, with professional education such as scientific, law, engineering and medical being potential focus areas within this. “We hope over time to find the right partners in India, and elsewhere to be able to explore this further. There are a few challenges as the content can be complex, but we see it as an important sector.”
He compared what could be done in India to what the company has been able to do with the Ministry of Education in Brazil, where it has used its enterprise education technology Whispercast to deliver textbooks to students and teachers across Brazil. “This could be done in India, and there is vast potential. The solution works on hardware that isn’t ours and so can be widely deployed.”
India is one of the 11 new geographies, apart from the U.S. and the U.K., which the company has expanded into since 2011. While the company does not disclose sales figures for the country, device sales have been steadily picking pace with Amazon selling Kindle e-readers and tablets here. Amazon’s most recent foray into the hardware segment, the digital media-streaming device Fire TV, is yet to release in India.
Amazon remained non-committal on a date for an India release, as executives across the board maintained silence on the much in-the-news plans to unveil a new Amazon smartphone.

Sensex falls for fifth day in a volatile trade
","In a volatile trade, the BSE benchmark index Sensex surrendered its initial gains to close marginally down by 13.91 points due to profit booking mainly in RIL, Larsen & Toubro and auto stocks on Friday, extending losses for the fifth straight day.
The 30-share index had recovered by over 157 points at the outset and touched a high of 22,575.62 points. Later, it succumbed to profit-booking to settle 13.91 points lower, or 0.06 per cent, at 22,403.89 points.
The 50-share Nifty of the National Stock Exchange fell 1.60 points, or 0.02 per cent, to end at 6,694.80 after touching the day’s high of 6,737.65 points.
“Profit-booking and cautious approach ahead of Lok Sabha election results are evident in the market,” Nidhi Saraswat, Senior Research Analyst, Bonanza Portfolio Ltd.
“Almost flat growth in manufacturing PMI in April, as against previous month, also weakened market sentiment,” Saraswat added.
Foreign funds were seen trimming their portfolios by booking profits at every rise, brokers said, adding that a subdued opening in the European markets also influenced the sentiment.
Maruti Suzuki and Mahindra & Mahindra fell by up to 1.69 per cent at close on poor April sales numbers.
RIL declined by close to 1 per cent while Larsen & Toubro dropped the most by 2.50 per cent among Sensex scrips. Tata Steel too faced selling pressure and lost 2.46 per cent.
Bucking the trend, IT stocks led by Infosys, Tata Consultancy Services and Wipro met with value buying and closed with sizeable gains, avoiding any major fall in the Sensex.
In 30-share Sensex, 16 stocks ended in negative zone while 14 settled higher.
The capital goods sector index suffered the most by losing 1.78 per cent to 11,902.84 followed by metal index by 1.41 per cent to 9,840.32. Banking index closed 0.11 per cent lower at 14,690.50.

Further, we have been promising our shareholders to improve the return on equity and networth to a certain extent. So, keeping all these points and that fact that we have a robust balance sheets, backlog and future earnings as we see it, the idea was, why not return some of the money to shareholders to whom it actually belongs,” he added. That was the principal rationale for the buyback. It’s a statement of how we believe the future is,” he added.

Argentina’s road to economic normality hits more zigzags ","Sigmund Freud wrote of transforming pathology into common unhappiness. Since 2015 President Mauricio Macri has been trying something similar with the Argentine economy. It’s an uncomfortable zigzag ride.
The country’s peso currency fell more than 6% against the dollar on Thursday, leading to the departure of the central bank chief. Federico Sturzenegger will be replaced by Luis Caputo, previously finance minister and an ex-JPMorgan banker. 
The shake-up, together with a larger-than-expected $50 billion assistance package from the International Monetary Fund announced last week, should help stabilize the roughly $500 billion economy, though the peso sold off further after an initial rebound on Friday.
Mr. Macri cant hark back forever to the mess he inherited from his predecessor Cristina Fernandez, a spendthrift populist enamoured of statist policies, and her late husband Nestor Kirchner. But it was a big one, all the same. The Peronist pair left Argentina a pariah in international credit markets and freighted public finances with subsidies and social spending that were unsustainable, however desirable.
Mr. Macri has ground through two-and-a-half years of gradual adjustment, trying to balance the pain of cuts against the prospects of renewed growth. Still-fragile results were appearing until Argentina was sideswiped in recent weeks by a downturn in investor sentiment toward emerging markets.
It’s worth keeping faith. The first tranche of the IMF help, called upon by Mr. Macri as prevention for trouble more than treatment, should arrive next week. Argentina may keep part of the rest in reserve as a defensive bulwark. Shrinking the fiscal deficit, as required by the IMF, looks feasible. The terms of the agreement still rightly allow for protecting the most vulnerable in society.
If Mr. Macri and his team can make enough progress to win a second term in 2019 — and he’d be the first non-Peronist since the 1983 restoration of democracy even to finish his first — he’d have a chance of establishing a welcome new normal.

RCom bondholders to get up to $118 mn in cash, $55 mn bonds
","Reliance Communications (RCom) on Friday secured the approval of its overseas bondholders to ease the company’s debt burden, a move that will help the debt-laden firm avert bankruptcy.
“RCom bondholders approved the tender and exchange offer of $300 million bonds with an overwhelming majority of over 83%, at their meeting held today, 24 August 2018, in London,” said the company in a statement adding that pursuant to the offer as approved, the bondholders will receive cash proceeds of up to $118 million. The bondholders would also get $55 million bonds to be issued by Global Cloud Xchange Limited, a foreign subsidiary of RCom, according to the statement.
RCom had defaulted on $300 million bonds last year and the vote was crucial for the telecom major as settling the matter was a precondition for RCom to reorganise its larger local debt of more than ₹42,000 crore.
In February, the Reserve Bank of India mandated banks to identify projects with even a day’s default as stressed assets and conclude the resolution proceedings in 180 days. The circular came into effect on March 1 and the 180-day deadline concludes on August 27.
RCom has to reach an agreement with all its creditors by August 27 or face insolvency proceedings.

Wilful bank loan default crosses Rs.70,000 cr
","The wilful bank loan default by 400 customers to various public sector banks have crossed the Rs.70,000-crore mark.
Having released the names of top 50 wilful defaulters in December 2013, the All India Bank Employees’ Association (AIBEA) will publish the second list of remaining 350 candidates on Tuesday.
The first set of 50 defaulters, consisting of a sitting Member of Parliament, a Central Minister and two Padma Shri awardees, collectively owe over Rs.40,000 crore to nationalised banks and the remaining 350 defaulters account for Rs.30,000 crore. In the last five years (March 2008-13), banks’ bad loans have risen by four-fold from Rs.39,000 crore to Rs.1,64,000 crore, and in the six-month period up to September 2013, it bloated by Rs.72,000 crore. At present, bad loans in top 30 accounts in 24 banks stand at Rs.70,300 crore.
Besides releasing the defaulters’ names, AIBEA had sought the permission of the Chief Election Commissioner to debar and disqualify them from contesting the Lok Sabha polls and to declare wilful default as criminal offence.
Talking to The Hindu, AIBEA general secretary C. H. Venkatachalam said: “The CEC did not take any steps to debar the wilful defaulters. We are releasing the list to enable the public to know how many of them have contested the polls and whether they should be allowed to assume office.”
According AIBEA, the top 12 defaulters owe more than Rs.20,000 crore with Kingfisher Airlines leading the pack. Punjab National Bank is the worst sufferer followed by Central Bank of India.

Dr.Reddy’s to sell generic version of opioid addiction treatment Suboxone in U.S. ","Shares of Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories (DRL) surged on Friday after the company said it planned to start selling in the U.S. a generic version of British drugmaker Indivior Plc’s Suboxone (buprenorphine and naloxone) sublingual film used in the treatment of opioid dependence.
The Hyderabad-based firm said it had received approval from the U.S. FDA for buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual film, 2 mg/0.5 mg, 4 mg/1 mg, 8 mg/2 mg, and 12 mg/3 mg and would be introducing the product in the U.S. with an approved risk evaluation and mitigation strategy programme.
DRL climbed 3.65% on the BSE to ₹2,351.10, the stock’s highest close in more than four months. Indivior plunged by more than 20% in London after the USFDA approved the first generic versions of Suboxone Film, an opioid addiction treatment that generates 80% of the company’s revenue.
White House economists said in a report in November that opioid drug abuse, which has ravaged parts of the U.S. in the recent years, cost the economy as much as $504 billion, or 2.8% of the GDP, in 2015.
‘Critical time’
Suboxone had sales of about $1.86 billion in the U.S. for the 12 months ended April 2018, DRL said, citing IMS Health.
“With opioid addiction becoming increasingly prevalent in America, the full approval and launch of our generic equivalent of Suboxone could not have come at a more critical time to help patients,” DRL’s CEO (Developed Markets) Alok Sonig said in the statement.
Shares in Indivior, which was spun out from Reckitt Benckiser in 2014, were down 22.7% at 0925 GMT and the biggest loser on the FTSE midcap index.
Mylan NV also received approval to market the substitute drug.
One analyst said the at-risk sudden introduction was a surprise and could threaten Indivior’s 2018 guidance.
Indivior could seek an injunction to try to halt a launch of the generics or launch its own authorised generic, analysts at Jefferies wrote in a note.
“If Indivior was to prevail in any of its on-going legal challenges then Dr. Reddy’s would be liable for damages,” Jefferies said, estimating that Indivior’s 2018 earnings per share could be hit by as much as 50%t if Dr. Reddy’s has sufficient inventory and launches by July 1.

Orient Refractories to merge RHI India and RHI Clasil with itself
","RHI Magnesita, a leading global supplier of refractory products, systems and services based in the U.K., has decided to consolidate its Indian operations under Orient Refractories Limited, as it sees significant growth potential for its refractory products and services in India.
The board of Orient Refractories, RHI India Private Limited (RHI India) and RHI Clasil Private Limited (RHI Clasil), at their respective meetings, approved the proposal to merge RHI India and RHI Clasil with Orient Refractories, making it a leading manufacturer and supplier of refractories with operating revenues of ₹1,235 crore, two production facilities, and more than 700 employees.
Following completion of the merger and subject to receipt of necessary approvals, Orient Refractories will be renamed to RHI Magnesita India Limited, which will combine the strengths and competencies of all three operating companies in India under one strong listed company that is well positioned to leverage future growth opportunities and enhance shareholder value, the company said in a statement.
RHI Magnesita owns 69.6% in Indian listed Orient Refractories, a leading manufacturer and supplier of special refractory products, systems and services for the steel industry. RHI India, a wholly owned subsidiary of RHI Magnesita, is the Indian sales company offering a full range of refractories and related services sourced from various RHI Magnesita group entities to Indian customers. RHI Magnesita owns 53.7% in RHI Clasil, a manufacturer and supplier of mainly alumina based refractories for the steel and cement industries.
Commenting on the merger, Mr. Parmod Sagar, MD & CEO, Orient Refractories, said “The merger will strengthen our position, significantly expand our product offerings and sales platform to access a much larger client base and allow for a pooling of resources and know-how. We believe that this will act as a strong platform from which we can embark on the next phase of our growth and unlock significant value for the shareholders.” 
As consideration for the merger, fresh equity shares of Orient Refractories will be issued to the shareholders of RHI India and RHI Clasil, thus increasing the the equity shares of Orient Refractories from 120.1 million to about 161 million. About 7,044 equity shares of Orient Refractories (of face value of ₹1 each) will be issued for every 100 equity shares of RHI India (of face value of ₹10 each).
Similarly, 908 equity shares of Orient Refractories (of face value of ₹1 each) will be issued for every 1,000 equity shares of RHI Clasil (of face value of ₹10 each). Post merger, the shareholding of RHI Magnesita, through Dutch US Holding B.V. and other group companies, in the combined company is likely to be around 70%. Furthermore, around 5% of the shareholding will be held by certain individual shareholders of RHI Clasil who are not part of the RHI Magnesita group, said the statement. 
Shares of Orient Refractories rose 0.75% to close at ₹209.15 in a firm Mumbai market on Tuesday, valuing the company at ₹2,512 crore.

Smartphones lift Xiaomi revenue by 68% ","Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi Inc. reported second-quarter revenue surged 68%, as strong smartphone sales complemented a jump in revenue at its smaller, but fast-growing connected devices business.
Xiaomi, whose cheap smartphones have become very popular in price-conscious countries such as India, said on Wednesday its revenue from overseas markets more than doubled from the year-earlier period.
This is the first set of results released by Xiaomi since it raised $4.72 billion in a high-profile IPO in June, valuing the firm at about $54 billion, almost half of industry’s earlier estimates of $100 billion. The going has not been smooth for Xiaomi as a listed company, however. Its Hong Kong-listed shares have slumped by about a fifth from their peak a month ago on concerns about Xiaomi’s valuation and trading accessibility for mainland Chinese investors.
The results are likely to assuage concerns about the company’s operations.
Revenue for the three months ended June 30 rose to 45.2 billion yuan ($6.58 billion) from 26.9 billion yuan, the company said in a statement. It posted a net profit of 14.63 billion yuan compared to a net loss of 11.97 billion yuan in the year-earlier period.
International revenue was 16.4 billion yuan, accounting for 36.3% of total revenue. Sales of Internet-connected devices, including smart TVs, also grew rapidly.
With its eyes on the premium smartphone market in India, Xiaomi unveiled sub-brand Poco that will compete with high-end devices from the stables of OnePlus, Apple and Samsung.
Poco — which introduced its maiden smartphone ‘F1’ priced at ₹20,999 onwards — will use the manufacturing and supply chain as well as the after-sales network of the Chinese parent.

Centre moots overseas UDAN ","State governments will be able to encourage tourism on preferred international air routes by offering subsidy to domestic airlines for a period of three years. The Ministry of Civil Aviation has prepared a draft scheme document for “UDAN International” and invited comments from stakeholders till September 4.
The scheme is designed for State governments that are keen to promote air connectivity on international routes identified by them and for which they are willing to provide subsidy to airlines. 
As per the draft, a State will identify international routes for which the Airports Authority of India (AAI) will determine a subsidy amount per seat and invite bids from domestic carriers. This will be followed by airlines submitting their proposals, which will include the routes they wish to connect as well as the subsidy needed by them.
The airlines will bid on the percentage of flight capacity for which they require financial assistance, provided that the figure doesn’t exceed 60% of the flight capacity. The entity that quotes the lowest amount will be awarded subsidy for a particular route. 
However, the government will grant financial aid only for the actual number of passenger seats that are unsold, even if the airline had sought subsidy for a higher percentage of seating capacity at the time of bidding.
No cap on fares
An airline that is awarded a particular route will have exclusive rights to a subsidy on that route for a period of three years. The key difference between this scheme and the regional connectivity scheme (RCS) for domestic routes is that there is no capping of fares. Under RCS, fares are capped at ₹2,500 for one hour of flight on a fixed wing aircraft in order to make air travel affordable, which was why the scheme was called Ude Desh Ka Aam Nagrik (UDAN).
“When we look at international connectivity, we are looking at people with disposable incomes looking to undertake air travel for the purpose of tourism,” a source said, explaining the rationale behind not capping fares. The financial assistance to an airline will be offered from the International Air Connectivity Fund (IACF), which will be created through the contributions made by the State government.
The scheme is meant for domestic airlines. Only fixed wing aircraft with more than 70 seats can be operated under the scheme and airlines will have to conduct a minimum of three and a maximum of seven departures on a given route on three days in a week.
The Centre has allowed airlines to enter into a code-sharing arrangement with international and domestic airlines for UDAN international. The AAI may also offer additional discounts at its own discretion such as landing, parking and housing charges at airports owned by it.
So far, Assam has proposed to offer ₹100 crore per year for flights to Kathmandu, Dhaka, Singapore, Bangkok, Kuala Lumpur and Yangon. Andhra Pradesh has also expressed its keenness to the Civil Aviation Ministry to encourage tourism. 
At present, the low-cost carrier AirAsia operates daily flights to Kuala Lumpur from Bhubaneshwar with a subsidy from the State government on a per-flight basis.

RBI blames PNB board for fraud
","Blaming the board of directors of the Punjab National Bank for the embezzlement of over ₹13,000 crore by jeweller Nirav Modi and his uncle Mehul Choksi, the Reserve Bank of India on Tuesday, in a written reply to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Finance, said all “three lines of defence” built in the banking system failed in this case.
RBI Governor Urjit Patel deposed in front of the panel, headed by Congress leader Veerappa Moily. The Hindu has reviewed the two documents submitted by the RBI to the panel.
The central bank said all financial institutions were adequately warned about dealing with Letters of Undertaking (LoUs), the primary tool of embezzlement by Nirav Modi. The RBI said it was the primary responsibility of the PNB board to understand the risks in issue of LoUs without collateral and to manage them through controls. It said each bank should have three lines of defence: first, the officer sanctioning the loan; second, at the managerial level; and third, the internal audit. “In the case of PNB, there seems to have been failure of all the three lines of defence.”
The RBI told the panel that its supervisory process does not constitute an audit of banks.
“With the number of commercial bank branches being more than 1,16,000 in the country it would be impossible to cover each and every branch under the RBI’s supervisory process,” the central bank said.
It also accused PNB of submitting a factually incorrect compliance report with regard to LoUs.
In its reply to the panel’s questionnaire, the RBI complained that it does not have regulatory powers over public sector banks (PSBs) which have the greater share of non-performing assets.
As on December 31 last year PSBs had NPAs worth ₹7,77,280 crore while the private sector banks had NPAs worth ₹1,07,796 crore.
The RBI said the main constraint was that public sector banks are “corporations” and not a “banking company” — so they do not come directly under the ambit of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949.
The central bank has asked for nine additional powers with regard to the public sector banks including the ability to “remove the Chairman and Managing Director and appoint them.” It also wants powers to grant and impose conditions on licences.
The RBI wants a say in appointment of managerial positions, including the power to supersede the Board of Directors and make application for winding up the errant banks.
Parliamentarians questioned Mr. Patel on the recent reports of ATMs running low on cash and the big question of exactly how much currency returned to the banking system after demonetisation. “Mr. Patel was not exactly forthcoming. He did not answer many of these questions. He insisted that steps taken to bring down the non- performing assets are bearing fruit and the NPAs are going down,” a senior Opposition MP who attended the meeting said.

Atul Gawande to lead health firm jointly formed by Amazon, Buffett, JPMorgan
"," Three corporate giants seeking to attack rising health care costs have turned to a Harvard professor who has written books about the system’s many flaws. 
Amazon, JPMorgan Chase and Berkshire Hathaway have named Dr. Atul Gawande CEO of a venture the companies announced earlier this year- an independent company focused on improving the care delivered to their employees while doing a better job of managing the expense. 
Berkshire Chairman and CEO Warren Buffett has described health costs as a “hungry tapeworm on the American economy.” And the leaders of the three companies see a lot they want to fix, even though they have said little yet about how that will be done. 
“We said at the outset that the degree of difficulty is high and success is going to require an expert’s knowledge, a beginner’s mind, and a long-term orientation,” Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos said in a statement Wednesday. “(Gawande) embodies all three, and we’re starting strong as we move forward in this challenging and worthwhile endeavor.” 
JPMorgan Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon outlined several priorities for the new venture in an April letter to shareholders. He said it will look for ways to help employees make better choices for their care and give them the best options available. It will develop better wellness programs, particularly focused on obesity and smoking, which account for chronic diseases like cancer, heart disease and depression. 
Mr. Dimon said the new company also will study why some costly and specialized medicines are often over- or under-utilized and the “extraordinary” amount of money spent on often unwanted care at the end of a patient’s life.
Mr. Gawande wrote a 2014 book, “Being Mortal,” that focused on aging and death. In it, he noted that people “live longer and better than at any time in history.” 
“But scientific advances have turned the process of aging and dying into medical experiences, matters to be managed by health care professionals,” he wrote. “And we in the medical world have proved alarmingly unprepared for it.”
Mr. Gawande is surgeon at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and a professor at both Harvard’s medical school and its school of public health. He said in a statement Wednesday that he has devoted his career in public health to building solutions for better care delivery, and that while the current system is broken, “better is possible.” 
Employer-sponsored insurance covers about 157 million people, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. That’s nearly half the total U.S. population and the biggest slice of the country’s patchwork health insurance market. 
Neither the companies that offer health coverage nor many of the employees that use it are happy with how the system currently works. Rising costs have pushed employers to hike deductibles and other costs for their workers. Companies are asking them to pay more of their care bills and to shop around for better deals. Many patients, especially the sickest, struggle with that. 
Amazon, JPMorgan and Berkshire said in late January that the initial focus of their new company will be on technology that provides simplified, high-quality and transparent care “at a reasonable cost.” 
Amazon’s participation and customer-first focus will be crucial, according to Brian Marcotte, CEO of the National Business Group on Health, a nonprofit that represents large employers. 
That could change if they go through a well-known platform like Amazon, which could then reach into its vast trove of customer data to personalize the shopping, Marcotte said. If, for instance, you are a runner considering knee surgery, Amazon could lay out the best or common practices for your condition and maybe show that surgery isn’t your only option. 
“It’s not only reaching people in the moment, it’s the possibility to reach people with relevant personalized messaging that will engage them,” Marcotte said. 
Mr. Gawande starts his new role July 9. His company will be based in Boston.

Finmin to PSB CEOs: check NPA frauds or face action ","In a stern warning to bankers, the finance ministry has asked chief executives of public sector banks (PSBs) to check all NPA accounts exceeding ₹50 crore for fraud, else face criminal conspiracy charges, according to official sources.
This missive comes in the light of arrest of Bhushan Steel’s erstwhile promoter Neeraj Singal by the Serious Fraud Investigation Office (SFIO) for allegedly siphoning of funds.
The sources said that bankers could be held accountable under Section 120B of Indian Penal Code if they fail to report fraud in an account which is later unearthed by investigating agencies, sources said.
If the investigating agencies find diversion of funds in those defaulting accounts, bankers may be liable to face criminal proceedings, the sources said, adding that this advisory is like an extra precaution to keep bankers from getting into legal tangles.
More than a dozen companies undergoing bankruptcy resolution are being reviewed by banks and investigating agencies for fraudulent activities, including diversion of funds.
Indian banks are facing mounting non-performing assets (NPAs) or bad loans, especially at PSBs, which have reached more than ₹8 lakh crore. In addition, several banking frauds have been unearthed, including the ₹14,000-crore scam at PNB, carried out allegedly by diamond jeweller Nirav Modi and his associates.
A senior government official confirmed the development and said that some discrepancies had been pointed out in the case of a steel-maker and a real estate firm among 10-12 companies.
“There were some inputs and lenders who have been asked to provide transaction details of last five years. If required, banks will also undertake forensic audit,” he said. Earlier this month, the SFIO arrested Mr. Singal for alleged diversion of ₹2,000 crore, raised through loans from state-owned banks.
“Similar modus operandi has been used by other promoters also,” said another government official, adding that there had been Intelligence inputs on associate companies being used for similar transactions.
SFIO is also looking into the books of companies which are currently undergoing debt resolution, he said, adding that this had been done on the basis of specific inputs provided by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs. During the resolution process, the extensive audit of bankrupt companies has thrown up financial irregularities in several cases.
In June 2017, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had identified 12 stressed accounts, each having more than ₹5,000 crore of outstanding loans and accounting for 25% of the total non-performing assets (NPAs) of banks for immediate referral under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC). In August, RBI had sent a list of 28 more firms to lenders for resolution by December 2017. “These accounts also have some firms from the second list and those where later banks filed cases in NCLT (National Company Law Tribunal),” said a bank executive aware of the developments.
The NCLT benches handle banks’ bad debt resolution under Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC).
Banks have to undertake a two-year transaction audit when they start the resolution process through IBC. In case there are any issues or specific information, banks also conduct a forensic audit.
In August 2017, the SFIO was given powers to arrest people for company law violations. SFIO is a multidisciplinary organisation having experts for prosecution of white-collar crimes and frauds under the company law.

Google unveils AI chips ","Google is going beyond building artificial intelligence (AI) chips for its data centres.
At the Google Cloud Next ’18 conference in San Francisco, the Internet giant announced two new products aimed at helping customers develop and deploy intelligent connected devices at scale. The first one was ‘Edge TPU,’ a new hardware chip, so small that four of them can fit on a U.S penny, Injong Rhee, VP, IoT, Google Cloud, demonstrated on the stage.
“Edge TPU would bring the brain to your devices... at extremely low cost and high power efficiency without compromising performance,” said Mr. Rhee.“I believe this is a game changer.”
Edge TPU is Google’s purpose-built application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) designed to run AI at the edge.
It delivers high performance in a small physical and power footprint, enabling the deployment of high-accuracy AI at the edge, according to the company.
The other product announced was ‘Cloud IoT Edge,’ a software stack that extends Google Cloud’s powerful AI capability to gateways and connected devices.
One of the companies using these new technologies is LG CNS, a subsidiary of LG. Shingyoon Hyun, the CTO of LG CNS, said with intelligent vision inspection, the company is eager to make a better working place, raise the quality of the product and save millions of dollars each year.
“Google Cloud AI and IoT technologies with LG CNS expertise make this possible,” said Mr. Hyun.
In May this year, Google’s rival Microsoft announced the preview introduction of its Project Brainwave, a system which has specialised chips to run AI models, on its cloud computing platform Azure.
Mr. Rhee of Google said ‘‘Cloud IoT Edge, Edge TPU and Cloud IoT Core’ are opening up completely new possibilities with the Internet of Things (IoT) — a technology where devices communicate with each other intelligently.
He said with powerful data processing and machine learning capabilities at the edge, devices such as robotic arms, wind turbines and smart cars can now act on the data from their sensors in real time and predict outcomes locally.
Also, automotive companies can increase safety through intelligent technologies like collision avoidance, traffic routing, and eyes-off-the-road detection systems, said Mr.Rhee. Research firm IDC estimates that the total amount of data generated from connected devices will exceed 40 trillion gigabytes by 2025.
Google also announced that it is making the new Gmail generally available to the customers of G Suite, the company ’s package of workplace productivity tools. It said more companies can take advantage of features like redesigned security warnings, snooze and offline access.
Mountain View, California-based Google said that it is using machine learning to analyse threat indicators across billions of messages in Gmail to help quickly identify potential security attacks in the making. ML helps protect more than 1.4 billion active Gmail user accounts “from nearly 10 million spam and malicious emails every minute,” said Garrick Toubassi, vice president of engineering, G Suite.
Google also announced a new Cloud Search functionality to help companies intelligently and securely index their third-party data beyond G Suite, whether that data is stored in the cloud, or on-premise.
Companies, like Whirlpool Corporation, have started deploying Cloud Search’s new capabilities to unify search across multiple data sources. It has created a custom app that indexes more than 12 million documents across different on-premise and cloud systems and returns results in “100s of milliseconds on average,” said Mr. Toubassi.
Titan Security Key
Google also announced a product called ‘Titan Security Key’ to protect its customers from phishing attacks. Jennifer Lin, product management director, Google Cloud said the company has long advocated the use of security keys as the strongest, most phishing-resistant authentication factor for high-value users, especially cloud admins, to protect against the potentially damaging consequences of credential theft. Titan Security Keys are available now to Google Cloud customers and will be available for anyone to purchase on the Google Store soon.

Grab for the locks
"," Greek mythology has a character named Caerus. He is the youngest son of Zeus, and is the personification of things like opportunity and luck. Caerus, also known as Kairos, is usually depicted being on tiptoes, with wings on his feet. This is to indicate how fleeting and ephemeral opportunity usually is. Caerus is also depicted with a very unusual hairstyle. Think of it as a radically reversed version of a mullet, a hairstyle famously described as “business at the front, party at the back”. 
Caerus had hair on his forehead, the sort that covers his face, not allowing people to recognise him easily, but was bald at the back. The moral was clear. If you had to prosper, you had to grab opportunity by the forelock, for once it fleet-footedly goes past you, there will be nothing for you to grab it by. 
As with anything else where luck can play a significant part, being successful at starting up is of course much like trying to grab Caerus by his forelock. But the real fun in entrepreneurship lies in two things. One, how do you recognise Caerus despite all that hair obscuring his face? And two, how do you still grab Caerus if you miss grabbing him by the forelocks?
There is a flaw in this otherwise excellent parable of Caerus’ hairstyle. It assumes that the only way to recognise Caerus is by sight. It is not all that horrible an assumption, given how most people depend on sight for recognition. But those who wish to start up, should know that their best chance lies in recognising Caerus even with his face covered. They should be able to smell him coming. Or know the sounds of his footsteps, as slight as they may be, so well, that they hear him coming. 
If you are an entrepreneur in food-tech, possibly even know what Caerus tastes like. And there is only one way this can happen. A lot of observation, and then importantly, letting all that observation inform your intuition. So if you plan to start up, once you have figured out the field of human endeavour you plan to address, just observe. A lot. Identify every player in that ecosystem. Know exactly how each of those players interact with each other. Keep looking for inefficiencies in these interactions. That is usually where Caerus is hiding, unrecognisable to an untrained eye. But you should be able to sniff him out in complete darkness even. 
Of course, more often than not, despite all this observation, Caerus being the master of camouflage that he is, you will fail to grab him, and only see his bald pate as he runs away from you. Here’s where the other skill that is very necessary for entrepreneurs comes of use. Patience. Fine, you missed him as he went past you. But the world being round, he will be back. You may miss him the second time too. But you now have new crucial information. You know the speed at which he is running. You may have to let Caerus run past you a few more times, before you are confident about his patterns. But once you are, all you have to do is to just stand in the way of opportunity, in a way that there is no way it can go past you. Grab Caerus, forelock and all, and prosper. 
That really is the true charm of startups. Unlike the rest of life, opportunity is more than just a slippery bald man who is hard to recognise.

Drop a pin
"," In 2013, Chris Sheldrick was working as a concert organiser. It was a thankless job. It mostly involved getting various concert equipment to a venue on time. On paper, this should not have been anything more than just another thankless grunt job. But there was something that made it worse. The concerts were almost always at some obscure venue, and trying to get to them based on just the address provided was the equivalent of solving a rather hard chess problem. Like white to win in two moves with just a king and two blocked pawns. Sheldrick quickly got frustrated about how horrible addresses were in the USA.
Before I tell you what Sheldrick did about his frustration, let me digress a bit, and tell you that addresses in India were even worse. For some 15 years of my childhood, for as long as I lived at 15/32, 2nd Main, Marenahalli, there was another 15/32 in Marenahalli, on another road that was also 2nd Main, and pretty much right behind our house as the crow flies, but some 500 metres if the crow decided to walk on roads. For some 15 years, the two households had to exchange snail mail every now and then, as whenever the regular postman who knew the nuance was off duty, mix-ups were bound to happen. To cut a long story short, Sheldrick’s problem was not just US-specific, but something that would find resonance the world over.
Sheldrick discussed his problem with Mohan Ganesalingam, an American resident, but his name tells you where he came from. And they came up with an idea that would elegantly solve the problem of addresses. They joined hands with two more people, Jack Waley-Cohen, and Michael Dent, and very soon what3words was born. The premise of what3words was that any geographic location on Earth could be expressed uniquely by a random combination of three words. Once that was done, all one had to do was remember three words instead of a confusing address. And this triplet of words would be linked to a lat-lon, making it easy to use any sort of a map app to guide yourself accurately to the location.
What3words may have been the first to come up with this excellent solution, but there soon were many others improving upon the idea. One such was a friend of mine, J Krishnamurthy, who, bored with being a Google employee, came up with Pyntag. It was just like the what3words idea, but instead allowed users to come up with their own unique ‘addresses’. So instead of some machine-generated TomDickHarry, you could have claimed ThejaswiUdupaHome for your residential address if you wanted to. It took a good idea and made it better. Some half a dozen others also did.
This was one of those ideas that had a lot of utility, and could even easily scale. But just because there was never really any clear way of making money off this brilliant idea, it refused to take off.

‘Untenable pricing’ sinks Bharti profit
","Bharti Airtel’s net profit dropped for the ninth consecutive quarter during April-June as pricing in the telecom industry continued to remain “untenable.” The telecom firm’s consolidated net income stood at ₹97 crore, a fall of 73% from ₹367.3 crore in the year-earlier period.
Sequentially, profits rose 17% from ₹82.9 crore in January-March quarter, which was its lowest quarterly net profit in almost 15 years.
Consolidated revenues, declined by 2.3% (on an underlying basis) to ₹20,089 crore. In a statement, the company said, India revenues for during the quarter stood at ₹14,930 crore, down 7% on an underlying basis. “Mobile segment continues to be impacted by aggressive industry pricing and has witnessed Y-o-Y de-growth of 11%.” Notably, other segments such as Digital TV and Airtel Business grew 10.6% and 11.8%, respectively. The company said mobile data traffic quadrupled to 2,151 billion MBs in the quarter as compared with 472 billion MBs in the same quarter last year.
The number of mobile broadband customers also increased by 75.2% to 85.7 million.
Gopal Vittal, MD and CEO, India & South Asia, said, “…Industry pricing continues to remain untenable. However, led by our successful bundles, content partnerships and handset upgrade programmes, our mobile data traffic surged 355% on a YoY basis.”
“Q1’19 has seen our highest quarterly capex spends of ₹7,887 crore. Our investments have led to some opex headwinds in this quarter but we remain focused on structural cost containment through our ‘War on Waste’ programme,” he added.
Talking about Africa operations, the company said in constant currency terms, revenues grew by 13.9% led by strong growth in data and Airtel money transaction value.
The company’s customer base stood at 457 million across 16 countries.

SEBI allows longer trading hours for SLB segment "," To facilitate physical settlement in equity derivatives, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has allowed stock exchanges to extend the timing of the stock lending and borrowing (SLB) segment.
Stock exchanges can set the trading hours in the SLB segment between 9am and 5pm, stated a circular issued by SEBI on Friday.
SLB segment is typically used by institutional investors to lend or borrow the shares depending on the positions taken in the derivatives segment. Globally, insurance companies and mutual funds that are typically long-term investors use the SLB segment to earn interest on their idle holding.
While the exchanges currently offer SLB segment, there is hardly any traction as the equity derivatives contracts were settled in cash.
Early this year in March, SEBI announced the introduction of physical settlement in the derivatives segment. Physical settlement refers to a mechanism wherein contracts are settled by giving or taking shares instead of cash.

Sugar export: mills get time till Dec.
","With sugar mills exporting barely a quarter of their assigned quota for the season, the Food Ministry has extended the deadline by another three months from September until the end of the year, according to an official order issued on Wednesday.
With sugar production reaching record highs and the resultant glut in sugar stocks causing a fall in prices and exacerbating the payment arrears that cash-starved mills owe cane farmers, the Centre had encouraged mills to reduce inventory by exporting their stock. In May, mill-wise Minimum Indicative Export Quotas (MIEQ) were allocated by the Food Ministry with the mills expected to export a total of 20 lakh tonnes for the season.
With the deadline to meet their export quotas due to expire at the end of September, mills have only exported about five lakh tonnes so far, according to a senior official at the Food Ministry. The Indian Sugar Mills Association estimates that only four lakh tonnes had actually been actually shipped so far.
The Food Ministry official said the deadline extension was a response to industry requests, as heavy rains had impeded the movement of sugar. With the global market demanding raw sugar, which is unavailable at this point in the season, the Ministry has also allowed mills to sell fresh raw sugar from the next season’s production that begins in October.
“The date of export of MIEQ allocated to sugar mills is extended by three months i.e. up to 31.12.2018 and the sugar mills will have option either to export sugar of 2017-18 sugar season or 2018-19 sugar season,” said the order.
ISMA general secretary Abinash Verma denied that the mills lobby group had requested the extension. He blames a retrospective government condition which meant that most mills failed to export sugar for at least two months during the peak marketing season. “The global prices were at $350 per tonne in June-July, but have fallen to $305 per tonne now,” he said. “The losses are massive.” International sugar prices are even lower than the domestic rates, he said, pointing out that mills would get ₹12-14 less for every kilogram of sugar that was exported.

ITC net rises 10% to ₹2,818.7 cr.
","Diversified conglomerate ITC Ltd. reported first-quarter profit rose 10% to ₹2,818.7 crore, helped by a sharp increase in profitability at the company’s non-cigarette fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) business.
Total revenue from operations at ₹10,874.6 crore in the April-June period was lower than ₹13,800.4 crore a year earlier. The company said that the figures were not comparable in view of the recast of indirect taxes.
While profits were driven by “robust performance across most segments, steep escalation in tax incidence under GST regime continues to weigh on FMCG-cigarettes performance,” ITC said in a statement.
The FMCG-others segment, which includes food and personal care products, witnessed an 86% jump in EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation) to ₹127.8 crore, driven by enhanced scale, enriched product-mix and improved cost management measures, it said.
Results at the hotels business improved through higher room rates and strong F&B sales. The 271-room luxury hotel ITC Kohenur, in Hyderabad, was commissioned on June 1 and had received “excellent initial response”, the company said. Construction of new hotels at Kolkata, Ahmedabad and WelcomeHotels in Guntur and Bhubaneswar was progressing.
The paperboards, paper and packaging segment saw a 15% increase in profit, driven by strategic investments in imported pulp substitution, improved pulp yield and higher realisation through better product mix.
In its agribusiness, ITC leveraged market opportunities in oil seeds, rice, spices and coffee resulting in robust business growth during the quarter to ₹3,151.3 crore, from ₹2,760.5 crore, even as the tobacco operations of the business hemmed in segment profits.

‘Weak rupee may hit CAD by 10-20 bps’
","The Centre expects minimal impact to the current account deficit of about 10-20 basis points due to the rupee depreciation and an increase in the oil import bill, a senior Finance Ministry official said.
“There are times when you have to pay more for oil and in the short term the CAD could be stressed slightly,” the official said. “But oil prices are not showing signs of any great fluctuations and so the CAD will not be as bad as forecast. It will be about a 10-20 basis point impact.”
Moody’s had earlier this week estimated that higher oil prices coupled with the rupee depreciation would widen the current account deficit to 2.5% of GDP.
“Dollar has been appreciating against all other currencies, not just the rupee,” the official added. The rupee, on the other hand, has remained stable in relation to other currencies apart from the U.S. dollar, he noted.

Gold, silver prices fall on Akshaya Tritiya day
","Contrary to the general trend witnessed on Akshaya Tritiya, prices of gold and silver plunged on Friday, an auspicious day in Hindu calendar, and jewellers said it was mainly due to external factors.
The spot price of 24 carat gold was quoting at Rs.29,970 per 10 gram in Mumbai’s Zaveri Bazaar as compared to Rs.30,150 on Thursday, down Rs.180. According to jewellers, the price of gold has fallen by nearly Rs.1,000 in the past five to six days.
Similarly, silver prices dropped by Rs.41 a kg on Akshaya Tritiya day. On Friday, silver was quoting at Rs.42,259 against Rs.42,300 a kg a day before, jewellers said.
Gold future price was also tended lower. MCX gold future price was down Rs.35 at Rs.28,545 (10 gram) while silver future was quoting at Rs.41,240 a kg, up Rs.334.
Last year, on Akshaya Tritiya day, gold price had suddenly plunged to Rs.26,825 and over 20 tonnes of gold worth Rs.600 crore was sold, said jewellers. This year, consumption can only be known on Saturday.
According to experts, internationally, gold prices are falling due to encouraging economic data emanating from the U.S. and the U.K. where fund houses and other investors are off-loading gold in huge quantity. This has affected gold prices, they said.
“Gold prices in India are determined by international trend and any festive demand in India can’t make any major difference in pricing. Currently, gold is under pressure internationally as it is no longer a safe haven investment option. Besides, the Indian rupee has appreciated against the dollar and this helped in softening of gold prices in India,” said Pramit Brahmbhatt, CEO, Veracity Financial Services that deals in bullion among others.
He said that this year the demand for gold was less in India as compared to previous years.
Anticipating this almost all leading jewellers had announced different schemes to lure gold buyers and footfalls had increased as compared to normal days, reported jewellers.
“We are having a packed day today and people are buying jewellery and coins. This year light weight jewellery is in demand and coins of 5 gram and 10 gram are being sold in large numbers. Most people had not bought gold during Dussehra, Dhanteras and Gudi Pawda and thus there was pent up demand today,” said Kumar Jain, Vice President, Mumbai Jewellers’ Association.
He said people were buying gold as the marriage season would be approaching in two months. Several jewellers were offering 5-10 per cent discounts on making charges. Reliance Jewels was offering Rs.111 discount on gold prices and a flat 15 per cent discount on diamond jewellery. There were also offers from Tanishq and Waman Hari Pethe, some of the city’s leading jewellers.

Rupee weakening not a concern, says Sanyal ","Principal Economic Adviser to the Finance Ministry Sanjeev Sanyal on Wednesday sought to allay concerns over the falling rupee against the U.S. dollar, saying India should not get too swayed by a single bilateral exchange rate.
“If you take any broad based basket, you will see that the rupee is not especially weak. We cannot get too swayed by a single bilateral exchange rate,” Mr. Sanyal said.
The falling rupee value should be seen as strengthening of the dollar rather than weakness of the rupee because the rupee has been stable over the last five years against most global currencies, Mr. Sanyal said.
“The rupee has been very stable over the last five years against most global currencies, except the dollar. Hence, we should see this as US dollar strengthening rather than rupee weakness,” he said.

Tamil Nadu and Gujarat finances: some pluses and minuses
","Tamil Nadu and Gujarat, whose models of development triggered a lively debate in the Lok Sabha election campaign, have some accomplishments in public finances, even as the former has better credentials in social and educational indicators of development.
A perusal of the report of the Reserve Bank of India, ‘State Finances: A Study of Budgets of 2013-14,’ published early this year, reveals that in the debt-Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP) ratio and the interest payments-revenue receipts ratio for the fiscal 2011-2012, Tamil Nadu was better placed than Gujarat.  
Also, be it the State’s Own Revenue (tax and non-tax) or in respect of select indicators like the development expenditure-GSDP ratio or the social sector expenditure-GSDP ratio, Tamil Nadu’s performance surpassed Gujarat’s.
The RBI report, an annual publication, presents an exhaustive account of the fiscal position of all State governments.
However, the story on public finances is not one-sided, and there are areas wherein Gujarat has scored over Tamil Nadu. For example, the former had a higher revenue surplus for 2011-2012. Compared with Tamil Nadu’s revenue surplus of around Rs. 13.6 billion, Gujarat registered Rs. 32 billion.  In respect of the fiscal deficit-GSDP ratio, Gujarat’s score was 1.8 per cent against Tamil Nadu’s 2.6 per cent. As for the profit/loss of public sector undertakings, the accumulated losses of the Tamil Nadu PSUs stood at Rs. 596 billion, whereas Gujarat’s undertakings (many of which are in the sector of energy and petroleum) recorded Rs. 16.9 billion in profits.  
 On the relative positive features of Tamil Nadu, the value of the State’s Own Revenue was Rs. 652 billion, while it was Rs. 495 billion for Gujarat. Tamil Nadu overtook Gujarat even in the parameter of the SOR as a ratio to the GSDP. Tamil Nadu’s 11.2 per cent was about three percentage points ahead of Gujarat’s (8.09 per cent).  (The total value of the GSDP of the two States is sourced from the budgetary documents of the States).  
With regard to the relationship between interest payments and revenue receipts, Tamil Nadu’s ratio (10.4 per cent) was lower than that of Gujarat (17.4 per cent). This means that the annual interest outgo on loans is lesser for Tamil Nadu than for Gujarat for 2011-12. Yet, the western State’s higher revenue surplus could be attributed to its less expenditure on wages and salaries and in the social sector, in both of which Tamil Nadu spent cumulatively about Rs. 210 billion more than Gujarat’s Rs.478 billion.  As for outstanding liabilities, Tamil Nadu’s tally was lower than Gujarat’s by Rs. 200 billion. In terms of percentage of the GSDP, the liabilities of the southern State accounted for 19.6 per cent, while Gujarat’s debt amounted to 24.7 per cent of its GSDP.

Not all Swiss bank money illegal: Piyush Goyal
","Finance Minister Piyush Goyal said on Friday the reported 50% rise in deposits by Indians in Swiss banks could not be presumed to be a case of black money parked abroad. He added that the government would start getting details on bank accounts of Indians in Switzerland from next year under a bilateral tax treaty and strong action would be instituted against anyone found guilty.
The Minister was responding to news reports that money parked by Indians in Swiss banks rose to CHF (Swiss Franc)1.01 billion (₹7,000 crore) in 2017, reversing a declining trend over three years amid a “clampdown” on suspected black money stashed there.
In comparison, the total funds held by all foreign clients of Swiss banks rose only about 3%, to CHF 1.46 trillion or about ₹100 lakh crore in same period, according to data released by the Swiss National Bank (SNB).
Citing news reports, Mr. Goyal said 40% of the deposits was the result of the liberalised remittance scheme introduced by former Finance Minister P. Chidambaram. As per the scheme, an individual could remit up to $2,50,000 per year, he said.
Replying to reporters’ queries, Mr. Goyal said, “The data that you alluded to will come to us; so how are you assuming that this is black money or this is illegal transaction?”
“We will have all information if someone is found guilty, (and) the government will take strong action against them,” he said.




Reacting to the reports, the Congress and other Opposition parties targeted Prime Minister Narendra Modi over his claims of retrieving black money stashed abroad. The JD(U), a BJP ally, also expressed “grave concern” over the surge in Indian deposits in Swiss banks.
Attacking Mr. Modi, Congress president Rahul Gandhi tweeted: “2014, HE said: I will bring back all the “BLACK” money in Swiss Banks & put 15 Lakhs in each Indian bank A/C. 2016, HE said: Demonetisation will cure India of “BLACK” money. 2018, HE says: 50% jump in Swiss Bank deposits by Indians, is “WHITE” money. No “BLACK” in Swiss Banks!”
The Congress said Swiss bank deposits had fallen during the UPA regime.
“Swiss Bank deposits fell during Dr. Manmohan Singh’s time, only to rise to record levels under PM Modi. The current increase of 50.2% post demonetisation is the maximum since 2004,” the party said on Twitter.
“What happened to Prime Minister Modi’s promise of eradicating corruption and bringing back black money?” asked Congress spokesperson R.P.N. Singh.
CPI(M) leader Sitaram Yechury said while the money of Indians in Swiss banks rose, the Centre wrote off the corporate world’s loans worth lakhs of crores and allowed some businessmen to flee after looting public money.
West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee questioned how deposits in Swiss banks had surged while public sector banks in India were reporting massive losses.
“Bravo! #DeMonetisation? Swiss Bank money flying. India losing,” Ms Banerjee tweeted.
Almost exactly a year ago, in an address on the foundation day of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) on July 1, Mr. Modi had highlighted a record 45% drop in deposits by Indians in Swiss banks.
Backing Mr. Goyal, Union Minister Arun Jaitley posted on Facebook: “Indian' money outside the country is of various categories. Past investigation by CBDT has shown that this includes money held by persons of Indian origin who now hold foreign passport, monies belonging to Non-Resident Indians, as also monies belonging to resident Indians who have made legitimate investments abroad, including transfer of money under the liberalised remittance schemes. It is only monies kept by resident Indians outside these categories which become actionable.”

Sensex touches 37,000 as rally extends
","Investor optimism over strong earnings and selective buying in index blue chips pushed the benchmark Sensex above the 37,000-mark for the first time ever on Thursday, which was also the fifth straight session of gain for the benchmark.
The 30-share Sensex opened strong and breached the 37,000-mark during the early morning session before partly shedding some of the gains on account of profit booking. Later in the day, it touched a high of 37,061.62 before closing the day at a new high of 36,984.64, up 126.41 points over Wednesday’s close.
While the index has gained 633 points in the last five consecutive session, it took only 13 sessions to move from 36,000 to 37,000.
Meanwhile, the broader Nifty settled at 11,167.30, up 35.30 points or 0.32%.
Dhiraj Relli, MD and CEO, HDFC Securities, attributed the rally to strong earnings and liquidity push, especially by mutual funds that have also done considerable portfolio reallocation in the recent past.
Inflows into MFs
“New highs have come about on the back of sustained inflows into mutual funds. Earnings are also catching up. Nifty earnings, which grew at a CAGR of 3% between 2013 and 2017, increased by 8.5% in the financial year 2017-18, and this year they are likely to be in high teens. This should make the valuations look comfortable,” said Mr. Relli.
Incidentally, the mutual fund reallocation has also led to the recent trend wherein the benchmarks have scaled new highs even as the overall market breadth remained weak or even negative on most days.
On Thursday, advances at 1,335 only barely managed to outnumber the declines at 1,238 with most of the broader indices registering only marginal gains. 
Most market participants still believe that the sell off in the midcap and smallcap space is not over yet.
Further, July has seen domestic institutional investors putting in more than ₹4,000 crore in equities wherein overseas investors have been net sellers at ₹927 crore.
Meanwhile, the Sensex pack saw a total of 18 stocks gaining ground on Thursday with State Bank of India, ICICI Bank, Power Grid Corporation, ONGC, Axis Bank, NTPC and HDFC all gaining in the range of 1-5% each.
While the Sensex has gained around 8.60% in the current calendar year, the BSE Smallcap index is down over 15% in 2018.
Maruti Suzuki was the worst performer in the Sensex pack, shedding 3.70% after the company June quarter profit missed analyst estimates.

Amazon India unveils Seller Lending Network, uses machine learning to facilitate loans
","Amazon India on Wednesday unveiled its ‘Seller Lending Network,’ further scaling its ‘Seller Lending program’ introduced in 2016. This would offer sellers on Amazon.in loan options from multiple third-party lenders.
The online retailer said the network would provide wider selection, wherein sellers can choose loan offers tailored for their business needs from multiple lenders and loan types. Amazon India said sellers stand to save about 150-250 bps (basis points) on interest rates due to competitive rates offered by the lenders.
Amazon also said sellers can now avail loans via an online application process with minimal documentation. This includes a very quick loan approval process of 2-3 days for new loans and intra-day approval for existing loan renewals.
“What we wanted to remove is a lack of working capital [for sellers] as a reason not to start selling online. We started this programme in 2016. Two years later we noticed there is an opportunity to make this programme even better,” said Gopal Pillai, general manager and director, seller services, Amazon India.
Machine learning
The Seller Lending Network also has Lender Central, a portal for lenders (similar to Seller Central for sellers), to facilitate exchange of information between lenders and Amazon. This facilitates information about seller performance data, loan application status and loan portfolio details. In addition, lenders can track the performance of a seller on Amazon.in real-time, thereby allowing lenders to better assess the sellers and make loan-decisioning models more comprehensive.
Lenders also benefit from Amazon’s machine learning models that provide early warning signals and help them maintain a high-quality loan book, the company said.
“We have a very proven algorithm that predicts the seller's capability to repay based on their historical performance,” said Mr. Pillai.
Currently, Aditya Birla Finance, Bank of Baroda, Capital First, Capital Float, Flexiloans, and Yes Bank are part of the lending program, offering loans to thousands of sellers through Seller Lending Network. Amazon said the lending partners benefit from access to a pool of customers, seamless data exchange and loan repayment, thereby simplifying and reducing their operational overheads. Mr.Pillai said the banks and non-banking financial companies don’t see Amazon as a competitor.
“They are our partners [and] also our customers. What we are able to transform is the intelligence we can give to the banks based on the seller’s historical performance in the marketplace… for them to get the confidence to give it [loan],” he said.
Since its launch in June 2013 with a few hundred sellers, Amazon India said there are over 3,40,000 sellers selling on its marketplace. These sellers have listed more than 170 million products on Amazon.in.

Gold, silver surge on wedding season buying, global cues
","Gold staged a strong recovery on Saturday by surging Rs. 320 to Rs. 30,710 per 10 grams in the national capital on emergence of buying by stockists to meet the ongoing wedding season demand amid a firming trend overseas.
Silver also snapped its three-day falling streak and spurted by Rs. 1,050 to Rs. 42,700 per kg on increased offtake by industrial units and coin makers. The white metal had lost Rs. 1,750 in the previous three sessions.
Traders attributed the rebound in precious metals to buying by stockists for the ongoing wedding season demand.
Besides, a firming global trend where gold advanced the most since mid-March as tensions between Russia and Ukraine increased, boosting demand for the precious metal as a safe haven, also boosted the sentiment here, they said.
Gold in New York, which normally sets the price trend on the domestic front, rose 1.5 per cent to $1,302.90 an ounce, the biggest gain since March 12 and silver by 2.6 per cent to $19.54 an ounce, the biggest gain since February 14.
In Delhi, gold of 99.9 and 99.5 per cent purity spurted by Rs. 320 each to Rs. 30,710 and Rs. 30,510 per 10 grams, respectively. It had lost Rs. 195 yesterday.
Sovereign followed suit and rose by Rs. 100 to Rs. 25,100 per piece of eight grams.
Silver ready recorded by a whopping rise of Rs. 1,050 to Rs. 42,700 per kg and weekly-based delivery by Rs. 1,105 to Rs. 42,080 per kg.
On the other hand, silver coins remained steady at Rs. 80,000 for buying and Rs. 81,000 for selling of 100 pieces.

Ujjivan offers overdraft for micro, small firms
","Ujjivan Small Finance Bank, a subsidiary of Ujjivan Financial Services Ltd., has announced the nationwide roll out of overdraft (OD) facility for micro and small enterprise (MSE) customers. An add-on product to the bank’s existing MSE term loans, the facility aims to assist businesses having a turnover of ₹50 lakh or more with funding to meet their long-term and short-term financing requirements.
The OD offered to all MSEs on a competitive interest rate is for a period of one year with a credit limit ranging from ₹11 lakh to ₹50 lakh, which can be renewed on an annual basis.
MSE customers are allowed to pay EMI only on the utilised amount, Ujjivan said in a statement. It also enables MSEs to repay the amount anytime during the tenure of the OD facility to replenish the credit limit back to its original amount, the lender said.
“This offering is aimed at the MSEs who don’t have easy access to formal credit given their turnover,” Samit Ghosh, MD and CEO, Ujjivan Small Finance Bank said in the statement.
Given the requirement of funds for working capital, and sometimes for short term purposes, overdraft limits would help customers to meet fluctuating capital requirements, he said.
“With this facility, we now offer a complete range of formal banking solutions to MSEs to meet all their business needs. The existing product offering of Ujjivan for the MSE customers is in the form of term loans,” he said.

India hits back at the U.S. with tariffs ","In what could signal escalating trade tensions between New Delhi and Washington, the Centre has written to the World Trade Organisation (WTO) notifying its decision to increase import tariffs on 30 items from the U.S. amounting to $240 million, in retaliation against tariffs imposed by the latter on aluminium and steel imports.
The move is significant as it comes a day after Commerce Minister Suresh Prabhu returned from the U.S. and just weeks ahead of further talks between the two countries on the issue.
“India hereby reiterates its decision to suspend concessions or other obligations notified to the Council for Trade in Goods on 18 May 2018… that are substantially equivalent to the amount of trade affected by the measures imposed by the United States,” the Centre said in the notification to the WTO’s Council for Trade in Goods. “The proposed suspension of concessions or other obligations takes the form of an increase in tariffs on selected products originating in the United States, based on the measures of the United States.”
“India reserves its right to further suspend substantially equivalent concessions and other obligations based on the trade impact resulting from the application of the measures of the United States,” the notification added.
U.S. President Donald Trump, in March, signed an order imposing a 25% tariff on steel imports and a 10% tariff on aluminium imports, citing national security as one of the key reasons behind the move. The Indian government repeatedly requested an exemption from these tariffs as India did not pose a security threat to the U.S., but to no avail. India has also taken the U.S. to the dispute settlement mechanism in the WTO over the matter.
Surprising move
The decision to begin retaliatory measures against the U.S., however, is particularly surprising because Commerce Minister Suresh Prabhu, on his return from the U.S. on Friday, indicated that the two countries would try to resolve their issues through dialogue.
“If they wanted to take fresh action, they would not agree to talks and we would not either do the same,” Mr Prabhu told reporters on Friday. “Instead of measures and counter-measures, we decided to talk and resolve it out.”
The notification to the WTO was, however, dated June 13, before the Minister made his comment.
“The situation between the U.S. and India should not be viewed as a trade war just yet,” Rishi Shah, Economist at Centre for Digital Economy and Policy said. “A possible continuation of such steps from both sides may result in more friction on the trade front. However, it must be kept in mind that the last fortnight has seen ratcheting up of trade tensions in the West and also with China as the US has imposed tariffs. Given the less than optimal nature of such policies, it must be assessed how sustainable they may be.”
$240 million in duty
The removal of concessions on U.S. imports — on items such as chickpeas, lentils, almonds, apples and some metal products — will likely result in a duty collection of $240 million, according to the Centre. This, according to the government, was in keeping with the duty increase of $241 million due to the U.S.’ actions.
“India wishes to clarify that suspension of concessions shall be equivalent to the amount of trade affected by the United States’ measures,” the notification said. “To this end, India reserves the right to adjust the specific products for which suspension of concessions is effectuated, and its right to adjust the additional rate of duty imposed on such products.”
Notably, one of the items on which the import concessions have been dropped pertains to high-capacity motorcycles such as those manufactured by Harley Davidson, duties on which were one of the sore points mentioned by Mr. Trump about India’s tariff policy.
“It’s some bit of posturing and some amount of negotiation will happen,” Abhishek Jain, Tax Partner at EY India said. “I don’t think it is as big as what is happening between the U.S. and China. Of course, this move will make these items more expensive for Indian importers.”

Fintech firm Drip Capital raises $15 mn ","Drip Capital, a California and Bengaluru-based fintech company that offers working capital to cross-border traders, said that it had raised $15 million of equity funding from Accel, Sequoia India and Wing VC in a Series A round. 
Existing investors, including Y-Combinator and others, who had invested $5 million in a previous seed round, also participated in this round. 
The company said it had also raised an undisclosed amount of debt capital from Silicon Valley Bank and others.
“The working capital gap is quite pronounced in India, where SMEs contribute to 40% of exports,” Pushkar Mukewar, co-founder and co-CEO of Drip, said in a statement.
Drip said it started with India as the first exporter market and experienced strong demand, having funded over $100 million of trade flows across industries in the last 18 months of operation. Drip now plans to use this funding to scale up operations in India and replicate the model in other geographies.
“With a partner like Drip Capital, emerging market exporters now never need to say no to a new order due to working capital constraints,” said Mohit Bhatnagar, managing director, Sequoia Capital India Advisors.

Madras HC reserves order in directors’ disqualification case "," With the Madras High Court reserving its order in the directors’ disqualification case, corporate India is keeping its fingers crossed.
Justice T. Raja of the Madras High Court last week heard the final arguments in the case which saw a spate of writ petitions challenging the order of the Registrar of Companies (ROCs) disqualifying directors of private companies for non-filing of financial statements for a period of three continuous financial years.
These petitions focussed their challenge on how the three continuous financial years should be calculated.
The Madras High Court was the first to grant a stay in September. Since then, more parties had filed writ petitions. The High Court had also heard the counter-arguments by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs.
The writ petitions were filed challenging the order on disqualification of directors under Section 164(2)(a) of the Companies Act, 2013.
Initially, a list of disqualified directors numbering 45,657 of various firms with effect from November 1, 2016 was released. An updated list later saw the number reduced to 34,565. 
The calculation of three continuous financial years has become the fulcrum of focus in this instance. If one were to go by Section 274(1)(g) of the 1956 Act, which came into effect from December 13, 2000, it means “three financial years commencing on and after the first day of April, 1999.” The new Section 164(2)(a) of the 2013 Act, however, uses the words “for any continuous period of three financial years.” So, the definition of the financial years itself has become the subject matter of argument in this case.
According to Section 2(41) of the 2013 Act, it is argued ‘financial year’ in relation to any company “means the period ending on the 31st day of March every year, and where it has been incorporated on or after the first day of January of a year, the period ending on the 31st day of March of the following year.”
Since Section 164 was made effective only from January 1, 2014, the first financial year for the purpose of Section 164 of the 2013 Act would between April 1, 2014 and March 31, 2015. 
“Accordingly, the second and third financial years would be the years ended 31/3/2016 and 31/3/2017,” it is argued.
‘October 2017 as trigger’
They also cited provisions related to holding of annual meetings and time limits given thereafter for filing annual returns and the like. 
Given all these, the disqualification could get triggered only on or after October 30, 2017 if a firm fails to file annual forms for three financial years, it is argued.

Vedanta Resources recommends offer to take company private
","Anil Agarwal’s efforts to take Vedanta Resources private moved a step forward on Tuesday, as the company said it would be recommending the $1.028 billion offer for the share capital not currently owned by Volcan Investments.
Following the grant of an extension of a deadline, in order to continue discussions with lenders, Vedanta Resources and Volcan Investments – the holding company wholly owned by Mr. Agarwal’s discretionary trust – outlined details of the recommended cash offer of £8.25 a share, which is a near 28% premium on the closing price of Vedanta Resources on the Friday before the offer was first announced on July 2. The offer was for the 33.47% stake that Volcan Investments doesn’t already own, and values the whole company at $3.07 billion.
Mr. Agarwal said the acquisition of the remaining shares was a “natural progression” for the company and that while a London listing had served the company “extremely well” since 2003, it was no longer necessary for the company to achieve its “strategic objectives.”
In addition to representing an attractive premium, the offer in cash provided certainty, while investors would still be able to reinvest the proceeds in Vedanta Limited, where the majority of the group’s profits and cash flow were generated, either through shares in India, or American Depository Receipts in New York, Volcan Investments said.
“This is an attractive offer for independent Vedanta Shareholders,” said Deepak Parekh, the chairman of the independent committee that reviewed the offer. “It secures delivery of future value today in cash, whilst providing shareholders with the ability, should they choose, to retain exposure to the Vedanta Group growth story by reinvesting all or part of their offer proceeds in Vedanta Limited.” The increased maturity and liquidity of the Indian markets had “diminished the rationale” for maintaining a U.K. entity, he added.

AIIMS gets a brand new 10-storey block
","The All India Institute of Medical Sciences here is finalising plans to use the newest entrant in its infrastructural expansion project – a 10-storey Convergence Block built at a cost of Rs.50.85 crore.
Handed over to the Institute after completion early this year, the imposing grey building (merging with the rest of the hospital) is slated to house teaching rooms, laboratories, research units along with a knowledge centre.
AIIMS chairperson of media and protocol officer Dr. Neerja Bhatla said: “The building will have an array of facilities including a student and teaching wing with examination halls, laboratories, media cell and an alumni cell. Space is also being allocated for research projects and record keeping. We hope to start using the building for students by July-August.”
The Block has 10 floors and two basement areas, with a total built-up area of 18,463 sq. metres. The building design also conforms to energy-saving norms and will offer space for faculties for various departments including Biology, Anatomy, Biochemistry, Physiology, Pharmacology and Pathology.
The Centre had planned the project and work began on the Block in 2011. This is among the most significant initiatives to expand infrastructure in the Hospital to handle the growing number of students and research needs and to provide quality patient care.
Besides housing the knowledge centre meant for creating a data base for various research activities, including clinical experiences at the AIIMS, the Block is also expected to have a state-of-the-art facility for knowledge expansion.
“The idea is to convert this into a one-point knowledge hub, where both basic sciences and clinical departments will have a common facility of doing technology-driven research in the Institute,” noted a senior official at the Union Health Ministry.
The Convergence Block is part of the Moily Committee’s recommendations for augmentation of infrastructure at AIIMS for which the Central Government has allocated Rs.750 crore.

What is the GDP deflator?
","The GDP deflator, also called implicit price deflator, is a measure of inflation. It is the ratio of the value of goods and services an economy produces in a particular year at current prices to that of prices that prevailed during the base year.
This ratio helps show the extent to which the increase in gross domestic product has happened on account of higher prices rather than increase in output. 
Since the deflator covers the entire range of goods and services produced in the economy — as against the limited commodity baskets for the wholesale or consumer price indices — it is seen as a more comprehensive measure of inflation.
Real vs nominal
 GDP GDP price deflator measures the difference between real GDP and nominal GDP. Nominal GDP differs from real GDP as the former doesn’t include inflation, while the latter does. 
As a result, nominal GDP will most often be higher than real GDP in an expanding economy.
The formula to find the GDP price deflator:
GDP price deflator = (nominal GDP ÷ real GDP) x 100
WPI, CPI
A consumer price index (CPI) measures changes over time in the general level of prices of goods and services that households acquire for the purpose of consumption. 
However, since CPI is based only a basket of select goods and is calculated on prices included in it, it does not capture inflation across the economy as a whole. 
The wholesale price index basket has no representation of the services sector and all the constituents are only goods whose prices are captured at the wholesale/producer level.
Changes in consumption patterns or introduction of goods and services are automatically reflected in the GDP deflator. This allows the GDP deflator to absorb changes to an economy’s consumption or investment patterns. Often, the trends of the GDP deflator will be similar to that of the CPI.
Specifically, for the GDP deflator, the ‘basket’ in each year is the set of all goods that were produced domestically, weighted by the market value of the total consumption of each good. 
Therefore, new expenditure patterns are allowed to show up in the deflator as people respond to changing prices. The theory behind this approach is that the GDP deflator reflects up-to-date expenditure patterns. 
Reliability of GDP deflator 
Both the WPI and CPI capture changes in prices at varying stages of the economic cycle. While WPI is seen as a defacto Producer Price Index, CPI considers inflation at the retail end. But since only goods and services directly consumed by households — food products, clothing, petrol, health, education and recreation — are considered, the CPI does not tell us what is happening to prices of cement, steel or polyester yarn. While retail inflation is important, policymakers cannot ignore the prices that producers of consumer and intermediate and capital goods are receiving. However, GDP deflator is available only on a quarterly basis along with GDP estimates, whereas CPI and WPI data are released every month.

Face of Indian banking set to change over next 2 years
","In about two years from now, at least five private sectors banks will see new faces at the helm. The process for succession at Axis Bank, the third-largest private sector lender, has been finalised and is now awaiting regulatory approval. The process will start by April in HDFC Bank, the second-largest private sector bank. For ICICI Bank, a clear picture is expected by October.
Axis Bank will see a new chief executive from January 1, 2019 as its board has shortlisted three candidates and sent them to the Reserve Bank of India for approval. The lender’s present MD and CEO Shikha Sharma has decided to step down on December 31, 2018. The future of ICICI Bank MD and CEO Chanda Kochhar is unclear. Following allegations of impropriety and conflict of interest, the board of ICICI Bank has ordered a probe, with Ms. Kochhar deciding to go on leave till the probe is over.




This prompted the bank to create the post of chief operating officer and appoint Sandeep Bakhshi, who is now running the show. It remains to be seen if Ms. Kochhar, whose present term ends in March 2019, will seek reappointment.
The current term of Romesh Sobti, who has changed the face of IndusInd Bank over the last 10 years, ends in March 2020 when he turns 70 — the regulator-mandated retirement age of private sector bank chief executives. The lender will also have a new face, and will most probably elevate one of its current top management team.
HDFC Bank MD Aditya Puri, the longest-serving head of any Indian bank, will hang up his boots in October 2020. The lender will start the search process for a successor in April 2019 and there could be a 12-month overlap period in which the successor will work with Mr. Puri.
Also, the latest private sector universal bank, IDFC Bank, will also see a change of guard once it gets all the clearances for its proposed merger with Capital First. According to the deal, V. Vaidyanathan, the executive chairman of Capital First, will replace Rajiv Lall as the MD and CEO of the bank.

Coromandel Q1 profit rises 24% ","Fertiliser maker Coromandel International has reported a ₹90.21 crore consolidated net profit for the quarter ended June 30, a more than 24% increase from the year-earlier period’s ₹72.65 crore. 
Consolidated total income rose 9.4% to ₹2,537 crore (₹2,318 crore). Besides being a leading manufacturer of phosphatic fertiliser, the Hyderabad-based firm is into crop protection solutions, specialty nutrients, organic manure and retail.
In a statement,managing director Sameer Goel said the company posted a strong performance during the quarter, improving its capacity utilisation, operational and sourcing efficiencies and customer connect initiatives. 
“This was despite erratic monsoon distribution in our key operating markets,” he said.
“The normal south-west monsoon improved reservoir levels and recent pick up in crop sowing in our key operating markets are expected to augment agriculture growth. 
“With the higher crop support price and farmer welfare schemes, we are seeing positive agrarian sentiments,” he said.
The recently announced GST rate reduction on fertiliser grade phosphoric acid from 12% to 5% is likely to bring down the company’s GST credit accumulation and improve the working capital situation, according to Mr. Goel.

The two facets of NPA management
"," The phenomenal increase in non-performing assets (NPAs) and wilful defaults over the last three years raises serious concerns about the effectiveness of NPA management and its mechanisms. Given the potential adverse impact that the increasing incidence of NPAs might cause, it is critical that NPA resolution takes place in a timely manner. Policies concerning NPA resolution must address two critical aspects: first, how to prevent it occurring at this scale in the future? and second, how to manage the existing accumulated NPAs?
Till recently, most of the initiatives by the government and the RBI (Reserve Bank of India) had centred on the latter — how to manage the existing NPAs. The emphasis was on finding ways to reduce the magnitude of NPAs. This was driven by the idea that bank balance sheets must be cleaned up and restored. While it is important to clean up the balance sheet of banks by reducing or eliminating bad loans, it is equally important to think about preventive measures. Typically, preventive measures are structural in nature. Both elements are quite important to a robust NPA management mechanism.
Regulator’s role
 The government and the regulator have to play a greater role in the process of NPA management. The role of the government has historically been crucial when there is a banking failure or crisis. It is the government which comes to the rescue, either through direct intervention or through the regulator. The role of government becomes even more important as it happens to be the principal owner of the majority of the affected banks in India.
On preventive measures, there is a need for evolving a framework in order to bring transparency into the operation and management of SCBs (scheduled commercial banks), particularly the PSBs (public sector banks), on four major parameters — project appraisal, monitoring, accounting, and auditing. As large loans constitute a substantial portion of the total NPAs, a robust credit appraisal mechanism is very much required. As large loans tend to be relatively technically complex, the banks must enhance their technical capabilities to undertake project monitoring effectively. Greater emphasis must be placed on bringing efficiency and transparency into the accounting system. Emphasis should be given on strengthening the audit system in banks. 
The above measures can potentially reduce the possibilities of collusion among the officials of the funding institutions and the borrowers.
‘Bad bank’
On NPA resolution, to deal with the existing accumulated NPAs, there is a need for creating a publicly funded ‘bad bank’ or an asset management company which will deal with the stressed assets of PSBs. The approach should be to formulate a resolution mechanism which will maximise recovery, and thereby, reduce the burden on the banks or the government. It can be very similar to the Swedish model where the bad bank bought the stressed assets from the affected banks and sold it at a higher price at the time of economic expansion, when asset prices picked up. This way, recovery on the bad loans can be maximised. The life span of the Swedish bad bank ‘Securum’ was 15 years, and it was fully owned by the government. 
On a similar line, the Government of India, too, can create a bad bank, with full government ownership. The proposed institution can continue to exist without an expiry date as the NPA problem is perennial.
The managerial staff of the ‘bad bank’ may, however, be outsourced to boost operational and managerial efficiency. 
The proposed bank should function independently with greater professionalism and should be accountable to the government. 
Given the fiscal constraints, it may not be viable for the government to finance the proposed bad bank through budgetary support fully. The government can, however, partly finance the proposed ‘bad bank’ by issuing equity shares with the government holding the majority share.

New Govt should respect Rajan’s appointment: Chidambaram
","The new government should respect the appointment of Reserve Bank Governor Raghuram Rajan, who was selected to head the central bank on the basis of his reputation, Finance Minister P Chidambaram has said.
His comments to Bloomberg on the sidelines of ADB’s annual conference at Astana, Kazakhstan, come amid media speculation that the BJP-led NDA may not be keen to retain Dr. Rajan as RBI Governor.
Dr. Rajan had last month dismissed the talks about his differences with BJP as “media invention”, saying “I haven’t had any discussion with the new government. I think its all press-invented difference. I think it should be seen as speculation rather than any actual differences“.
His comments came against the backdrop of certain BJP leaders questioning his policies to deal with the current economic woes.
During the 8-month stint, Dr. Rajan has >raised key policy rates thrice by 0.25 per cent each.
In an interview to CNBC at Astana, Chidambaram said: “I have done more heavy lifting in the last 12 months than the RBI... I have done what needs to be done on the fiscal side, the central bank has done what needs to do on monetary side. Now we have to address the supply side constraints“.
Answering questions on growth, the Minister said Indian economy will pick up pace and will grow at 6 per cent in the current fiscal.
Mr. Chidambaram said: “We have unblocked a very large number of projects which had stalled... When the projects are completed and begin production, you will see all that adds to the economy.”
The economy grew is estimated to have grown at 4.9 per cent in the 2013—14 fiscal after touching a decade-low level of 4.5 per cent growth in 2012—13.
“As long as we have high inflation how can you ask the RBI to lower rates dramatically,” Mr. Chidambaram questioned, adding “we have to address supply side constraints. (We have to) bring down inflation before the monetary policy can come to aid of growth“.

>WPI inflation in March stood at 3-month-high of 5.7 per cent, while the >CPI or retail inflation too inched up to 8.3 per cent.
Mr. Chidambaram also said that the fiscal deficit and the current account deficit have been contained and investments have started pouring in.
In the interim Budget, he had said that the fiscal deficit would be contained at 4.6 per cent of GDP, lower than the earlier target of 4.8 per cent. The deficit in 2012—13 was 4.9 per cent of GDP.

No magic wand for new government to wave
","The wheels of commerce, to borrow a cliché, have been grinding ever so slowly in the last few weeks ever since the country went into election mode.
Businessmen and CEOs that you speak to uniformly have a single response to any question you pose and that is: “we are waiting for the next government.”
This probably reflects their frustration with the outgoing dispensation and its policies which have not exactly been industry-friendly. Yet, the statement is alsoa reflection of their expectations from the new government. Indeed, a survey report of industry body, Assocham, released last week shows that expectations of India Inc. from the next government are sky high.
“The expectation level is soaring by the day among different segments of the economy — stock markets, industry, trade, multilateral institutions and foreign investors’, says the report based on a survey of 450 CEOs from different sectors such as manufacturing, banking, IT, real estate and finance. The survey respondents expect the new government to bring down prices (inflation), interest rates, create jobs and revive manufacturing, all in the next few months.
Nothing wrong in the expectations at all except that it is unrealistic to imagine that they will all happen in the near-term. There is a clear danger here that the weight of expectations will be too much for any new government to bear and whatever it does will fall short, which will, in turn, fuel disappointment and disillusionment.
The biggest assumption underlining these expectations is that we will have a stable dispensation taking charge once the results are out on May 16. All bets on a quick return to growth will obviously be off if we are to get a wobbly coalition government next. However, getting a stable government does not mean that the economic problems will go away immediately. There is no magic wand for the new Prime Minister to wave and immediately cure the economy of its serious ailments. A strong government will only be the first step in a long journey to get the economy back on rails.
Let’s take a few of the issues that need to be addressed by the new government immediately. Price rise is the foremost amongst them. Rising food prices have proved an insurmountable problem over the last three years. The problems lie on the supply side and it is futile to assume that the next government can increase supply of food commodities immediately.
While foodgrain can be released from the overflowing warehouses of the government, the same cannot be said about vegetables, fruits, milk and other protein foods. Prices of perishable commodities always rise during summer and the first indications were provided in the inflation data of March which showed a spike in consumer prices. With warnings of an El Nino strike this year, the predictions for the monsoon are not very favourable too. This is bad news for a new government inheriting the inflation gift.
Rest assured that inflation will not be tamed for the next few months. Assuming that the new government acts immediately to reform the agricultural products chain and procurement policies, the benefits will begin to be felt only by the end of the next few quarters.
The issue of interest rates is linked to inflation and those expecting rates to fall immediately will obviously be disappointed. The RBI’s actions reflect the sum total of the government’s efforts on the fiscal side and the new dispensation has to do a number of things right before the central bank can be willed into softening rates.
The second important issue that India Inc is waiting for the government to address is the slowdown in manufacturing. Consumption, the most important indicator of economic health, has slowed down visibly and that is clearly reflected in the sales of industries such as automobiles, consumer durables and electronics. The government will have to think of stimulus measures to revive manufacturing such as duty reductions/concessions in the first budget that it will announce in July. Reducing income tax to put more money in the hands of the people to spend is another option.
Of course, given the not-so-comfortable position on the fiscal deficit front, there will not be much leeway for stimulus measures. Yet, the fact is that even if such measures are announced, it will be at least two, if not three quarters, before the benefits are begun to be felt.
Whichever party forms the new government, it will have to necessarily focus on infrastructure growth but here again, the benefits will be felt only over the medium-to-long term. The national highways project of the Atal Behari Vajpayee government was a tremendous boost not just to infrastructure but to the overall economy itself as it created demand for downstream industries and generated jobs. What will be the equivalent project for the new government? Will it be inter-linking of rivers if the NDA forms the government, as opinion polls seem to indicate?
The challenges on the economy front for the new government will be stiff and getting growth back on rails is a long-haul project. Those building up expectations now — including the markets — would do well to remember this.

SEBI proposes using UPI to reduce public issue timeline ","The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has proposed allowing investors to use the unified payments interface (UPI) while bidding for shares in an initial public offer (IPO) to reduce the public issue timeline from the current T+6 to T+3.
In a discussion paper released on Wednesday, the capital market regulator said that while ASBA — application supported by blocked amount — helped in reducing the timeline two years back, UPI could help in further bringing down the overall IPO timeline. 
“In view of the significant developments in the payment mechanisms, it is felt that the unified payments interface (UPI)... could be incorporated with ASBA mechanism to further improve the efficiency of the (IPO) process,” stated the paper. 
T+3 refers to a system wherein the equity shares would be listed on the bourses on the third day from the day the IPO closes for subscription. SEBI had reduced the IPO timeline from T+12 to T+6 in January 2016 by making ASBA mandatory for all investors. 
SEBI, however, said since UPI had a cap of ₹2 lakh for money transfer, institutional investors and high net worth individuals would be allowed to bid using the existing ASBA process.

Private security agencies seek GST on commission, not gross income
"," 
Private security agencies in the country have reiterated their demand for application of 5% GST on their gross income or, alternatively, the applicable 18% GST on their agency commission only.
“Private security agencies are under financial constraints [due to] GST which is collected on gross amount charged to a client [the principal employer] which includes reimbursement of wages and statutory benefits paid to security guards,” Security Association of India (SAI) said in a recent letter to the government.
‘Pleas yield no result’
“From the beginning, we have been representing that wages and benefits paid to security guards should be excluded from the value for calculating the amount for service tax and that the tax should be charged only on the total value of commission/agency charges received by the security agency,” SAI said in a representation to the Union Finance Minister.
The association said all its earlier pleas have yielded no result.
The umbrella organisation for this sector, the Central Association of Private Security Industry (CAPSI) has called for a nation-wide protest to press for its demands.
In a meeting held in Mumbai, the CAPSI and SAI, expressed fears that the 18% GST would force many players to close down their business and tender thousands of guards jobless.
To highlight their cause, President of CAPSI Viswanath Katti said that security agencies will demonstrate at GST offices across the country on July 18, 2018 and a memorandum will be submitted to GST commissioners.
Council urged to mull
SAI president Gurcharan Singh Chauhan said that Maharashtra’s Finance Minister Sudhir Mungantiwar has been approached and urged to discuss the issue in the GST Council meeting.
He said the sector helped employ the poor from rural areas and many of the estimated 70 lakh guards would be rendered unemployed as the cost of wages goes up.
They said GST should be levied on 10% of the agency’s service charge of ₹2,034 which will attract GST of ₹366 per month per security guard.
“The security guard who draws the lowest monthly salary of ₹10,000 is being taxed ₹4,028 per month, which is very high and unfair in comparison to his monthly wages,” the letter said.

‘Flood damage may slash India’s coffee output by 20%‘
","India’s coffee production in 2018/19 is likely to fall by at least one-fifth from a year earlier as floods in key producing states damaged the crop and delayed exports, industry officials told Reuters.
Some of the worst flooding in India in a century killed hundreds of people in the southern states of Kerala and Karnataka earlier this month, both of which account for more than 90% of the country’s total coffee production.
“Earlier we were expecting better crop this year,” Ramesh Rajah, president of the Coffee Exporters’ Association of India, told Reuters. “Now we are expecting at least 20% drop in production.”
Severe crop loss was reported in the coffee-growing regions of Kodagu in Karnataka and Wayanad in Kerala, while the Chikmagalur and Hassan districts in Karnataka also reported damage on limited scale, he said.
The South Asian country, famous as a tea producer, is the world’s sixth-largest coffee grower, according to state-run Coffee Board, mainly churning out the robusta beans used to make instant coffee, but also producing some of the more expensive arabica variety.
In 2017/18 marketing year to September 30, India produced 3.16 lakh tonnes coffee, Coffee Board data show.

IMF suggests India three steps to sustain high growth rate ","To sustain the high growth rate India has achieved, the country should carry out banking sector reforms; continue with fiscal consolidation, simplify and streamline GST; and renew impetus on reforms, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said on Friday.
India’s growth accelerated to 7.7 per cent in the fourth quarter of Financial Year (FY) 2017-18. That was up from 7 per cent in the previous quarter.
“We expect the recovery to continue in FY 2018-19. Growth is projected at 7.4 per cent in FY 2018-19 and actually 7.8 percent in FY 19-20, respectively,” IMF Communications Director Gerry Rice told reporters at his fortnightly news conference.
In order to sustain the high growth rate, Mr. Rice suggested three steps for India to follow.
“One, to revive a bank credit and enhance the efficiency of credit provision; by accelerating the cleanup of bank and corporate balance sheets and enhancing the government of public sector banks,” he said.
“Point two, to continue fiscal consolidation and to lower elevated public debt levels supported by simplifying and streamlining the goods and services tax (GST) structure,” he added.
He then suggested India to renew impetus to reforms of key markets over the medium-term.
“And thirdly, over the medium-term, renew impetus to reforms of key markets, for example, labour and land, as well as improving the overall business climate would be crucial to improving competitiveness and again, maintaining that very high level of growth in India,” Mr. Rice said in response to a question.
The IMF Board is tentatively scheduled to meet on July 18 for its annual India meeting.
“We will be releasing the staff report in relation to that Board meeting and it will have detail (about GST),” he said when asked about simplifying and streamlining the goods and services tax structure.
“It (GST) is a complicated tax to administer and to implement, so I think some suggestions that streamlining can be important. There will be more on that in the context of the Article IV,” Rice said.
The IMF is scheduled to release on July 16 the update on World Economic Outlook.

Cabinet okays ₹2,000-cr. capital infusion for export guarantor across FY2017-20
","The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs on Wednesday approved a capital infusion of ₹2,000 crore into the Export Credit Guarantee Corporation (ECGC) to be infused over the three financial years 2017-20.
The break-up of the infusion would be ₹50 crore in 2017-18, ₹1,450 crore in 2018-19, and ₹500 crore in 2019-20.
MSME exports
“The infusion would enhance insurance coverage to MSME exports and strengthen India’s exports to emerging and challenging markets like Africa, CIS and Latin American countries,” the government said in a release. “With enhanced capital, ECGC’s underwriting capacity and risk to capital ratio will improve considerably. With a stronger underwriting capacity, ECGC will be in a better position to support Indian exporters to tap new and unexplored markets.”
The increased capital infusion would also help ECGC to diversify its product portfolio and provide cost-effective credit insurance to exporters, the government said.
“Covers from ECGC will help in improving competitive position of India exporters in international markets,” the government said. “More than 85% of customers benefited by ECGC’s covers are MSMEs. ECGC covers exports to around 200 countries in the world.”
Separately, the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs also approved the contribution of grant-in-aid of ₹1,040 crore to the National Export Insurance Account Trust (NEIA). “The corpus is to be utilised during three years from 2017-18 to 2019-20,” the government said. 
“An amount of ₹440 crore has already been received for the year 2017-18. ₹300 crore each will be given to NEIA for the years 2018-19 and 2019-20. The corpus would strengthen NEIA to support project exports from the country that are of strategic and national importance,” the Centre added.

India drops three ranks in AT Kearney FDI Confidence Index
","India in 2018 has fallen out of the top 10 destinations for FDI in terms of its attractiveness, according to an AT Kearney report, which says this could be due to teething troubles in the implementation of the goods and services tax and the government’s demonetisation decision in 2016.
India ranks 11 in the 2018 AT Kearney FDI Confidence Index, down from 8 in 2017 and 9 in 2016.
“Some policies, however, may have deterred investors — at least in the short term,” the report said. “The 2017 nationwide goods and services tax, for example, has faced implementation challenges, and the 2016 demonetisation initiative disrupted business activity and weighed on economic growth.”
That said, the report highlighted several of the reforms — such as removing the Foreign Investment Promotion Board and liberalising FDI limits in key sectors — that have maintained India’s high rankings in terms of FDI attractiveness.
“Notable reforms include the elimination of the Foreign Investment Promotion Board, a government agency responsible for reviewing all potential foreign investment, and the liberalisation of foreign investment thresholds for the retail, aviation, and biomedical industries,” the report said.
The report, released on Monday added that potential investors are likely to be cautious as they are monitoring political risks such as China abolishing presidential term limits and the upcoming general election in India.
“The sheer size of the Chinese and Indian markets, however, will continue to be a draw for investors, and they remain the highest-ranking emerging markets on the index,” the report brought out by the management consulting company added.

Indian LPG, kerosene cheapest in subcontinent
"," Even as petrol and diesel prices in the country shoot up and decline in tune international crude prices, Indian consumers may take some solace from comparisons of prices of cooking gas and kerosene in India with its neighbours. Prices in the country for these two cooking fuels is still the cheapest in the subcontinent, according to data compiled by Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell (PPAC).
India has a total of 22.43 crore active liquefied natural gas (LPG) customers in the domestic category, according to government data, of which more than 18.11 crore, or greater than 80%, avail the subsidy. The LPG coverage of the country estimated on the basis of active domestic connections and estimated households as on April 1 is about 80.9%. 
Consumers in India paid ₹493.55 for an LPG cylinder weighing 14.2 kg, averaging ₹34.76 per kg for a subsidised cylinder and ₹671 or ₹47.25 for a non-subsidised cylinder as on June 1. 
Comparatively, consumers in Pakistan pay ₹1039.52 for a domestic LPG cylinder weighing 11.8 kg or ₹88.95 per kg, making it the highest in the Indian subcontinent.
Users in Sri Lanka and Nepal pay ₹815.30 and ₹867.11 for 12.5-kg and 14.2-kg cylinders, respectively. This translates to a price of ₹65.22 per kg in Sri Lanka and ₹61.06 per kg in Nepal.
Consumers in Bangladesh pay ₹643.79 for 12.5 kg LPG cylinders, translating to price of ₹51.5 per kg.

Prices in other metros like Mumbai (₹84.26), Kolkata (₹79.10) and Chennai (₹79.33) are even more due to higher State levies.

‘Creditors have recovered over ₹50,000 cr. under IBC’ ","M.S. Sahoo, chairperson of Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (IBBI) talks about the success of the IBC process, challenges and the way forward. Edited excerpts: 
What’s the status of resolution of cases under the IBC in terms of resolution? 
I don’t have the exact figures. I think about 40 corporate debtors... the process has yielded resolutions. In this 40, the creditors have got over ₹50,000 crore or so. The average realisation has been above 50%. The operational creditors have also got 50%. 
Are corporates undermining the IBC’s 270-day deadline by moving the courts?
If somebody has a right and thinks that he can establish his right by going to the court, we should not be aggrieved. That’s why we have court system in the country to sort out the differences. It’s not a cause for concern that people are going to court and courts are entertaining them. Is it that 100% of the cases are going to court and getting delayed? 
Our experience suggests that very few, say 20 out of 1,000 cases, have gone to court. Number of cases going through lengthy court process is very less. 
But, isn’t it delaying the overall resolution process? 
We have seen from our experience that issues that have gone to NCLT, NCLAT and Supreme Court have been sorted out by the Supreme Court forever. Last week, we saw Supreme Court order in the case of Jaypee Infra, which was about Section 29 (A) and home buyers. Then, there was an order on the scope of moratorium on the corporate guarantors in the SBI vs Ramakrishna case. I am referring to these two issues because they are dealing with the law which came in the last ordinance on June 6 and is yet to become an Act. 
Even at this stage, the Supreme Court has dealt with provisions of the ordinance in these two orders, so this is the speed at which the courts are working. 
Is it just a perception that no one is willing to take responsibility, with the RP passing it to CoC, CoC to NCLT, NCLT to NCLAT and NCLAT to SC? 
No, it’s not that NCLT passes on to NCLAT and NCLAT to SC. NCLT takes a view and those who are aggrieved appeal to NCLAT and those who are aggrieved, appeal again to SC. 
But you have to look at the data, what is the percentage of orders challenged at NCLAT, it’s about 5-7%. Again what’s the percentage of cases challenged at SC? It’s about 20-30%. You have to see it in totality. Some high profile cases create much more noise, but besides these, big cases also are getting resolved. 
Does the NCLT’s acceptance of bids after closure of deadlines not hurt the sanctity of the IBC process?
You should ask that question to NCLT or whoever does it. 
There were some instances in the past. You should look at the regulatory provisions and the amendments made on July 4 to the IBC regulations. 
It very categorically states that the process, including the timeline and that plan received outside the system will not be considered. As we learnt from experience, we are trying to avoid those problems either by making laws, or SC sorts it out. 
NCLT courts are not fully equipped to deal with such a large number of insolvency cases coming in. How do you address this concern?
It is not in the domain of the IBBI. We have seen that NCLT capacity is being increased over time. Today, we have 12 benches and new benches are being set up in Jaipur and Cuttack. Recruitment process has started to recruit more judges. Efforts are on to take new premises in New Delhi and Mumbai. 
The progress in on and the government is taking efforts to create capacity to meet the number of cases.

FMC tightens commodity exchange investment norms
","Tightening shareholding norms of commodity exchanges after the National Spot Exchange (NSEL) crisis, the Forward Markets Commission (FMC), on Tuesday, said no resident individual could hold more than 5 per cent stake in them and scrapped the concept of promoters and anchor investors for such bourses.
In an eight-page document laying out shareholding norms for national-level commodity exchanges, the FMC said at least 51 per cent of the shares of any commodity exchange will have to be held by the public. This is to ensure broader participation in commodity bourses.
Only a commodity exchange, stock exchange, depository, bank, insurance company or public financial institution can hold up to 15 per cent in such an exchange.
As per the norms, any shareholding in excess of the specified norms will have to be lowered to the threshold level within five years. The previous guidelines had allowed promoters/anchor investors to hold up to 26 per cent stake in a bourse.
Foreign investors will not be allowed to hold more than a 5 per cent stake. The combined holdings of people resident outside the country have been restricted at 49 per cent.
No foreign institutional investor can have any representation on the governing board of a commodity exchange, the regulator said. The revised shareholding norms come into force immediately. The regulator said a commodity exchange needs to have a net worth of at least Rs.100 crore at all times.
“Since commodity derivative exchanges are financial market infrastructure institutions having an important regulatory role, there is a need to diversify their ownership structure and attract more institutional investors. The FMC directed all six commodity exchanges to amend their rules.
Compliance should be reported to the FMC by June 23.

‘Bandhan will show that the poor are also bankable’
","
The IFC (International Finance Corporation)-invested microfinance firm has, in the past, won many awards. However, Chandra Shekhar Ghosh the Chairman and Managing Director admits that he too was not prepared for the giant wave of support and adulation that came his way after the announcements made by RBI earlier this month.

It has been a busy, busy phase since then Mr.Ghosh spoke to The Hindu about his plans to scale up operations and bring Bandhan’s 55,000 clients onto a formal banking platform.

What are your plans for launching banking services?

BFSPL is a microfinance organisation, which is also registered as a non-deposit taking NBFC.
We have been working for over a decade with women, giving them business loans for taking up a host of activities. Our aim has been capacity building and we provide loans starting from Rs.1000 and going upto Rs.5 lakh for business activities and from Rs.1000 to Rs.10,000 for non-business activities such as building a sanitary latrine) and children’s education, among others. We also give pension and there are 55,000 borrowers across 22 states, covering 173 un-banked districts. About 75 per cent of Bandhan’s coverage is in rural areas.
With the proposed launch of banking services, we will cover all our clients at one go and 50 per cent of the coverage would be in un-banked areas. This perhaps will be the largest single-sweep coverage of un-banked areas….

What is the business model you are contemplating?

We have a very viable model in our micro finance business and that model should work for the bank too. The loan portfolio stood at over Rs.6200 crore in 2013-14 against Rs.4400 crore the year before.
We are targeting Rs.7500 crore this fiscal . We will maintain our profitability, which is around Rs.200 crore.
We will need investments in setting up the IT infrastructure and also for the branch roll out, but that should not be a problem.
We have a capital base of Rs.1100 crore. However, initially profit will be modest.

What will be your areas of opportunity?

We will merge the existing microfinance business with the bank.
But our thrust area will be medium and small scale sectors. Reaching the un-banked areas would be one of the biggest areas of opportunity. We will target the poor and the segment just above that.
We would like to show that the poor can also be bankable. Our entire loan portfolio is directed at priority sectors and our recovery rate is 99.5 percent.
As we graduate from a MFI to a bank, our range of services will also expand such as accepting deposits and remittances. As we start taking deposits it should become possible for us to offer loans at rates lower than the present 22 per cent.

You have a sizable manpower. How do you plan to utilise them as you roll out banking services?

We have nearly 13,000 staff who reach credit at the doorsteps of our borrowers. They are in regular touch with our clients and we hope to utilise them to raise deposits too. About 95 per cent of employees are from poor families and rural areas. We have trained them up to their present task. We will, of course, need fresh recruitments at key places and some at senior positions. But I would like to train up these youths too.

What are the challenges ahead?

My father was a sweet-maker and we were a family of eight including all the siblings. My family could not afford my education beyond my Masters. After my father’s death, as the eldest son, the task of running the family fell on me. I started my career with a NGO based in Bangladesh (just across the border from where we stayed in Agartala) and it was the biggest of its kind in the world. After that I worked for several such NGOs. I saw poverty and deprivation close at hand... I realised from the way my mother used to run our home with limited income, that women were the best money-managers. This also inspired me to start my own venture.
I started Bandhan in 2001 with money borrowed from a money lender at nearly 80 per cent annual rate of interest. We have grown year-on-year andBandhan’s client base, its branch network and loan portfolio give me immense strength.
But yes, I do foresee some challenges. And one of these is the integration of this workforce with the senior banking professional that we will need to hire. It may be a culture shock on both sides.

Oil slumps 3% on OPEC supply, China’s tariffs plan
","Oil prices fell more than $2 a barrel Friday after two of the world’s biggest producers indicated they might increase output at next week’s OPEC meeting, while U.S. exports were threatened by potential Chinese tariffs on crude oil and refined products.
Oil investors have been nervous ahead of the coming OPEC summit in Vienna. Saudi Arabia and Russia have already boosted production modestly, and have indicated they were prepared to increase output at that meeting.
Brent crude oil fell $2.50, or 3.29% to settle at $73.44 a barrel. U.S. crude settled $1.83 lower at $65.06 a barrel. In post-settlement trading, U.S. crude retreated further, falling 2.25, or 3.4%, to $64.64 a barrel.
After settlement, China announced $50 billion in retaliatory tariffs, in response to a series of levies by U.S. President Donald Trump earlier.
Some investors were surprised when crude oil and other energy products were included for tariffs at a later date, the official Xinhua news agency reported, citing the Tariff Commission of the State Council.
Over the past six months, the U.S. has exported an average 363,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil to China, which along with Canada is the biggest buyer of U.S. crude.
“They were a big outlet, and we’re going to notice it,” said John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital. “It’ll take time for other buyers to absorb that crude.” U.S. crude’s discount to Brent widened after China announced the planned tariffs. 
Rising U.S. crude output
Both contracts have drifted lower since hitting 3-1/2-year highs in May. Prices have been pressured by rising U.S. crude production, while the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, Russia and others look poised to increase output in their meeting in the Austrian capital on June 22-23.
“We’re going into an OPEC meeting where everyone is talking about raising production — the only question is by how much,” said Bob Yawger, director, energy at Mizuho. On Thursday, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after talks with Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih in Moscow that both nations “in principle” supported a gradual increase in production after restricting output for 18 months.
 Mr. Novak said one option would involve gradually raising output by 1.5 million bpd, possibly starting July 1. Mr. Falih said “I think we’ll come to an agreement that satisfies, most importantly, the market.”
Greg McKenna, chief market strategist at futures brokerage AxiTrader, said Russia seemed to want a bigger rise in production than some other producers.
“My guess is the increase will be something less than the 1 million bpd that the U.S. is supposed to have asked the Saudis for,” Mr. McKenna said.

Rupee drops marginally to 60.21 against dollar
","The rupee on Monday failed to maintain initial gains and ended lower by five paise at 60.21 against the dollar on fag-end demand for the US currency from banks and importers.
The rupee opened higher at 60.09 a dollar against last weekend’s level of 60.16 at the Interbank Foreign Exchange (Forex) market.
It firmed up further to 60 per dollar on initial dollar selling from banks and exporters amid capital inflows into equity markets.
According to provisional data from stock exchanges, foreign institutional investors (FIIs) bought shares worth a net Rs 386.95 crore last Friday.
However, fag-end dollar demand from banks and importers pulled the domestic currency to 60.21, a marginal loss of five paise from its previous close.
Meanwhile, the benchmark BSE Sensex ended 41.23 points higher at 22,445.12.
The dollar index was quoted lower by 0.01 per cent against the major currencies in the international market.
“The initial gains were supported by the gains in other Asian currencies against the dollar overseas,” said Abhishek Goenka, Founder and CEO, India Forex Advisors.
The benchmark six-month premium payable in October settled the day at 228—230 paise from last Friday’s close of 225.5—227.5 paise.
Far forward contracts maturing in April, 2015 ended at 458.5—460.5 paise against 456—458 paise previously.

To dump contractor or not to
","About one-and-a-half years after selecting a company to manage its garbage, the Mangalore City Corporation is all set to take a decision on Monday whether to allot the company the contract or not.
Though the corporation had selected a Mumbai-based company in December, 2013 to collect and transport solid waste from all the 60 wards in the city, so far it has not been issued the work order.
The fact that MCC’s Council, though elected over a year ago, was in limbo is said to have contributed to the delay. The official machinery in the civic body did not take any decision on doing away with the present multiple contractor system of collecting and transporting garbage, implementation of a new solid waste management scheme was hanging in balance.
The new scheme is called three-package solid waste management scheme. According to it the operation and maintenance of compost plant and landfill site at Pachchanady has been handed over to a Delhi-based company under a package.
The 60 wards in the city have been bifurcated as north (29 wards) and south zones (31 wards) under two packages for collecting and transporting the waste to Pachchanady.
The two packages were made to ensure two separate companies are assigned the job. But as the bid of Antony Waste Handling Pvt. Ltd., Mumbai was the lowest, the corporation selected the same company to take up the work of both the packages.
Mayor Mahabala Marla told The Hindu that the company officials have been asked to make a presentation on how they would make a difference from the existing multiple contractor system. They would have to explain about their preparedness, vehicles, manpower and other facilities required to take up the work at one go.
If it was satisfied the company might be asked to take up the work in north zone first, prove themselves and take up the south zone work later.

Srikalahasti Pipes net down on technical snag
","Srikalahasti Pipes Ltd., formerly known as Lanco Industries Ltd., has posted lower net profit at ₹17.29 crore for the first quarter ended June 30, 2018 against ₹36.44 crore for the corresponding year-earlier period due to a technical issue in mini blast furnace since May 18, said a top official. 
During the period under review, the firm’s revenue from operations dropped to ₹309.04 crore from ₹446.68 crore in the year earlier period.
“The [technical] issue has since been addressed after shutting down the plant for about 12 days during June 2018, resulting in lower production and higher cost,” said G.S. Rathi, whole time director, Srikalahasti Pipes Ltd. “The profit was further affected by the increase in the main raw materials such as coal, iron ore and ferro silicon prices.”
While expressing optimism that the loss of production would be compensated in the coming quarters due to healthy order book, he said post relining, the operations of MBF had stabilised and the company was running efficiently. 
He also said it was decided to replace the existing MBF by installing a new mini blast furnace to have liquid metal capacity of over 1,000 tonnes per day in the existing location. The same would be synchronised with existing facilities.
To utilise the surplus liquid metal available from the new MBF, the company has decided to install facilities for manufacturing of small dia ductile iron pipe capacity of 1 lakh tonnes per annum. 
As regards the proposed ferro alloys project, he said pre-project start-up activities were going on and the project was expected to commence in the current quarter.

Upstart: the electric scooter movement is a vision on wheels
"," If you are keeping up with what is happening in the startup capital of the world, San Francisco, and by extension the Bay Area, you know that the place is under the grips of a fad that very few saw coming — electric scooters. What was a toy less than a generation ago, is now the magic bullet that is believed to be capable of solving the tricky problem of last mile connectivity for urban commuters the world over. And of course, in this ‘ride sharing’ economy, you are not expected to buy these electric scooters.
It is the Uber model, just that there is no driver. You locate a scooter closest to you. Your app tells the scooter who you are and where you have picked it up. You use it to get where you wanted to get to. You get off the scooter, end the trip. It knows where you have gotten off. Whatever needs to be charged to you shall be charged. You pay in a manner that is most convenient to you. You do not mind, for you are sure that it is going to be way cheaper than any other way of having travelled that distance without breaking into a sweat. And when millions of commuters the world over adopt this behaviour, the company operating these scooters will make a killing.
At this point, a lot of Silicon Valley investors are completely sold on this utopian vision. It does not, at least not as long as you do not worry about where electricity really comes from, consume fossil fuels that are rightfully going out of fashion. And it seems perfectly suited for millennials and post-millennials, whatever they are called, who consider any energy spent outside of their fancy exercise regimens, completely unnecessary. Two companies that are into electric scooter sharing are already unicorns, Lime and Bird. And sooner than later, I am sure there will be many more.
The thing about Silicon Valley unicorns is that they are often considered bellwethers for what is going to happen elsewhere. By elsewhere, people are almost always looking at China and India, because clearly that is where the scale is, for that is where the weight of the population exerts enough pressure. And for the first time, of an overwhelming Silicon Valley trend, I feel confident enough to laugh it off.
I will start with China. It was not too long ago when Communist China was acknowledged as a place where everyone bicycled everywhere. When China made its first overtures towards capitalism, one of the earliest sort of companies that came about were those that enabled bicycle sharing. In a model that was not actually all that different from the current model followed by Lime, Bird, and other such electric scooter sharers. 
But when this bicycle sharing was tried in China, as a business, as opposed to the positioning as cool that European cities such as Amsterdam and Paris were trying, it was a disaster. Fire up your favourite search engine, and finding images of heaps of bicycles dumped haphazardly enough to cause a nuisance turns out to be a common sight from back then. And because Beijing would then get compared to a Paris or an Amsterdam, it was easy for global media to paint this as a failure of the uncivilised East. 
Funnily enough, if you look up photos of electric scooters in San Francisco today, it is pretty much a similar sight. Electric scooters haphazardly dumped all over sidewalks. Or footpaths, as we call sidewalks in India. Even in the Bay Area, there are already loud and righteously vociferous complaints about these scooters taking over sidewalks. Imagine what would happen in India, where there is hardly space on the footpaths to walk. I will leave the idea of electric scooters succeeding on the footpaths of India as an exercise to the imagination of the reader. I take no responsibility for the chaotic nightmare that may result.

Infusion to help PSBs meet norms: Moody’s
","The government’s decision to infuse ₹11,336 crore in five public sector banks will help meet the regulatory capital requirements, rating agency Moody’s said on Wednesday. 
“The infusions are credit positive and will strengthen the banks’ capitalisation.” 
‘Weakest CET1 ratios’
 “These banks’ common equity tier 1 (CET1) ratios were the weakest among all public-sector banks as of fiscal 2018, and were at the risk of breaching the minimum regulatory capital requirement of 5.5% under the Basel III norms,” Moody’s said. The banks that would receive the funds are Allahabad Bank, Andhra Bank, Corporation Bank, Indian Overseas Bank and Punjab National Bank. “The infused capital is 0.6%-2.0% of the banks’ risk-weighted assets (RWAs) as of fiscal 2018,” Moody’s said adding with this capital infusion, these banks’ CET1 ratios are expected to be above 5.5%, which is the minimum capital requirement under the Basel III norms in India.

Need ₹10 lakh cr. to raise steel output: Minister
","India would require Rs. 10 lakh crore investment to achieve its target of reaching its target of 300MT steel manufacturing capacity by 2030 and it had saved Rs. 5,000 crore worth of foreign exchange through domestic substitution of high-end steel imports.
“ What we projected or what we want that if we reach the target of 300 million tonne capacity, the creation of 300 million tonnes, we would be requiring 10 lakh crore,” Union Minister of Steel, Choudhary Birender Singh, told The Hindu and Businessline correspondents on Friday.
“And out of that 10 lakh crore, 4 lakh crore, if we don’t have the machinery made in India or ‘Make in India’ then this 4 lakh crore is to go out of the country in the shape of foreign exchange.”
“So we’re organizing a conclave in the near future, in a month or so, where we will be calling all the important machinery suppliers for steel plants. We would like that they should put up their plants so that we can purchase from them and share with us their technology in the shape of JV’s.
“This would be the most important venture as regards transfer of technology. I know that certain companies have shown a lot of interest, wanting to put up plants. This is how the 300 million tonne target is achievable,” he said.
India was the world’s third-largest steel producer in 2017, according to the India Brand Equity Foundation. The growth in the Indian steel sector has been driven by the domestic availability of raw materials such as iron ore and cost-effective labour.
India is expected to become the second largest steel producer in the world by 2018, based on increased capacity addition in anticipation of upcoming demand, and the new steel policy, that has been approved by the Union Cabinet in May 2017, is expected to boost India's steel production.
Mr. Singh said the Rs. 5,000 crore saving had been achieved through an increase in output of high-end steel for infrastructure, automobile, defence and medical equipment sectors. Government’ initiatives have reduced imports by 36% to 7.48 million tonnes, he said.
 “We are on the job of substitution of high-quality steel. By a substantial portion of steel production locally and reduction in imports and our dependence on other countries has to come down.”
He said when the scrapple policy comes into effect the demand for domestic steel would increase.
India’s crude steel output grew 5.87% year-on-year to 101.227 million tonnes (MT) in CY 2017. Crude steel production reached 93.183 MT during April-February 2017-18, according to India Brand Foundation. Total consumption of finished steel stood at 81.943 MT during April-February 2017-18. 
The Union Cabinet, Government of India has approved the National Steel Policy (NSP) 2017, as it seeks to create a globally competitive steel industry in India. NSP 2017 targets 300 million tonnes (MT) steel-making capacity and 160 kgs per capita steel consumption by 2030
The Ministry of Steel is facilitating setting up of an industry driven Steel Research and Technology Mission of India (SRTMI) in association with the public and private sector steel companies to spearhead research and development activities in the iron and steel industry at an initial corpus of Rs. 200 crore.

Key monetary tools at the RBI’s disposal
","The Reserve Bank of India (RBI), earlier this month, raised its policy repo rate by 25 basis points to 6.25%, the central bank’s first interest rate increase in four-and-a-half years.
Banks need to hold some portion of their deposits in cash with the RBI. This ratio is called CRR. If the RBI cuts CRR, banks will be left with more money to lend or invest. On the other hand, if the CRR is raised, banks will have lesser money to lend.
RBI uses CRR to absorb excess liquidity or to release funds needed for economic growth. The present CRR is 4%.
When a bank’s deposits increase by ₹100, and if the CRR is 4%, the banks will have to park ₹4 with the RBI. The bank can use only ₹96 for investments and lending purposes.
Banks also have to invest a certain portion of their deposits in government securities with the RBI. This percentage is known as SLR. Banks can earn return on these investments. The current SLR is 19.5%. If a deposit of ₹100 is made in a bank, then the bank will have to invest ₹19.5 in government securities. So, to meet CRR and SLR requirements, a bank has to earmark ₹23.5 (4+19.5).
When banks need money they can borrow from the RBI against their surplus government securities at a fixed interest rate. This rate is known as the repo rate. The higher the repo rate, the higher the cost of short-term money to the banks and vice versa. Generally, whenever the repo rate is raised, banks pass the burden on to customers.
If the repo rate is lowered, then banks can potentially charge lower interest rates on the loans taken by borrowers.
What is the reverse repo rate?
The reverse repo rate is the rate of interest offered by RBI, when banks deposit their surplus funds with the RBI for short periods. The reverse repo rate at present is 6%.

BSNL aims to double post-paid users in one year
","As it aims to double its post-paid mobile customer base to 10 per cent in one year, BSNL has launched a facility wherein bills can be paid at over 5 lakh of its franchises or retailers all the seven days in a week.
The State-owned telecom firm has been citing bill payment problem as one of the issues for decline in its high revenue post-paid customer base.
“One of the reason for our declining post-paid users was the problems related to bill payment. But with the launch of this new facility from May 1, we are targeting to double our post-paid users to 10 per cent by May next year,” BSNL Director (Consumer Mobility) Anupam Shrivastava told PTI.
Currently, 5 per cent of BSNL’s users are post paid as most of them prefer pre-paid due to hassles in bill payment.
Customers had to pay the bills on BSNL’s counters and billing centres during working hours only, which used to be a problem for working professionals.
The state-run company had 9.48 crore wireless subscribers at the end of February 2014.
“The average revenue per user (ARPU) for post-paid is around Rs. 400 whereas for pre-paid, it is in the range of Rs 90-100. It will be good for BSNL’s profitability, if we can increase the post paid users,” Mr. Shrivastava said.
He added the company has attractive post-paid plans but most of the people prefer pre-paid due to bill payment.
BSNL has a network of around 5 lakh franchisees and retailers across the country. The new facility will allow users to pay bills all the seven days and also during government holidays.
No additional amount will be charged from customers for using this facility.
BSNL has been logging losses since 2009-10. The company’s profits started declining after 2004-05, when it had made net gains of Rs. 10,183 crore.
The government had also constituted a Group of Ministers (GoM) for revival of BSNL and MTNL.

Oil rises as U.S. sanctions on Iran cloud supply view
","Oil prices rose more than 1% on Friday, supported by signs that U.S. sanctions on Iran are already reducing global crude supply.
Benchmark Brent crude oil rose $1.30 a barrel to a high of $76.03 by 1425 GMT, on track for gains of more than 5% this week. U.S. crude was $1.20 higher at $69.03, heading for a weekly rise of more than 4%.
“Both crude markers are on track to end a steady run of weekly declines. This is largely due to a tightening fundamental outlook on the back of looming Iranian supply shortages,” said Stephen Brennock, analyst at London brokerage PVM Oil Associates.
The U.S. Government reimposed sanctions on Iran this month after withdrawing from a 2015 international nuclear deal, which Washington saw as inadequate for curbing Tehran’s activities in the Middle East and denying it the means to make an atomic bomb. Tehran says it has no ambitions to make such a weapon.
Iran is the third-biggest producer in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, supplying around 2.5 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude and condensate to markets this year, equivalent to about 2.5% of global consumption.
“Third-party reports indicate that Iranian tanker loadings are already down by about 700,000 bpd in the first half of August relative to July, which if it holds will exceed most expectations,” U.S. investment bank Jefferies said on Friday.
“We expect that by Q4 the market will be dealing with either undersupply, dwindling spare capacity - or both,” it added.
Energy consultancy FGE says it expects Iran’s crude and condensate exports to drop below 1 million bpd by mid-2019.
Market sentiment was cautious, however, after talks between U.S. and Chinese officials aimed at resolving an escalating trade dispute ended on Thursday with no major breakthrough.
Instead, both countries activated another round of tariffs on $16 billion worth of each other’s goods.
“Investors are likely to feel nervous as the two countries vow to step up the pressure,” ANZ bank said.
Economists say a prolonged trade war would reduce business activity in the United States and China, and stifle world economic growth. Despite the trade war, China’s Unipec will resume purchases of U.S. crude oil in October, sources said. Traders kept an eye on North Sea, where workers on three oil and gas platforms plan to go on strike.

Centre shelves Air India privatisation plan

He added that measures such as cutting down costs as well as monetisation of Air India’s assets will be adopted in order to run the airline.
The source attributed the lack of interest in the disinvestment process to rising fuel prices and hinted that the government could revisit the plan to offload its stake in Air India at a later stage.
The decision was taken at a meeting convened by senior BJP leader and Union Minister Arun Jaitley on Monday.
The broad contours of Air India’s privatisation were made public in March-end and interested players were invited to place initial bids.
However, when the deadline to submit the bids ended on May 31, no player came forward to express its interest in buying the airline.
The government had offered to sell 76% of its stake in Air India, along with low-cost subsidiary Air India Express and its 50% share in ground handling arm AISATS as a single entity. The buyer would have to take on the debt and current liabilities of ₹33,392 crore.
Many players had raised questions about the huge size of the debt, the government’s refusal to exit completely from the airline as well as sought clarity on the benefits and obligations towards more than 15,000 permanent and contractual employees.
However, the government had said that continuing to hold some stake in Air India would help it to service the share of the debt of approximately ₹25,000 crore it was not passing on to the new buyer.
Aviation think-tank CAPA says the government’s decision does not bode well for the beleaguered airline.
“We are disappointed with the government’s decision not to go ahead with AI’s divestment. Continuing government ownership and the lack of a clear road map will lead AI to extreme insignificance and possibly closure. There will never be a perfect timing for AI divestment as conditions for divestment have to be structured by some bold decisions,” said Kapil Kaul, CEO & Director, CAPA South Asia.
He said the government will have to focus on comprehensive restructuring of the airline under a special administration to scale down losses significantly.
The airline has already sought short-term loans of ₹1,000 crore after it was unable to pay the salaries of its employees earlier this month.
A turnaround plan approved by the UPA-2 government in 2012 provided for financial assistance to the tune of ₹30,000 crore over a 10-year period for the carrier. Of this, the airline has received more than ₹26,000 crore. It was also required for the airline to monetise its land assets and generate ₹5,000 crore over a 10-year period until 2021 but the airline has only been able to garner a mere ₹445 crore, as per the government in Parliament in February.

Bank employee unions flay BoM chief’s arrest
","A day after Ravindra Marathe, the MD & CEO of Bank of Maharashtra, was arrested by the Pune police, bank employee unions strongly criticised the action and wrote to the government decrying the ‘unjustifiable harassment’. 
On Wednesday, six officials of the bank were arrested on allegations of misuse of powers in extending loan to real estate developer — D.S. Kulkarni Developers. 
“What is surprising is that these executives, who as per information, are not connected with the cheating by DSK, and hence arresting them at this stage is unwarranted,” the general secretary of the All India Bank Employees’ Association (AIBEA) wrote in a letter to Financial Services Secretary Rajiv Kumar. 
‘Fully secured’
During the bank’s AGM on Thursday, executive director A.C. Rout said the bank’s total exposure to D.S. Kulkarni Developers was about ₹94.52 crore, which was fully secured. BoM had also declared DSK Developers and its promoters as wilful defaulters and started auctioning some of the assets. 
“If, according to government, Bank of Maharashtra executives are involved in the scam and are part of any fraudulent activity, their arrest is justifiable. Otherwise, the government should step in and take up the matter with Govt. of Maharashtra and Pune Police for necessary correction and remedy,” AIBEA wrote.

Swiss cable solutions firm eyes data centre growth ","R&M (Reichle & De-Massari AG), has set up a manufacturing facility in Bengaluru, as the Swiss cabling solutions provider aims to tap a surge in demand from communication networks and data centres in the country. 
The company plans to set up another greenfield facility in India within two years to make advanced cabling components, Gaurav Ahluwalia, MD R&M India, said in a telephone interview.
“We started four years back by acquiring a small fiber company called Advanced Fibre Systems (AFS) that was about less than 30 people with less than eight-crore rupee turnover.
“As of now, we have 300 employees. We have already crossed the 100 crore turnover now. We are the major suppliers to all the telcos in India, including Bharti and Jio. This [manufacturing facility] is the first investment done in Asia Pacific,” he said. The AFS acquisition was the first one in 50 years of the company’s history. 
“With this success, we went ahead and did acquisitions in the U.S. and Czech Republic and Brazil. With this model, they might be looking at other Asia Pacific regions also.”
The company’s solutions are used by network operators, in office buildings, data centres, apartments, as well as in the industry. R&M operates in Europe, the Middle East and in Asia. 
R&M achieved sales of Swiss Francs 232.1 million in 2017, with 80% of that figure being generated overseas. The company is wholly owned by Martin and Peter Reichle. “In India, we are already developing the design and doing the engineering for molds for some customers in Europe. Now we want to make India the global hub for designing of the mold and engineering of the products. They are looking to expand this from India to Europe and India to the U.S. also,” Mr. Ahluwalia said.
He said the demand for the company’s products was primarily driven by data centres.
Rapid growth
The APAC market is growing rapidly with a 25% market share at $42 billion and the Middle East and Africa region hold a 3% share with nearly $6 billion in investments, according to Cushman & Wakefield, a 100-year-old real estate brokerage giant backed by private equity firm TPG.
Digital data in India was about 40,000 petabytes in 2010 and this number is projected to go up to 2.3 million petabytes by 2020, twice as fast as the worldwide rate
India had a data centre capacity of 1.3 million square feet in 2007, which is expected to go up to 10.9 million square feet by the end of 2018 at a compounded annual growth rate of 19.8% (excluding the data centres smaller than 1,000 square feet). Mr. Ahluwalia said R&M will employ 600 people within two years.
“With the new regulation coming into India that data centres have to be located in India, there is going to be a good demand for those in India. The second is the Giga fiber application from Jio. This is going to drive the demand for the next five years.” R&M is also investing in warehouses with a current capacity of 12,000 square feet. “We carry over ₹30 crore of fiber component to meet the demand.”
“All the fiber adapters, connectors we are still getting from our plant in Europe and we are assembling those here in India. We look forward to making most parts in India,” he said.
For the Smart City projects in cities such as Nagpur, Vizag, Hyderabad, Pune, Raipur and Mumbai, R&M has already executed cabling projects. “Few more are in the pipeline.”

‘Reserves firepower to help stem rupee’s losses’
","India believes the current slide in the rupee will not be prolonged as it has adequate “firepower” of foreign exchange reserves to deal with the current volatility, a senior finance ministry official said.
The volatility is being driven by global factors, including proposed U.S. sanctions on Iran and the mismatch in demand and supply of oil, said Subhash Chandra Garg, the economic affairs secretary in the finance ministry.
Policy makers are also worried that the ongoing trade war between the U.S. and China could adversely impact exports from emerging markets, including India, while discouraging capital inflows — putting pressure on the rupee.
The rupee is down about 7% so far this year, making it the worst performing currency in Asia.
Besides using reserves, economists said the Reserve Bank of India, which raised rates in May by 25 basis points to mark the first tightening in more than four years, could raise rates again.
“We could see a couple of rate hikes in the current monetary cycle,” said N. R. Bhanumurthy, an economist at the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy.
However, he added a further increase in the key repo rate could squeeze credit for companies as well as lead to some cuts in capital spending by the government — dragging down economic growth. “We may not be able to achieve even 7% growth this fiscal,” he said. The rupee, which fell to a record low of 69.095 per dollar before recovering to end at 68.79 on Thursday, rebounded on Friday to close at 68.46.
Adequate firepower?
New Delhi feels that with forex reserves amounting to $410 billion as of June 15, it could deal with the current storm. “We have adequate reserves, there is adequate firepower,” Mr. Garg said.
But reserves are already down from their record high of $426.08 billion as of April 13, prompting traders to believe a large part of this decline has been due to dollar sales by the central bank to prop up the currency.
“The RBI seems to be instrumental in rescuing [the] rupee from its low of 69.10 to current prices,” said Pritam Kumar Patnaik, Business Head at Reliance Commodities. “We expect them to keep participating as and when the rupee falls below the 69 to a dollar level.”
But he added: “While they can exercise control on the domestic markets, they will have little or no control on the NDF (non-deliverable forward) markets, which has been setting the trend post our market close.”
Three-month dollar/rupee contracts were changing hands at 69.35/47 levels in the offshore NDF market.
Mr. Garg said other tools were also available to stem the rupee’s decline. If needed, the government could raise funds through foreign currency non-repatriable (FCNR) deposits, sovereign bonds or other routes to increase reserves, he said.
“If we assess at any stage that we need to buttress or refurbish our reserves, the options are open,” Mr. Garg said, adding “that situation has not arisen.” Compared to a crisis in 2013, the current situation was much better, mainly due to higher forex reserves, services exports and inflow of remittances by non-resident Indians, the secretary said.
Mr. Garg, who coordinates government policy with the RBI, said the trade deficit was expected to widen in the current year, mainly due to rising crude oil prices. He said any further rise in oil prices could further widen the trade deficit and put pressure on the rupee, but the situation was not clear at this stage.
‘A storm’
“We are not even certain what kind of a storm it is or even if it is a storm or whether it will turn out to be a storm.” 
Mr. Garg also said it was too early to say what impact the fall in the rupee would have on inflation. “Inflation situation is not worrisome at the moment. You have the facility of adjustment [of interest rates] every two months, and the Monetary Policy Committee will take an appropriate view.” 
The Centre, however, believes the economic situation will not worsen, he said, adding “I do not see any need to increase rates.”

Kochhar eyes I-Sec board slot
","Chanda Kochhar, who is in the midst of a probe by ICICI Bank and other regulatory agencies, is seeking reappointment as a director on the board of ICICI Securities, the financial services arm of the ICICI Group.
The AGM of the recently listed entity will be held on August 30, where shareholders can vote on the reappointment of Ms. Kochhar, 56, who has been on the board of ICICI Securities since October 2008.
Ms. Kochhar, who is currently on leave, is facing conflict of interest allegations, with ICICI Bank setting up an independent panel under former Supreme Court judge B.N. Srikrishna to look into the matter.
Separately, SEBI and CBI are conducting inquiries in the matter involving the Videocon group and NuPower Renewables, a firm run by Ms. Kochhar’s husband Deepak Kochhar.
Interestingly, proxy advisory firms are of the view that shareholders can vote for the reappointment of Ms. Kochhar as till date no inquiry report has confirmed the allegations against the ICICI Bank chief.
“Currently, there are only allegations against her and one cannot take a negative view based on allegations,” said J.N. Gupta, MD, Stakeholders Empowerment Services. “Till date, there is neither any regulatory action against her nor there are any findings of the Srikrishna panel. So we are not recommending voting against her reappointment,” Mr. Gupta added. 
Ms. Kochhar serves as a director on various other ICICI Group companies such as ICICI Bank, ICICI Lombard General Insurance Company and ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Company, ICICI Prudential Asset Management Company and ICICI Bank Canada. 
Shares under pressure

Low recoveries of NPAs: RBI data
","While public sector banks have claimed a ₹1,50,960 crore reduction in their non-performing asset (NPA) levels over 2017-18, about 55% of this was due to write-offs and only 27% was actual recoveries, according to data provided by RBI Governor Urjit Patel to the parliamentary Standing Committee on Finance.
According to the data reviewed by The Hindu, public sector banks saw a ₹1,50,960 crore reduction in their NPA levels from the start of financial year 2017-18 till December 31, 2017. However, the data also showed that the same period saw ₹2,37,475 crore of loans being added to the NPA list, thereby leading to an overall worsening of the NPA situation. Further, within the ₹1,50,960 crore ‘reduction in NPAs’, about 55% or ₹84,272 crore was due to write-offs. The data shows that only ₹41,391 crore, or 27%, of the reduction in NPA levels was due to actual recoveries. In addition, ₹25,297 crore worth of loans were upgraded from NPA status.
 

Urjit Patel assures parliamentary panel of steps to strengthen banking system


Private sector banks saw a reduction of ₹46,091 crore in their NPA levels by December 31, 2017 compared with what they were as of April 1, 2017. But, fresh additions to the NPA list amounted to ₹60,800 crore.
For private sector banks, about 40.2% of the reduction in their NPA levels was due to write-offs. Actual recoveries accounted for 34.2% of the reduction, while upgrades accounted for 24.1% of the reductions. Gross NPAs with public sector banks stood at ₹7,77,280 crore at the end of December 2017, up from ₹5,39,968 crore as on March 31, 2016. For private sector banks, gross NPA levels grew to ₹1,07,796 crore by December 31, 2017 from ₹55,853 crore as on March 31, 2016.
The data also showed that bank frauds increased in both number and value over the last three years.
While 4,693 frauds of more than ₹1 lakh were reported in 2015-16, this increased to 5,904 in 2017-18, an increase of about 26%. Over the same period, the value of these frauds increased from ₹18,698.8 crore to ₹32,361.27 crore.

Trade deficit greater concern than rupee, says NITI chief
","NITI Aayog Vice-Chairman Rajiv Kumar said on Tuesday that he was more concerned about the rising trade deficit than the falling rupee, and called for efforts to push exports.
“I don’t believe in strong rupee... Rupee should remain in its natural value, some countries depreciate their currency deliberately, this is wrong. It will be very difficult for India to try and push up the rupee,” Mr. Kumar said at an event organised by industry body CII.
“There is a constituency that benefits from strong rupee...The constituency should be put on back foot,” he added. The rupee on August 16 had slumped to life-time low of 70.32 on strong demand for the U.S. dollar.
Mr. Kumar further said that economic policy making should not focus only on fiscal deficit number, arguing that large economies like USA, China and European Union do not give much importance to fiscal deficit.
“Nobody is playing by rules, so we should learn to play as it suits our requirements,” he said.
He pointed out that at a time when private investment is low, then the aggregate demand can be brought up by public spending. He said however that some revenue expenditure can be just be brought to zero. The main worry, he added, is trade deficit. “I think it will be much better to try and push exports, as our share in world trade is low. Even our share in services sector in world trade is lower than China’s,” he noted.

HOPCOMS to set up large supermarket-type store in Mysore
","Horticultural Producers’ Cooperative Marketing and Processing Society (HOPCOMS), Mysore, is coming up with a large supermarket-type “bazaar” for farm-fresh vegetables and fruits on a two-acre plot near the Lalitha Mahal Palace here.
Unlike its 43 outlets here, the HOPCOMS plans to give a new and modern touch to the upcoming store on the lines of fruit and vegetable sections in supermarkets and malls. The new store is coming up at a cost of Rs. 20 lakh with funding from the Karnataka Horticulture Federation (KHF).
With ample space for parking, customers can also purchase fruit juices, which will be sold in a lounge, apart from shopping.
The KHF is supporting the modernisation of HOPCOMS outlets. One of its oldest outlets at the city bus-stand here was modernised a few years ago.
Managing director (in-charge), HOPCOMS, K.B. Krishnamurthy told The Hindu that the work is under way to build the store at a farm (previously under the control of the Horticulture Department) which also houses a procurement centre and a fruit ripening chamber. “The proposed store is an attempt to provide more facilities to customers,” he said.
Mr. Krishnamurthy said there were also plans to market packaged fruit juices of private manufacturers at HOPCOMS outlets here to improve their earnings.
“The HOPCOMS outlets in Bangalore have already been marketing juices of private companies and therefore a proposal will be placed before the governing council here seeking its nod for replicating the model,” he said.

Profit

The Mysore HOPCOMS made a net profit of Rs. 50 lakh last year. Despite competition from supermarkets, it earned good revenue, thanks to the support from the department, the officials and the staff, Mr. Krishnamurthy said.
“The staff had no option but to work hard and improve earnings to remain in the market,” Mr. Krishnamurthy said.
Revenue is expected to go up further with a proposal to open 11 new outlets here, he added.
The grape juice sold by HOPCOMS in 200 ml bottles has established a market here, despite competition from private packaged fruit juices. It is sold in paper cups at its outlet at the city bus-stand. With summer peaking, sales of the juice have picked up.
“Only the grape juice is fast moving. We had also introduced mango juice, but it did not receive a good response,” he said.

India to defend GSP benefits at USTR
","India is expected to challenge charges levelled against it by the U.S dairy and medical devices industries at a hearing before the United States Trade Representative (USTR) office scheduled for Tuesday and defend its eligibility for benefits under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) programme.
The GSP programme provides for the duty-free treatment of designated articles when imported from beneficiary developing countries to America. What is at stake is exports worth about $5 billion annually, of 1,937 products from India. The USTR is reviewing India’s eligibility under the programme, after complaints from bodies representing the dairy and medical devices industry. The USTR had accused India of implementing “a wide array of trade barriers that create serious negative effects on U.S. commerce,” in April, announcing the review. The petitions calling for a review of India’s GSP benefits, “based on concerns that India has allegedly created trade barriers for these industries,” are “without substantive merits,” Indian embassy official Puneet Roy Kundal said in a written submission to the USTR. Mr. Kundal was also scheduled to participate in the hearing.
“India requires that dairy products [be] derived from animals which have never consumed any feeds containing internal organs, blood meal, or tissues of ruminant origin.
“In this regard, India has explained to the U.S that India’s position is based on religious, cultural and moral grounds. India is committed to respect the religious and cultural beliefs of its people and it will be inappropriate to impute any other considerations to this decision,” India told the USTR, pointing out that several countries export dairy products to India, meeting these requirements.
India imports dairy products from countries such as Australia and Switzerland. India will tell the USTR that this is not a question of market access but of certifications. “If several countries can meet this certification requirement, how can’t the U.S?” wondered an Indian official.
Defends price control
Defending India’s measures to control prices of the medical devices, the submission said, the country was committed to providing its citizens with equitable and affordable access to essential medicines and medical devices. But this is a huge business opportunity for American companies, the submission argues. “The large size of the Indian population…is likely to benefit U.S and other multinational companies involved in manufacturing of such devices,” it said.
Indian submission also seeks to address the Donald Trump administration’s protectionist political platform. “..An examination of the top GSP benefiting imports into the U.S shows that Indian products receiving GSP benefits are intermediary goods which are not bound to cause any injury to domestically manufactured goods in the U.S.,” it said. Of the total value of merchandise imports of the U.S. approximately $2.36 trillion only $5.6 billion, it pointed out. A USTR delegation will be travelling to India next week for further negotiations on a host of trade issues between the countries, which remained inconclusive after Commerce Minister Suresh Prabhu’s visit to the U.S. last week.

GST fuels warehouse space demand in first half: CBRE ","Leasing activity in India’s Industrial and Logistics space gained 45% in the first half of 2018 to close to 10 million sq.ft. of space as compared with H1 2017, mainly owing to GST implementation, CBRE said in a report.
The transactions were primarily driven by consolidation and expansion initiatives of e-commerce, 3PL, retail, and engineering and manufacturing companies, which together accounted for more than 75% of the leasing during the period. 
“This is as a result of the policy reforms that the sector has undergone in the past two years (particularly the implementation of the GST), as more and more corporates in this sector consolidate their operations and locate closer to consumption hubs, thereby driving demand for larger warehouses,” the realty firm said. 
The average size of acquired space increased from 75,000 sq. ft. during H1 2017 to close to 90,000 sq. ft. during H1 2018. 
Bengaluru tops
The overall demand for logistics and warehousing space was largely concentrated in Bengaluru (25%), Delhi-NCR (21%) and Mumbai (20%). Chennai and Hyderabad also reported sizeable transaction activity and accounted for about 12% and 10% of the demand respectively. Smaller cities such as Kolkata, Ahmedabad and Pune collectively held a share of 12%. “Going forward, we foresee the use of innovative technology solutions being the game-changer for the sector,” Anshuman Magazine, chairman, India and South East Asia, CBRE, said in a statement.
“As the sector witnesses the use of technology, coupled with the government’s reform push, corporates across all sectors would be driven to opt for large, modern warehouses,” he said.
 “The entry of various private equity firms and foreign players in the Indian logistics market would boost quality supply, hence propelling demand. Cities such as Mumbai, Pune and Chennai would remain major investment destinations, with Delhi-NCR and Bengaluru also being on the investors’ radar,” he added.

Fatal flaws in Balanced Scorecard execution
","Twenty-six years after it was conceptualised, the Balanced Scorecard (BSC) continues to be a staple in the manager’s arsenal. Its holistic focus, simple design and widespread acceptance make it a tool for corporates, NGOs and even governments. Most modern organisations implement some form of the BSC for performance management. However, very few of them are realising the true benefits of the tool.
Results are often relegated to Excel sheets in unused folders, and the blame for that lies squarely with poor design.
Fundamentally, the BSC is meant to be a reflection of a firm’s strategy. This implies a top-down approach, starting with a strategy map and cascading across the organisation. The 2018 Global BSC Usage Survey, which includes India, indicates that companies that engage in cascading, tend to be 45% more satisfied with their outcomes. Our practice corroborates this. In the instance of one client, achievement rates on shared metrics exceed that on individual metrics by over 20% — largely due to collaboration between teams. In general, though, many organisations fail to articulate a strategy map and create scorecards as a bottom-up process, completely defeating the purpose of the exercise.
The next fatal error is looking at metrics for metrics’ sake. We’ve all heard ‘what gets measured, gets done.’ This has led to an overdose of metrics. Many organisations use the BSC to capture a laundry list resembling the job description. Can any one person actually focus on dozens of metrics? Our work has reinforced our belief in having not more than 5-10 metrics per individual.
Again, the 2018 survey showed firms with fewer metrics derive greater satisfaction from the tool. It’s critical to ensure these metrics are truly important and measurable. An MXV analysis across thousands of scorecards showed the average rating on quantitative metrics 2.7 (out of 5), while qualitative metrics averaged 4.2, or 56% higher and clearly demonstrating various rating biases. Having fewer metrics ensures alignment and clarity. Making metrics measurable reduces bias and quickens the review cycle.
The third error is to do with inertia. Scorecards need to be dynamic. In some environments, for example start-ups, that may be as frequent as a quarter. Even the most slow-changing environments need an annual revision that ties into the strategy development and business planning process. Again, we find many scorecards are not reviewed for several years, making them as obsolete as the processes they replaced! Automation can help, putting control in the hands of managers and enabling them to use the tool as it was meant to be.
The BSC is an elegant tool suited to the needs of Indian organisations. Thoughtfully designed, it can be a key driver of company performance and growth instead of just another HR initiative that managers pray to avoid.

Coal use to rise on power uptick: Crisil
","Consumption of non-coking coal is forecast to climb to 1,076 million tonnes in fiscal 2023, from 826 million tonnes in fiscal 2018, Crisil Research said in a report. 
In a sectoral study, Crisil Research also said that non-coking coal imports would decline to 145 million tonnes in fiscal 2023 from 162 million tonnes in fiscal 2018. However, this would be due to lower imports by non-power sector which has seen improved domestic supply after linkage auctions. Overall, the power sector, with improved plant load factors, has driven domestic coal consumption. 
On coking coal, the report said that imports would remain high as domestic supply of metallurgical coking coal is estimated at 19 million tonnes against a demand of 65 million tonnes in FY23.
Global coking coal prices are expected to soften but still be dear at about $ 190 to $200 per tonne this year according to the Crisil analysis, noting a worldwide revival in steel demand. Production too is expected to improve led by resumption of coal mines which were closed earlier and resolution of transport bottlenecks in some of the mining countries. However, these easing of supply constraints may lead to prices dropping to about $175 to $185 per tonne next year, Crisil Research said.
It said that Coal India is expected to increase its output through increased production from large blocks. 
Domestic non-coking coal prices would be governed by linkage prices, auction of linkages and spot auctions. Edelweiss Research said that robust international prices will support CIL’s e-auction premium amid a demand uptick in both power and non-power sectors.

High-level panel suggests setting up of FRA
","The high-level working group set up to suggest strengthening of the resolution regime, on Friday, recommended setting up of a single Financial Resolution Authority (FRA) that is institutionally independent of regulators and the Government.
“The mandate of FRA will be to resolve failed financial institutions and financial markets infrastructures (FMIs) — other than those owned and operated by Reserve Bank of India (RBI) — along with providing deposit insurance and protection to insurance policy holders and investors / clients within limits, if required at the resolution stage,” the group said in its report.
The FRA should be the sole authority responsible for operation and implementation of the financial resolution framework, including the decision to choose the appropriate resolution tool, except the power to take an institution into temporary public ownership (TPO) that will be invoked by the government on the recommendation of the FRA.
This working group was set up by the sub-committee of the Financial Stability and Development Council (FSDC).
FRA can be set up by either transforming the present Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation  (DICGC) into FRA or by setting up a new authority, namely, FRA that will subsume DICGC.
“The aim of resolution is not to preserve the failing institution, but to ensure the continuity of the functions that are critical for the financial system as a whole and limit any use of taxpayers’ money,” the group stated in its report.
The group recommended that as the ultimate objective of regulation and supervision in India was to protect the interests of depositors, insurance policyholders, and investors, the proposed statute for financial resolution framework should explicitly provide for preference to be given to depositors, insurance policyholders and investors over other unsecured creditors in resolution of failed financial institu- tions.
It also said that equal treatment may be provided to uninsured depositors of banks and claims of DICGC on account of payments made to insured depositors.
To ensure that regulators/supervisors can intervene at a sufficiently early stage with clear trigger levels to prevent the institution from reaching situation of non-viability, the group recommended each financial sector regulator/supervisor to formulate a prompt corrective action (PCA) framework for the institutions under their regulatory jurisdiction.

SEBI to review MF expense ratio limits
","The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) might soon review the expense ratio limits for mutual funds to address concerns related to concentration of profits among a few large fund houses. 
Hinting that the regulator might take a relook at the norms, SEBI chairman Ajay Tyagi said that a review would serve to encourage healthy competition.
‘Healthy competition’
“You would appreciate that from an overall industry perspective, some thinking is definitely required to bring in elements that facilitate a healthy competition in the industry,” Mr. Tyagi said, while speaking at an event organised by the Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI). The SEBI chief made the statement in the context of the fact that the revenue of the seven largest fund houses exceeds 60% of the total industry revenue, while the profit margin of large mutual funds is in the range of 40-50%. Expense ratio, which broadly ranges between 0.75% to 2.5%, is the fee that fund houses charge investors to manage all the expenses of the fund house.
“It is apparent, therefore, that large AMCs have a fairly high market share of the total AUM, revenues and profits for the industry as a whole, indicating a high concentration of the industry in a few hands. Is this concentration due to lack of adequate competition in the fund space? Are such disproportionately high profits due to high Total Expense Ratio (TERs), especially in equity funds?,” Mr. Tyagi pondered.
The SEBI chairman also said that fund houses should maintain an arm’s length relationship with respect to related party investments to avoid any conflict of interest. 
“Some recent cases, the details of which I need not get into, do not augur well with the public service character of the industry and have to be avoided at all costs. An arm’s length relationship with respect to related party investments as also avoiding conflict of interest is the need of the hour,” he said. 
Recently, there were reports that the capital market watchdog had directed ICICI Prudential Mutual Fund to return the money to its schemes that invested in the public issue of ICICI Securities.
AUM growth
Lauding the performance of the mutual fund industry, the SEBI chief highlighted the fact that the AUM has more than doubled in the last five years to touch ₹23 trillion in June. 
“The customer base of mutual funds is also growing at a healthy rate with nearly 7.59 crore folios in July 2018, as against 5.99 crore folios in July 2017 — an increase of around 27% over one year,” Mr. Tyagi said.
Further, the share of the cities beyond the top 15 (B-15) in the overall AUM climbed from 12.7 % in 2012-13 to 17.7 % in 2017-18, he said, adding that the fund houses should now concentrate on B-30 centres.
“I hope that the dispensation to allow AMCs to charge additional TER (up to 30 bps) of new inflows from beyond top 30 cities, would facilitate in further deepening the industry,” Mr. Tyagi said.
He, however, added that the AUM as a share of the gross domestic product is only 11%, while it is 100% in the US.

The data shows that 7,43,608 new subscribers enrolled in EPFO in May 2018, up from 6,76,147 in April, registering a growth of 10%. Within this, about 34% of the subscribers were in the age group of 18-21 years, 25% in the 22-25 year age group, and 14.2% in the 29-35 age group.
Similarly, the number of new subscribers in the ESIC stood at 12,75,658 in May compared with 10,45,048 in April, a growth of 22%. Here too, the 22-25 age group contributed the highest proportion — 27.6% — of the new subscribers, followed by the 18-21 age group, which accounted for 21% of the new subscribers.
The number of new subscribers in NPS grew to 56,336 in May 2018, from 46,863 in April, a growth of 20.2%.
In NPS, the highest contribution to the number of new subscribers came from the above 35 years age group, which made up 29.3% of the new subscribers.
The Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation, however, clarified that simply looking at this data would not provide a complete picture of formal employment in the country.
“As mentioned in the earlier series, the levels of employment are from various sources, there are elements of overlap and the estimates are not additive,” the Ministry said in the release. “The present report gives different perspectives on the levels of employment in the formal sector and does not measure employment at a holistic level.”

Fund managers turn to tech, financials as trade worries rise ","The rising tensions over global trade policy are prompting some top-performing international fund managers to look for the companies that can emerge as winners.
Fund managers from firms including AllianceBernstein, Causeway Capital Management and Janus Henderson are adding to positions in companies ranging from Italy’s largest bank to China’s largest e-commerce company, all in hopes of avoiding the fallout from a global trade war.
Chief among the corporate attributes fund managers are now looking for are either a strong domestic business that would not be significantly affected by import tariffs, or a dominant market position, or intellectual property that would prompt customers to continue to buy its goods regardless of additional taxes.
‘Growth stories’
“The impact of a tariff is becoming a bigger factor in our decision-making,” said George Maris, a portfolio manager of the $2.2 billion Janus Henderson Global Select fund. Mr. Maris has increased his position in companies such as Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holdings that are dominating their domestic markets.
“Secular growth stories overwhelm the threat of increased trade frictions every time,” he said.
 U.S. President Donald Trump said he was pushing ahead with tariffs on $50 billion of Chinese imports on Friday, and the smouldering trade war between the world’s two largest economies showed signs of igniting. 
Mr. Trump laid out a list of more than 800 strategically important imports from China that would be subject to a 25% tariff starting on July 6 including cars, the latest hard-line stance on trade by a U.S. president who has been wrangling with allies.
The European Union, meanwhile, has challenged aluminium and steel tariffs imposed by the Trump administration at the World Trade Organization and has drawn up a list of goods it would hit with retaliatory measures.
The threat of tariffs, along with rising U.S. interest rates, helped sink global stock markets in February. Since then, major stock indices have recovered most of their gains, with the U.S. S&P 500 index up 4.9% for the year to date and the Stoxx 600 index of companies in the European Union up 2.5% over the same time.
Conor Muldoon, a portfolio manager of the $8.7 billion Causeway International Value fund, said that trade and other macroeconomic concerns are “presenting short-term opportunities.” The fund has been increasing its position in Italian bank UniCredit SpA, for instance, after its shares sold off in March following elections that renewed concerns about whether the country could exit the eurozone.
Mr. Muldoon’s fund is also increasing its position in durgmakers such as GlaxoSmithKline and Japan’s Takeda Pharmaceutical that have strong drug pipelines, he said. Shares of GlaxoSmithKline are up 19.5% year to date, while shares of Takeda are down 32% over the same time after it raised its $62 billion bid for Shire Plc.
Sammy Suzuki, a co-portfolio manager of the $77 million AB International Strategic Core fund, said that the threat of technological disruption in some markets was just as pressing a concern for some global firms as the impact of higher tariffs. As a result, his fund is focusing more on what he calls the “enablers”, which are back-end tech firms that do not trade at as high valuations as companies like Amazon.com and Netflix.
‘Tariff-resistant business’
Spanish firm Amadeus IT Group, for instance, provides the technology backing the reservation systems used by airlines including British Airways, Southwest, and Lufthansa Group. Shares of the company are up 20% for the year to date.
“Even if you wanted to, it’s difficult to rip them out of these companies,” he said.
Mr. Suzuki has also been increasing his position in European luxury goods makers such as Italian apparel firm Moncler and British alcoholic beverage company Diageo, both of which make products that should not be significantly affected by rising trade costs, he said.
“You can find tariff-resistant businesses that are in niches, but it takes work to find them,” he said.

Of banks and ebbing deposit flows
","Of late, Indian banks have come up against a problem that they’ve seldom had to face over the last two decades — having too few takers for their fixed deposits. 
RBI data showed that in the financial year ended March 2018, aggregate deposits of scheduled commercial banks expanded by 6.7%. That’s the lowest annual growth rate recorded in over five decades. Over the last two decades, banks have been able to expand their deposit base at an average rate of 16% a year. 
It would be tempting to attribute the ultra-low growth in FY18 to the high base effect caused by demonetisation. After all, the second half of FY17 saw an unusual deluge of deposits into banks triggered by the ban on high-value currency notes. This propped up bank deposit growth to 15.3% in FY17. But if you exclude this as an aberration, new deposits flowing into banks have been on a decline since FY15. 
RBI data showed that in the nine years from FY05 to FY14, bank deposits saw a massive surge in their popularity. Net inflows into banks grew more than four-fold during this period, from ₹1.95 lakh crore in FY05 to ₹9.55 lakh crore in FY14. But the juggernaut was halted in FY14. New deposit mop-ups dipped to ₹8.27 lakh crore in FY15 and further to ₹7.94 lakh crore in FY16. The note ban offered a temporary breather by drawing back ₹14.3 lakh crore into banks in FY17. But the flows have ebbed quickly thereafter, to just ₹7.17 lakh crore in FY18. 
Why the decline 
What has caused Indian savers to lose their long-held affinity for bank deposits? Well, one obvious reason is diminishing returns. Historical trends suggest that inflows into bank deposits carry a high correlation with interest rates. FY05 marked a low point in interest rates in the economy, with 1 to 3-year bank deposits offering 5.25%-5.75%. Rates climbed steadily to 9.25% by FY12 and stayed put until FY14. Thereafter, as a slowing economy forced RBI to prune policy rates, deposit rates slumped to 6.75% in FY18. Deposit mop-ups by banks have followed a similar trajectory. 
The hunt for better returns has prompted savers to actively seek out market-linked alternatives to bank deposits. Savers have upped their allocations to NBFC deposits, which have seen a fourfold rise in their deposit base in the last four years. More significantly, with the stock markets taking wing from FY14, retail savers have been making a beeline for equity mutual funds which delivered a 15-20% return between FY13 and FY18. 
From pull-outs of ₹11,000 crore in FY14, equity funds attracted more than ₹80,000 crore in net inflows in FY15 and went on to amass ₹2.6 lakh crore in new flows in FY18. A rising number of those investors are also signing up for monthly investments with systematic investment plans (SIPs) now funnelling over ₹7,000 crore a month into mutual funds. Debt funds have emerged as more tax-efficient alternatives to bank deposits too. 
PSBs hit most
But a third and far more disturbing reason for savers shying away could be the relentless adverse news flow about bad loans, capital adequacy woes and multi-billion rupee frauds, that have kept bank depositors on the tenterhooks in the last three years. 
It is public sector banks (PSBs) — the most hit by these problems — that have seen their deposits dry up the most. In FY18, PSBs managed a minuscule 3.1% growth in their aggregate deposit base. But private banks saw a brisk 17.4% growth in deposits while regional rural banks managed a 7.2% increase. Newbie small finance banks, which offered high rates, managed a fourfold jump in deposit base in one year. With consistently better deposit growth, private banks have seen their share in aggregate deposits shoot up from 21 to 27% in the last four years while PSBs have seen their share plummet from 73 to 67%. 
Dwindling deposit flows into banks have significant repercussions for the economy and banks themselves. 
One, it is credit that oils the wheels of the economy and as the economy revives from its slumber of the last three years, banks may find it difficult to bankroll the credit needs of industry. This may impede industrial revival. In the ten years to FY17, the annual increase in deposits for banks easily outpaced additional demand for credit each year. In FY17, thanks to the riches from demonetisation, new deposit flows exceeded the incremental loan offtake by a massive ₹8.4 lakh crore. But in FY18, the tables turned drastically, with deposit flows falling short of incremental credit demand by about ₹91,000 crore. While deposit growth has slumped lately, credit growth has accelerated from the single to double digits. Yes, as banks have scrounged for funds to lend, bond markets have stepped in to bankroll industry. But given the lack of breadth in the Indian bond market, the market route is open only to large corporates with high credit ratings. For lower-rated companies, MSMEs and sundry small borrowers, a cutback in bank lending usually means a squeeze on credit availability.
Two, the funds crunch has forced banks to step back from lending to the government too. Domestic banks, to fulfil their statutory liquidity ratio (SLR) requirement, are required to compulsorily park 19.5% of their deposits in government securities. This requirement allows the Central and State governments, which survive on deficit financing, to periodically dump gilts on banks to raise money. But after indulging in a gilt buying binge in FY17 and overshooting their SLR requirements, banks have found no reason to buy more gilts in recent months. This has this sent borrowing costs for the Centre shooting up (it topped 8% recently), and raised concerns about how the Centre or the States will successfully complete their borrowing programmes this year. 
Three, banks have also been constrained by their rising stockpile of non-performing loans. With ₹10 lakh crore of bank funds locked up in NPLs and sluggish recoveries, banks’ hands have been further tied in expanding their loan book. 
This poses a Chakravyuha-like problem for banks. Expanding their loan book of healthy borrowers is the fastest way for beleaguered banks to ‘grow’ out of the NPL mess. And, it is by lending to non-government entities, that they can earn the high yields that cushion their profits from the rising bad loan write-offs. But both of these require healthy deposit flows, which are eluding the needy banks the most. 
The way out
So, can banks now woo back savers with higher deposit rates? They have certainly been trying in the last six months, by pegging up their deposit rates far more rapidly than RBI’s policy rates. Conveniently for them, the stock markets have also lost some steam, sharply pruning equity fund returns. But RBI data for the first two months of FY19 doesn’t indicate a material turnaround in deposit flows. 
It is too early to conclude that domestic savers, vexed with the adverse news flow from PSBs, have shifted their loyalties for good. But given that market conditions are now favouring banks over equity avenues, this is the time for both banks and the government to try their level best to woo back skittish depositors and rebuild the domestic savers’ confidence in the banking system. Else, PSBs may permanently lose out on the precious deposit base that is the bread and butter of their existence.

FDI in services sector drops 54% during April-February
","Foreign direct investment (FDI) in the services sector declined 54 per cent to $2.18 billion during April-February of 2013-14 from a year earlier.
Services such as banking, insurance, outsourcing, R&D, courier and technology testing had received $4.74 billion of FDI during April-February 2013, according to data from the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP).
According to experts, foreign investors will move ahead with their decisions once a new government takes over after the ongoing Lok Sabha elections.
“Although the present government has taken steps to attract investments, more needs to be done by the new government,” said Krishan Malhotra, an expert on FDI with corporate law firm Amarchand & Mangaldas.
Overall foreign inflows into the country declined to $20.76 billion during the first 11 months of 2013-14 from $20.89 billion in April-February 2013.
The services sector contributes over 60 per cent to India’s gross domestic product. In 2012-13, foreign investment in services fell to $4.83 billion from $5.21 billion in 2011-12.
Other sectors where inflows have declined include construction, metallurgical industries and hotel and tourism.
Foreign investments are considered crucial for India, which needs about $1 trillion in the five years to 2017 to overhaul infrastructure such as ports, airports and highways to boost growth.
A drop in foreign investment could affect the country’s balance of payments situation and the rupee.

But the Indian startup scene had gotten out of a couple of such bubbles, and there was no discernible wave to ride in starting up for celebrities. Cryptocurrencies did not cause the same ripples here as they did elsewhere. Machine learning, and artificial intelligence are possibly waves celebrities might eventually target, but it is too early to do so now, for them at least.
So when I saw a headline about Sushant Singh Rajput becoming an entrepreneur, I decided I will read the article too, because I was curious. At the very least, to figure out if I had missed out some bubble. His startup is called Innsaei. It apparently is an Icelandic word meaning intuition. Of course, it tells you nothing about what the startup might be into. For that, let me quote tweets from Sushant, ones that all press coverage duly printed, for there was little else to report.
“Announcing my first venture #Innsaei with my business partner @ivarunmathur. The convergence of #IntellectualProperty and Emerging Technologies. @OnInnsaei.”
Okay, so far so vague. I do not know what this startup is really about, and maybe Sushant will clear the mist in his next tweet.
“Emerging technologies are disrupting socio-cultural and economic structures at an exponential pace and this will impact key areas like education, employment, entertainment & health @OnInnsaei.”
This is where I gave up. I know it is a grammatically correct sentence, yet, all those words neatly put together made no sense at all. In my past columns, I have harped enough times on how crucial it is for a startup to be very clear about the problem that they are solving, for it is only then that they can achieve any sort of product and market fit. I have also talked about how important it is to be able to clearly enunciate the business model in a sentence or two. When a startup fails either of these two criteria, I almost always write them off. And Sushant’s startup fails both these heuristics.
Of course, there is the likelihood that these perfectly logical thumb rules and heuristics will fail, and the startup may actually succeed. For it is a man with much privilege and the security blanket that it brings who has started it, and such access goes a long way in making something successful. Either way, I hope it is just a blip and not a trend.

SEBI proposes new listing, disclosure requirement norms
","The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), on Monday, proposed a new set of rules, which would require greater disclosures by companies and give more powers to stock exchanges to check any non-compliance.
The proposed norms, to be called SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2014, would need to be followed by all listed companies, as also for listing of debentures, bonds and mutual funds on stock exchanges.
The final norms, which would be framed after taking into public comments, would replace the existing provisions for Listing Agreements that currently act as a contract between a stock exchange and the entity seeking to list on its platform.
SEBI has sought public comments on the proposed norms by May 30.
Detailing the proposed norms in a 74-page document on Monday, SEBI has brought in provisions related to powers of bourses in case of non-compliance by listed entities, empowering bourses to impose penalties on entities for violations, listing and disclosure requirements for mutual funds, among others.
“The stock exchange shall, in case of non-compliance with provisions of these regulations, initiate appropriate action against the listed entity including levying of fines, suspension, freezing of promoter shareholding and the like as specified by the board through circulars or guidelines issued in this regard from time to time,” the draft norms said.
“The stock exchange shall revoke suspension, unfreeze promoter shareholding etc of the listed entity in the manner as directed by the board from time to time,” it added.
The new rules would also include provisions related to the revised corporate governance framework such as requirement by companies to get shareholders’ approval for related party transactions, setting up a whistle blower mechanism, elaborate disclosures on pay packages and requirement of at least one woman director on company boards. The draft norms are also likely to include rules that would require entities to give prior intimation about their fund raising events such as preferential issue and debt issue as well as file an annual information memorandum.
“In order to ensure uniformity in disclosure requirements, the provisions of various clauses of equity listing agreement have also been made applicable to SMEs,” SEBI said. Moreover, the proposed rules may also be made applicable to non-convertible debt securities and non-convertible redeemable preference shares.
According to SEBI, ‘policy changes’ are being proposed separately with respect to financial results “by following a consultative process”. The same would be included in draft regulations once the process is completed.
Meanwhile, SEBI said norms with respect to allotment, refund and payment of interest, book closure date, requirement of 1 per cent security deposit, submitting multiple copies of documents to stock exchange, among others, may not be included in the new listing norms as they are either redundant or would be incorporated in separate set of regulations.

India to be $10 trillion economy by 2030: Garg "," 
 The Indian economy is at a “take off” stage and is expected to be the world’s third largest by 2030 with GDP worth $10 trillion, Economic Affairs Secretary Subhash Chandra Garg said.
“Good days are ahead and lot of good work is happening in the economy. The economy is on a stage of take off where Indians can legitimately hold their heads high,” he said here.
 In the first 40 years of independence, the country hardly grew at 3.5%, and today 7-8% is the norm, Mr. Garg said at a function to mark the platinum jubilee celebrations of the Institute of Cost Accountants of India (ICAI).
“By 2030, we can legitimately expect to be a $10 trillion economy. That is the challenge. That is also the opportunity,” he said.

NSC seeks comment on GDP back series ","The National Statistical Commission (NSC) has sought public comments on a panel report which showed that the economy grew at the fastest pace under the Congress rule, amid a political row over the growth numbers. The report of the panel, constituted by the NSC, was made public last week.
The government has maintained that the GDP Back Series Report 2011 was an unofficial document that has not been accepted by it. The Centre had also said the report was only at discussion stage and its acceptance will be based on wider consultations.
The Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MOSPI) posted the report on its website under the section that calls for comments on draft reports. “The NSC welcomes comments and suggestions on the reports by September 30, 2018,” the commission said.
Earlier, the report was posted on the website’s publication section, which the Opposition Congress cited as vindication of its economic policies.
The NSC said the draft report has been placed in the public domain to facilitate wider public consultation and invited suggestions on that by September 30, 2018.
According to the draft report, the Indian economy recorded a 10.08 per cent growth rate in 2006-07 under the then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, the highest since liberalisation of the economy in 1991.
The back series data on GDP report was prepared by the Committee on Real Sector Statistics. The report compares growth rates between old series (2004-05) and new series based on 2011-12 prices. “The GDP backseries data is finally out. It proves that like-for-like, the economy under both UPA terms (10 year avg: 8.1%) outperformed the Modi Govt (Avg 7.3%),” the Congress party said in a tweet.

Drugmakers eye new prescription for exports
"," For the $17.3 billion Indian pharmaceuticals export sector, there could be no better time than now to look beyond its largest market — the U.S.
An upsurge in challenges in the U.S. market — from the long-standing regulatory issues to increased pricing pressure amid a tougher policy approach on the part of the Trump administration — coincided with a decline in India’s shipments to the world’s largest market for medicines last fiscal. Exports fell 7.4% to $5.35 billion in the 12 months ended March, from $5.77 billion in 2016-17.
‘Exports to U.S. shrink’
North America, primarily the U.S., accounted for more than 30% of India’s pharma exports in FY18. While it may continue to remain the single largest destination for some more time to come, the fact is it also was the only market to have recorded a contraction in India’s drug export basket.
With the headwinds in the U.S. showing no signs of abating any time soon, a shift in focus seems more of a necessity than a choice.
“It is difficult to predict how long these trends will last,” said Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories Chairman K. Satish Reddy and CEO G V Prasad, in a letter to shareholders in the 2017-18 annual report.
DRL, one of India’s largest drugmakers, has for some quarters now, been highlighting price erosion in the U.S. due to channel consolidation and increased competition as a key pressure point on the company’s margins. The U.S. accounts for 52% of DRL’s global generics sales.
“Our focus... instead of worrying about our exports to [North] America [should be] to simultaneously explore the markets of Africa, Latin America and Europe,” said Ravi Uday Bhaskar, director general, Pharmaceuticals Export Promotion Council (Pharmexcil). “Where there is a question of affordability and a weak economy, there, Indian generics are very much relevant,” he asserted. Decades of experience in exporting to the highly regulated U.S. and European markets should, in fact, serve as a big advantage for Indian drugmakers looking to tap other global markets, according to Mr. Bhaskar. Efforts in this direction are already under way, according to HDFC Securities analyst Amey Chalke.
“Most companies [with] a branded presence in India are exploring opportunities outside the U.S., Europe and India,” said Mr. Chalke. “They are looking at branded markets like Africa, Latin America and Asia, which are non-regulated or semi-regulated markets.”
One concern for drugmakers exploring newer markets would be profit margins. “If you are in Europe, it is a generic market. It is like the U.S. but under price control. So obviously, the margins would be lower in Europe. In case of other markets like Africa, Asia and Latin America, margins could be substantially higher if you have a good, branded portfolio. It may be less than India, but could report substantial profitability,” he said.
‘High volume game’
Volumes, though, could be substantially higher, added Mr. Bhaskar of Pharmexcil, a body under the Union Ministry of Commerce tasked with facilitating exports. 
Ajantha Pharma, he pointed out, has substantial presence in Africa and earns more than 30% Ebitda margins in the continent. There are also companies that procure products from cheaper sources in China and then supply the drugs to the African market. 
Acquisition is another path. Aurobindo Pharma’s acquisition of Canadian generic major Apotex’s European operations is an example. The acquisition is in line with Aurobindo’s strategy to strengthen and grow its European business and to expand in Eastern Europe. It already has a presence in nine countries in the continent and posted €577 million sales last fiscal.

Copra prices shoot up as online trading takes off
","Commencement of online trading in copra through the Rashtriya e-Market Services (ReMS) has resulted in the sharp rise in prices of the commodity in markets around major coconut production districts in the State.
Compared with prices of 2011, copra prices have increased by 75 per cent in Tiptur market and 49 per cent in Arasikere market in April 2014. All traders in two markets switched over to online trading in February 2014.
The average prices of copra increased from Rs. 6,545 per quintal in April 2011 to Rs. 11,474 per quintal in April 2014 in the Tiptur market, while it moved from Rs. 6,496 per quintal in April 2011 to Rs. 10,200 in April 2014 in the Arasikere market of Hassan district.
Manoj Rajan, Managing Director and CEO, ReMS, said the implementation of the Unified Market Platform (UMP) through the ReMS had contributed to the significant rise in prices of copra in coconut-growing districts. Now, the government has decided to expand online trading to other commodities in other APMC yards.
The government implemented online trading to develop a barrier-free market for farmers. Now, wholesale dealers such as Metro Cash and Carry and major traders in different parts of the State are participating in online trading and quoting competitive prices.
ReMS is a joint venture between NCDEX Spot Exchange and the State government. Online trading was introduced in the State following implementation of the Karnataka Agricultural Marketing Policy 2013.
Online trading helps producer-seller to secure the best price for commodities at the APMCs. The new system has eliminated the role of middlemen and unfair trade practices, he said.
Shortage of coconut yield is not the reason for the hike in prices of copra this year. The Arasikere market received 8,801 quintals of copra in February 2014 against 3,128 quintals in February 2013. Arrivals of copra in Tiptur market stood at 38,000 quintals in February 2014 against 29,330 quintals in the same month in 2013, Mr. Rajan said.
The Odisha government has decided to adopt Karnataka’s model. However, it is yet to amend the Agricultural Produce Marketing (Regulation) Act.

Preparing for the budget
","The budget is the most important economic statement of the government. Over the years, it has ceased to be a mere statement of revenue and expenditure but also conveys the thrust of the government’s macro-economic policies.
As everyone knows, the Finance Minister presents the budget at the end of February. This allows sufficient time for Parliament to debate and approve the budget proposals for the financial year commencing April 1.
The budget process for fiscal 2014-15 will be different from any normal year. An interim budget was presented by P. Chidambaram in February. Essentially, in the nature of a vote on account, the interim budget was intended to get Parliament approval for expenditure that will be incurred during the first few months of fiscal year 2015. This is meant to accommodate the election schedule and the formation of a new government, whose urgent task it will be to present a “full “ budget by July for 2014-15.
The new finance minister will be constrained by time. The budget exercise usually starts months ahead of its actual presentation (in February). This time that luxury will simply not be available. The finance minister will have very little time to nominate and get acquainted with key officials who will be responsible for the budget preparation.
All these suggest that the first budget of the new government, whatever be its predilections, would substantially resemble the interim budget of February. There will not be any time to prepare a fresh set of numbers, different from the interim budget. For very practical reasons, the new government will stick to the projections of expenditure and revenue in the interim budget.
Yet, there is something special about the first budget of a new government, which, if opinion polls are correct, will be formed by a political combination that will be different from the one that has been in power for a decade. The July budget will be keenly watched for the likely course of fiscal policy over the next five years.
The very large expectations raised by political parties will challenge the new finance minister.
There is no doubt that some of those expectations are overblown. Like those from the foreign institutional investors who have pumped in large sums of money into the stock market. If the poll results do not vindicate their optimism in a Modi-led NDA government how will they react? Many other sections of society — industrialists and common man alike — clamour for a government which is ‘decisive’. Will such expectations be partially at least met in July?
Game changer this budget may not be but the Finance Minister would do well to lay the framework for a more transparent budgetary mechanism that will involve some honest accounting.
The next round of official national income statistics (GDP) will be available only in early June. The Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) next review of monetary policy will be released by that time. Inflation data — both CPI and WPI — will be released by the middle of this month. Whatever statistics that have been released do not present a particularly flattering picture of the economy although most forecasters think that the economy is on the mend and that GDP (gross domestic product) growth will finally move out of the sub-5 per cent growth trajectory during the current year.
The validity of election-eve official claims will come under scrutiny. Mr. Chidambaram has claimed that he is leaving behind an economy in good health. The current account deficit which threatened macro-economic stability last year has come down to very manageable levels (from around 4.7 per cent of GDP last year it is projected to come down to below 2 per cent).
On fiscal deficit, the government has claimed credit. The Finance Minister has said that on no account will the deficit breach the self-imposed red-line and that the interim budget’s estimate of the deficit at 4.6 per cent of GDP will hold good.
On the face of it, the success claimed in addressing the twin deficits is remarkable. Yet, in both, it is not the actual numbers so much as how they were achieved that matters. The current account deficit (CAD) has come down essentially because of the government clampdown on gold imports.
The restrictions on gold imports cannot continue indefinitely. Already a large portion of the bullion trade has shifted underground. Besides, a healthy reduction of the CAD is best achieved through increased exports and not through imports reduction. It is noteworthy that non-oil imports too have fallen, not a good sign because it indicates a continuing slowdown.
Much will be said about the other ‘achievement’ of the UPA-II government in fiscal consolidation. Here again, it is the quality of fiscal contraction that matters. It is not healthy to cut Plan expenditure or shift subsidy payments to the next accounting period or claim revenues that strictly accrue during the next year.
None of the above blemishes in fiscal management are special to the UPA II’s ways of managing public finance.
Yet, when claimed as big achievements during election time, they do require special scrutiny.
The next finance minister should sift the dodgy numbers from the genuine ones and overhaul fiscal policy.

AIIMS-led team develops highly sensitive, portable test for TB meningitis
"," A diagnostic test for TB meningitis (the most severe form of TB) with nearly 100% sensitivity and about 91% specificity has been developed by a multi-institutional team led by Prof. Jaya Sivaswami Tyagi from the Department of Biotechnology at AIIMS. The performance of the diagnostic test was evaluated in 87 cerebrospinal fluid samples obtained from paediatric subjects (39 TB meningitis patients and 48 controls). The results of the study were published recently in the journal Tuberculosis.
The diagnostic test is based on a derivative of a DNA aptamer (a small single-stranded DNA molecule that binds to a specific target molecule and is a chemical rival of antibodies) that shows high binding affinity in nanomolar range and high specificity to a TB antigen (HspX). Besides higher binding affinity, there is significantly higher load of the HspX antigen in cerebrospinal fluid samples, leading to higher sensitivity. 
A rapid, point-of-care diagnostic test for TB meningitis that uses the DNA aptamer has already been adapted to a sensor format and is being evaluated on clinical samples. “It takes all of 30 minutes to get the result as we are using an electrochemical sensing platform,” says Prof. Tyagi.
“While antibodies have to be generated in animals and so will not be of uniform quality, aptamers can be produced in the lab,” says Dr. Tarun Kumar Sharma from the Centre for Biodesign and Diagnostics at Translational Health Science and Technology Institute (THSTI), Faridabad and the other corresponding author of the paper.
The aptamer-based diagnostic test for TB meningitis has been patented by AIIMS and THSTI and licensed to AptaBharat Innovation Pvt Limited, a THSTI spinoff founded by Dr. Sharma.
The currently used diagnostic methods — microscopy and culture of cerebrospinal fluid — suffer from huge limitations in terms of poor sensitivity and long turnaround time of up to eight weeks. Even GeneXpert has only 55% sensitivity. In settings such as India, where the prevalence of TB meningitis is high, one in six patients tested by Xpert will be missed.
 
Ten-year journey
It has taken the team about 10 years to reach this stage of developing a diagnostic test. Since there are very few bacteria in TB meningitis samples, the researchers wanted to evaluate the utility of using TB DNA for the diagnosis using PCR. In a paper published in 2009 in the Journal of Medical Microbiology, the researchers filtered 167 cerebrospinal fluid samples using a filter paper and studied the filtrate that contains the DNA of TB bacteria. DNA and other components of TB bacteria are present in the filtrate due to disintegration of the bacteria.
“We studied TB bacteria present on the filter paper and the TB DNA present in the filtrate and found TB DNA yielded significantly higher sensitivity of detection (88%) than the whole bacteria (53%). When we saw the filtrate had more DNA we wanted to check for antigens of TB bacteria,” recalls Dr. Sagarika Haldar from the Centre for Biodesign and Diagnostics at THSTI and first author in two papers. She is currently at the Department of Experimental Medicine and Biotechnology,
PGIMER, Chandigarh.
In a paper published in 2012 in PLOS ONE, the team studied 532 cerebrospinal fluid samples collected from children and looked for five TB antigens. “Though DNA and antigen were significantly higher in the filtrate compared with TB bacteria, the amount of TB antigens was far higher than DNA,” Dr. Haldar says. Using DNA for diagnosis would involve sophisticated instrument and amplification while antigen detection will be straight forward. 
The team found the sensitivity of both tests — DNA and antigen — was similar. Of the five antigens, two were found to be excellent in terms of sensitivity and specificity. “We would need an ELISA reader to detect the antigens. Since we wanted to make a point-of-care diagnostic test for TB meningitis, we turned out attention to DNA aptamers,” says Dr. Haldar.
Using a DNA aptamer to bind to the TB antigen makes ELISA reader redundant in a portable assay format. The aptamer is also more sensitive, specific and stable compared with the antibody. Since the antigen is directly detected, only 5 microlitre of the sample is required.
Twenty-one aptamers were selected from the aptamer libarary and based on specificity one was chosen. Since all the 44 nucleotides of the aptamer don’t interact with the HspX TB antigen, the size of the aptamer was reduced to 28 nucleotides. Reducing the size of the aptamer will in turn reduce the cost of the diagnostic test.
“Once the mutation was done to reduce the size we found the binding improved. The mutant aptamer showed 2.5-fold higher binding than the parent aptamer,” says Abhijeet Dhiman from the Department of Biotechnology, AIIMS and first author of the 2018 paper. The optimised aptamer was tested on 87 cerebrospinal fluid samples and found to have nearly 100% sensitivity and about 91% specificity.

IISc researchers find cholesterol helps bacterial toxins kill cells "," Researchers at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bengaluru, have found that cholesterol present in cell membrane plays a crucial role in stabilising and binding together the pore-forming toxin cytolysin A. The pore-forming toxins form the largest class of bacterial proteins causing virulence that kills human cells. The cytolysin A toxin is secreted by E. coli, Shigella and Salmonella.
The toxin secreted by E. coli bacteria is water-soluble and binds to the cell membrane. The binding of the water-soluble toxin to the cell membrane does not depend on cholesterol present in the membrane surface. In fact, the binding drops in cholesterol-containing membranes. “Binding is only a part of the pore forming process and cholesterol has no role to play,” says Dr. Rahul Roy from the Department of Chemical Engineering at IISc who led the team. 
Toxin movements
Once the toxin gets bound to the cell membrane, it does not stay in one place. Instead, it keeps moving around the cell membrane surface. Using a powerful microscope that allows them to look at single molecules tagged with a fluorescent tag, the researchers could actually see the toxin proteins moving around. 
Unlike the usually observed Brownian movement, these proteins tend to move around fast and then slow down before picking up speed and moving fast again. This happens even when no cholesterol is present. The structure capable of puncturing the cell membrane is supposed to slow down the protein movement. So this suggested that the structure of the bound protein is similar to the water-soluble protein and different from the structure that pierces the cell membrane. 
Cholesterol interaction
In the presence of cholesterol, the protein stops moving quickly. “Using molecular dynamic simulations, we found cholesterol interacting with the protein just as we suspected. The interaction was with the region on the protein that is responsible for forming the pore,” says Dr. Roy. 
Binding to cholesterol per se does not stop the motion of the protein. But on binding to cholesterol, the structure of the protein undergoes a change resulting in slowing down of the motion. 
The change in the speed of motion happens even in the absence of cholesterol due to the change in structure of the protein. But in the absence of cholesterol, the protein is unable to maintain the structure required for pore formation. 
“The structure of the toxin is stabilised in the presence of cholesterol and that is essential for pore formation,” says Pradeep Sathyanarayana from the Centre for BioSystems Science and Engineering at IISc and first author of a paper published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. “This is a clever strategy by the bacteria to use the toxin to specifically target only human/animal cells while the bacteria themselves are protected from the toxicity since cholesterol is absent in bacterial membranes.” 
To be able to rupture the cell membrane, the proteins bound to cholesterol have to come together to form a ring-like structure comprising 12 molecules. The coming together of the molecules to form the ring-like structure is also enhanced in the presence of cholesterol.
“Computer simulations showed that when two pore-forming protein molecules come together there is a small pocket where the cholesterol goes and interacts with the proteins. So cholesterol provides additional support to hold the two molecules together,” says Dr. Roy. 
Studies by other groups have shown that cancer cells in mice can be reduced dramatically by using cytolysin A toxin. 
“Based on our study, we can work on making the toxin target only the cancer cells. We can also use cholesterol-like molecules to prevent the toxin protein from changing its structure thereby prevent cell destruction,” says Dr. Roy.

Of mobile revolution and its impact
","The mobile technology, a disruptive force in the country, also brought a negative impact on the environment, Robin Jeffrey, co-author of the book ‘Cell Phone Nation’, said at a lecture in the city on Monday.
At the Computer Society of India Education Directorate, Taramani, Mr. Jeffrey, a visiting research professor at the Institute of South Asian Studies of National University of Singapore, delivered a lecture titled ‘Cell phone nation : How mobile phones changed India’.
Recalling the days when the telegram was more popular than the telephone, Mr. Jeffrey said it was in 1986, with the advent of the PCO booths, that the telephone became more accessible.
Until the late 1990s, mobile phones were unattainable to the common man.
Mr. Jeffrey argued that mobile technology was a tremendous disruptive force, both politically and socially.
“The technology put knowledge power in the hands of hundreds of millions of users who had previously lacked the same. This transformed the everyday way of life of millions and granted an autonomy which allowed individuals to challenge long established conventions in society,” he said.
Mr. Jeffrey also went on to discussing some of the negatives of this otherwise liberating technology.
While acknowledging that anxiety over the impact of the technology was only natural, he declared himself a cyber optimist with the view that the future was favourably disposed to mobile technology.
The lecture, chaired by Ashok Jhunjhunwala, professor at the department of electrical engineering at IIT-Madras, and organised by IEEE Madras Section, Cellular Operator Association of India, Telecom Centers of Excellence India, IEEE Computer Society, IEEE Communications Society, IEEE Communications Society and the Computer Society of India, ended with an interactive session with the audience.

Partial solar eclipse visible in Australia, New Zealand "," The year's second solar eclipse occurred on July 13, 2018. The partial eclipse was seen only in parts of Australia and New Zealand as it took place almost entirely over open waters of Antartica. 
This partial eclipse began at 7:18 IST on July 13, reached its maximum magnitude of 0.3367 at 8:31 IST and ended at 09:43 IST. 
Solar eclipse is a natural phenomenon that occurs when the moon comes in between the sun and the earth. A partial eclipse occurs when the three celestial bodies are not exactly on the same plane. 
It is not advisable to look at the sun during the solar eclipse with naked eyes since the sunlight is not totally cut during the time. Only eclipse glasses that have a certification with ""ISO 12312-2 international standard"" are safe for use, according to NASA. Other options are number 14 welder's glass, or making a pinhole projector that allows a user to project the image of the sun on paper or cardboard.
The first solar eclipse of the year was observed on February 15, largely visible in South American nations.
The next solar eclipse, also a partial one, will be on August 11 and could be seen in parts of North America, Russia, eastern Europe, north and West Asia, and the Arctic region.
Skygazers in India will, however, get to watch the lunar eclipse on July 27, which is said to be the longest one of the century. The total lunar eclipse would last for one hour and 43 minutes while partial eclipses, which would precede and follow the total eclipse, would last more than an hour.

Mouse brain allows neuronal patchwork to succeed
"," Brain tissue can incur damage due to degeneration or injury, and one way to repair this is to transplant neurons which will merge with the surrounding tissue and connect with the other neurons in the neighbourhood to make up for the damage. A study carried out by an international collaboration determines the conditions under which neurons implanted in the brain of mice can successfully integrate with the surrounding tissue.
The researchers implanted newly born neurons, taken from the cerebral cortex of mouse embryos into brains of other newborn mice. The cerebral cortex is the region responsible for higher-level functions such as voluntary control of movement and cognition. These embryonic neurons are normally capable of maturing into adult neurons that form long distance connections between parts of the brain. “We optimized the method of transplantation and limited the number of cells that we injected into a recipient brain so that we can analyze these cells individually at a later stage,” Thomas Wuttke, first author of the paper published in Nature Neuroscience says in an email.
The transplanted neurons were labelled with a fluorescent protein (eGFP) which is derived from a species of jellyfish. “Due to labeling, we were able to visualize the transplanted neurons within the brains of the recipient pups and distinguish them from nearby recipient-derived neurons,” says Dr Wuttke.
Experiments showed that the transplanted neurons could form appropriate connections within the brains of the recipient mouse pups when analysed at the level of single cells. “This suggests that by transplanting appropriate types of immature neurons we can potentially reconstruct a neuronal circuitry, at least in the context of a newborn animal,” he adds.
Earlier, pioneering work had shown that neurons implanted in the brain could take root there and also send out long axons (wire-like extensions that help transmit signals) and connect to nearby neurons. However, those experiments were done with bulk transplantation of large numbers of neurons. “Bulk cell experiments are not appropriate for looking at transplanted neurons on a cell-by-cell basis to determine if they mature as required and form correct connections,” says Hari Padmanabhan, co-author of the paper, who is with the Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology, Harvard University.
“This has important implications when we consider transplanting new neurons for correcting diseases caused by neuronal loss that happens either through degeneration or via injury,” he explains.
“We reported, for the first time, that transplanted immature but developmentally ‘primed’ neurons of specific and distinct projection neuron subtypes can integrate cellularly and positionally into postnatal cortex; maintain remarkable fidelity of differentiation and maturation, establish subtype-specific and appropriate long-distance connectivity; and bi-directionally integrate electrophysiologically into local and long-distance circuitry,” says Jeffrey Macklis of harvard University who led the study.

James Webb Space Telescope to study Jupiter’s Great Red Spot: NASA "," 
 
NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope - the most ambitious and complex space observatory ever built - will be used to study Jupiter’s Great Red Spot, shedding new light on the enigmatic storm that has been raging on the planet for over 350 years.
 Jupiter’s iconic storm is on the Webb telescope’s list of targets chosen by guaranteed time observers, scientists who helped develop the incredibly complex telescope. 
 One of the telescope’s science goals is to study planets, including the mysteries still held by the planets. 
 Researchers plan to use Webb’s mid-infrared instrument (MIRI) to create multispectral maps of the Great Red Spot and analyse its thermal, chemical and cloud structures.
 They will be able to observe infrared wavelengths that could shed light on what causes the spot’s iconic colour, which is often attributed to the Sun’s ultraviolet radiation interacting with nitrogen, sulphur and phosphorus-bearing chemicals that are lifted from Jupiter’s deeper atmosphere by powerful atmospheric currents within the storm.
 Using MIRI to observe in the five to seven micrometre range could be particularly revealing for the Great Red Spot, as no other mission has been able to observe Jupiter in that part of the electromagnetic spectrum. 
 Those wavelengths of light could allow the scientists to see unique chemical byproducts of the storm, which would give insight into its composition.
“We’ll be looking for signatures of any chemical compounds that are unique to the Great Red Spot, which could be responsible for the red chromophores,” said Leigh Fletcher, a senior research fellow at the University of Leicester 
 Chromophores are the parts of molecules responsible for their colour.
“Any waves produced by the vigorous convective activity within the storm must pass through the stratosphere before they reach the ionosphere and thermosphere.If they really do exist and are responsible for heating Jupiter’s upper layers, hopefully we’ll see evidence for their passage in our data” Fletcher said.
 Generations of astronomers have studied the Great Red Spot; the storm has been monitored since 1830, but it has possibly existed for more than 350 years.
 The reason for the storm’s longevity largely remains a mystery, and the key to understanding the formation of storms on Jupiter is to witness their full life cycle - growing, shrinking, and eventually dying.
“We did not see the Great Red Spot form, and it may not die anytime soon, so scientists must rely on observing “smaller and fresher” storms on the planet to see how they begin and evolve, something that Webb may do in the future, said Fletcher.

PSLV bags first Australian order ","The Indian PSLV launcher has broken into a rising Australian space market and bagged its first small but promising order from Down Under. Fleet Space Technologies, an IoT (Internet of Things) startup, disclosed last week that its first 10-kg nanosatellite Centauri I would fly to space on a PSLV later this year. 
The prospect for the PSLV is in the fact that Adelaide-based Fleet plans to put up a constellation of an unstated number of tiny satellites — all of which will need a suitable, timely launch vehicle to take them to space. 
Australia is in the throes of setting up its space agency and an industry around it. Adelaide in South Australia is the current hub of this activity. The second nanosat, Centauri II, is to be launched on the U.S. SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket later this year.
The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) has planned a part-commercial PSLV flight around August. Neither Fleet nor Antrix Corporation, ISRO's business arm, could immediately say if Centauri I would go on it.
For lighter payloads
The PSLV's three versions can lift satellites of 1,000-1,750 kg to distances of around 600 km in pole-to-pole orbits. A neat launch record has made the booster a trusted and affordable space vehicle for small satellites. Big rocket players are focussed on taking heavy, multi-tonne satellites to space.
Since its first commercial launch in 1999, the PSLV has put in orbit 237 small satellites of 28 countries, About half of them are from the US. Antrix recently said it has many more orders confirmed or under discussion.
Low-cost connectivity
A news release from the Australian company quoted its co-founder and CEO Flavia Tata Nardini and said it is developing a series of 10-kg nanosatellites about the size of a shoebox to enable low-cost connectivity for agriculture, logistics, mining and other industries.
""The first satellite,"" it said, ""will establish a global network that will connect [75 billion] sensors and devices, for free."" A single nanosat can apparently cover 90% of the globe.

The best from the science journals: Melancholic moulds and the first footprints
","First footprints?
Published in Science Advances
South China is now officially the place where an animal laid the first footprint. A new fossil containing track imprints, believed to have been made by a pair-legged creature like a millipede or a worm with legs has been discovered here. The fossil is about 635 to 541 million years old, which means that the creature lived during the geological period known as Ediacaran Period. With this new fossil, scientists now have solid evidence to prove that the Ediacaran Period saw the first animal with paired appendages, thus filling gaps in evolutionary history.
Blood protein atlas
Published in Nature




Did you know that we have above 1,500 proteins in our blood? And there are about 2,000 genetic associations with these proteins? An international team of researchers has now created the first detailed genetic map of the proteins in human blood plasma. The scientists built this map after studying about 3,300 individuals, their DNA, and genomes. The authors say that this atlas can improve our understanding of diseases and help in developing new drugs.
Hidden state of matter
Published in Nature Materials
Using new high-tech equipments researchers have now seen electrons interacting inside a superconductive alloy. Short pulses at terahertz frequency were used to bombard the superconductor (niobium-tin) and these flashes suddenly turned the compound into a new state of matter. Further studies are planned to understand more about this hidden state which can find applications in quantum computing.
Unhappy fungi
Published in Nature




Even lowly fungi leading a hidden life in tree roots are affected by pollution. Looking at 40,000 roots, 13,000 soil samples from 137 forests in 20 European countries, a ten-year study has now shown that increased nitrogen and carbon in the air is causing stress to helpful fungi that live on the roots of many trees. The team also found that as the fungi went sick the trees also looked malnourished indicating how the plant-fungal symbiotic relationship was important for the survival of the tree.
Stubborn Zika
Published in Science Advances




To understand if Zika infection in newborn babies can persist into adulthood, researchers infected three-day-old mice with the virus and observed its developments. They found that even after reaching adulthood, the mice suffered from seizures, showed reduced motor functions and did not perform well in behavioral and memory tests. The team also found that by using a drug called infliximab, the number of seizures could be reduced. This study is the first to look at the long term effects of the disease.

'Dark Souls Remaster' review: Die in glorious detail "," Love it or hate it, the Dark Souls series is one of the most unique and visceral gaming experiences out there today. Some may call it masochistic and make religious warding signs every time they see it, but those who have had a taste of the darkness of Souls games always want more. No matter how many times the game punishes players by hurling them off a cliff, with a well-placed enemy or one of their towering bosses, one cannot help but come back. So much so it has spawned off a niche of ‘Souls’ games like Bloodborne, Nioh and the upcoming Code Vein. All this, kick-started by a game called Demon’s Souls, followed by Dark Souls, that gets a brand-new remastered treatment, so that you can go right to the source of where the ‘Souls’ craze begins.


What is it about?
The Dark Souls series has always been lauded for its inventive and unconventional storytelling experiences. Every one of these games throws you into a mysterious fantasy world, with just a smidgen of lore that does not make any sense whatsoever. While you’re dying all over the place, the game never hand-holds you through boring storytelling, if you don’t want to. However, for those intrepid explorers, a massive treat awaits, as the game encourages you to observe, connect the dots, find story snippets lying around. Thread by thread, it weaves itself into a beautiful tapestry, telling a deep story with very interesting characters, all left to you to interpret.




You play a character that you can create from a bunch of presets and classes, who finds himself in a dark world. An undead entity doomed to roam the lands, each death stripping him of his humanity further and further into a wraith. Even though you resurrect, you have to constantly quest to preserve what vestiges of humanity you have left, as you rush to reignite the Age of Fire once more. 
No game captures you as much as Dark Souls, as you keep exploring on and on, deep into this world of true despair. It is that feeling of existential dread that keeps you going on. Chalk that up to the superb gameplay. 
How does it play?
At its core, Dark Souls is an action role-playing game, that’s a lethal combination of a deep sword play and dodge, parry system and completely devilish level design. Along with its secret sauce, which is death. Expect to die hundreds of times, because that is the core mechanic on which this game is built upon. Killing monsters of all kinds gives you a currency called Souls, which you spend on upgrading yourself or buying items. If you die, your souls remain on the spot of your death for you to double back and collect them again. If you die en route, you lose everything. 
This risk reward system is the whole and soul of this game, and while it does sound dark and dreary, it’s actually the most fun element. The elation you feel when you narrowly escape that death is like a drug that keeps on giving. This game is so unbelievably unforgiving that it plays some sort of reverse psychology joo joo on you, making you want to conquer that level. Where in an RPG, when you level up, you get better, in Dark Souls you level up your skills with the game. No matter how high your level is, even the lowest minion can kill you with a few well-placed hits. The level design is treacherous, tricking the careless adventurer into plunging to his death. 




The bosses though are truly scary, instilling complete and utter fear in you. All of them are truly creepy, crawling straight out of your worst horror movies. There is a secret escape-it-all though in Souls games, which is the evade roll, which just adds that level of agility to the game that makes you feel like a proper swashbuckling knight. Add to that some magic and some quick thinking on your part, you can overcome any of these bosses. That endorphin hit you get will make you shout in glee. Good luck trying to explain what just happened to your flatmates though.
The original Dark Souls was a beautiful game, but a complete mess on PC. The remaster just makes everything so much better, running at a smooth 60 frames per second, even in the dreaded blight town. If you own a good PC, PlayStation Pro or Xbox One X, the game can scale up to 4k. With improved graphics, texture quality and lighting, worthy for today’s gamers. 
Should you get it?
If it is challenge ye seek, oh adventurer, then look no further than Dark Souls, to set you off on ye merry way. Those warriors on the go, may want to wait till the Switch version launches to take this masterpiece on the subway with you. Whether you are a returning player or a newbie, you cannot afford to miss out on Dark Souls: Remastered.

Tamil publishers yet to wake up to e-book market potential
","Tamil readers using a Kindle or a tablet to read books will now be familiar with the woefully inadequate number of titles available in the electronic format.
From ignorance of technology, and insecurity stemming from fear of loss of control over content to the absence of a unified platform to host the books, the Tamil publishing industry faces an array of issues in transiting to the digital version.
According to G. Olivannan of the Bookseller’s and Publishers’ Association of South India, the experience of the music industry has remained a bitter lesson for anyone moving to the digital format.
“In the music industry, copyright no longer has any value. The moment someone uploads a song on the internet, you virtually lose control of the content. This is what publishers also fear given the small market,” he states. This reluctance, he says, also comes from ignorance about the technology itself.
“Some publishers still adhere to obsolete techniques of printing. How do you expect them to embrace e-books?” he wonders.
Noted author S. Ramakrishnan agrees on the ignorance part. Which is why, he has now embarked on a mission to develop his own cross-platform application to sell electronic versions of his books.
The author says that publishers have failed to grasp the market potential of e-books.
“As matters stand, they also don’t have the expertise. I feel there is no point in waiting for any publisher to start the process. I have taken the expertise of developers in London and will launch the app in August,” he says, adding that opening up to digital versions would augment his profits multi-fold.
Managing Director of New Horizon Media Badri Seshadri says the issues are much more complicated.
In the English books world, there are ready-made platforms like Amazon which provides the expertise and facilitates easy hosting of e-books. Such a forum does not exist in Tamil.
Amazon, he says, does not support Tamil language at the moment and lack of technical knowledge of converting the books into electronic format discourages publishers from using other platforms such as Google Play Books.
In this regard, Mr. Badri says his company is in the process of putting out an app that will, in a much smaller scale, replicate the Amazon Kindle model.
“Through the app, called the NHM Reader, we want to provide all the expertise necessary to host an e-book. This includes the process of conversion and we are keeping this open to all publishers and not just ‘Kizhaku’, our publishing house,” he says. The app is likely to be launched next month.

The story of creating an Indian network to connect blood donors and recipients "," Way back in 1998, in the days of high internet costs and dial-up connections, when going online in India meant sitting in an internet café, Khushroo Poacha, now 50, was doing just that. Except, unlike most of us who went online to chat though, he was emailing his cousin in Canada, to ask for help setting up a website that would help connect people who wanted to donate blood with those who needed it.
“In 1994, my grandmother was in a coma in a hospital in Nagpur, and I used to spend the night in the hospital. One night, I heard loud noises and I rushed out to see people beating up a doctor,” says Poacha. He asked what the matter was and was told that the doctor had ‘killed’ a patient. Delving deeper, he understood that the patient’s relatives had been told to arrange for some blood which they couldn’t manage. Something stirred in Poacha. A few years later, he was personally affected when a friend called to ask for help arranging blood donors. “We weren’t able to, and the person died,” he says.




So, in March 1999, he got into a conversation about starting a website that would make the connection. He realised the power the internet would play, “but things like domain names, servers, all this was not known to us, and so we registered the name www.indianblooddonors.com. It was only later that someone told them that .com was usually used for a business and that they could have registered it as .org. “My wife, Fermin and I spent ₹40,000 to ₹45,000 on this, buying a second-hand computer and domain name, hosting the website in the US. It was a huge amount those days, and I withdrew my PF for this,” says Poacha.
The first few who registered were friends. This was soon followed by using the paging technology. Poacha put out a line asking people to page him if they needed blood and someone from outside Nagpur paged back saying they did. He immediately connected to his registered friends, and someone who had never been a donor before stepped forward. “When I saw the way the person thanked her, I knew this would work,” he says.
An employee of the Indian Railways, his wife worked in a school office, and he says he was clear it never was, nor ever will be about making money off it, or even turning it into an NGO. It will, however, reach out to as many people as possible, using the most popular technology of the time, because “people at the bottom of the pyramid should be able to access it”.




In 2001, the Gujarat earthquake happened. His wife’s family was from there, and though they were unhurt, he felt he needed to do something. He made a cold call to Zee TV, asking them to run the website in the ticker. “Our site crashed in half an hour. It was January 26, so everyone was on leave. I woke up the guard at the web hosting company (by then he had moved the website to an Indian server), and begged him for the number of the company owner. That very day, they moved the website to a standalone server,” he says. The company, Net4India, till date, hosts the website free of cost.
After this, the numbers on the website only grew, and today, there are over 50,000 registered donors online. In 2009, they started keeping track of numbers, and have connected 1,36,000 people since then. When mobile services picked up, SMSes were what kept up the momentum. He got the idea when his wife sent him out to buy vegetables during a cricket match and he texted a number for a score.
Today, it’s a helpline number 7961907766 on an interactive-voice response (IVR) system that Neil Patel, CEO of Awaaz.De, a volunteer, has helped him set up. There’s also an app for Android (Indian Blood Donors), even as he’s figuring out how WhatsApp can be used to expand reach. He’s currently looking for people to volunteer in other areas of the organisation.
“After 19 years of marriage, I was blessed with a daughter five years ago,” says Poacha. “I am sure it was the blessings of all those thousands of people I have helped.”

Scientists develop bacteria-killing fabric
","An antibacterial fabric with an ability to kill off two of the most infectious and lethal pathogens — E.coli and Staphylococcus aureus — has been developed by researchers in Australia.
Both the pathogens were shown to die off within 10 minutes of contact with this newly created fabric, which utilises the antibacterial properties of silver, according to media reports. The study was conducted by the Australia-based university RMIT in collaboration with Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation and a paper on the new material was recently published in the prestigious journal Advanced Functional Materials.
“It has been known for the last hundred years that silver is anti-bacterial,” said Vipul Bansal, Associate Professor from RMIT University’s School of Applied Sciences.
“Silver metal, when it comes into contact with body fluids, releases silver ions and these ions are actually toxic and have anti-microbial and antibacterial properties,” Bansal said.
“Instead of using silver metals, we developed a new material called silver TCNQ which releases these silver ions quite slowly so the antibacterial effect is long term,” he said.
Potential applications of this fabric include bandaids and wound dressings, surgical gowns and bed sheets as means to reduce hospital-acquired infections.

Gecko species split into three
","Termite hill geckos are all chocolate-brown, banded and small enough to fit into your palm. But the finer physical details and genetic differences reveal that what was believed to be one species is now three: the Whitaker’s, Sahgal’s and southern termite hill geckos.
In the past, scientists depended solely on physical differences to describe new species. Now, researchers can use genetic techniques to identify a new species. Many researchers also use a combination of these to tap into the strengths of both methods and obtain more robust results.
This is precisely what Zeeshan Mirza, of Bengaluru’s National Centre for Biological Sciences (NCBS), and his colleagues did when they suspected that there could be “hidden” species amongst termite hill geckos (lizards which are widely distributed across India, Sri Lanka and Pakistan; their taxonomy has been confusing in the past).
The team collected termite hill geckos across Maharashtra, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu and Pondicherry and extracted genetic data from these samples.
The four genes they studied reveal that all these geckos separated neatly (and robustly) into three different ‘clades’ or branches.
Samples from Nellore, Pondicherry and Sri Lanka (recognised as a sub-species till now) grouped as one, proving that they were one species; the team designated this as the southern termite hill gecko (Hemidactylus triedrus). Samples from south Karnataka and the Nilgiris district in Tamil Nadu formed a separate clade, distinct enough to be a separate species; the researchers named it Hemidactylus whitakeri (in honour of herpetologist Romulus Whitaker’s contributions to the conservation of India’s reptiles). Geckos from Maharashtra, Gujarat and parts of Pakistan clustered together and Mirza and colleagues have named it Hemidactylus sahgali, after Bittu Sahgal, the editor and founder of Sanctuary Asia magazine.
Detailed examinations of the physical features of the geckos from existing literature and by comparing both the newly collected specimens and museum specimens also complemented the genetic descriptions. Small pores on its thigh demarcate the Sahgal’s gecko clearly from the other two; however, identifying and comparing many of these features on field takes a trained eye.
According to Mirza, lead author of the study published in PeerJ, using numerous methods together has helped solve the taxonomy of a species that has been debated for two centuries and also reveals that we do not know enough about the distribution of the Whitaker’s and southern termite hill geckos.
“More studies in India’s arid habitats could reveal more ‘hidden’ species,” he adds.

Instagram launches mobile app for long videos "," 
Facebook Inc-owned social network Instagram launched a mobile app on Wednesday dedicated to user-generated videos that can go up to an hour, thereby intensifying the competition for consumers' time among ad-supported streaming services such as YouTube.
Called IGTV in a nod to traditional television, the service plans to feature videos from rising internet celebrities, artists and pets, some of whom have tens of millions of social media followers.
“Teens are now watching 40% less TV than they did five years ago,” Instagram Chief Executive Kevin Systrom said at an event to announce the launch in San Francisco. “It's time for video to move forward and evolve.”
Facebook shares rose 2.3 % on Wednesday to $202.06 after earlier crossing the $200 mark for the first time.
Instagram, which was founded in 2010 as a photo-sharing app, has surpassed 1 billion users, Systrom said.
Tech firms such as Facebook, Alphabet Inc's YouTube and Snap Inc's Snapchat have been spending heavily to grow mobile video services that will attract both users and corporate brand advertising.
Courting stars to post videos is part of their strategies. Instagram said it has signed up personalities such as Lele Pons, who has 25 million Instagram followers, for IGTV.
Pons said she did not plan to choose sides between two of Silicon Valley's largest companies. “I'm still going to be posting on YouTube as well as on Instagram,” she told reporters.
Facebook on Tuesday launched a separate effort to lure video makers away from YouTube, offering ways to make money on the Facebook app. YouTube said it plans to update its commercialization options this week.
Instagram does not immediately plan to share revenue with video creators but may in the future, Systrom said.
IGTV will be available as part of Instagram's app and as a separate app, he said.
The service does not have advertising at launch, but research firm eMarketer said it expects it will have ads eventually, and that marketers in the meantime will sign up stars for endorsement deals.
As social media “influencers” have gained popularity, “I only wonder why it took Instagram so long to roll this out,” eMarketer analyst Debra Aho Williamson said.
Instagram, which Facebook bought in 2012 for $1 billion, has grown by adding features like messaging and short videos. In 2016, it added the ability to post slideshows that disappear in 24 hours, a copy of Snapchat's popular “stories” feature.

For China’s lonely children, ‘iPal’ robot is a companion ","It speaks two languages, gives math lessons, tells jokes and interacts with children through the tablet screen in its chest — China’s latest robot is the babysitter every parent needs. 
The “iPal” was among a slew of new tech unveiled at the Consumer Electronics Show Asia in Shanghai this week, offering education and company for lonely children and peace of mind for adults.
The humanoid device stands as tall as a five-year-old, moves and dances on wheels and its eyes keep track of its charges through facial recognition technology.
Parents can also remotely talk to and monitor the children through the iPal, which is linked to a smartphone app that allows them to see and hear everything. “The idea for this robot is to be a companion for children,” said Tingyu Huang, co-founder of AvatarMind Robot Technology. “When a child sees it, he or she will think of the robot as a friend, as another child in the family.”
The price tag of 9,000 yuan ($1,400) has not dampened interest from buyers watching a performance of several iPals dancing in unison. “They’re pretty cute. I was just thinking my own two-year-old daughter would love one,” Mike Stone, a buyer from Australia said.
China’s young working parents often face the burden of taking care of children or elders without help from a large extended family, as the impact of the country’s decades-long one-child policy lingers. 
The limit was raised to two children in 2016.

E-tattoos to help monitor health "," Chinese scientists have developed skin-like electronic tattoos, that can be used to monitor health parameters such as blood pressure and body temperature in real time.
 The graphene-based electronic tattoo, developed by scientists from the Tsinghua University in China, can be easily transferred onto various surfaces such as the human skin, leaves and silk. Graphene, a super thin material with excellent flexibility and conductivity, is an ideal material for electronic skin, researchers said.
 It could also be attached to masks and throats to measure body signals such as breathing, heartbeat and voice, according to the research published in the journal ACS Nano.
The electronic skin exhibits high sensitivity and long-term stability. It can withstand higher temperatures and is comfortable to wear, ‘Xinhua’ reported.
 With laser scribing technology, the pattern of the graphene-based electronic skin can be personalised, a feature that will help future commercialisation.
 The electronic skin has huge potential in health care and intelligent systems, scientists said.

All the best game reveals from E3 2018
","This year's Electronic Entertainment Expo, known as E3, the biggest celebration of gaming in the world, and a place where all the newest games are revealed, saw a stunning slew of games released with strong female protagonists. It's great to see that finally gaming it's shedding off it's one dimensional protagonists to embrace more of diversity, letting users identify with who they want to be with their gaming avatars. As always this year was explosive as ever with some incredible games revealed. Here are the best of what was unveiled.
 
The Last of Us 2
Sealed with a kiss and punctuated with brutal violence. The Last of Us 2, sequel to the award winning game from Naughty Dog, warmed our hearts with a beautiful kiss between Ellie, the protagonist and her girlfriend. Like a red apple in a dying forest, the rest of the demo showed Ellie survive against a group of cultists in a return to the post apocalyptic world. There was no glimpse of Joel, Ellie's guardian from the first game.




Cyberpunk 2077
While the latest game from the studio that created Witcher 3 has been on the cards since 2013. This year we finally get a clear glimpse into the world of Cyberpunk 2077's world. You get to chose from a male or female character called V, and you drive, run and gun around a massive futuristic city that seems to combine all your favourite Cyberpunk fiction in one place. With it's retro-futuristic neon styling to it's bold visual language, Cyberpunk 2077 is undoubtedly different.




Ghost of Tsushima
From the makers of the famous Infamous series, comes a game that's a radical departure from their usual body of work, but somehow looks perfect. Set in the year 1274, during the mongol invasion of Tsushima island, the trailer gave us a glimpse of a lone samurai in a beautiful land. There was major Witcher 3 vibes, from the game world to the action. Which was very reactive, with some interesting platforming.




Fallout 76
The next game in the popular post apocalyptic series Fallout 76 is set just a few years after the underground vaults open. Letting you create and play as your own vault dweller to go out into the wasteland to rebuild society. Set in West Virginia, the game is an online game that can also be played offline as a single player experience. Though, with the lands teeming with all manner of beasties, it's best if you have a bunch of friends along.




Assassins Creed Odyssey
The latest Assassins Creed was unveiled, and it's set in Ancient Greece. During the conflict between Sparta and Athens, as well as the zenith of Greece's philosophical and scientific discoveries. You play a descendant of the famous Spartan Leonidas, of 300 fame, as you journey around a beautiful, recreated Greece, fighting on land, sea as well as in large scale battles. The best part is you can choose to play as a male or female protagonist. The game looks a lot like a reskin of Origins and set way before the story of the foundation of the order of Assassins. So perhaps Odyssey tells a completely different story from canon, we'll have to see.




The Division 2
Having it's share of ups and downs, the first Division game emerged victorious. Letting players play as elite agents tasked with taking over and protecting the peace after a virus hits New York. Now the action moves to Washington DC, taking the Massively Multiplayer Online Shooter into another theatre of war, telling a different story. By the looks of the gameplay, it seems to be less of an urban sprawl of the Big Apple, and more of a vegetated area, with lots of foliage. The game also features three new specialisations, so color us interested.




Gears of War 5
With a female lead, the next generation of Gears races ahead with the 5th instalment. An Xbox exclusive, you play as Kait, who is on a personal mission to seek answers to her dreams. While Gears of War 4 seems to be a setup for a new series of games, 5 seems to be quite intense. Our only worry is that it looks same old, same old. Hopefully, the game will go the way of God of War and reinvent itself.




Forza Horizon 4
The latest Forza Horizon 4 is one of the best games revealed at E3, if not the best racing game. Sporting some incredible graphics as cars race across realistic tracks, getting dust and dirt on them. The game is set in Great Britain and features a dynamic weather system as well as the onset of seasons. Each bringing it's own set of thrills and spills with it.




Wolfenstein Youngblood and Doom Eternal
In addition to the reveal of a new Wolfenstein game, featuring the twin daughters of B.J. Blazkowicz, ID Software also revealed Doom Eternal. Youngblood takes the fight to a whole new level, featuring not one, but two protagonists, with which you can co-op play. Doom Eternal gave us an glimpse of an hellscape before the Doom Marine steps in to the backdrop of a melted building. It's that modern take Hell on Earth we've all been waiting for.




Dying Light 2
With game design legend and master storyteller Chris Avellone attached to Dying Light 2. A game about parkour and some intense zombies gets a whole lot better as he showed us how the decision tree works. Where the way you save a water supply could positively or negatively affect the world. Not to mention, at night, the zombies get truly scary.




Rage 2
Id Software announced and gave us an in depth look at Rage 2, from Avalanche studios, the people who gave us the Just Cause games as well as Mad Max. Featuring a dusty post apocalyptic world filled with menacing mutants featuring some incredible first person shooter gameplay that was fast, brutal and filled with weird gadgets and wicked guns. Also shown was the vehicular action, as you take down enemy cars with an assortment of armaments from your armoured vehicle. Rage 2 is definitely the Mad Max game sequel we deserve, with a helpful serving of Doom thrown in.
Other Glimpses
In addition to in depth looks at these games, we also got announcement trailers of a new Elder Scrolls VI, exclusively for next generation consoles, as well as a new intellectual property from Bethesda called Starfield, which looks very sci-fi. EA verbally revealed a new Star Wars game called The Fallen Order. Nintendo revealed Mario Party as well as a new Super Smash Bros Ultimate. Sony revealed a game called Control from Remedy entertainment, featuring their usual time stopping mechanics. The samurai souls game is back with a Nioh 2 reveal. From software had two reveals, one in the form of Shadows die twice, which featured a ninja with a gruesome prosthetic arm, the other is an odd creepy VR game called Déraciné. Microsoft gave us a taste of Halo Infinite, teasing the return of Master Chief. We did see Just Cause 4 and way too much of Kingdom Hearts 3 and Rise of the Tomb Raider.

Human population, roads reduce effectiveness of protected areas
"," Designated protected areas such as wildlife parks and sanctuaries are effective at preventing forest loss — except when there are roads or more populous areas nearby, find scientists. 
Loss of forests is a worry in most tropical countries including India which is home to the Western Ghats, one of the world’s major biodiversity hotspots. To assess trends of forest loss in the Ghats, a team including Meghna Agarwala from Ashoka University, analysed high-resolution Landsat satellite imagery from 2000 to 2016. The teamexamined whether the forest loss correlates with factors including protection status of an area (protected area PA, versus non-PA) and proximity to roads and towns. They collected biophysical (slope, elevation etc, which play a role in patterns of forest loss), demographic (human population densities from census data) and administrative (protection status of an area) data from multiple sources, incorporating this into their spatial analysis.
The results, published in Biological Conservation, show that forest loss — though confined to only small patches — is higher in wetter areas, higher altitudes and near rivers and lakes across 89,681 sqkm of forests in the Ghats. Protected areas were 30% less likely to lose forest than non-protected areas, especially when forests were closer to roads and towns. However, the advantage of protection declined by 32% when local population densities increased.
“Interestingly, we found that the benefits of protection can be modulated by how close a forest area lies to a road or how dense the surrounding human populations are,” writes co-lead author Meghna Krishnadas of Yale University, U.S., in an email to The Hindu. “In the case of roads and protection, we found that protection reduced forest loss, but the benefit of protection diminished if the forest patch was within 4 km of a road.”
However, the results varied when the team analysed two smaller landscapes in Karnataka, hinting that local factors are important mediators of forest loss patterns. This could include how locals use forests in their vicinity and working with communities could improve long-term forest conservation, adds Ms. Krishnadas. 0“Larger studies like these can help scientists explore local degradation near roads,” says scientist P. Jeganathan of the Nature Conservation Foundation who was not part of the study but has studied wildlife roadkills in the Ghats. “It would have been interesting to explore how other linear infrastructure — like powerlines or canals — also impact forest loss. Translating this into policy would be crucial,” he adds.

Boys have more tightly knit band of friends than girls: study
","Boys in schools may be more ‘cliquey’ than girls, forming the most tight-knit friendship groups often structured around gender, a study has found. A clique describes group of individuals who exclusively interact with one another, and are often not welcoming to outsiders.
The findings, published in the journal PLOS ONE suggests that factors such as location and timetable may have an impact on the social networks that children develop.
Social mixing patterns are commonly used in mathematical models of infectious disease which can play a vital role in public health planning, such as determining effective vaccination strategies. Children’s mixing patterns are recognised as particularly important, as they represent a key risk group for disease transmission. As school is the primary location for many of their interactions, understanding how children socialise there is vital.
Researchers from the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine and the University of Cambridge in the UK, examined the features and structure of children’s social networks within different schools.
Previous research on social interactions among children has generally focused on just a single day. The team surveyed the self-reported contacts of 460 year 7 pupils across four UK secondary schools over a five month period (between January and June 2015). In total pupils completed 1,254 surveys, reporting contact information such as who they spend the most time with. The schools in the study were selected to be representative of different geographical and socioeconomic settings, for example including rural and urban and single-sex and mixed-sex schools.
Researchers found that while the overall structure of contacts within children’s networks was generally consistent within schools, the patterns of interactions varied considerably between each school. In most schools, children formed well-defined groups, whereas in one school, children interacted more widely.
Interestingly there were only small differences reported in individuals’ contacts and networks over the five months, suggesting that well connected and weakly connected, ie popular or less popular – children remain that way over time.
The characteristics of social networks were found to be mainly dependent on gender and to a lesser extent on other factors, such as school class. In particular, males tended to cluster together more in each mixed-sex school in the survey.
“Previous studies have typically looked at social interactions over a single day, so there has been limited information available on how much variation there might be in social mixing patterns over time in schools,” said Adam Kucharski, lead author at London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine. “Showing boys are potentially more cliquey than girls, perhaps going against gender stereotypes, and that popular children remain popular over time, is an interesting social insight but for mathematical modellers this type of information is also extremely valuable.”
“Understanding age-specific social mixing patterns is vital for studying outbreaks of infectious diseases like flu and measles which can spread rapidly, particularly among children,” he said. “It’s useful to find that mixing patterns are fairly consistent, as this suggests it will be easier to analyse social interactions among children than was previously thought. It also shows the value of working directly with schools to study these questions.”

When less is more
"," Let’s do a small thought exercise. What are some of the things that come to mind when you think of how startups work? Fast, agile, nimble, constantly trying out 10 different things at the same time, unafraid to take risks and failures, an always-on mindset, and many more such qualities.
Each one of these is an excellent quality to have. But I will say something that may sound slightly unintuitive here. These are all excellent qualities for larger organisations to aspire to, but not necessarily excellent qualities for smaller startups to have.
Let’s rewind to our thought exercise. Now, think of some qualities that come to mind when you think of how successful startups work. A thorough understanding of the problem that they are trying to solve, an unwavering focus on solving said problem in the best way possible, and importantly, the confidence and patience to give the solution as much time as it needs. None of this means that they have been slow, or have had stunted growth. It just means that doing too many things is not the route for maximum growth, but doing the right things the right way is.
There is a very basic problem with doing too many things. You will never do a good job of any of those things. And this problem gets exacerbated when you are a startup always low on resources, and faced with various constraints. Do not put 50 buggy products, or features, or services out there. You will never get a medal for 50 failures. Instead work on getting 10 really good things out into the market, and then watch the accolades roll in.
The reason startups fall into this trap of doing too many things is because a certain idea of “growth hacking” has taken root in the startup scene both here in India, and elsewhere. To the extent that a lot of founders have swapped the sounder idea of doing what’s strategic with just doing more. And that idea flows down the organisation from there. Employees are encouraged and empowered to just do more, and rewarded too. And while it is easy to get convinced that it is the right goal to have, it is very hard to notice that doing the right things often falls by the wayside in this quest to do more.
So how does a founder look out for this trap? For one, if you are doing too many things to solve some problem, and yet the customers are not adopting it, there is a good chance that the problem itself may not be pressing enough. Stop before you do even more things, and look at whether you are solving the right problem even. Next, avoid just validating every idea you are executing in isolation. Validate it against what your business is, and what gives you money. If it is not making business sense, drop it. And related to this, even before you start building something, make sure you know how to sell it. This way, your startup can avoid wasting time working on a lot of cool things that suck a lot of time and make you no money. 
Over and above all this, and this is a mantra that all my years of product management have taught me: Prioritise. Prioritise. Prioritise. At every step of the way. This automatically enables the discipline of working only on the most important things. Do less. That really is the best way of doing more.

Indian-origin scientist gets funding for project ","An Indian-origin scientist working on a project to create a robotic hand covered in so-called brainy skin that mimics the human sense of touch has won 1.5 million pounds in funding for the project.
Professor Ravinder Dahiya, a faculty at the University of Glasgow’s School of Engineering, said the futuristic “thinking skin concept” is inspired by the real skin. 
The super-flexible, hypersensitive skin may one day be used to make more responsive prosthetics for amputees, or to build robots with a sense of touch.
Brainy skin is critical for the autonomy of robots and for a safe human-robot interaction to meet emerging societal needs such as helping the elderly, said Professor Dahiya.
Along with his Bendable Electronics and Sensing Technologies (BEST) team, the scientist has plans to develop ultra-flexible, synthetic “Brainy Skin” that thinks for itself . Brainy Skin reacts like human skin, which has its own neurons that respond immediately to touch rather than having to relay the whole message to the brain.
This electronic thinking skin is made from silicon-based printed neural transistors and graphene — an ultra-thin form of carbon that is only an atom thick, but stronger than steel. 
The new version in the making is said to be more powerful, less cumbersome and would work better than earlier prototypes.
Mimics skin morphology
Professor Dahiya explains, Human skin is an incredibly complex system capable of detecting pressure, temperature and texture through an array of neural sensors that carry signals from the skin to the brain.
Inspired by real skin, this project will harness the technological advances in electronic engineering to mimic some features of human skin, such as softness, bendability and now, also sense of touch. This skin will not just mimic the morphology of the skin but also its functionality. 
The research, dubbed neuPRINTSKIN (Neuromorphic Printed Tactile Skin), received the latest 1.5 million pounds in funding from the Engineering and Physical Science Research Council (EPSRC).
The team’s work means tactile data is gathered over large areas by the synthetic skin’s computing system rather than sent to the brain for interpretation. 
With additional EPSRC funding, which extends Professor Dahiya’s fellowship by another three years, he plans to introduce tactile skin with neuron-like processing. This breakthrough in the tactile sensing research will lead to the first neuromorphic tactile skin, or brainy skin .
To achieve this, Professor Dahiya will add a new neural layer to the e-skin that he has already been developed using printing silicon nanowires.

'Metal Gear Survive' review: potential let down by dull game mechanics "," After the public breakup between legendary game designer Hideo Kojima and Konami, the fate of the illustrious Metal Gear Solid, a series that Kojima has been synonymous with for decades, lies in the balance. While we do know the series will probably never have that cinematic flair and breath of life that Kojima’s signature style is known for, a return to the world of Metal Gear was inevitable. After the success and brilliance of Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain, Konami has a tough act to follow with Survive.


What’s it about?
Those who have played a Metal Gear Solid game will know the game is packed with lots of acronyms, secret organisations, code words, technologies and more, making it impossible to condense the story into a small space as this. Survive is sort of a standalone game like Metal Gear Rising, which takes place directly after the events of Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes. Taking place in a parallel dimension, where a portion of Motherbase gets sucked into a vortex, you play a soldier sent by a scientist known as Goodluck through the wormhole, to find out what happened. Except you’re infected by some sort of virus, and you’re surrounded by mysterious zombies.




In an attempt to continue what fans expect from a Kojima project, Survive continues the tradition of long cinematics, with an intro that tries so hard it turns out boring. This sets the precedent for the rest of the game, which has a story that has the makings of an exciting one, but ultimately fails on so many levels. Chief of them being the fact that it fails to arouse any interest beyond the interesting premise of a parallel universe, which is just a drab excuse of reusing The Phantom Pain’s maps.
Even the radio conversations, which serve for excellent story exposition and give you the perfect break in letting you get to know the characters, are boring in Survive. There is nothing memorable about the game.
How does it play?
Survive takes the series into new Survival Horror territory, with the signature stealth elements. The survival layer is admittedly fun, as you balance your water and food intake and relentlessly scavenge for ammo, food or materials to build your base. Making things worse, you are also on a time limit, as the infection takes hold, which means you need to scavenge more to stave that off. You can only achieve this by exploring more, and Survive takes great pains in making the process painful and arduous. As your hunger and thirst constantly slow you down, diverting your attention to constantly appease those.




The grinding elements are what bog the game down, though it is oddly relaxing with that whole find, rinse, repeat gameplay of finding resources. In addition to the survival, the game is about building and maintaining your base in a sort of a tower defence gameplay. Something like what Fallout 4 achieves, complete with surviving humans toiling to keep the base alive, as you scavenge for resources to keep everything running and the monsters out of your space. This is the most fun you will have in this game, after you have spent hours scavenging to make those brief moments happen.
Metal Gear Survive uses the same maps and resources as The Phantom Pain. Not to mention the game has an annoying micro transaction element, which would be all right if it didn’t charge you money to start a new character, while keeping your last one. In a world where games encourage you to replay the game with a new character, Survive should rethink this strategy. Even the enemy types are all the same, and there is no variation in their attack patterns to make the game challenging. Instead, the challenge comes from navigating the multitudes of menus micromanaging your base or your stats.
Should you get it?
At its core, Survive is a collection of some great ideas built by a passionate team. The execution though is a boring, uninspiring and uninteresting game that takes itself too seriously, resulting in a series of tiring chores. Survive is a game meant for ardent Metal Gear enthusiasts and those who want a serious survival horror sim.

Astronomers puzzled by ‘cow’ in the sky
"," Astronomers across the world are puzzled by a new phenomenon — a very bright celestial object seen close to the very small galaxy CGCG 137-068 — reported in The Astronomer’s Telegram on June 17. Since then, the journal has been receiving a spate of communications, from Indian astrophysicists, too. A fast-brightening spot, initially thought to be a bright transient astronomical event lying close to the galaxy CGCG 137-068, was spotted by the ATLAS telescope. Named AT2018cow, the transient was soon given the nickname ‘cow’. This is not due to any resemblance to the quadruped but a mere coincidence of letters in the way of naming such transients.
The cow proved to be suitably interesting, because though it was initially thought to be a nova, later analysis showed that it was more like a broadline supernova of the type Ic. Transient astronomical events last from a few seconds to several weeks and may have several causes. Specifically, a Type Ic supernova is caused by the explosion of an extremely massive star which has lost its outer layers of hydrogen and helium. 
“As part of the GROWTH collaboration, we are keeping an eye on the mysterious transient AT2018cow using the 2-metre Himalayan Chandra Telescope (HCT) at Hanle, Ladakh,” says Shubham Srivastav, a post-doctoral fellow at IIT Bombay, in an email to The Hindu. The HCT observations indicate that the transient is steadily fading in all optical bands. Although spectroscopic features indicate a tentative similarity with broad line Ic supernovae, its true nature remains a puzzle, he adds.
A.J. Nayana, a research scholar at National Centre for Radio Astrophysics, Pune (NCRA) says: “We observed AT2018cow with the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) on June 28 and reported our first results on June 29 in The Astronomers Telegram.” Since there are many transients being discovered each day, the researchers had to wait and decide if this object was worth the effort. Also, as Prof Poonam Chandra at NCRA, Pune, explains, “Radio frequencies are the lowest energy of the electromagnetic spectrum and the object evolves much later at radio frequencies. The GMRT results tell us that the radio-frequency radiation is still absorbed, most likely, by the relativistic electrons themselves which are responsible for the radio emission.”
 Astronomers are in a frenzy trying to figure out what this is. “Even if it is finally a Type IC supernova, it will not be a conventional one,” says Varun Bhalerao from the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, who is involved in analysing data received from the GMRT as well as the Himalayan Chandra Telescope. “The images and spectrum were obtained by the Hanle facility and GMRT. We have requested Astrosat to observe and it will start on July 3,” he adds.
In particular, AT2018cow’s fast rise time and high luminosity are unprecedented for a supernova. Hence it seems like nothing that was known before. “Anything in the unknown territory becomes exciting, and hence currently difficult to explain. However, I am confident that as astronomy community collects more data in multiple wavelengths, we will be able to nail down this exotic supernova,” says Prof. Chandra.

Fighting fire
"," What you do day-to-day at your job, when you are at any level of management, and especially so in the world of technology, can be divided into a convenient dichotomy. There is time that you spend on immediate problems, usually under tremendous amounts of pressure because of the impact that not tackling the problems will have on your business. Then there is time that you spend on making plans for the long term, trying to shape the directions in which your business will grow. Some term this dichotomy as ‘running the business’ versus ‘scaling the business’. I prefer to think of it in terms of dousing the flames of a house on fire versus digging a pit to lay stones as foundation for a big house that you intend to build.
In a larger company, fighting fires is easy. The fire can be compartmentalised, localised, and fought. Think of it as a large skyscraper, where there is a fire in one floor. Unless the fire is really catastrophic, or people fail to handle it correctly, it will not bring the whole building down. You can even have teams focusing on just firefighting, and you can have a whole bunch of other people thinking about building long-term businesses.
But in startups, it often feels like one’s entire time is taken up by firefighting. There are product features failing. There are cases of the operations set-up not being able to handle sudden surges in demand. There are vendors demanding payment. There are clients who are refusing to pay up. There are angry customers threatening hell and high water because they feel that they are entitled to far more than what they have paid for. It is like a small unfinished house full of highly flammable materials that has caught fire, and the damage that it causes can quickly turn permanent and irreversible. At a time when entrepreneurs should be thinking about how their startups can scale up, and build for the future, they end up using all their resources on just keeping the company alive.
So what should startups be doing to avoid the dangers of perennial firefighting? A mantra from the world of healthcare is useful here. Prevention and early detection. As a startup, pay extra attention to cases that go wrong and cause flare-ups, and make sure that you have mitigation plans at hand. 
The mitigation plans may range from something as unrelated to your business as having a good relationship with the local police (which can come in handy when a client is refusing to pay), to training your employees with at least two different skills, so that they can fill in for other roles under conditions that call for it. Also, fight these fires when they are still small. This is usually a matter of prioritisation. If something looks like it is about to be problematic, pay attention to it immediately and get it out of the way. The more you push doing that to a different day, the greater the probability of the fire being catastrophic.

‘Hyper social’ tendencies behind smartphone addiction "," Humans are addicted to continuous social interaction, and not to their smartphone devices, a study of dysfunctional use of smart technology has found.
 The findings, published in Frontiers in Psychology, suggest that smartphone addiction could be hyper-social, not anti-social.
“There is a lot of panic surrounding this topic. We’re trying to offer some good news and show that it is our desire for human interaction that is addictive - and there are fairly simple solutions to deal with this,” said Samuel Veissiere, from McGill University in Canada.
 We all know people who, seemingly incapable of living without the bright screen of their phone for more than a few minutes, are constantly texting and checking out what friends are up to on social media.
 These are examples of what many consider to be the antisocial behaviour brought on by smartphone addiction, a phenomenon that has garnered media attention in the past few months and led investors and consumers to demand that tech giants address this problem.
 Veissiere said that the desire to watch and monitor others - but also to be seen and monitored by others - runs deep in our evolutionary past.
 Humans evolved to be a uniquely social species and require constant input from others to seek a guide for culturally appropriate behaviour.
 This is also a way for them to find meaning, goals, and a sense of identity. Researchers reviewed current literature on dysfunctional use of smart technology through an evolutionary lens.
 They found that the most addictive smartphone functions all shared a common theme: they tap into the human desire to connect with other people.
 While smartphones harness a normal and healthy need for sociality, Veissiere agrees that the pace and scale of hyper-connectivity pushes the brain’s reward system to run on overdrive, which can lead to unhealthy addictions.
 Turning off push notifications and setting up appropriate times to check your phone can go a long way to regain control over smartphone addiction. Research suggests that workplace policies “that prohibit evening and weekend emails” are also important.
“Rather than start regulating the tech companies or the use of these devices, we need to start having a conversation about the appropriate way to use smartphones,” said Veissiere.
“Parents and teachers need to be made aware of how important this is,” he said.

Modified paddy cultivation method seems to hold better promise
","Rice, a major crop in Andhra Pradesh, is cultivated using water from borewells, tanks or open wells. Since the crop grows in standing water ground water depletion is usually high especially during summer.
In addition to the water shortage, non-availability of labour on time is also increasing the cost of production, forcing farmers to give up rice cultivation citing low productivity and high labour costs as reasons.
A different look at newer production methods that are relatively cost effective and use water more productively becomes imperative against the backdrop of the deepening water crisis and dwindling productivity under the inundation method of rice cultivation.
SRI (systematic rice intensification) is a proven methodology for comprehensively managing resources — changing the way land, seeds, water, nutrients and human labour are used.
“But in present times even SRI has some practical problems. The cono weeder which is an important tool in the cultivation practices is too heavy for pulling in the fields by the farmers. The other problem area is transplanting the seedlings from the nursery to the main field, which is quite labour intensive. With these in mind the Rashtiya Seva Samithi (Rass) — Krishi Vigyan Kendra in Chittoor district has slightly modified the practices using a fibre-bodied 8-rowed paddy seeder (drum seeder) for sowing the seeds and modified the weeder in such a way that it runs between the space in (20 cm) between the two paddy rows,” says Mr. C.Manohar, Programme Coordinator at the institute.
With the assistance of NABARD the institute organised capacity building activities like training programmes on modified practices to create awareness and motivate farmers to adopt the technology.
Exposure visits and field days were organised to showcase the performance of the technology and finally to disseminate the same among the farming communities in different parts of the district.
“About 60 eight-rowed paddy seeders and 300 conoweeders were purchased and kept in the homes of master trainers in the villages and at the office of the agricultural officer. Farmers who wanted to take up this cultivation could contact the agricultural officer or facilitator for the drum seeder and weeder and return them after completion,” says Mr. Manohar.
“Timely availability of the drum seeders and weeders are an important step in this practice. Farmers should be able to source the machines on time. That is why we have ensured that apart from the agriculture office the machines are also available in their respective villages. Otherwise it becomes a problem for the grower to get a good yield. Growers were also supplied with pre-emergence herbicide for weed management,” he adds.
The institute published a pamphlet on direct seeding technology in Telugu and distributed it to farmers to get their feedback on this. Five facilitators were recruited in this project. In addition to this, KVK also trained ten master trainers and their services were utilized for sowing, weed management etc in the project area.
“Both facilitators and master trainers not only helped the farmers with modified technology but also provided other advisory services like weather, pest and disease management, water management, weed management etc. through the Kissan mobile service of the institute. We started the project during rabi 2010 season and completed it in kharif 2013 season,” says S. Sreenivasulu, subject matter specialist. Demonstrations of this modified SRI method were conducted in 140 villages in the district. Results from the data of three previous years collected showed that the average yield obtained in modified SRI method was 2,574 kg per acre, whereas it was 2,325 kg in the traditional method. About 11 per cent yield increase was observed in the modified SRI method than in the traditional method.
An additional advantage was reduction in cultivation cost. It is also observed that the cost of cultivation is reduced by about Rs.4,000-5,000 per acre in this method due to skipping of practices like nursery raising and manual transplanting. Duration of the crop is also reduced by 7-10 days in modified SRI method compared to conventional practice.

Universe evolution recreated in laboratory
","Scientists have come up with the best computer model yet of the universe. This new virtual cosmos created by U.S., German and English researchers includes details never before achieved in a simulation.
Called Illustris, the numerical-based model covers the 13 billion-year evolution of the universe beginning just 12 million years after the Big Bang, or creation. The model accurately depicts the distribution and composition of various types of galaxies.
Illustris was developed by a team led by astrophysicist Mark Vogelsberger of Massachusetts Institute of Technology. It’s described in Thursday’s issue of the journal Nature.
The Illustris creators say it represents “a significant step forward in modelling galaxy formation.” They attribute their success to advanced computer power.
Previous attempts have broadly reproduced the web of galaxies, but failed to create mixed populations of galaxies or predict gas and metal content

NASA launches advanced weather satellite for western U.S. ","NASA launched another of the world’s most advanced weather satellites on Thursday, this time to safeguard the western U.S.
The GOES-S satellite thundered toward orbit aboard an Atlas V rocket, slicing through a hazy late afternoon sky. Dozens of meteorologists gathered for the launch, including TV crews from the Weather Channel and WeatherNation.
GOES-S is the second satellite in an approximately $11 billion effort that’s already revolutionising forecasting with astonishingly fast, crisp images of hurricanes, wildfires, floods, mudslides and other natural calamities.
The first spacecraft in the series, GOES-16, has been monitoring the Atlantic and East Coast for the past year for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration . The same first-class service is now coming to the Pacific region.
Besides the West Coast, Alaska and Hawaii, GOES-S also will keep watch over Mexico and Central America. It will become GOES-17 once it reaches its intended 22,000-mile-high orbit over the equator in a few weeks, and should be officially operational by year’s end.
“We can’t wait!” tweeted the National Weather Service in Anchorage just before the rocket soared from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station.
The weather service’s Jim Yoe said on NASA TV that he was “really excited” to see his first launch in person.
“I’m even more excited about the work that’s coming up for me and my colleagues, putting these new data to work for better forecasts and warnings for the American public,” said Mr. Yoe, an official at the Joint Center for Satellite Data Assimilation.
With these two new satellites, NOAA’s high-definition coverage will stretch from the Atlantic near West Africa, a hotbed for hurricane formation, all the way across the U.S. and the Pacific out to New Zealand.
It’s the third weather tracker launched by NASA in just over a year- “three brilliant eyes in the sky,” as NOAA satellite director Stephen Volz puts it. GOES-16 launched in late 2016 and an environmental satellite rocketed into a polar orbit from California last November.
These next-generation Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites, or GOES, are “a quantum leap above” the federal agency’s previous weather sentinels, Mr. Volz said. This is the 18th launch of a GOES since 1975; one was lost in an explosion during liftoff and all but three of the satellites already up there are retired. Rockets by United Launch Alliance, a venture between Lockheed Martin and Boeing, carried all those GOES.
Even as it was still being checked in orbit, GOES-16 provided invaluable data to firefighters battling blazes in Texas, Oklahoma and elsewhere last March and to Houston-area rescue teams in the flooded aftermath of Hurricane Harvey last August, according to officials. GOES-16 also observed the uncertain path of Hurricanes Irma and the rapidly intensifying Hurricane Maria in September.
GOES-16 “turned out to be better than we expected it to be,” said National Weather Service director Louis Uccellini, on hand for Thursday’s launch. The satellite wasn’t officially on duty yet, “and we were just standing there gawking at the imagery,”
As Hurricane Harvey approached the Texas coast, the satellite revealed the clouds sinking in the eye and the eye expanding as the storm morphed from a category 2 to 4, Mr. Uccellini said. Those images helped determine when it was safe for rescue teams to go out and save stranded residents, he added.
The satellite also alerted authorities in Texas and Oklahoma to the eruption of new blazes even before the 911 calls came in, Mr. Uccellini said. He said the satellite also tracked the direction of the fires like never before, prompting first responders to later tell NOAA, “You saved lives.”
Two more are planned in this four-satellite series- GOES-T in 2020 and GOES-U in 2024. The $10.8 billion cost includes the development, launch and operation of all four satellites as well as ground systems through 2036.

#NomoreBagheeras: a movement to fight online sale of dogs and cats
"," Last month a 21-day-old Labrador puppy, endearingly named Bagheera, was bought on Quikr. He was born with a contagious, fatal viral disease, called canine distemper, usually caused due to vaccinations not given on time and unhygienic living conditions. Sadly, Bagheera died.
The petition
Puppy mills and backyard breeders are what the largely unregulated, untaxed pet industry ends up being. Breeding animals in horrible conditions, where they are taken away as newborn babies from their mothers, confined in cramped spaces, with barely any vaccinations or places to defecate, and without proper food, often leads to animals contracting or even being born with diseases.
As with most things, the Internet has added to the trade. Now, #NomoreBagheeras is a movement to fight this menace. About 20 groups from all over India — including Bombat Dawgz, CUPA (Bengaluru), Federation of Indian Animal Protection Organisations (FIAPO) (Delhi), VOSD, RESQ (Pune), The Pound (Chennai), Jhatkaa and Humane Society International — have joined hands and launched a petition (bit.ly/onlinepets) seeking the total ban of pets online. The petition was triggered by CJ Memorial Trust and front-ended by the members of Cubbon Park Canines, Bengaluru, a dog-lovers group founded by Priya Chetty-Rajagopal. The petition has been signed by more than 30,000 people.
A Facebook post by group member Anushree Thamanna, who fostered Bagheera, showing a poignant picture of a tired sleeping foster mom and a dying Bagheera, triggered the launch of the petition and signature drive.
The rules
The Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (Dog Breeding and Marketing) Rules, 2017, clearly states no public display of pets is allowed for ‘instant’ sale. It also lays down the rules for dog breeders to have a legal licence. No dog below the age of eight weeks can legally be sold. 
“Bagheera was just three weeks old when sold. He would search for his mother’s nipple because he was separated from her very early. Of course, we are very emotional, our hearts are bleeding, but our brains haven’t stopped functioning. We are talking about rules and regulations. The law discourages ‘public display of pets for instant sale’ because it prompts impulsive buying. There is also the question of anonymity. Breeders put up ads of selling dogs online, and once the dog is sold, they disappear, switch off their phone and change their numbers,” says Chetty-Rajagopal, who says that the sale of Bagheera, has transgressed the law.
Bagheera was meant to be a surprise birthday gift for a person. We don’t know if she/he was ready for the dog, but the ease of buying a ‘cute adorable puppy’ online, accelerates such sales. 
“There are very effective laws on paper, but are they being implemented and followed? The person the dog was gifted to didn’t know what to do, especially with a sick dog, and the breeder is untraceable. One breeder in Ejipura got a paralysed Alsatian and wondered if she could give birth, otherwise, he said, “she is of no use to me”.
Cyber canine combat cops
Following his death, the groups formed a cyber outfit: Cyber Canine Combat Cops, which started collecting data pertaining to ads of dogs and cats posted online. “Research shocked the team. Quikr itself had 791-odd pages of puppy listings for sale. Indiamart has hundreds of pedigree pups on ‘wholesale’.
 According to Chetty-Rajagopal, “Even though the Facebook policy is crystal clear against the sale of drugs, dogs and guns, there are Facebook groups selling dogs online. A Google doc was started for recording all transgressions. Even Instagram, Snapchat and YouTube were flaunting sales. One Instagram ad actually said dogs were ‘available as low as ₹999, so call us now!’”
The group began connecting with different online platforms. “We received canned responses saying the matter would be looked into. Nothing happened,” says Chetty-Rajagopal. In the meantime, the WhatsApp group brought together people from diverse backgrounds, and they began writing to companies that put out such ads and are now consulting with legal experts. 
“Marshalls Pet Zone stopped listing, as did Justdial, and FB removed dogs for sale from Marketplace but NOT on its groups. We really appreciate other online platforms for choosing not to sell beating hearts online,” says Chetty-Rajagopal. 
A parallel campaign is also on the cards to educate buyers about the perils of buying online.
Response from Quikr
We were recently made aware of dog breeding malpractices by a few petitioners and we thank them for bringing it to our attention. We are committed towards healthy community practices and are always looking to evolve and are working on doing the right things.
To begin with, we launched an email campaign under ‘Quikr Cares’ to educate our consumers about dog breeding and marketing rules, 2017. They were given about three weeks to produce necessary documentation with a request to delete the ads and we deleted them if they did not meet the criteria. We also spoke to about 600+ customers to educate them about these rules. While the awareness was low, 30% were willing to apply for the certification, a few said they have the licence, some others showed resistance stating these rules were being discussed with the ministry. We are also in touch with a couple of AWBI (Animal Welfare Board of India) members.
On the product side, some of the key rules of AWBI are prominently displayed for both sellers and buyers on our platform. Consumers cannot proceed to post an ad without an AWBI registration number and the certificate. We have deleted a few thousand ads and it’s a work in progress.

IISER Pune uses nanovesicles to improve cancer drug delivery
"," By encapsulating the poorly water-soluble anticancer drug Alisertib in polysaccharide nano-sized balls or vesicles, researchers at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) Pune have been able to increase its uptake by breast cancer cells and achieve greater ability to restrict cancer cell growth. Better uptake of the drug when encapsulated meant lower concentration (0.02 microM) of the drug was sufficient to restrict cancer growth significantly better than the free drug.
The study, which was started about six years ago, gains importance as the drug by targeting AU`RKA now selectively inhibits RalA protein thereby disrupting cancer cells’ ability to grow without anchorage (anchorage independent growth). Anchorage independence in tumors is what allows cells to spread and grow at new sites in the body — metastasis.
Target protein
Since producing inhibitors against RalA protein is challenging and the existing inhibitor is not specific (targets both RalA and RalB), the researchers chose to target Aurora Kinase A (AURKA) instead. Aberrant AURKA activity has been implicated in cancer formation, and its inhibition could potentiate the effect of chemotherapies. When AURKA is silenced, RalA protein, which is present downstream, gets automatically (and selectively) inhibited.
The researchers embedded breast cancer cells in 3D gels (collagen or agarose) and incubated them with nanovesicles containing the drug and a florescent dye. In 15 days the breast cancer cells grew into a colony in the 3D gel. About 75% of the encapsulated drug was retained in the nanovesicle and carried into cancer cells during the 15-day period.
“While the free drug did not inhibit the colony forming ability of cancer cells, the number of colonies was significantly reduced in the presence of nanovesicles loaded with the drug,” says Prof. Nagaraj Balasubramanian from the Department of Biology who led the team along with Prof. Manickam Jayakannan from the Department of Chemistry, IISER Pune.
The encapsulated drug produced 94% inhibition of the target AURKA leading to 25% inhibition of RalA; the drug did not affect RalB. As a result, there was 38% inhibition of anchorage independent growth of cancer cells.
In comparison, at 50%, the Ral inhibitor achieved greater inhibition of RalA than the encapsulated drug but the inhibition was not specific — RalB was inhibited by 64%. The inhibition of anchorage independent growth was only 33%.
“What was interesting is that besides being specific to RalA, the encapsulated drug achieved greater inhibition of anchorage independent growth than the Ral inhibitor. This despite the Ral inhibitor achieving double the inhibition of RalA than the encapsulated drug,” says Prof. Balasubramanian. 
“So the Alisertib drug did better than the existing Ral inhibitor and led to better inhibition of anchorage independent growth. That’s the most striking observation of the study,” he says. The results were published in the journal Molecular Pharmaceutics.
For this study, the nanovesicles were encapsulated with only one drug (Alisertib) in the hydrophobic envelop while a fluroscent dye was loaded in the hydrophilic core. But the 2014 study (published in the journal Nanoscale) by the team showed that loading the nanovesicles with two drugs enhances the therapeutic efficacies against cancer cells.
Hydrophobic and hydrophilic anticancer drugs loaded in the envelop and core of the nanovesicle respectively performed better than free drugs and synergistically killed breast and colon cancer cells. The proof-of-concept study was published in 2012 in Biomacromolecules.
“We are aiming to start animal studies in mice to study how well the drug contained in nanovesicles is able to inhibit breast cancer tumours. We are also using this drug loaded in nanovesicle to inhibit and study the role of AURKA and RalA in normal and cancer cells. So it also becomes a tool to understand the role of these proteins in cells,” he says. 
Fabricating nanovesicles
“To make the nanovesicles self-assemble, we undertook some modifications to the dextran polysaccharide using a molecule from cashew nut shell extract,” says Prof. Jayakannan. “Since both are from bio-based nanosystems, the nanovesicles are not toxic to cells, and possibly human, and are biodegradable.”
Prof. Jayakannan and his team started working on making the nanovesicles self-assemble way back in 2008 and in 2012 they succeeded once they knew the structure that is required to make the nanovesicle with modification.
“The nanovesicle is bilayered and is held together to form a stable vesicle through hydrophilic-hydrophobic interactions,” Prof. Jayakannan says. Since the nanovesicles are about 120 nanometre in size, they are easily taken up by cancer tissue but not normal tissue. 
Also, nanovesicles with the drugs loaded become water dispersible thus increasing the uptake by cancer cells. “We are working to make the nanovesicles even more specific to cancer cells,” Prof. Jayakannan says. The drug-loaded nanovesicles are cleaved by esterase enzyme once inside the cell. “In spite of being cleaved, the drug is released slowly in a controlled manner over 8-10 hours” Prof. Jayakannan says. This would be important for how nanovesicles act in tumours.

Plink: the sound of falling drops decoded
","Scientists have finally cracked the “dripping tap” enigma and know exactly how the sound is generated.
“Until now, everyone thought these sound waves just passed through the water surface and that’s how we heard the sound, much like if you hear someone speaking through a wall,” said Samuel Phillips, an undergraduate student at the University of Cambridge and lead author of a study in Scientific Reports.
The idea to probe further came to Mr. Phillips’ professor, Anurag Agarwal, while he was visiting a friend who had a small leak in the roof of his house. “I was being kept awake by the sound of water falling in a bucket,” he recalled. “The next day I discussed it with my friend and another visiting academic and we were all surprised that no one had actually answered the question of what causes the sound.”
To find out, the researchers set up an experiment making full use of cutting-edge video and audio recording technology. Using ultra-slow-motion video, a microphone and a hydrophone, they were able to perceive details that had previously gone unnoticed.
The trapped air bubble, it turned out, began to vibrate as the cavity deepened. “Sound waves emitted by the vibrating air bubble don’t simply pass through the water surface into the air, as previously thought,” Mr. Phillips explained. “Rather, the oscillating bubble causes the water surface itself to vibrate at the bottom of the cavity, acting like a piston to drive sound waves into the air.” 
No bubble, no ‘plink’ 
Not only did the researched crack the enigma, they also found a way to neutralise the “plink” for those leaky-roof rainy days.
Adding a little dish-soap will do the trick, they said. “It changes the surface tension of the water, and so prevents the bubble from being trapped under the water,” Phillips said. “No bubble means no sound, hence no ‘plink’!”
In 1908, Arthur Mason Worthington published a treatise, A Study of Splashes, featuring the first known photograph in a scientific journal of a drop as it punctures a body of water’s still surface. The image shows the formation of a cavity on the water’s surface upon impact, followed by a narrow column of water rising as the cavity recoils. But if the fluid mechanics of drops-in-liquid have been understood for a century, the signature noise they make remained harder to grasp.
Around 1920, a team of researchers in England decided that resonance inside the tiny water cavity was the likely mechanism behind the sound. A decade later, another group discovered that a minimum height was required to generate a “plink.” Finally, in 1955, scientists noticed the formation of a bubble of air briefly trapped beneath the cavity as it took shape, speculating that when it burst sound waves rose to the surface and escaped into the air.
Over the following decades, dozens of published experiments with increasingly precise instruments backed up this idea.

Five ways 3D printing is changing our lives ","The genesis of 3D printing technology can be traced back to 1986, when an American engineer, Chuck Hull, created a prototype for a process called stereolithography. Often referred to as ‘the father’ of 3D printing, Hull laid down the foundation on which the modern 3D printing technology is built upon. From increasing cost-effectiveness and efficiency to spurring innovation, the technology has made a significant impact on the manufacturing industry in the past couple of years. Here are five revolutionary applications of 3D printing technology and how they are transforming our daily lives.
In the first-of-its-kind concept restaurant in London, 3D printing specialist Food Ink introduced a three-day dinner pop-up series in 2016, where everything, from the food to the restaurant’s furniture and even the cutlery were all 3D-printed. The eatery conducted live sessions for its guests, offering a uniquely immersive experience of witnessing the printing in action and tasting some 3D-printed food. The food items on the menu were all prepared using the company’s ByFlow Focus 3D-Printers and fresh natural ingredients. The food printers use pureed ingredients filled in bags, which are squeezed and guided by its robotic arms to create aesthetically spectacular dishes.




Porsche recently announced that its Porsche Classic division has started using the technology to 3D-print obscure parts for its vintage cars. Using traditional production methods to manufacture these rare parts in limited quantities would otherwise be an extremely expensive affair. However, 3D printing has allowed the company to make cost-effective replacement parts to order, which also eliminates storage overheads. Porsche is currently 3D-printing nine such replacement parts, using steel or plastic to keep rare and valuable classic cars on the road.




GE was one of the first to introduce the technology into the aviation industry. The company, which built the first American jet engine in 1942, created a working mini jet engine made entirely out of 3D-printed parts back in 2015. While it was an experimental project, the company now uses the manufacturing technology to make engine components for commercial planes. In 2016, GE started testing its new engine, the GE9X, which has a sizeable number of 3D-printed parts. The GE9X is also the world’s largest jet engine ever, which has been designed for the upcoming Boeing 777X commercial aircraft. 3D-printing technology has helped the company to render parts once impossible to make, using conventional methods.




Scientists have been working on human capability-enhancers, such as robotic prosthetic limbs that can be controlled by the brain and provide sensory feedback. Additive manufacturing technology plays an important role in turning this dream into reality. Youbionic is a company that was started in 2014 with the sole purpose of creating an augmented human. The company has introduced a unique 3D-printed two-handed prosthetic, which can be controlled by flex sensors on the human operator’s fingers. Although the current functionality of the wearable is limited, it gives us a peek into the future, where capability-enhancing prosthetics will become a part of our daily lives.




3D-printing human organs for transplants may soon become a reality. BIOLIFE4D, a biotech startup, is soon going to open a lab in Chicago and begin perfecting the process of 3D-printing human hearts, that could eventually be used in transplants. Working with researchers in university labs, the technology will use the patient’s own cells, in what is called bioink, to produce a patient-specific, fully-functioning heart.

Improving the stability, bioavailability of TB FDC drug
"," The physical stability and bioavailability of a fixed-dose combination (FDC) drug containing four anti-TB medicines — rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide and ethambutol — has been vastly improved from 3-4 days (at 40 degree C and 75% relative humidity) to over 30 days by turning to crystal engineering.
The use of FDC containing two, three and four anti-TB drugs for the treatment of TB was recommended by the World Health Organisation in 1994. The four-drug FDC was included in the WHO Model List of Essential Drugs in 1999. 
The four-drug FDC suffers from stability and quality issues. The FDC tablets tend to undergo discolouration and become sticky, gummy mass thereby affecting its quality. The use of poor quality drugs can lead to treatment failures and development of drug resistance.
A team led by Dr. Ashwini Nangia from Pune’s National Chemical Laboratory addressed the problem of stability and poor bioavailability by making cocrystals (hydrogen-bonded multicomponent crystal) of isoniazid with either caffeic acid or vanillic acid. The results of the study were published in the Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences.
“Rifampicin tends to cross react with isoniazid and this leads to changes in colour and composition of the four-drug FDC drug, and erratic bioavailability and therapeutic action,” says Dr. Nangia. By using caffeine and vanillic acid to form cocrystals with isoniazid, the researchers were able to inhibit cross-reaction between isoniazid and rifampicin.
While FDC tablets used as control turned to liquid-like state within one week, the FDC containing isoniazid cocrystal remained stable for up to 30 days.
Whereas the cocrystal formed using vanilic acid showed slight colour change within one week and became dark brown at the end of four weeks, caffeic acid cocrystal showed slight change in colour after one week but remained in solid form for up to four weeks. As a result, caffeic acid cocrystal showed better stability.
“The reason why caffeic acid cocrystal performs better than vanilic acid cocrystal is due to better and strong hydrogen bonding in the crystal structure. This is absent in the vanillic acid cocrystal,” he says. 
“We have tested the stability for one month. We expect the stability to be much longer because excipients [substances included for the purpose of long-term stabilisation] and additives will be added which make the formulation stable. Secondly, the tablet will be in closed strip and so the degradation will be much slower. The cocrystal FDC is much more stable than the drug mixture and hence should be explored in further formulation development,” says Dr. Nangia.
The researchers plan to test the stability of the four-drug FDC cocrystal for longer term and in new environments. “It is expected to perform superior to the drug combinations,” he says.

Govt. to set up fifth national data centre ","The Centre will set up the country’s biggest data centre in Bhopal with a capacity to host five lakh virtual servers, Electronics and IT Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said on Monday.
The data centre, which will take about two years to come up, will be set up by the National Informatics Centre (NIC), under the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY).
This will be the fifth National Data Centre after the ones at Bhubaneswar, Delhi, Hyderabad and Pune. These National Data Centres host government websites, services and applications. 
“India’s digital ecosystem has got a momentum of its own and this process is going to be irreversible. As far as data privacy is concerned, we have always said that data must be protected, and India should become a good centre of data analysis,” the Minister said.
Replying to a query on data mining by firms in the context of the general elections in 2019, Mr. Prasad said, “Any attempt to influence India’s elections in a covert or overt manner by abuse of data will not be tolerated. People can campaign on social networking sites, but misuse and abuse of data is not acceptable.”
He added that the government planned to expand its BPO promotion scheme to one lakh seats from the “current 48,000 seats.” 
Under the initiative, which had an outlay of ₹493 crore, 91 BPOs had been set up in small towns and rural areas till now.
‘121 cr. Aadhaar issued’
On Aadhaar, the Minister said that while only 61 crore Aadhaar numbers had been generated up to 2014. The numbers had jumped to more than 121 crore as on June 16, 2018. “The difference between Narendra Modi Government’s Aadhaar and that of Manmohan Singh... the old Aadhaar was Niradhar [without basis]...there was no legislative support to that platform. Today, Aadhaar has a robust parliamentary law,” Mr. Prasad said.
Asked about the government’s action plan in case the Supreme Court’s decision was not in favour of Aadhaar, the Minister said, “The question is hypothetical... the judgment [in the case] is reserved but I believe our Aadhaar team lawyers have argued it with proof, and Aadhaar has already established its benefits for the public.”
He further added that as many as 59.15 crore Indians had linked 87.79 crore bank accounts with Aadhaar.

Docile or hostile?: 'Domestication' genes found in foxes
","A six-decade breeding experiment with foxes designed to shed light on how wolves became dogs has led to the discovery of genes that favour tame or aggressive behaviour, scientists said on August 6.
Comparing the sequenced genomes of foxes selected across 50 generations for their friendliness towards people with another group bred for hostility uncovered dozens of telltale differences, including one gene in particular, they reported in the journal Nature Ecology & Evolution.
""We were able to show that a specific gene"" — known as SorCS1 — ""does have an effect on behaviour, making foxes more tame,"" lead author Anna Kukekova, an assistant professor at the University of Illinois, told AFP. ""That's a big result — it's hard to make that connection.""
The findings are also relevant to human behaviour. Some of the genetic regions identified, for example, correspond to autism and bipolar disorders, while others are associated with William-Beuren syndrome, which causes pathologically outgoing, friendly behaviour.
The backstory to the fox study begins more than half a century ago, when the origins of animal domestication were poorly understood and hotly contested. In 1959, Russian biologist Dmitri Belyaev decided to test his theory that genes played a more important role than human interaction in the gradual metamorphosis of wolves into the man's-best-friend subspecies we call dogs.
At the same time, Nobel laureate Konrad Lorenz, a pioneer in the study of aggression in animals and humans, argued that new-born wolf puppies raised with tender loving human care would become docile and domesticated. Belyaev suspected otherwise, and choose Vulpes vulpes — a.k.a. the red or silver fox — to make his case. Russia was full of fox farms which raised and harvested the animals for their fur, offering the perfect opportunity for a large-scale experiment, he reasoned.
""Farm-bred foxes were not domesticated,"" said Kukekova, an evolutionary geneticist who began studying the animals 16 years ago. ""If you try to touch them, they show fear and aggression,"" much as in the wild.
Belyaev found a large farm willing to cooperate, and began to systematically select foxes that exhibited the least stress and fear around people, repeating the process with each new generation. ""After only 10 generations, they got a few puppies that wagged their tail just like dogs when they saw people, even when there was no food,"" Kukekova said. ""They were just happy to see humans.""
Today, all of the 500 breeding pairs in the tame group are at ease in the presence of humans, even if they are not as domesticated as dogs.




Around 1970, Belyaev's team at the Russian Institute of Cytology and Genetics added a group of foxes, selected for their aggressiveness, and a third control group with a random mix. For the new study, Kukekova and two dozen colleagues sequenced the genomes of 10 foxes from each of the three groups.
""The game changer for us was the development of next-generation sequencing technology,"" she said.
Earlier genetic sweeps yielded chunks of code with dozens or hundreds of genes, making it impossible to isolate those that mattered. This time, the researchers pinpointed 103 relevant genetic regions.
Significantly, more than 60 % of the tame animals — including those in the control group — shared the same variant of SorCS1. Among the aggressive foxes, that variant was entirely absent.
The study also revealed that different genes are responsible for very specific behaviours. ""For example, when foxes greet people by wagging their tail, it seems to be determined by different genes than those responsible for allowing a human to touch a fox's belly,"" Kukekova said.
And whether a fox wants to prolong an interaction with a human is governed by yet another bit of genetic code.

A desi keyboard for Indian languages ","A small room on a terrace in Uttarahalli, Bengaluru, is bursting with a big idea. It is the office of KaNaada Phonetics Pvt Ltd which has just launched their new product, ‘Ka-Naada’, in April this year.
Ka-Naada (ka-naada.com) is a patented keyboard layout available as both hardware (with a USB cable) and software. It groups letters according to phonetics, creating a more intuitive interface for languages based on the Brahmi (the common ancestor of Indian scripts) script. The keyboard is available in multiple languages: Kannada, Gujarati, Gurumukhi, Malayalam, Tulu, Oriya and more. A user can switch languages, using the keyboard of one script to type in another. The current keyboard requires QWERTY for certain commands, such as the control and function keys. The future version of Ka-Naada will have these commands as well.
A long time coming
The idea was born in 2009 when Guru Prasad — a simulator based in Orlando, Florida — saw children struggling to learn their mother tongues. With a Ph.D in industrial engineering (simulation systems) he is an expert in simulation, network architecture, distributed systems and systems modeling. The QWERTY keyboard, he determined, was unfit for Indian languages. Navigating a keyboard meant for English disrupted ‘native thinking’. He worked predominantly with linguist Professor BVK Sastry at theYoga-Samskrutham University in Florida, and a few others, to find a solution. The Ka-Naada keyboard layout was finalised by 2011, the first prototype was done by 2012 and the first full keyboard, by 2015. It was an uncomfortable square shape, and had to be redesigned to be rectangular.
KaNaada has received funding from associations such as Kannada Praadhikaara and ITBT (Department of Information Technology, Biotechnology and Science and Technology of Government of Karnataka) and design assistance from the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME), Centre of Excellence, IISc. They received their patent in 2017.
“The response, particularly, has been very overwhelming,” Prasad says. “It is highly intuitive for users, right from the get go. Children, particularly, are thrilled to use it. I have heard comments like, Maine aankhe band karke, type kiya (I was able to type with my eyes closed), from them. For adults, there were some training issues because they are so accustomed to QWERTY. We are trying to work to come closer to that keyboard ergonomically.” While maintaining their current layout, the company is experimenting with the size and qualities of the keys and keyboard for the most user-friendly combinations.
For Prasad, the most fascinating part of his journey has been reviving the script of his mother-tongue — Tulu. “The language came alive. All of a sudden, we have a user interface for Tulu. It is the same with Kashmiri (in the Sharada script) and for all the other languages that might go out of use. This might be a boon, that we can keep them alive through our children.”
Increase accessibility
The entrepreneur lights up when asked about the potential of his product. It could open up job opportunities for those in the rural areas who do not know English. It could be a key learning device, and he plans on introducing a toy keyboard for children to use, as they learn their mother tongue. It could be used in government offices, for desktop publishing, or by visually-impaired users. It will soon be available in foreign languages, including Malay, Sinhalese, and Nepalese, which are all Brahmi-based.
As his dreams grow, so does his work. Currently, the entrepreneur is juggling production, research and development, and marketing. He receives his supplies from vendors across the country and is co-sharing a production facility in Bengaluru. However, a large machine has been ordered in anticipation of a full-scale production unit. He has now tied up with NGOs and is working with overseas students who come as part of a Youth Ambassador programme to distribute the keyboard in various rural schools in India.

How insects evolve immune-memory against bacterial infections
"," Much like humans, insects too develop an immune-memory in response to infection, a team at the National Centre for Biological Sciences (NCBS), Bengaluru has found. In humans, for instance, natural infection or vaccination can lead to the formation of important immunological memory in the human immune system. In other words, once infected, the immune system becomes ready to deal with that particular antigen because of immune-memory. For long, it has been a point of debate whether insects have such a memory that can protect them against future infections. The present study shows that such a memory can evolve over generations in red flour beetles (Tribolium castaneum) infected with Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt). The results of the study were recently published in Proceedings of the Royal Society B.
The study was conducted in Deepa Agashe’s lab at NCBS and the experiment was designed by Imroze Khan, first author of the paper, and Dr. Agashe, the principal investigator. The team infected nearly 5,000 to 6,000 beetles in every generation. “Every insect had to be pierced at the right point and injected with a standard number of bacterial cells. It took a year to standardise this process,” says Dr. Khan, who is now a faculty at Ashoka University, Delhi. With a generation being approximately 45 days long, the study of 10 generations stretched over two years. “Every day Arun Prakash [one of the authors] and I had to infect 1,000 insects,” he adds when asked what was the most challenging part of the study. The beetle populations were exposed to a single large dose of live Bt antigens or exposed to dead bacteria followed by live infection. 
Evolved immunity
After observing ten generations, the team found that the new generation of insects had evolved better defence against Bt antigen. The emerging populations showed either improved innate resistance or immune-memory, as opposed to control populations which were injected with a buffer solution and did not evolve any special ability to deal with the pathogen.
“This is the first real-time observation of the evolution of immune-memory in an insect; we showed that this can happen very quickly, and quite often,” says Dr Agashe, in an email to The Hindu. “If our results hold true for other insects (which remains to be tested), this suggests that immune-memory can be a very broad system of defence against pathogens,” she adds. Since insects do not have the kind of immune cells that humans have, for a long time, scientists did not think it was even possible for insects to develop an immune-memory.
 In the past few years, multiple studies showed that insects do show some form of immune-memory, but how such memory evolves remained a puzzle. “We now have some clues about how fast and how reliably memory could evolve, what might be the mechanisms involved and when might immune-memory versus resistance be favoured by natural selection,” says Dr Agashe.
Together, Dr. Khan and Dr. Agashe’s labs are now trying to figure out the molecules responsible for immune-memory and resistance.

Trees offer multiple benefits — don’t kill them, breed them
"," Officials in Delhi wish to fell about 17,000 fully grown trees in some parts of the city to make space for building housing colonies. And to “pacify” people who object to this tree destruction, they say that for every tree that will be felled, they will plant 10 saplings. Interesting — the minister knows it; the National Building Construction Corporation (NBCC) knows it and we all known it — that this is a stupid answer. “What you lose today, I will make up” (20 years from now? and if the saplings survive?) And this is not just in Delhi. Government and city planners in several other states do the same. This attitude shows not just ignorance but arrogance, disregard for trees and their value. It is time planners wake up and understand the value — economic, ecological, health-related and sociological — that trees offer.
Value of a tree
Way back in 1979, Dr. T.M. Das of Calcutta University estimated that the monetary value of a tree, during a life span of 50 years, amounted to about $2,00,000 (at 1979 rates). This was based on the amount of oxygen it produces, the fruit or the biomass and the timber it offers when felled and so on. For every 1 gram that a tree accumulates as it grows, it generates about 2.66 grams of oxygen. Dr Nancy Beckham of Australia, in her paper, “Trees: finding their true value”, points out that “trees and plants silently carry out their daily routine years after years, stabilizing the soil, recycling nutrients, cooling the air, modifying wind turbulence, intercepting the rain, absorbing toxins, reducing fuel costs, neutralizing sewage, increasing property values, promoting tourism, encouraging recreation, reducing stress and improving personal health as well as providing food, medicine and accommodation for other living things”. (Link: <https://www.uow.edu.au/~sharonb/
STS300/valuing/price/
pricingarticles.html>).
The Department of Environmental Conservation of New York State, USA offers numbers in this connection (see <http://www.dec.ny.gov/lands/40243.html>), along with references to scientific papers which estimate these numbers. It points out that (1) healthy trees mean healthy people: 100 trees remove 53 tons of CO2 and 430 pounds of other air pollutants per year; (2) healthy trees mean healthy communities: tree-filled neighbourhoods lower the levels of domestic violence and are safer and move sociable; (3) healthy trees mean healthy environment — 100 mature trees catch about 1,40,000 gallons of rain water per year; (4) healthy trees mean home-owner savings — strategically placed trees save up to 56% of air conditioning costs; evergreens that block winter winds can save 3% on heating; (5) healthy trees means better business — in tree-lined commercial districts, shoppers report more frequent shopping and spend 12% more for goods, and (6) healthy trees means higher property values.
The minister and the NBCC officials are smart people and they surely know all these facts. Yet for them, a mature tree is “dead urban space” and clearing 17,000 trees means real estate for building houses, colonies and shopping malls in a city that is gasping for clean air. (Delhi Greens, an NGO, estimated in 2013 that a healthy tree is worth Rs. 24 lakh a year, just with respect to its oxygen producing capacity). And for them a sapling occupies (today) about a hundredth (or even less) space. But where will they plant the saplings — where the trees were? How will they survive if construction starts already? Clearly the officials’ attitude is: ‘well, we will be gone (transferred/ retired) and do not need to answer’. What Gurgaon was then, and is now, makes the point.
Admire trees, don’t axe them
In stark contrast to their cruel attitude towards trees stand the examples of Sunderlal Bahuguna’s “chipko” movement, Saalumarada Thimmakka of Karnataka who has planted 398 banyan trees — each representing her own child, and Majid Khan and the team of biologists and horticulturists who are offering “intensive care” (injecting insecticide mix in to the phloem of each branch) to a 700 years old “pillalamarri” banyan tree near Mahabubnagar, Telangana, spanning a 4–acre canopy , which is being eaten up by termites, and bringing it back to life. (See: https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/a-tree-in-intensive-care/article24241462.ece). Should it have been cut and the 4 acre space used as real estate? 
Obviously trees offer emotional, even spiritual solace. Indian history is replete with examples — Lord Buddha, Emperor Ashoka, and the Tamil King Pari Vallal who left his chariot near a plant to help it spread its branches.
Should not Delhi then think of building houses and colonies elsewhere in the suburbs, saving these 17,000 trees? Or if at all it has to do it in Delhi, think new thoughts, but without cutting the trees (or at best sacrificing the smallest possible number)? This impossible-sounding scheme offers challenges to architects. Indeed, high rise apartments have been built elsewhere, saving trees and even including them as part of the building. Some examples are seen in Italy, Turkey and Brazil. 
India has been blessed with creative architects, both Indian and foreign, who have built houses and campuses, totally in harmony with the surroundings. The Indian Institute of Architects has about 20,000 members, we have about 80 institutions that teach architecture. Why not throw a challenge to them to come up with the best plan, offer a handsome award to the most suited and creative one, and use it to build the colony?

What the well-gadgeted man is wearing
"," Fans of P. G. Wodehouse will remember how the hero Bertie Wooster was persuaded by his aunt Dahlia to write a piece on ‘what the well dressed man is wearing’ for her weekly magazine “Milady’s Boudoir”. That was in the 1920s and the days of gentlemen of leisure. A century later, these are the days of gentlemen (and ladies) on the go. And the biweekly magazine “Science News” has published an article called: “Fashion forward: Advanced textiles may add serious gadgetry to clothes”, authored by Maria Temming and Mariah Quantanilla, in its May 25, 2018 issue.
The two authors, Maria and Mariah, write about how future ‘smart’ clothes could pack ‘serious’ gadgetry, and give a few examples presented by several developers and innovators at some recent technological meetings in the US. Here are some excerpts from this article.
Clothes that change colour
 About sixty or seventy years ago, one could buy a shirt made of a cloth teasingly called ‘Bleeding Madras’. It would change colour upon each wash (and fade!). The one discussed here changes colour not upon washing, but reversibly upon exposure to light (such as sunlight or on stage), when the wearer taps his/her smartphone screen. How does this happen? The fabric is made of thin yarn containing some thinner strands of copper wire sheathed in polyester (or nylon). This polyester fibre is coated with pigments just as normal clothes are. A garment is made of this pigmented cloth, and the garment also carries a tiny battery. The wearer sends a wi-fi signal from his/her smartphone, which activates the battery to heat the copper wire in the yarn. With that signal, the colour changes and the wearer now shows off the new colour (or stripe or pattern – whatever has been built in) on his/her garment! Developed by Dr. Joshua Kaufman and Dr. Ayman Abouraddy of the University of Central Florida at Orlando, FL, USA, this fabric and the clothes, bags or upholstery will hit the market soon.
 Traditional women in Gujarat and Rajasthan wear long skirts called lehangas or ghararas using fabrics which are studded with small discs made of glass mirror pieces. They shine when light falls on them. Well, now we have hi-tech versions that will be available soon; except, they will not have the traditional ‘inorganic’ mirror pieces but light emitting diodes or LEDs. And these LEDs too will be ‘organic’ in nature, or what the authors have called as OLEDs. These OLEDs are created on cloth- polyester- and are thus far more flexible than the conventional ‘inorganic’ LEDs. Developed by Dr. S. Kwon and associates at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology in Daejon, South Korea, these OLEDs, when activated using electric signals generated using smartphone signals, can light up the fabric. They can thus be organised in the fabric to display patterns and messages, or just light up the street to help pedestrians at night. 
After a brisk run, you feel hot — the active motion generating thermal energy. Likewise, as you stand for a while in bright sunlight, you feel warm. Rather than lose energy through heat this way, can we convert heat or body motion into electricity? This was the question that Dr. Jun Chen and Dr. Zhong Lin Wang of Stanford and Georgia Tech Universities attempted to work on. To this end, they threaded a fabric with photovoltaic wires which, when sunlight falls on them, generate tiny amounts of electricity just the way traditional solar cells do. And this energy can be stored safely in a small battery attached to the garment. Dr. Chen is reported to have said that a 4 cm x 5 cm piece of such a solar cell fabric stitched on to your T-shirt as you run in the sun can charge up your cellphone. Imagine wearing a whole shirt or a jacket made of such a fabric. 
Dr. Chen has also devised a fabric made of a special type of polymer (called PTFE) which captures energy coming out of motion (movement of the body) and converts it into electrical energy. Maria and Mariah write: “this energy-harvesting material could also be built into tents that, when bathed in sun or rustled by wind, could charge campers’ devices”. The article by these two ladies, titled: “Future smart clothes could pack serious gadgetry”, is available free on the net, and is recommended. It covers a few more such studies which focus on capturing energy from the environment through the use of devices of this kind, and converting it into storable and usable electric energy. 
Light cell phone
Some people have done away with carrying bulky cell phones; instead, they go for wrist-wearable ones and earplugs. Many others no longer carry a laptop; smart phones do the job for them. (The Nobelist Prof. Martin Chalfie gave three different lectures recently in Hyderabad, with all lecture materials- slides and movies- saved in his smartphone, no laptop). Wearing gadgets (even computers) will become increasingly popular and convenient. Since these can now be charged using stuff in your clothes, look out for what Generation Z is wearing next year.

P is for Pie: Android’s latest version is in
","Google on Monday launched the latest version of it’s Android operating system — Android Pie, that promises to make smartphones ‘smarter’.
An over-the-air update to Android 9 will begin rolling out to Google’s Pixel phones. The devices that participated in the Beta programme will receive the update soon, Sameer Samat, vice-president of Product Management, Android & Google Play said in a blog.
“ We are also working with a number of other partners to launch or upgrade devices to Android 9 this year,” he added.
“We’ve built Android 9 to learn from you — and work better for you — the more you use it. From predicting your next task so you can jump right into the action you want to take, to prioritising battery power for the apps you use most, to helping you disconnect from your phone at the end of the day, Android 9 adapts to your life and the ways you like to use your phone,” Google said.
Smart settings
The Android 9 comes with features like adaptive battery, which learns the apps users’ use most and prioritises battery use for them, and adaptive brightness, which learns how users like to set the brightness in different settings.
“Making your phone smarter and more adaptive is important, but we also want Android to be easier to use and more approachable. In Android 9, we’ve introduced a new system navigation featuring a single home button.” Mr. Samat said.
This is especially helpful as phones grow taller and it is more difficult to get things done on the phone with one hand, Google added.

‘Primitives enjoyed scent of early flowers’
","The flower-based compounds behind the perfumes and colognes you enjoy have been eliciting olfactory excitement since dinosaurs walked the Earth, a study has found.
Researchers at Oregon State University in the U.S. found evidence that floral scents originated in primitive flowers as far back as 100 million years ago as pollinator attractants. They still play the role even though today’s flowers also have colourful petals for luring pollinators, according to the study published in the journal Historical Biology.
“I bet some of the dinosaurs could have detected the scents of these early flowers,” said George Poinar, an entomologist at Oregon State University. “In fact, floral essences from these early flowers could even have attracted these giant reptiles,” said Mr. Poinar.
The researchers examined amber flowers from Myanmar, including the now extinct glandular laurel flower (Cascolaurus burmensis) and veined star flower (Tropidogyne pentaptera).
Without colourful petals, flowers from early period had to rely solely on scents to attract pollinators. “You can’t detect scents or analyse the chemical components of fossil flowers, but you can find the tissues responsible for the scents,” said Mr. Poinar.
The study also found that secretory tissues of these Cretaceous flowers are similar in structure to those of their modern descendants. That suggests modern and ancient flowers of the same lineages produced similar essences.
Some of flowers studied were even in the process of emitting compounds at the time they were engulfed by the tree resin that later became amber.

60% of Indian computers vulnerable
","India must go the Japanese way if it wishes to prevent cyber attacks on the country’s massive IT infrastructure, says Avast Antivirus chief technical officer and executive vice-president Ondrej Vlcek.
“Japan brought in a stringent regulatory mechanism last year to put its IT infrastructure under a protective shield. India can also follow that example considering the growing internet penetration in the country,” Mr. Vleck told The Hindu on the sidelines of RISE 2018, Asia’s largest technology conference which got underway here on Tuesday.
He said that over 60% of the personal computers in India were vulnerable to cyber crimes. As many as 18% of routers, 17% phones, 14% printers, 25% network associated storages, 4% security cameras and 2% media boxes too were vulnerable to threats in India. In comparison, only 9% of personal computers, 3% phones, 25% of routers, 16% of printers and 23% of security cameras in Japan were under threat.
The situation was not rosy in Hong Kong either, where about 45% of personal computers were vulnerable to cyber attacks. The percentage for China, the U.S. and Singapore were 39%, 38% and 33% respectively, he said.
“Already most countries are taking precautionary steps specially when it comes to hardware devices. But government-enabled regulations can prevent cyber crimes with the growth of Internet of Things (IoT),” he said. 
“Your smart home is only as secure as its weakest link. Personal data leakage and ransomware attacks lead to IoT botnets and physical security threats,” he said.
Incidentally, Artificial Intelligence (AI) will play a key role in IoT safety. In future, AI will identify malicious and legitimate behaviour, Mr. Vleck said.

A new state of matter created ","An international team of physicists have successfully created a “giant atom” and filled it with ordinary atoms, creating a new state of matter termed “Rydberg polarons”. These atoms are held together by a weak bond and is created at very cold temperatures.
“For us, this new, weakly bound state of matter is an exciting new possibility of investigating the physics of ultracold atoms,” says Joachim Burgdörfer, theoretical physicist from TU Wein and one of the authors of the paper published in Physical Review Letters.
Dr.Ganesh Ramachandran from the Condensed Matter Group at Institute of Mathematical Sciences, Chennai explains the new Rydberg polarons
How was the new polaron created?
This is an intricate experiment that builds upon several advances that were achieved over the past two decades.
It uses ideas from two different fields: Bose Einstein Condensation and Rydberg atoms.
A BEC (Bose Einstein Condensate) is a liquid-like state of matter that occurs at very low temperatures. A BEC can be perturbed to create excitations which are akin to ripples on a lake. Here, the authors have used a BEC of strontium atoms.
Electrons in an atom move in orbits around the nucleus. A ‘Rydberg atom’ is an atom in which an electron has been kicked out to a very large orbit. These have interesting properties and have been studied for a long time.
In this work, the authors used laser light on a BEC of strontium atoms so that it impinges on one strontium atom at a time. This excites an electron into a large orbit, forming a Rydberg atom. This orbit is large enough to encircle many other strontium atoms inside it.
As the electron moves around many strontium atoms, it generates ripples of the BEC. The Rydberg atom becomes inextricably mixed with these ripples and forms a new super-atom called a ‘Rydberg polaron’.
What will be the use of these Rydberg polarons?
A particularly interesting implication is for cosmology. Our universe is believed to be filled with a mysterious ‘dark matter’ which exerts a gravitational force on other matter.
Some theories of dark matter postulate that it is a cosmic Bose Einstein Condensate, perhaps composed of an as-yet-unknown type of particle. If we are indeed living in an invisible all pervading Bose Einstein Condensate, this experiment can suggest ways to detect it.

ISRO’s first ‘pad abort’ test, critical for future human space mission, successful
","The first 'pad abort' test critical for a future human space mission was conducted successfully on Thursday morning, the Indian Space Research Organisation has announced. The test was conducted at the Satish Dhawan Space Centre, Sriharikota.
“The Pad Abort Test demonstrated the safe recovery of the crew module in case of any exigency at the launch pad,” the space agency said.
Describing it as a major technology demonstrator the space agency said the PAT (pad abort test) is the first in a series of tests to qualify a crew escape system technology of a manned mission in the future.
The Crew Escape System is an emergency escape measure to quickly pull the crew module — the astronaut cabin — along with astronauts out to a safe distance from the launch vehicle in the event of a launch abort.
ISRO Chairman K.Sivan said the teams also tried out at least five new secondary technologies related to satellite communication, navigation and telemetry during the test. A few more trials related to the safety of astronauts would be taken up later.
The countdown began at 2 a.m., five hours ahead of the test. At 7 a.m., the Crew Escape System with a simulated 12.6-tonne crew module lifted off from its pad.
It was propelled on its own seven specially made complex in-built rockets. In the next four-odd minutes, it reached a height of 2.7 km and curved down into the Bay of Bengal on parachutes. It landed in sea at a distance of 2.9 km from the launch centre.
Three recovery boats were sent out to retrieve the module.
The rockets are solid-fuel powered and specially designed for quickly ejecting the crew module and astronauts to a safe distance without exceeding the safe G-levels, an ISRO statement said.
Nearly 300 sensors recorded various functional aspects of the mission during the test flight.

Dasubhashitam : Resurgence of literature
"," A bulk of social media debates, virtual discussions contribute to extending the longevity of vernacular literature in the Telugu states. Yet their efforts in encouraging readers to turn to classics and look back at our literary richness have been more restrictive than effective. 
The advent of technology has opened up opportunities to connect and find innovative solutions. That’s precisely what the Hyderabad-based father-son duo Tulasidas Konduru and Kiran Kumar have done, they’ve come up with an Audible-like app for Telugu audiobooks called Dasubhashitam. The two call it a first of a kind platform to tell stories, revive art forms, encourage budding and established writers, narrators in Telugu, connect them to a wide user base.
A year ago when Tulasidas, a retired government employee, had suggested that his software engineer son Kiran read PVRK Prasad’s memoir Asalem Jarigindante, the latter responded, “I hardly have any time. You’re anyways free. Why don’t you read it out to me?” The casual conversation between the two literary enthusiasts became a starting point to develop the app. They saw this as a right opportunity to re-introduce Telugu literature to a new generation. “We can’t eat for someone else, we can’t watch a movie for others, but reading for others seems quite possible,” says Tulsidas.




Kiran’s stint with Google, HCL helped him work extensively on the interface, he also collaborated with a Chennai-based team to develop Dasubhashitam. Though the app targeted youngsters, their initial reader base was aged around 35-40 years. “The icons, font size, interface are quite easy to handle. We inhabited the sensibilities from apps like Audible and Apple podcasts,” says Kiran. The app has separate sections for fiction, poetry, non-fiction,e-books and interviews. Apart from Tulsidas, narrators of the novels and short stories include Mulugu Sarada, Goli Anjaneyulu, Chegondi Veera Venkata Satyanarayana (lyricist Anantha Sriram’s father). “Vocal clarity has been my strength since childhood, this worked in storytelling. I keenly observe the way people speak and their modulation. I dramatise the works without overdoing it. I involve myself in the content,” says Tulasidas. 
Platform for arts




Also envisaged as a platform to nurture newer and ancient art forms, the duo hopes the medium helps revive radio plays and have contemporary stories narrated through the format. Dasubhashitam, available on Android and iOS devices is bound to be a boon for a wide audience that can speak but cannot read Telugu. “We did made mistakes initially, on the quality side, but our intentions are honest and we have improved over time,” they share, adding “There are not many Telugu writers these days and it’s necessary to create a market. Many lose out on distribution too. We want to create an eco-system where people think about audiobooks.”
The responses over six months have been promising. Ganapathi, Amaravathi Kathalu, Kumara Sambhavam are popular picks on the app that comprises mostly classics, epics and spiritual audiobooks as of now. PVRK Prasad had even requested the duo to come up with audiobook versions of his other works. Tulasidas says, “PV Narasimha Rao’s daughter Vani too has requested us to come up with audio books of her father’s stories. We intend to stay free from books that endorse political ideologies.”
For the future
Copyrights pertaining to the books is an area of concern, but they say the app is not pirating anything. “We are giving publicity for Telugu literature. For instance, we don't know who holds the rights for Barrister Parvateesam. We’ll put the audiobook for sale on the app and give them their share of the claim, if anyone comes forward,” Tulasidas signs off.

Star watchers count black holes in globular clusters
"," The universe is strange and fascinating because it holds many a glittering clue to its secrets — bright and dark. To follow the clues and unravel these secrets is the astrophysicist’s privilege. In a recent paper published in The Astrophysical Journal, Sourav Chatterjee of Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR), Mumbai, and a team of international collaborators, trace such clues to estimate the number of black holes in globular clusters.
Globular clusters
Globular clusters are massive bunches of stars that are typically about 9-12 billion years old. While the Milky Way has about 150 globular clusters, their number could go up to a few thousands in other galaxies. They are densely packed with stars. Within the distance equal to that between the Sun and its nearest star neighbour, a globular cluster would have about a million stars. “Due to the high stellar densities, the stars interact with other stars frequently. These dynamical interactions are key to understanding how black holes form binaries that may be detected via gravitational waves, X-ray or radio emission,” says Sourav Chatterjee in an email to The Hindu.
Recently, astronomers have detected black hole candidates in four globular clusters in the Milky Way. “They are either discovered via X-ray or radio emissions or by monitoring the radial velocity of a companion star,” Dr Chatterjee explains. Among these, the team studied three globular clusters within the Milky Way: 47 Tuc, M 10, M22. These three globular clusters have candidates identified to be black holes through radio and X-ray observations. “The observations were done using archival data from the ACS survey done using the Hubble space telescope. All theoretical models and data reduction software were built by us,” he adds.
This has sparked interest in understanding how these black holes evolve and estimating how many black holes are there within a globular cluster. The team shows that the clue to knowing the number of black holes in the cluster lies in the mass segregation observed between the giant stars and the less massive main sequence stars. They find that the measure of mass segregation is related inversely to the number of black holes in the cluster. According to Dr. Chatterjee, this can be an effective probe to indirectly estimate the number of black holes in a globular cluster aided by calibrations from numerical models.
Milky Way
The team has estimated that 47 Tuc, M10, and M22 globular clusters within the Milky Way contain 150, 50 and 200 black holes, respectively.
Not all black holes that form in a cluster are retained. Some of them are ejected at birth and some are forced out later. Once this has stabilised, the galaxy or cluster acquires a stable retention fraction.
“Newlin [N. Weatherford, a collaborator from North Western University, USA] and I will use the same method to constrain the number of retained black holes in all globular clusters for which the necessary data is available,” Says Dr Chatterjee.
“These constraints will help us understand the retention fraction of black holes in globular clusters. This has wide implications. For example, the rate of black hole mergers observable by LIGO is dependent strongly on this [constraint],” he adds.

NASA to launch probe into sun’s scorching atmosphere
","NASA is preparing to send a probe closer to the sun, enduring wicked heat while zooming through the solar corona to study this outermost part of the stellar atmosphere that gives rise to the solar wind.
The Parker Solar Probe, a robotic spacecraft the size of a small car, is slated to launch from Cape Canaveral in Florida, with August 6 targeted as the launch date for the planned seven-year mission. It is set to fly into the sun’s corona within 3.8 million miles from the solar surface, seven times closer than any other spacecraft.
“To send a probe where you haven’t been before is ambitious. To send it into such brutal conditions is highly ambitious,” Nicola Fox, a project scientist from the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, told a news conference on Friday.
The previous closest pass to the sun was by a probe called Helios 2, which in 1976 came within 43 million km.
The distance of the earth from the sun is approximately 149.6 million km.
Importance of study
The corona gives rise to the solar wind, a continuous flow of charged particles that permeates the solar system. Unpredictable solar winds cause disturbances in our planet’s magnetic field and can play havoc with communications technology on the earth. NASA hopes the findings will enable scientists to forecast changes in the earth’s space environment.
“It’s of fundamental importance for us to be able to predict this space weather, much like we predict weather here on the earth,” said Alex Young, a solar scientist at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland. 
“In the most extreme cases of these space weather events, it can actually affect our power grids on the earth.” The project, with a $1.5 billion price tag, is the first major mission under NASA’s Living With a Star programme.
The probe is set to use seven Venus flybys over nearly seven years to steadily reduce its orbit around the sun, using instruments designed to image the solar wind and study electric and magnetic fields, coronal plasma and energetic particles. NASA aims to collect data about the inner workings of the highly magnetized corona.
The probe, named after American solar astrophysicist Eugene Newman Parker, will have to survive difficult heat and radiation conditions. 
It has been outfitted with a heat shield designed to keep its instruments at a tolerable 29 degrees Celsius even as the spacecraft faces temperatures reaching nearly 21,370 degrees Celsius at its closest pass.

IIT-Madras powers up a desi chip
","These are the kind of chips that India always wanted, but could not make. Now, computer scientists and a student team from the IIT- Madras have developed the first of a family of six industry-standard microprocessors.
The initial batch of 300 chips, named RISECREEK and produced under Project Shakti, have been fabricated free at Intel’s facility at Oregon, U.S., to run the Linux operating system.
The IIT team says its microprocessors can be adapted by others, as the design is open source. They optimise power use and compete with international units such as the Cortex A5 from Advanced RISC Machines (ARM).
On the test bench, the IIT design fared better than the A5, measured in terms of the DMIPS per megahertz rating, scoring 1.68 against the competition’s 1.57. At a frequency of 350 MHz, RISECREEK can meet the demands of defence and strategic equipment such as NAVIC (Indian Regional Navigation Satellite) and Internet of Things (IoT) electronics, its developers say. “Our process helps us develop the processor three times sooner than industry standards,” says Kamakoti Veezhinathan, Professor of Computer Science at the IIT- Madras, who led the project.
What makes RISECREEK different is the open source nature of the designs. “This is made in India, but even if it were made in the U.S., it would be contemporary,” says G.S. Madhusudan, project adviser from the IIT- Madras.
The team, led by Dr. Neel Gala, an alumnus of the IIT- Madras, is thrilled, not just because it developed a viable industry grade chip, but also because the process can be tapped for future efforts in semiconductors. “The Shakti plan started in 2014 as an IIT-M initiative. Last year, the Union Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology funded a part of the project,” says Dr. Kamakoti.
The plan includes a family of six types of microprocessors. The first to be ready is the C class, RISECREEK. The E class of microprocessors that can be used in smart cards, IoT devices, fan/motor controls, etc, is almost ready and the I class, which can be used for mobile phones, desktops and mobile phones is soon to follow. The design for the S class which can be used for enterprise class servers is underway, and the H class, which will be used for building High Performance computers with a massive parallel processing capacity.
The H Class is part of the next phase of development, which the team calls the Para-SHAKTI (parallel SHAKTI) project. Para-SHAKTI will make microprocessors for indigenous high-performance computers with over 32 SHAKTI cores.
“The Shakti project is not aimed at only building processors. It also aims to build high speed interconnects for servers and supercomputers based on variants of the RapidiIO and GenZ standards. These are key to build large clusters of processors to get Petaflop and Exaflop level supercomputers,” says Mr. Madhusudan.
With a team of about eight students and three computer scientists, the team used BlueSpec System Verilog language to capture the processor functionality. Everything from that to making the final chip layout was done within the campus. The chip layout was sent to Oregon, to be fabricated by Intel. Once that was done, mounting the chip on a 10-layer verification board and bringing up the chip was done again at IIT Madras. The board bring- up and booting Linux was done in four days. “There are 70 million instructions from the point we switch on the system till the prompt comes. The chip executed these instructions without any bug at the first shot. This gives a lot of confidence to move ahead,” says Dr. Kamakoti.
Intel has fabricated the chip free of cost, and the team incurred a development cost of about ₹1.2 Crore. Regarding vulnerabilities due to outsourcing the fabrication of the chip, he says, “Since the entire design has been developed in-house, it is extremely difficult for a foundry to add backdoors or security vulnerabilities. But yes, an external fab can always induce vulnerabilities. A probable solution for this is to move towards a controlled fab.”

River dolphins could be hunting prey using many methods
"," Asia's river dolphins may be nearly blind, but compensate by using many methods to catch prey. Though chiefly known as echolocators, researchers now suggest that these dolphins could also be listening for surface-swimming fish and sensing electrical signals emitted by bottom-dwelling prey on the river-bed.
Eyes are of no use for river dolphins (genus Platanista) in the naturally murky waters of the Indus and Ganga. Instead, they have evolved to use echolocation to navigate and catch fish: the small clicks they produce underwater echo back at them, helping them identify a prey or obstacle on their path. Despite increasing pressures on their habitat – from ships' underwater noise (which could affect dolphin echolocation) to dams that alter the river's flow – dolphins still survive in many heavily human-used river stretches.
Wondering if these aquatic mammals have other methods to catch prey and thereby survive, a team of researchers from institutes including Bengaluru's Asoka Trust for Ecology and Evolution (ATREE) first dug through 105 studies and historical references for information about dolphin anatomy and physiology as well as that of their prey (shrimp and fish). They also complemented this with the prey they found in dead dolphins' stomachs and acoustic information on the echolocation clicks Gangetic river dolphins use in varying depths of a 100-km stretch of the Ganga in Bihar.
The results show that dolphins choose their prey based on size; bottom-dwelling fish dominate their diets. Dolphins grasp their prey and potentially suck them into their mouths using their unusually large tongues. The study, published in Mammal Review, is the first to calculate the distance that these dolphins can detect a fish from: their echolocation enables them to 'see' a fish the size of your finger from 20 metres away.
There is also a clear difference in the ways dolphins catch fish at various river depths: at the surface they listen for fish movement; prefer echolocation at the middle depths (dolphins produced the most number of clicks here); and sensitive snout-whiskers, especially in calves and juveniles, could help sense weak electrical signals emitted by bottom-dwelling fish and shrimp. This could make Platanista dolphins one of the few mammal groups in the world that use this method, says ATREE's Nachiket Kelkar, lead author of the study.
Scientists did think that this 'electroreception' could be a possibility in other dolphin species too when an experimental aquarium study in 2013 found that Guiana dolphins (that dwell in the coastal waters off South America) can detect fish prey using electric perception through nerve fibres in their snout-whiskers.
“The use of these different feeding strategies together could perhaps also explain why we see Platanista dolphins even in some highly disturbed habitats,” adds Kelkar.
According to the authors, the research findings would be highly relevant for future studies on river dolphin ecology, feeding behaviour and assessments of their responses to human-induced threats.

Far Cry 5 preview: Guns, gangs and gore
"," We buy into countless stories built around heroes and villains, but in games especially, we see the same thing over and over, served differently. Rarely do we face a disturbing reality that is uncomfortably within reach of regular people, led astray to perform unspeakable acts. Far Cry 5, plays on this reality. 


A new game, a new world
A family of religious zealots, led by Joseph ‘The Father’ Seed, has established a community of god-fearing cultists in Hope County, Montana. There are four siblings (including Joseph), the so-called Heralds, overseeing the Project at Eden’s Gate, which distorts the Bible to suit the group’s perverse wants and needs. Each sibling has a speciality role within the organisation: Jacob, the eldest, is ex-army, with an army of his own; the younger brother John is the lawyer and money man; and Faith, the kid half-sister captures hearts and minds with her charisma.
Not everyone is willing to sing ‘Kumbaya’ with a barrel of a gun stuck to their heads, in Seed’s worship-or-be-killed regime. A resistance has formed, as small pockets of the Hope County community are fighting back. Spurred into action by a handful of their very own charismatic leaders, you play a young deputy sheriff who has his commander murdered, leading you on a path of revenge. This makes things personal against Joseph Seed and his ilk.




Enforcing a divide-and-rule policy, the Seeds have carved Hope County into four main territories, with Jacob in the Whitetail Mountains of the North, Faith luring followers to the Henbane River in the East, and John nestled in the Holland Valley out West. So you have to take them down one by one to weaken The Father’s hold.
Paws for hire
We got our hands on the same build that was shown at the Paris Preview Event, and the signature Far Cry brand of first-person open-world shooter gameplay remains intact. This time around though, the mission structure of Far Cry 5 is much more organic, and story-focused. Instead of climbing untold radio towers to reveal sections of the map, routes and waypoints are unlocked after talking to non-player characters, or upon spying notes on tables or tucked between files. Side-quests shouldn’t mean being side-tracked.




All your activities are tracked by a nifty Resistance Meter, which balances your influence among the rebels with the level of attention being raised to the cult leaders. Any time you rescue civilians, destroy cult property, complete a mission, or liberate cult outposts, this counts in your favour, and frustrates the hell out of Joseph Seed. Good performance also has the benefit of rewarding experience points used to develop skills such as swimming, fishing and foraging, alongside fun stuff like additional equipment slots and becoming more powerful.
It is terrific fun, and challenging, to take on Seed’s army all by yourself, but you can sort of phone a friend with the upgraded ‘for hire’ system to include Friends for Hire and Fangs for Hire, in addition to the Guns for Hire perk that you may already know. Friends bring specialist tactics to the battle, while Fangs, which include a faithful dog, a grizzly bear, and a wildcat, can be called upon to use their animal agility and instinct to unsettle the opposition. Players may also invite a real-world friend to complete objectives in co-op mode, or just wreak havoc in the beautiful world.




Why should you care?
The game is an open-world first-person shooter set in rural America, where you, a bunch of friends and fangs for hire get to practise your First Amendment rights, usually with a plethora of guns and vehicles. 
Above all, you get to lead a resistance against a mad cult. It does help that the game looks drop-dead gorgeous and there are no loot boxes.

Indian telescope spots distant radio galaxy
","Astronomers have used an Indian telescope to discover the most distant radio galaxy ever known, located at a distance of 12 billion light-years.
 The galaxy, from a time when the universe was only 7% of its current age was found using the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) in Pune.
 GMRT is an array of thirty fully steerable parabolic radio telescopes of 45-metre diameter. It is operated by the National Centre for Radio Astrophysics.
 The distance to this galaxy was determined using the Gemini North telescope in Hawaii and the Large Binocular Telescope in Arizona.
 The galaxy is perceived as it looked when the universe was only a billion years old, according to the study appearing in the journal Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society.
 This also means that the light from this galaxy is almost 12 billion years old.
 “It is very surprising how these galaxies have built up their mass in such a short period of time,” said Aayush Saxena from Leiden Observatory in the Netherlands.
 “Bright radio galaxies harbour supermassive black holes. It is amazing to find such objects as early in the history of the universe; the time for these supermassive black holes to form and grow must have been very short,” said Huub Rottgering, also from Leiden Observatory.
Black hole at the centre
 Radio galaxies are very rare objects in the universe. They are colossal galaxies with a supermassive black hole in their centre that actively accretes gas and dust from its surroundings.
 This activity initiates the launch of high-energy jet streams, which are capable of accelerating charged particles around the supermassive black hole to almost the speed of light.
 The discovery of such galaxies at extremely large distances is important for our understanding of the formation and evolution of galaxies, researchers said.

JNCASR’s novel material to convert waste heat into electricity ","A novel compound that exhibits poor thermal conductivity in the 25-425 degree C range but shows good electrical conductivity has been developed by a team of researchers led by Dr Kanishka Biswas from Bengaluru’s Jawaharlal Nehru Centre for Advanced Scientific Research (JNCASR). The compound, silver copper telluride (AgCuTe), shows promise as a thermoelectric material for converting waste heat into electricity.
Since nearly 65% of utilized energy is wasted as heat, the focus is on developing materials that exhibit good thermoelectric property with both glass- and metal-like properties. Potential applications of the thermoelectric technology are in automobile industry, chemical, thermal and steel power plants where large quantities of heat are wasted.
Due to the low thermal conductivity of the material developed by JNCASR, one end of the 8 mm-long rod that is contact with waste heat remains hot while the other end maintains cold temperature. The temperature difference is essential for the generation of electrical voltage. At the same time, the material exhibits good electrical conductivity like metal. The results were published in the journal Angewandte Chemie.
In the AgCuTe material, the silver atoms (cation) are weakly bound, giving rise to poor thermal conductivity due to the slow vibration of the lattice (soft lattice). At high temperatures, copper in the material further lowers the thermal conductivity along with silver. “Since the silver lattice vibrates slowly, it provides record low thermal conduction of 0.35 W per metre per kelvin, which is actually close to the glass,” Dr Biswas says.
“Both cations [silver and copper] contribute to low thermal conductivity but silver contributes more. Over 170 degree C, both silver and copper ions flow like liquid within the rigid tellurium sublattice, thereby reducing the thermal conductivity to the level of glass without affecting the hole (electrical carrier) transport,” says Subhajit Roychowdhury from JNCASR and first author of the paper.
In contrast, the tellurium atoms (anion) are strongly bound and the lattice is very rigid. The strongly bound tellurium provides a conduction channel for holes thus rendering good electrical conductivity as seen in metals.
“By combining silver and copper with tellurium we have made our material as a combination of glass and metal — poor thermal conductivity and good electrical conductivity,” Dr Biswas says.
“Silver telluride does not have good thermoelectric property because it has higher thermal conductivity than our material,” says Roychowdhury.
It is a challenging task to have glassy and metallic properties in a single material, which is the fundamental challenge in the field of thermoelectrics. “We addressed this challenge through structural chemistry by creating a bonding hierarchy in the material,” Dr Biswas says.
The calculated efficiency to convert heat into electricity is 14% for the new material developed by JNCASR researchers. The lead telluride (PbTe) has higher efficiency of 18%. “But unlike lead telluride that contains lead, which is toxic, our material is lead-free,” he adds. The theoretical calculation to know the electronic structure was done in collaboration with Prof. Umesh V. Waghmare of JNCASR and coauthor of the paper. “We are trying to increase the efficiency by doping with different cations and anions,” Dr Biswas says.

Demystifying Science - June 3, 2018
","Two teams of researchers have identified a gene family called NOTCH2NL that appears to play an important role in human-specific cortex development and may have been a driving force in the evolution of our large brains. The evolution of larger brains, in the last 3 million years, has played an important role in our ability as a species to think, problem-solve, and develop culture. The researchers have found that NOTCH2NL can substantially expand the population of cortical stem cells, which in turn generate more neurons, making the human brain larger. The findings have been published in the journal, Cell.

Geeknight Hyderabad on being ‘geek and proud’
"," 

Scrounging YouTube and Twitch, we often see what our role models in technology are up to. But what of our very neighbours? That’s where Geeknight by Thoughtworks steps in.
The community-oriented event is a source of pride for Office principal Kashi Reddy who explains, “Thoughtworks is essentially into a lot of sharing and learning; we are always thinking about social responsibility. We have always been pro-open source, meaning software should be free for people to use. When we say free, it’s open freedom, not cost.” On that note, the concept of Geeknight opens the floor to people outside the international development to come to the events which often take place on the first Wednesday of every month, and further the sharing of technical knowledge and increase collaboration within the ‘geek community.’ 
Of course, Geeknight isn’t a new concept but it’s providing age-old avenues for newer topics of conversation. According to Ujjavala Singh, a developer at Thoughtworks and one of the organisers of Geeknight, the news around these themes evolve daily if not hourly and finding topics to discuss can be a fun task. She adds, “I see a great variation of people coming in, in regards to their years of experience in relevant fields, from university students to people who are at top-tier positions at development firms. That helps bring in diverse views which is really interesting and useful.” 




Their first ever event in Hyderabad remains a truly memorable one for Kashi; it was about microservices. “A luminary called Sam Newman, who used to be a Thoughtworker, was in Hyderabad,” he recalls, “We invited him to our office and about 40 to 50 people from outside came for the event. Back then, we had a very small office with barely 10 people. The attendance of 40 to 50 was a big number to me because we obviously didn’t have the presence we do now.” 
But there’s plenty to still achieve for Geeknight. Kashi adds, “Yes, we do get great turnouts for umbrella topics with certain jargon like virtual reality or Internet of Things or Artificial Intelligence. But I’d like to see deeper engagement on smaller and more refined topics. Even if the turnout isn’t huge, I know we can’t keep doing ‘baahubali’ topics, we have to attract people who are in specialist positions and mindset… topics like ‘scaling continuous integration pipelines in a really complex environment.’” He observed that not many did turn up for this event, as predicted, but the engagement was in the right direction.
According to Thoughtworker and Geeknight organiser Mahitha Arveti, they’ve enjoyed the insights of some remarkable moderators, like software architect and author Neal Ford, who’ve enriched the conversation as well as inspired developers.
Geeknight always communicates directly with each and every person who steps into their offices for their events, taking feedback meticulously and carefully all to stay on their A-game. 
And it helps to have a fun and quirkily-designed office in the bustling area of Gachibowli, close to institutes like IIIT as well as big firms too.

Protein’s novel role in embryo implantation studied
","A large number of couples are infertile and in many cases IVF is not successful and there are repeated failures. In a latest development, Mumbai-based researchers have shown the molecular features of embryo–endometrium crosstalk that helps in embryo implantation.
The team led by Dr. Deepak Modi from ICMR’s National Institute for Research in Reproductive Health (NIRRH) has discovered that the endometrium is not a passive tissue which readily promotes embryo implantation but undergoes extensive remodelling brought about by the embryo at the time of implantation.
They discovered that a protein OVGP1 is induced in the endometrium precisely at the time when the embryo has to implant. That the embryo can implant only during a narrow window is well known. Studies carried out in mouse models showed that OVGP1 protein is expressed for a brief period that coincides with the time of implantation. It is known that the pregnancy hormone — human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) produced and released by embryos is crucial for the implantation process.
The role of hCG hormone in inducing the endometrium to produce the OVGP1 protein became clear when the researchers studied the role of different hormones on endometrial cell lines. The cell lines were exposed to progesterone, estrogen and human chorionic gonadotropin hormone. “We found the hCG hormone induced the expression of OVGP1 protein. Progesterone and estrogen, too, had a role, though minor, whereas hCG had a major role in the expression of OVGP1. This tells that embryos signal the endometrium to express OVGP1,” says Dr. Modi, who is the corresponding author of a paper published in the Journal of Assisted Reproduction and Genetics.
To study how the protein helps in the implantation process, the researchers silenced the expression of the protein in the endometrium cell lines. They found that the expression levels of integrin proteins, which are essential for implantation, were significantly reduced in OVGP1 silenced cells. Similarly, homeobox protein HOXA10 levels too reduced significantly as did the cytokines, says Saniya Laheri from the Department of Biological Sciences, NMIMS Sunandan Divatia School of Science, Mumbai and first author of the paper.
“We found the OVGP1 protein is required for balancing the expression of genes required for implantation,” says Laheri. “We then wanted to test if the expression of the altered genes affects implantation.”
For implantation to take place the trophoblast cells (the outermost layer of the embryo) have to adhere to the endometrial epithelial cells. When the OVGP1 protein was silenced in the endometrium the adhesion of the trophoblast gets reduced. “This led us to conclude that OVGP1 in the endometrial epithelial cells is required for embryo implantation,” says Nancy Ashray from NIRRH, a co-author of the paper.
Women who had repeated IVF failure apparently had reduced levels of OVGP1 protein. “The levels of OVGP1 are reduced by 30% in women with repeated IVF failure,” Laheri says.
“This is a very fundamental research and we are now beginning to understand how the embryo and endometrium have to crosstalk. This work in long term might have implications in management of infertility,” says Dr. Modi.

NASA's Parker Solar Probe launch postponed ","The launch of the first-ever spacecraft to the Sun, the Parker Solar Probe, has been postponed to Sunday morning. NASA wrote on its Twitter page that the launch was postponed from 3:33 am ET to 4:38 am ET. It later updated that the launch was ""scrubbed"" and a second attempt would be made on Sunday morning.



This morning’s launch of @NASASun’s #ParkerSolarProbe was scrubbed. Launch teams will attempt to launch on Sunday morning. Get real-time updates: https://t.co/9uczz8fdI8 pic.twitter.com/6GyCioopfa


NASA’s car-sized, $1.5 billion Parker Solar Probe was scheduled for launch on a Delta IV Heavy rocket from Cape Canaveral, Florida, during a 65-minute launch window that opened at 3.33 am EDT (1.33 pm IST).
By coming closer to the Sun than any spacecraft in history, the unmanned probe’s main goal is to unveil the secrets of the corona, the unusual atmosphere around the Sun. “We are going to be in an area that is so exciting, where solar wind — we believe — will be accelerating,” said NASA planetary science division director Jim Green.



LIVE NOW: Join us as we launch our first-ever mission to study the Sun up close! Our Parker #SolarProbe will swoop within 4 million miles of the Sun's surface, facing heat & radiation like no spacecraft before. Watch the countdown to the 3:53am ET liftoff: https://t.co/MNkanu1yVV


“Where we see huge magnetic fields that are passing by us, as coronal mass ejections make their way out into the solar system.”
Not only is the corona about 300 times hotter than the Sun’s surface, it also hurls powerful plasma and energetic particles that can unleash geomagnetic space storms, wreaking havoc on the Earth by disrupting the power grid.
But these solar outbursts are poorly understood.
“The Parker Solar Probe will help us do a much better job of predicting when a disturbance in the solar wind could hit the Earth,” said Justin Kasper, a project scientist and professor at the University of Michigan.
Knowing more about the solar wind and space storms will also help protect future deep space explorers as they journey toward the Moon or Mars.
The probe is protected by an ultra-powerful heat shield that is just 4.5 inches (11.43 centimeters) thick.
The shield should enable the spacecraft to survive its close shave with the fiery star, coming within 3.83 million miles (6.16 million kilometers) of the Sun’s surface.
The heat shield is built to withstand radiation equivalent to up to about 500 times the Sun’s radiation on Earth.
Even in a region where temperatures can reach more than a million degrees Fahrenheit, the sunlight is expected to heat the shield to just around 2,500 degrees Fahrenheit (1,371 degrees Celsius).
Scorching, yes? But if all works as planned, the inside of the spacecraft should stay at just 85 degrees Fahrenheit.
The goal for the Parker Solar Probe is to make 24 passes through the corona during its seven-year mission.
“The sun is full of mysteries,” said Nicky Fox, project scientist at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Lab.
“We are ready. We have the perfect payload. We know the questions we want to answer.”
The tools on board will measure the expanding corona and continually flowing atmosphere known as the solar wind, which solar physicist Eugene Parker first described in 1958.
Parker, now 91, recalled that at first some people did not believe in his theory.
But then, the launch of NASA’s Mariner 2 spacecraft in 1962 — becoming the first robotic spacecraft to make a successful planetary encounter — proved them wrong.
“It was just a matter of sitting out the deniers for four years until the Venus Mariner 2 spacecraft showed that, by golly, there was a solar wind,” Mr. Parker said earlier this week.
Mr. Parker said he was “impressed” by the Parker Solar Probe, calling it “a very complex machine.”
Scientists have wanted to build a spacecraft like this for more than 60 years, but only in recent years did the heat shield technology advance enough to be capable of protecting sensitive instruments, according to Mr. Fox.
Tools on board will measure high-energy particles associated with flares and coronal mass ejections, as well as the changing magnetic field around the Sun.
“We will also be listening for plasma waves that we know flow around when particles move,” Mr. Fox added.
“And last but not least, we have a white light imager that is taking images of the atmosphere right in front of the Sun.”
When it nears the Sun, the probe will travel rapidly enough to go from New York to Tokyo in one minute — some 430,000 miles per hour, making it the fastest human-made object.

What caused the Dec. 1, 2015 Chennai downpour? ","On December 1, 2015 Chennai and its surrounding regions experienced an unprecedented, heavy rainfall. In a region where the average rainfall during the season is expected to be 8-10 mm per day, one of the rain gauges in the city recorded an abnormally high, 494 mm, rainfall over 24 hours that day. This led to death of nearly 250 people, and Chennai was declared a ‘disaster zone’. There have been attempts to explain this phenomenon of how clouds remained stationary over this region, continuously giving rain over 24 hours. In a first, Jayesh Phadtare of Centre for Atmospheric and Ocean Sciences, Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru, links the presence of the Eastern Ghats to this phenomenon, in a paper published in Monthly Weather Review.
Cold pool
When clouds give out water droplets, the droplets evaporate mid-air, as they fall down. This cools the surrounding air, forming a cold pool of air which sinks down and flows horizontally. “The gusty cold wind that heralds an approaching thunderstorm is nothing but a cold pool, which plays a pivotal role in cloud dynamics.” says Jayesh.
Unlike the Western Ghats, which run close to the west coast of India, the Eastern Ghats are nearly 200 km away from the coast. Therefore, the link between the mountains’ orography and the rainfall over the region is not obvious, and this is the first study to link the two. Jayesh, who is studying cloud propagation over the Indian region, could see the connection by observing satellite images: “In Kalpana-I satellite images, I saw that the clouds that gave so much rain over Chennai on 1 December 2015 moved from Bay of Bengal to the coast and became stationary there,” he says. Realising that the Eastern Ghats must be having a role in this, he went on to study a model of the system. “The interaction between mountains, clouds and cold pools became clear after performing the model experiments,” he adds, in an email to The Hindu.
According to the model, the cold pool was obstructed by the Eastern Ghats from flowing downward. Hence it piled up and remained stationary over the Chennai region. “The reason for the clouds remaining stationary was that there was a balance between the piling of cold pool along the mountain and the winds from the bay. This does not happen in all heavy rainfall incidences over Chennai,” says Jayesh.
Sensitivity experiments were done to check this model. In the experimental model in which the orography was absent, the winds just swept downstream and the clouds moved inland. In the model where the evaporative cooling was removed, the cold pool did not form at all and the clouds moved over the Ghats.
Dust storms
Cold pools are known to play an important role in the dust storms (Aandhi) that form in northern India. They form by the evaporation of raindrops. This process is more efficient in the drier and warmer environment as there is lot of scope of evaporation. So, the cold pools that form in these conditions, are deeper and more vigorous. “As pre-monsoon conditions in north India are very dry and warm, cold pools that accompany the pre-monsoon thunderstorms there are far more destructive, causing widespread damages,” says Jayesh. For the first time, this study links cold pools and the mountain structure to explain rainfall over south India.
Though the primary aim of the study is to explain the anomalous rainfall over Chennai on December 1, 2015, ""the understanding gained from this analysis can be useful for improving the general weather forecast over this region,” the author writes in the paper.

Dire times for coastal fisheries?
"," The fishing industry along a portion of India’s east coast could be on the brink of a collapse. This dire warning comes as scientists find that fisheries in coastal Tamil Nadu and Puducherry use destructive methods and do not comply with existing regulations, which could stress the already over-exploited fish resources here.
Regulations are crucial in India, the world's second largest fish producer, where large scale motorisation of traditional fishing crafts began since the 1950s. Different categories of crafts – traditional catamarans, fibreglass boats, trawlers – have specifications, from the fishing gear they should employ to the distance they should head out into the sea. But are these rules followed?
GPS data
To generate baseline information on who fishes where in the sea, scientists from the Foundation for Ecological Research, Advocacy and Learning mapped and quantified fish catch, fishing gear, craft and crew details along 120 kilometres of the coasts of Puducherry, Villupuram and Cuddalore districts of Tamil Nadu. They attached global positioning systems to vessels; these, as well as field teams gathered information of over 3,427 fishing trips over 7,945 square kilometres of fishing grounds between June 2012 and June 2013. Their results, published in PLOS ONE on July 11 this year, reveal that there are distinct high-pressure fishing zones and overlapping fishing territories between traditional, motorised and mechanised crafts. Violations of the Marine Fisheries Regulations Act (including not adhering to fishing limits and using illegal fishing gear) are also frequent. The team also presented these results to the fishing community leaders of each village.
“We wanted to initiate discussions among the fishing communities regarding their role in fisheries management, for they adhere to decisions made by their community leaders,” said Tara Lawrence, lead author of the study.
Some of the recommendations made by these communities are listed in the study – such as suggesting that boats stick to their nautical mile limits – and can be achieved with enforcement and could potentially help the marine ecosystem recover, she adds.
According to marine biologist Divya Karnad who was not involved in this study, this work is a critical contribution to the study of small-scale fisheries in India. However, the data is a bit dated; since fisheries are ever-changing, comparisons with the present could offer better insight into change and adaptation in these fisheries, she wrote in an email.
“We need many more such systematic studies that collect long-term data,” she added.

When Bill Gross, someone who is considered a startup guru, studied 200 different startups to understand factors most crucial to success, ‘Ideas’ made the top 5, at number 3. Behind ‘Timing’ and ‘Team’, but above ‘Business Model’ and ‘Funding’.
But a lot of the ideas that startups grapple with tend to be unproven, and thus laden with a lot of risk. The sensible thing to do is to validate them before work can be started in full earnest to bring those ideas into fruition, as either products or services. How does one do it? Even though hypothesis testing is a mature-enough science, startups do not often have the wherewithal for the time or effort that any such data-gathering exercise would take. 
Building a prototype or an MVP (minimum viable product) is often the correct thing to do to test hypotheses, but for most startups, the prototype is often the product, and entrepreneurs will be loath to spend resources and effort, with the knowledge that they may have to ditch what they have built. In a sense, this is a variant of that old problem of entrepreneurs loving their solution too much, something we have talked about in the past in this column. This is why we often have solutions that startups are very taken in with, but are not really solving any problem. Detaching themselves from the solution and attaching themselves much more strongly to the problem instead, is therefore, a great first step for any entrepreneur wanting to validate their ideas.
There is another big advantage that comes from worrying about the problem more than the solution. If one studies the problem comprehensively enough, it makes it easier for the entrepreneurs to find parallels in either a different problem, or a different market. And importantly, they can find such problem parallels where there are proven solutions. It allows you to abstract out the problem and its ecosystem, instead of trying to solve for the specifics right away. For example, if you are trying to come up with a solution for last-mile connectivity from Metro railway stations in Bengaluru, you can study how this problem was similarly solved in other Bengaluru-like cities around the globe, when the Metro first came to their cities. And then see how similar the solution hypothesis that you are testing is, to the solution that has successfully worked in the parallel problem ecosystem.
Of course, a crucial follow-up step after finding appropriate parallels for the problem ecosystem, where a solution already exists, is to be complete in understanding how the two ecosystems are different. For this determines how the solutions vary too.
Like any heuristic or thumb rule, this method of validating ideas does not guarantee complete success. However, it will definitely be more fruitful than jumping into a solution completely unvalidated, and takes far lesser time and effort than any sort of rigorous hypothesis testing of the ideas. In other words, perfect for entrepreneurs.

Novel biomarkers for gastric cancer progression
"," With stomach cancer figuring as the third leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide, researchers from University of Delhi and National Institute of Cancer Prevention and Research, Noida have identified two proteins — survivin and STAT3 — that can be potential markers of the disease. According to them, these proteins could also be suitable therapeutic targets in preventing gastric cancer progression.
From 2007-2012, in all 156 gastric samples were collected from a hospital in Allahabad and studied. Of these, 30 were precancerous tissues, 65 were in the advanced stage of stomach cancer (adenocarcinomas) and the rest were normal healthy tissues. Protein expression studies revealed that survivin and STAT3 were produced in abundance (overexpressed) during gastric tumour progression.
“Survivin plays a dual role. Normally, it is in the nucleus and is associated with cell proliferation, whereas in advanced tumours it has been observed in cytoplasm and mitochondria, which is linked to chemoresistance. This means that in patients, when it is overexpressed in cytoplasm, it can inhibit cell death,” explains Prof. Alok C. Bharti from the Molecular Oncology Laboratory at the University of Delhi and corresponding author of the work published in Cancer Reports. “Therefore, the protein can help cancer cells to survive in harsh toxic conditions and to withstand chemoradiation, causing the patient to not respond or poorly respond to chemotherapy.”
Genetic analysis
The researchers also looked at the presence of key pathogenicity inducing gene cagA of Helicobacter pylori and identified strong correlation between presence of the gene and increased expression of survivin and STAT3.
Lifestyle habits like smoking and alcohol consumption were also found to be the causes for increase in the expression of these proteins. But when these habits came together along with H. pylori infection, the expression of survivin was characteristically very high. These molecular markers can be present even when the lesion is small and have larger implications as they point to future progress of the disease.
“It is a very simple, easy test to detect the level of these molecular markers. Detection of cagA gene is done by standard PCR and the immunohistological analysis for the proteins could be performed in a lab and does not require sophisticated infrastructure. The reagents required are also generic and not expensive, and the analysis can be done by any expert pathologist,” says Dr. Arvind Pandey, first author of the study who did his PhD at the institute.
Currently there is no specific clinically-available method to study gastric cancer progression. Further standardisation is needed to translate it into clinical reality.

Now, polyethylene plastic with antibacterial properties
","Silver nanoparticles embedded on clay have now been successfully dispersed inside plastic to create new antimicrobial films, filaments and can also be moulded into other plastic items. Silver nanoparticle-embedded plastics were found to have greater than 99% antibacterial activity against common bacterial pathogens like Escherchia coli and Staphylococcus aureus.
Silver nanoparticles of about 10 nanometre size were deposited on clay particles of about 200-300 nanometre length. “We used an inorganic clay found in volcanic sites called Montmorillonite. Silver nanoparticles have a tendency of agglomeration or clumping due to high surface area, so we provided clay as a platform for the silver to sit on,” explains Anasuya Roy, PhD scholar at IIT, Delhi and first author of the paper published in Polymer Composites.
Clay-silver compound
The clay–silver compound, containg 10% silver, was then loaded into the high density polyethylene plastic using a melt compounding method. “The clay is inorganic and highly hydrophilic, whereas our plastic is organic, hydrophobic and nonpolar. They are highly incompatible. So we use a compatibilizer, which gives the required adhesion between the two phases. Also, inside the twin screw extruder machine, the necessary speed, temperature and time gives uniform mixing and the silver-clay is well embedded inside the plastic,” explains Prof. Mangala Joshi, from Department of Textile Technology at IIT Delhi and corresponding author of the paper.
Films and filaments
They then converted the newly formed silver–clay–plastic nanocomposite into films, filaments and also moulded these into specimens and checked the antibacterial property. The films and filaments showed higher activity than the moulded ones. “In the moulded ones, we found that the antimicrobial silver was not available on the surface leading to the reduction in activity. But when the concentration of silver–clay complex was increased from 3% to 5%, the moulded ones also showed excellent activity against the two pathogens,” adds Joshi. The research team has got a U.S. patent.
The team also tried other metal ions like zinc and copper in the place of silver. “Silver has a high reduction potential, meaning it can quickly go from silver ions to silver nanoparticles without the need of any external reducing agent. These silver nanoparticles interact with the bacterial cell wall and also generate oxidative stress inside the cell, thus killing it,” explains Roy. “The content of silver is very low in these nanocomposite plastic so no toxicity to human cells. Further, we checked the biocompatibility of the plastic with human skin and blood in vitro. In vivo tests are in progress and we hope that the new plastic can find a wide range of applications in the biomedical field and also in commodity items where this antimicrobial property can be an added advantage.”

App helps monitor blood pressure using smartphone
","Scientists, including those of Indian-origin, have developed a new smartphone app and hardware that could help measure blood pressure more accurately than existing cuff devices.
The team, from Michigan State University in the U.S., also discovered a more convenient measurement point. “We targeted a different artery, the transverse palmer arch artery at the fingertip, to give us better control of the measurement,” said Anand Chandrasekhar, doctoral student at MSU.
“We were excited when we validated this location. Being able to use your fingertip makes our approach much easier and more accessible,” said Chandrasekhar, lead author of the study published in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
The approach uses two sensors: an optical sensor on top of a force sensor. The sensor unit and other circuitry are housed in a one centimeter-thick case attached to the back of the phone.
Users turn on the app and press their fingertip against the sensor unit. With their finger on the unit, they hold their phone at heart level and watch their smartphone screen to ensure they are applying the correct amount of finger pressure.
“A key point was to see if users could properly apply the finger pressure over time, which lasts as long as an arm-cuff measurement,” said Ramakrishna Mukkamala, professor at MSU.
“We were pleased to see that 90 per cent of the people trying it were able to do it easily after just one or two practice tries,” said Mukkamala.
While high blood pressure is treatable with lifestyle changes and medication, only around 20% of people with hypertension have their condition under control.
This invention gives patients a convenient option, and keeping a log of daily measurements would produce an accurate average, discounting an occasional measurement anomaly, Mukkamala said.
The research team will continue to improve accuracy and hopes to pursue more comprehensive testing based on the standard protocol of the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation.

Our competition is cash by itself, says PayPal's Guru Bhat
"," 
PayPal started domestic payments in India six months ago. How is that coming along?
It’s coming along well. We processed upwards of 450 billion dollars in payment in 2017 globally; that’s over 16,537 dollars per second. Still when we started the domestic payment six months ago, there were a lot of questions: were we too late, are there too many rival companies... But if you look at the payment volume in India, 85% is still in cash — so that is where our focus is. Our competition is not the other players in the market but cash in itself. Moreover, here we have the regulatory authorities as well as the government championing digital payment. Combine that with the increasing spending power of the Indian middle class, smartphone availability, Internet penetration and the number of millennials (people under 35 years of age) — the Indian market is really vibrant right now.
What is your growth strategy for India, are you looking at expanding presence in the Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities?
When we introduce something into a new market which is as complex as India, we need to understand the user base and modify our products to fit the Indian need. We recognise that the Indian market needs to be a marathon not a sprint. Given the dynamic market, we can’t build a fixed product here. We need to keep redesigning it to meet fresh demands.
India is an untapped opportunity for digital payments. Currently, we are focusing on the tier 1 market, but we will grow subsequently. Government initiatives and a favourable regulatory environment, along with mobile adoption, are changing the game in India. There has been a positive impact on how consumers and merchants are interacting, and this will accelerate the process of bringing online and offline together.
I’m not sure if we can have something truly offline, however, because you’ll still need to go online to sync your information to your account. But yes, say you have a lot of information about a customer’s payment activity, their patterns, how religiously they pay all their bills, then you can build in a system for offline payment. The technology is not an inhibitor there. If there is a need for it, we will make it happen.
The other thing we are working on is making PayPal easily accessible — any merchant can sign up to a PayPal account.
How do you plan to stand out in such a highly competitive market?
We have been in the market for several years. With so much data, comes a lot of insight as well. Our risk management is efficient — reducing fraud loss rates to 0.28% — that’s our secret sauce.
We use artificial intelligence to prevent collusion fraud — where a buyer and seller collude to cheat the company. We have algorithms to read patterns and detect which combination of buyers and sellers are most likely to commit fraud.
Moreover, we have a unique value proposition to protect sellers as well as buyers, where a customer has 180 days to dispute a fraudulent transaction.
Another difference right now is that our customers are not required to hold a balance or a wallet, you can directly use funding instruments like a credit or debit card. So the KYC mandate to register the customers’ Aadhaar or PAN number does not apply to us as of now.
What sort of tie-ups is PayPal looking at, to increase its user base?
For the domestic launch, we had partnered with a select set of merchants like BookMyShow, Yatra and MakeMyTrip. PayPal is now available for all merchants and consumers — offering a single account for their domestic and international transactions.
Do you see cryptocurrencies playing a big role in digital payments in the future?
If you look at the technology behind cryptocurrencies — the blockchain — that itself is promising; there is a huge potential in certain use cases. As a neutral payment system, we are committed to accepting the forms of payment our customers and merchants demand. But right now, we have not seen that kind of demand for cryptocurrency. It is just one of those things we are keeping an eye on, but not very closely.
My personal opinion is that despite the noble intention to enable free movement of money, it is lending itself to a lot of rackets. Moreover, it is prone to fluctuation, and anything that has so much speculation around it will not attract the big players. So it will be interesting to see what happens after the dust settles down after a year or so. Now, there is no technical reason to not use it, but we just do not see the need to introduce it.

What is a voltage fade?
It is the bane of batteries, including phone batteries, and is said to be a key reason for lowering their performance. Voltage fade reduces the energy density of a battery which in turn limits the practical applications of these materials despite their high energy density in the initial charge-discharge cycles. Voltage fade is of concern now as it affects a promising class of cathode materials called Lithium-rich NMC (nickel magnesium cobalt) layered oxides. These cathode materials have drawn attention to their potential as components for better rechargeable batteries for electric vehicles. Researchers have now identified nanoscale defects or dislocations which result in voltage fade. There is hope, though. The team in the U.S. has showed that heat treatment eliminated most of the defects and restored the original voltage.The findings have been published in the journal, Nature Energy. — Science Daily

Want your name to go to the Sun? NASA gives you a chance! "," If you want your name to travel through the Sun’s atmosphere, braving brutal heat and radiation conditions, here comes your chance. NASA is inviting people around the world to submit their names online to be placed on a microchip aboard its historic solar probe launching this summer.
“This probe will journey to a region humanity has never explored before,” said Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator for the Science Mission Directorate at NASA Headquarters in Washington. “This mission will answer questions scientists have sought to uncover for more than six decades.” 
In May 2017, NASA renamed the spacecraft from the Solar Probe Plus to the Parker Solar Probe in honour of astrophysicist Eugene Parker. The US space agency on Tuesday said it would accept submissions till April 27, 2018.




The spacecraft, about the size of a small car, will travel directly into the Sun’s atmosphere about four million miles from the star’s surface. The primary science goals for the mission are to trace how energy and heat move through the solar corona, and to explore what accelerates the solar wind as well as solar energetic particles. 
The mission will revolutionise our understanding of the Sun, where changing conditions can spread out into the solar system, affecting Earth and other worlds, NASA said. The spacecraft speed is so fast, at its closest approach it will be going at approximately 430,000 mph. That’s fast enough to get from Washington DC to Tokyo in under a minute, NASA said.
“Parker Solar Probe is, quite literally, the fastest, hottest — and, to me, coolest — mission under the Sun,” said project scientist Nicola Fox of the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in Maryland, US. “This incredible spacecraft is going to reveal so much about our star and how it works that we’ve not been able to understand.”

Severe uranium contamination in India’s groundwater: Study ","Scientists have found widespread uranium contamination in groundwater from aquifers across 16 states in India, much above the WHO provisional standard for the country. The findings published in the journal Environmental Science & Technology Letters are the first to demonstrate the predominant prevalence of uranium in India’s groundwater.
The researchers from Duke University in the US unveiled new data showing that the occurrence in uranium in Indian groundwater — a primary source of drinking water and irrigation — is an emerging and widespread phenomenon.
They compiled data on groundwater uranium from 16 Indian states and new data from 324 wells in Rajasthan and Gujarat that shows a high prevalence of uranium concentrations above the WHO provisional guideline value across India.
The WHO has set a provisional safe drinking water standard of 30 micrograms of uranium per litre for India, a level that is consistent with US Environmental Protection Agency standards. Despite this, uranium is not yet included in the list of contaminants monitored under the Bureau of Indian Standards’ Drinking Water Specifications, researchers said.
The study suggests that contribution of human factors such as groundwater depletion and nitrate pollution may be aggravating the already present natural uranium contamination to dangerous levels. Several studies have linked exposure to uranium in drinking water to chronic kidney disease.
“Nearly a third of all water wells we tested in one state, Rajasthan, contained uranium levels that exceed the World Health Organization and US Environmental Protection Agency’s safe drinking water standards,” said Avner Vengosh, a professor of geochemistry and water quality at Duke’s Nicholas School of the Environment. “By analysing previous water quality studies, we also identified aquifers contaminated with similarly high levels of uranium in 26 other districts in northwestern India and nine districts in southern or southeastern India.”
Many of India’s aquifers are composed of clay, silt and gravel carried down from Himalayan weathering by streams or uranium-rich granitic rocks. When over-pumping of these aquifers’ groundwater occurs and their water levels decline, it induces oxidation conditions that, in turn, enhance uranium enrichment in the shallow groundwater that remains.
While the primary source of uranium is geogenic (naturally occurring), anthropogenic (human caused) factors such as groundwater table decline and nitrate pollution may further enhance uranium mobilisation. Using geochemical and uranium isotope data, it suggests factors that may drive high uranium concentrations in groundwater, including uranium content in aquifer rocks, oxidation state, and groundwater chemistry that promotes the formation of soluble uranyl carbonate complexes.
“Our analysis showed that the occurrence of uranium in these groundwater sources depends on several factors,” said Rachel M Coyte, a PhD student in Vengosh’s lab.
These factors include the amount of uranium contained in an aquifer’s rocks; water-rock interactions that cause the uranium to be extracted from those rocks; oxidation conditions that enhance the extracted uranium’s solubility in water; and the interaction of the extracted uranium with other chemicals in the groundwater, such as bicarbonate, which can further enhance its solubility.
“In many parts of India, these factors co-occur and result in high uranium concentrations in the groundwater,” Coyte said. “Geochemistry and isotopic tools help us to better understand the process and conditions that control uranium occurrence in groundwater.”
Human activities, especially the over-exploitation of groundwater for agricultural irrigation, may contribute to the problem, said Coyte. “One of the takeaways of this study is that human activities can make a bad situation worse, but we could also make it better,” Vengosh said.
The study strongly suggests the need for revision of the current water quality monitoring program in India, evaluation of human health risks in areas of high uranium prevalence, development of adequate remediation technologies, and, above all, implementation of preventive management practices to address this problem, said Vengosh.
“Including a uranium standard in the Bureau of Indian Standards’ Drinking Water Specification based on uranium’s kidney-harming effects, establishing monitoring systems to identify at-risk areas, and exploring new ways to prevent or treat uranium contamination will help ensure access to safe drinking water for tens of millions in India,” he said.

Nokia X5 launched in China: here’s the full specs, and price
"," Nokia launched the highly anticipated Nokia X5 in China on Wednesday. The 5.8-inch phone, which comes with Android Oreo, was sold out within two hours of its launch, according to the company’s Weibo account. 
The X5, with its face recognition and intelligent AI features, is priced at ¥999 (approx. Rs. 10186) for the 3GB RAM/32GB ROM. The phone also comes in a 4GB RAM/64 GB ROM version. 
Display and camera
The phone is encased in a double-sided glass body with an integrated polycarbonate frame. It is available in three colours - -Extreme Night Black, Glacier White and Baltic Sea Blue. The 5.86 inch phone has a 19:9 HD screen ratio, but it also has a notch at its top, reminiscent of the iPhone X. The Nokia X6 was the first Nokia phone to feature the notch
The display has a resolution of 1520×720 and has a 2.5D glass. The phone also features a 13 megapixel + 5 megapixel dual camera set up in the rear, with f/2.0 aperture, phase detection autofocus and an LED flash. The front is equipped with an 8 megapixel camera. 
The camera has several built-in features like the AI beauty blur -- the application of intelligent 3D blur algorithm -- smart portrait lighting, blurred pictures, application of depth of field among others. 
Tech specs
The X5 is powered by a MediaTek Helio P60 chipset. The 3,060 mAh battery, which is a built-in type, does not support fast charging, according to Tech Radar. It also has the standard 3.5 mm audio jack and the USB Type-C port. 
The specs, according to the Nokia website, give you 11 hours of video playback on 4G networks, 27 hours screen time on standby and a call duration of 17.5 hours. 
‘Intelligent’ features
The phone supports screen-off fingerprint payment, which lets users open up apps with their fingerprint even if the screen is off, making “fingerprint payment in the lock screen state more convenient and faster”. The phone also has features like intelligent screen recognition, double-finger long-press on the screen that lets you break down articles and conversations into easy-to-select, copy, and search-for words. 
Since the phone comes with the pure Android, it can be upgraded to the not-yet-released Android P.
The company launched the Nokia X6 in China earlier this year and reports say that it could be launched in India somewhere around August or September. The India launch date for the new X5 however, is unclear. Media reports also say that both phones could be marketed as Nokia 5.1 Plus and Nokia 6.1 Plus outside China.

Okami HD and Dead Cells: Fun on the go
"," Several games have tried to replicate the soul of Nintendo’s Zelda series and Okami is one game that has come close to that formula. A unique game that not only bags several awards, but is a modern-day classic, making it to the hall of fame of the best games ever made. Recently re-released in HD for the Playstation 4, the same HD treatment makes its way to Nintendo’s spunky handheld, the Switch, and it is the perfect home for Amaterasu. 
Okami HD


What’s it about?
Amaterasu is a Japanese sun goddess, and the main character of Okami, who appears in the game as the white wolf Shiranui. Based on folklore, Amaterasu appears to cleanse the land consumed by a dark curse laid down by Orochi. Accompanied by a tiny artist known as Issun, you get to use the celestial brush to draw out evil, pun fully intended.




Released in 2006, Okami proved to the world that games can be works of art. The Playstation 2 sang as it churned out a beautiful world that was one large Sumi-e (a Japanese woodcut watercolour brushwork technique) painting come to life. An art style that has had an impact on Capcom’s games to this day, very evident in Street Fighter IV and V, adding movement via ink and brush strokes.
While the art style will leave your jaw on the floor, Okami does drag a lot in places. From its beautiful but annoying intro that you have to sit through, to a few pacing problems in the story. These are minor quibbles though, in comparison to the incredible world that is waiting for you to explore. So all you need to do is just survive that intro.
How does it play?
Made by legendary game designer Hideki Kamiya, the brains behind Devil May Cry and Bayonetta, Amaterasu’s fighting technique has flair and speed. In addition to that, a press of the button brings the celestial brush, which is perfect for the Switch in handheld mode, as you use the touchscreen to draw across enemies. It seems as though the game has been made for a console that launched almost 10 years later.




Exploration and puzzle-solving is a lot better with the touch celestial brush. Though in docked mode, you will need to use the JoyCons. The handheld mode is recommended though, not only because you get to take Amaterasu on your work commute, but also because it addresses one of the biggest problems we had with the HD remake. Due to the art style, on large TVs, the graphics look a bit like you are seeing double, with the cel shading and the brush work adding a bit of a second image. On the handheld screen of the Switch, we did not notice this phenomenon and were able to enjoy the game to its fullest.
Should you get it?
If you own a Nintendo Switch and you’re feeling that void after completing Breath of the Wild, then Okami is one game you should dive right into.
While Okami was inspired by Zelda, Dead Cells is an Indie game that’s inspired by Nintendo’s Metroid, combining two enthusiast sub-genres, Metroidvania — games that are like Castlevania and Metroid — and Roguelikes, games that have random generated elements that power their gameplay systems. Add to that a large dollop of Dark Souls, which has an enthusiast genre of its own known as Masocore, masochism+hardcore, and you have quite an interesting formula, and one helluva game.
Dead Cells


What’s it about?
In Dead Cells, you play a collection of cells. A blob of sentient goo with one purpose, to escape this convoluted, ever-changing prison. After an experiment gone wrong, you take over the nearest dead host body, and have to keep killing other monsters to recover cells that are lost.
Story takes a backseat to a game that is all about its gameplay systems. Dead Cells thinks differently, which is not surprising, coming from Motion Twin, a small game studio that also thinks differently, and recently announced that they are an equal pay worker cooperative. This shows in every cell of Dead Cells.




How does it play?
Dead Cells is the most fun I have had in a side-scroller since Contra or Castlevania or even Metroid. These added subgenres just make this game all the more interesting and fun to play. Usually dying and starting over is perceived as a negative thing in games, but here it is the only way to progress. Every time you die, you may have to start at the beginning, but the entire dungeon has changed and new paths have opened up. The same goes for the weapons and powers you collect along the way. 
The action is definitely Dark Souls-like, with its rolling evasion and pattern-based enemies and bosses. It’s Souls-Lite though, a lot more enjoyable and less punishing. The best part though, is the action, which is satisfying. The quick sword slashes and the sheer amount of power-ups and weapons make you want to come back to the game again and again. Things do get a bit repetitive in a rinse-and-repeat way, but the developers have got the action right, making it the perfect game to play on-the-go. 
The retro pixel graphics and animations are superb and there is a lot on the screen at one time. From enemies exploding in globs of gore, to sparkles off the items and other particle effects, there is a lot going on, but it adds to the sheer energy of the game.
Should you get it?
Dead Cells is an addictive game that is best played in short bursts, and perfect if you have a laptop and want something quick. It’s great on the Nintendo Switch also, if you happen to own one.

Saturn’s moon could support life, says study
","Complex organic molecules have been discovered originating from one of Saturn’s moons, Enceladus, adding to its potential to support life, researchers said on Wednesday.
The Cassini spacecraft first flew close to the ice-covered moon in 2005 as part of a mission to gather data on Saturn that will be analysed for years to come.
A team led by Frank Postberg and Nozair Khawaja of the University of Heidelberg in Germany said they had identified fragments of large organic molecules in ice grains that were ejected from geysers through cracks in the moon’s icy exterior.
Their findings were published in the journal Nature. “It is the first ever detection of complex organics coming from an extraterrestrial waterworld,” Mr. Postberg was quoted as saying.
The Enceladus findings come after data earlier this month showed organic compounds on the surface of Mars and seasonal fluctuations of atmospheric methane, marking some of the strongest evidence ever that the earth’s neighbour may have harboured life. 
Cassini has previously detected lightweight organic molecules at Enceladus but the newly found fragments are much larger. Such large molecules can only be created by complex chemical processes including those related to life, ESA said. 
“This is the most recent in a long series of discoveries made by Cassini,” ESA added.

IGIB find ways to reduce TB’s tissue-damaging effects
"," It is generally believed that TB bacteria make the host cells accumulate triglyceride and become lipid-rich as bacteria prefer lipids for their nutrition. Now, using human macrophage cells researchers at the Institute of Genomic and Integrative Biology (CSIR-IGIB) have shown that when TB-infected macrophages undergo necrosis (where the cell ruptures when it dies) lipids and bacteria contained in the cells are released. The neighbouring cells — both healthy and TB-infected — take up the lipids thus leading to lipid accumulation.
“Our study brings a new facet to the way the field has been thinking about pathogenesis where it was believed that because the bacteria prefer lipids for their nutrition, they make the host cell become lipid-rich. Our work points to the relevance of the incident pathology — necrosis in a granuloma result in the development of lipid-rich foamy macrophages [presence of cells with large lipid-filled vacuoles],” says Dr. Sheetal Gandotra from the Cardio Respiratory Disease Biology Unit at IGIB and corresponding author of a paper published in the journal Frontiers in Immunology.
The ability to induce necrosis is peculiar to virulent TB bacteria. The avirulent Mycobacterium bovis strain used in BCG vaccine is unable to cause necrosis; it triggers a programmed cell death (apoptosis) instead. Like the BCG strain, TB mutants that lack the capacity to induce necrosis also lack the associated capacity to induce necrosis-induced triglyceride accumulation in neighbouring cells.
When macrophages encounter TB bacteria they mount an inflammatory response wherein certain factors are secreted to help recruit other cells of the immune system to kill the bacteria. “For the first time we reported that foamy macrophages showed more inflammatory response than normal macrophages,” says Dr. Neetika Jaisinghani from IGIB and first author of the paper. As a result of the inflammatory response more macrophages are recruited to the site of infection thus exposing them to infection.
“So it sets off a positive feed-forward loop such that the inflammatory response gets amplified,” says Dr. Gandotra.
To understand the role of excess lipids in host defence strategies, the researchers added uninfected necrotic cells to macrophages that were not infected with TB bacteria. Even these healthy macrophages stored lipids from the dying cells in the form of triglycerides. The macrophages were foamy but not infected. “These macrophages did not show any inflammation till such time they were infected with TB bacteria,” says Dr. Gandotra. 
Human blood monocyte-derived macrophages, too, showed increased inflammatory response when triglyceride accumulation was increased. Central to the storage of triglycerides in macrophages is the DGAT1 enzyme (diacylglycerol o-acyltransferase). When the DGAT1 gene is silenced in the macrophage cell lines, the macrophages’ ability to accumulate triglycerides is compromised.
“Our studies show that macrophages made to store triglyceride in response to necrosis are able to mount a higher level of the inflammatory response, and if we deplete the levels of the DGAT1 enzyme, the inflammatory response of these macrophages to infection is suppressed,” Dr. Gandotra says. “Inhibitors are available against this enzyme and we plan to undertake preclinical studies.”
While the ability of the host to inhibit TB infection might not be compromised, the tissue-damaging effects of inflammation may be reduced by inhibiting the ability of the macrophages to accumulate lipids. “The work brings out the importance of the role of host lipid metabolism in increasing inflammation by foamy cells during infection, thereby bringing metabolism into perspective as a potential target for TB therapy,” Dr. Gandotra says.
“Currently, all anti-TB drugs are antimicrobials and don’t help in improving the respiratory health of TB patients, which is compromised. We are hoping that our research may help in finding a promising target to reduce inflammation in TB patients,” says Dr. Jaisinghani.
The role of lipids in altering the immune state in non-infectious metabolic disorders such as obesity is well known. But this study for the very first time reports the role of triglyceride metabolism in altering the immune state during infection.

NASA prepares to extract data as Kepler runs very low on fuel
","Scientists at NASA are preparing to download the latest bit of data stored in its plant-hunting Kepler space telescope as the spacecraft is now running “very low” on fuel.
The US space agency has placed the spacecraft in a no-fuel-use safe mode to save the remaining fuel so that data extraction can be completed, NASA said on Friday.
On August 2, the Kepler team will command the spacecraft to awaken from its no-fuel-use state and manoeuvre the spacecraft to the correct orientation and downlink the data.
Once the data has been downloaded, the expectation is to start observations for the next campaign with any remaining fuel.
But as of now, returning the data back to Earth is the “highest priority” for the remaining fuel.
 
We've paused science observations for @NASAKepler to download recent science data after receiving an indication that the spacecraft is very low on fuel as expected. Our team is monitoring the fuel closely as we expect to run out in the next few months: https://t.co/rES0NHRsmP pic.twitter.com/kthrcEiwjb

Since May 12, Kepler has been on its 18th observation campaign, staring at a patch of sky towards the constellation of Cancer it previously studied in 2015.
The data from this second look will provide astronomers with an opportunity to confirm previous exoplanet candidates and discover new ones.
To bring the data home, the spacecraft must point its large antenna back to Earth and transmit the data during its allotted Deep Space Network time, which is scheduled in early August.
Until then, the spacecraft will remain stable and parked in a no-fuel-use safe mode.
If the manoeuvre and download are successful, the team will begin its 19th observation campaign on August 6 with the remaining fuel, NASA said, adding that it will provide an update after the scheduled download.
The US space agency has been monitoring the Kepler spacecraft closely for signs of low fuel for quite some time now, and expects it to run out of fuel in the next few months.
Launched in 2009, the Kepler mission is specifically designed to survey our region of the Milky Way galaxy to discover hundreds of Earth-size and smaller planets in or near the habitable zone and determine the fraction of the hundreds of billions of stars in our galaxy that might have such planets.
Among other findings, recently 24 new planet discoveries were made using data from the 10th observation campaign, adding to the spacecraft’s growing bounty of 2,650 confirmed planets.
The Kepler space telescope, which is now 94 million miles away from Earth, has survived many potential knock-outs during its nine years in flight, from mechanical failures to being blasted by cosmic rays.
In 2013, Kepler’s primary mission ended when a second reaction wheel broke, rendering it unable to hold its gaze steady at the original field of view.
The spacecraft was given a new lease on life by using the pressure of sunlight to maintain its pointing, like a kayak steering into the current.
Reborn as “K2,” this extended mission requires the spacecraft to shift its field of view to new portions of the sky roughly every three months in what scientists refer to as a “campaign.”
Initially, the Kepler team estimated that the K2 mission could conduct 10 campaigns with the remaining fuel.
It turns out scientists were overly conservative in their estimate. The mission has already completed 17 campaigns, and since May 12, Kepler has been on its 18th observation campaign.
But scientists now know that its life is coming to end very soon.
NASA in April launched another planet-hunting spacecraft, the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (Tess).
After the Kepler space telescope, Tess is the second spacecraft which will search for planets outside our solar system, including those that could support life.

Astronomers capture image of a planet’s birth ","Astronomers say they’ve captured the first confirmed image of a planet forming in the dust swirling around a young star. They said the planet appears as a bright spot in the snapshot taken using the European Southern Observatory’s Very Large Telescope in Chile. 
Miriam Kepler of the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy in Germany said hints of baby planets have been detected before, but astronomers weren’t sure whether those observations might simply be features in the swirling dust. In a paper to be published in Astronomy & Astrophysics, scientists describe the planet, located about three billion km from the star PDS 70, as a gas giant bigger than Jupiter. It has a cloudy atmosphere and a surface temperature of 1,000 degrees Celsius.

Oldest family tree built up from citizen science data
"," Columbia University researchers have identified a huge family tree spanning 11 generations based on data from a collaborative genealogy website. This is the largest single-family tree established so far. With 13 million people under its canopy, it is of the order of the population of Bengaluru. Though the researchers would need to go back 65 generations further to get the whole tree and converge on a single ancestor, the existing data is good enough to indicate some factors. By comparing each individual’s lifespan to that of their relatives, and looking at their degree of separation, they find that good longevity genes can extend a person’s lifespan by just 5%, indicating the slight role of genes in affecting lifespan.

Dell G7 7588 laptop: Stealth attack
"," 

A couple of years ago, the term ‘gaming laptop’ was better suited to marketing brochures than as part of a gamer’s daily set-up. That said, the advances in chip technology — which have enabled manufacturers to produce smaller processors which use less power and therefore produce less heat — have improved the amount of performance that can be crammed into a device that does not look and weigh as much as an average wardrobe. The biggest beneficiary of this trend has been, no prizes for guessing — the gaming laptop.
All this modern technical wizardry is in full display in Dell’s new G7 7588 gaming laptop, which complements the company’s Inspiron Gaming series, but brings in the added firepower of Intel’s 8th-generation processors.
On the outside
The G7 is clearly intended for the gamer with sophisticated taste. Our review unit came finished in white, with a sharp blue accent (there is also a black version available). The outer cover is all white, save for the blue Dell logo, while the keyboard and base are black, with the keys also getting a blue accent as well as blue backlighting. The backlight has only two brightness settings and no fancy lighting modes, and the only other indication of this laptop’s gaming credentials is the subtle marking on the W, A, S, and D keys. The trackpad has ample room and the small round power button also has a fingerprint sensor compatible with Windows Hello.
The G7’s 15.6-inch Full HD screen does not have touch support, and has a substantial amount of bezel, but the panel is a sharp IPS set-up with an anti-glare coating, which produces crisp images and very little colour shift. The back of the device has a couple of exhaust vents with a subtle blue accent within, as well as a G7 badge, and a small white light on the front indicates the laptop’s status.
The G7 is well-specced in the connectivity department too, with its left side housing the power input, card reader and USB port, while the right side gets two more USB ports, a Thunderbolt 3-capable USB-C port, a headphone jack and a full-size HDMI port.
A modern heart




Underneath the unassuming exterior, the G7 packs some of the latest hardware from the houses of Intel and Nvidia. The 8th-generation i7-8750H is from the six-core Coffee Lake family, making the G7 more than competent at handling demanding multi-core applications, which has been the Achilles Heel for laptops in the past. Add an Nvidia GTX 1060 with 6GB memory and an efficient Max-Q design, and you have a potent powerhouse, the results of which show in real-world scenarios as well. 
The G7 happily waltzed through everything we threw at it, making short work of some of today’s most demanding AAA titles, as well as multi-player games and less-optimised indie titles, while keeping temperatures within acceptable levels. The display is not a high-refresh rate affair, but we suspect that will not be a deal breaker for most. 




Who is it for?
At an asking price of ₹1,05,924, on Dell’s website (exclusive of taxes), the G7 technically undercuts the pricier version of the Inspiron Gaming line (which also has a GTX 1060 Max Q) by around ₹7,000, though the latter has a 256GB SSD out of the box, compared to 128GB on the G7. This, combined with the newer processor, makes the G7 ideal for performance-hungry gamers and anyone who works with resource-heavy applications, like video editors, who are also likely to appreciate the subtle design of the laptop. 




For more firepower, Dell also has a version of the laptop with a Core i9 8950HK processor, though we did not get to test that version. For those interested in gaming only, the 1060 Max Q Inspiron gaming with the last i7 generation processor is a good buy if it can be found cheaper, but at the current price point, the G7 is one of the lowest entry points for a GTX 1060-powered configuration, and the newer processor makes it an excellent value-for-money recommendation.

Japan firm to fly wedding plaques into space
","The sky is no longer the limit for lovers looking for unusual ways to commemorate their nuptials, with a Japanese company now offering to blast commemorative wedding plaques into space.
Warpspace, a start-up based in Tsukuba City outside Tokyo, is introducing the new service in partnership with a local hotel popular for wedding banquets.
For about 30,000 yen ($270), newly-weds marrying at the hotel will be able to emboss their names and design elements on 16-by-eight-millimetre titanium plates that will be loaded onto a tiny satellite. The satellite will be taken up to the International Space Station on a supply ship, and then released by astronauts.
Customers will receive photos of the craft carrying their plaques as it swirls among the stars, Warpspace chief executive Toshihiro Kameda said. “I want them to spread their happiness across the sky,” he said.

Go, Google, gone
"," ‘In India, we choose our career after becoming an engineer,’ reads a popular meme on digital media — and this applies to Apoorva Tiwari as well. A final year student of Electronics and Communication at Vidya Jyothi Institute of Technology, app development is her forte. This deviation from her academic branch concerned her parents initially, but Apoorva’s impressive academic progress didn’t clash with her coding interests. 
She was the only student from Hyderabad to have made it to the annual Google I/O conference, California this May. Thrilled to have shared stage with global leaders and developers, she says the opportunity helped her engage in fruitful discussions on building applications with Google and many open source platforms (Android, Chrome and Chrome OS, APIs, Google Web Toolkit, App Engine). 
Her entry was facilitated through an app development course by Udacity. A series of contests helped her bag a Google scholarship out of a 5000-member community. Commitment levels, participant camaraderie and development prowess were the criteria. “This course has been interesting. There were contests that judged our abilities on a daily basis, I felt thrilled to have made the cut,” Apoorva says. She calls the Google I/O conference an unforgettable experience, “It was great to interact with global leaders. Though the course had us engaging with hangout calls with them regularly, meeting them at the conference was special.”
 I want to create something that will help people at an individual level too, like helping people to battle depression; no current apps do a great job of it
Not everything at the conference was technical, she made friends with people from different countries; it was a learning curve. “We were introduced to various Google products. I aspire to be an Android developer and I wanted to understand nuances, drawbacks and market needs before I take the plunge. The Google staff made sure we had enough opportunities to break ice — a DJ night, a magic show, performances by a few international bands and a dinner with the Indian community. It helped us get to know each other better. It was nice talking to them about aspects that could enhance our career prospects.”
Did the course and programme play spoilsport with her college schedules? “Not really. I was in my final year, so it didn’t demand my presence at college on a regular basis.” The first girl in her family to have made an overseas trip, she wishes to put her app development lessons to make the world a better place — she has ideas of an app that will help identify trash in every area that has to be disposed. “I want to create something that will help people at an individual level too, like helping people to battle depression; no current apps do a great job of it,” she points out. 
For those aspiring to make it to future Google I/O conferences, she says, “Enrolling in many community programmes beyond college is necessary. It will give you a direction. One must focus on academics, but shouldn’t compromise on their true calling.” 
Apoorva, currently wrapping up her nanodegree course in app development hopes to a bag a job that will further her interests.

When Artificial Intelligence goes psycho ","No, it’s not a new horror film. It’s Norman: also known as the first psychopathic Artificial Intelligence, just unveiled by U.S. researchers.
The goal is to explain in layman’s terms how algorithms are made, and to make people aware of AI’s potential dangers.
Norman “represents a case study on the dangers of Artificial Intelligence gone wrong when biased data is used in machine learning algorithms,” according to the prestigious Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Pinar Yanardag, Manuel Cebrian and Iyad Rahwan, part of an MIT team, added: “There is a central idea in machine learning: the data you use to teach a machine learning algorithm can significantly influence its behaviour.” 
“So when we talk about AI algorithms being biased or unfair, the culprit is often not the algorithm itself, but the biased data that was fed to it,” they said via email.
Hence the idea of creating Norman, which was named after the psychopathic killer Norman Bates in the 1960 Alfred Hitchcock film Psycho.
Scary results
Norman was “fed” only with short legends describing images of “people dying” found on the Reddit internet platform. 
The researchers then submitted images of ink blots, as in the Rorschach psychological test, to determine what Norman was seeing and compare his answers to those of traditionally trained AI. The results are scary, to say the least: where traditional AI sees “two people standing close to each other,” Norman sees in the same spot of ink “a man who jumps out a window.” 
And when Norman distinguishes “a man shot to death by his screaming wife,” the other AI detects “a person holding an umbrella.”

An update for Apple users and more ","Flat-earthers, beware
I can’t find more than five people who dislike Neil deGrasse Tyson, but somehow, in the past 24 hours, that number has increased. The sassy astrophysicist has managed to tick off flat-earthers by giving a thumbs down to their beliefs in the latest instalment of his YouTube show, StarTalk, owing the falseness and ridicule of it all to a bad education system, coupled with the very-well-used freedom of speech.
In typical Tyson fashion, he introduces several pieces of evidence throughout history, be it from the time of the ancient Greeks or from far more recent research done by our fellows, adding, “That’s okay, as long as you don’t run NASA.”
Twitter, Tyson’s watering hole, was flooded with various opinions, most sarcastic. RealityCheck46 says, “I’m appalled that in the 21st century anyone would actually believe the earth is flat. Oh right, one of those alternative facts. #nonsense,” while user GenXMedia adds, “Well done. Too bad, the people who need this the most probably won’t see it or believe it.” I’m asking anyone out there with a friend or colleague who’s a flat-earther — show this to them, flood their messengers, spam their email inboxes, reverberate the facts in a verbal fashion until they don’t want to be friends with you any more... excessive?

IGIB team finds a new target to reverse iron overload disease ","Using zebrafish, researchers at the Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (CSIR-IGIB) have successfully discovered a pathway that regulates hepcidin hormone production. The hepcidin hormone, released by the liver, is a central regulator of iron in the body. Dysregulation of the hormone leads to anaemia on one hand and excess iron accumulation in organs such as liver and heart leading to multi-organ failure.
Hemochromatosis is a rare hereditary disease that is characterised by iron accumulation or overload in various tissues. The symptoms are non-specific and hence difficult to diagnose. Current options only manage the disease by removing excess iron. “One method is to bleed the patients and the other is to absorb iron using iron chelation, which is toxic to liver and kidney and may also cause hearing problems. There is no therapy currently available,” says Sandeep Basu from CSIR-IGIB and first author of a paper published in ACS Chemical Biology.
Mutations in about six genes are known to cause reduction in hepcidin hormone production thereby causing excess iron accumulation. But for the study, the research team led by Chetana Sachidanandan created a disease model in zebrafish (a fish exhibiting similar characteristics of the human disease) by mutating one of these genes (TFR2). Mutations in the TFR2 gene cause a severe form of the disease.
The zebrafish with the mutant gene showed excess iron accumulation in organs, quite similar to what is seen in humans.
In the conventional drug discovery approach, the target protein and even the pathway are already known and molecules that would either inhibit or overproduce the target protein are screened for. But the researchers adopted a different approach for this study.
“Hepcidin gene is controlled by many factors, many of them not well understood. So, instead of picking one target for our drug screen, we focused on the symptoms of the disease — excess accumulation of iron,” says Dr. Sachidanandan. “We knew that hepcidin hormone is low in the hemochromatosis patients, and that this causes iron overload.”
Since the researchers knew hepcidin production is regulated by many signalling pathways, they selected 80 compounds that specifically target signalling pathways in zebrafish. Of the 80 compounds tested, eight were found to induce the production of hepcidin hormone in the fish. “One of these compounds is a blocker of NFkB signalling pathway. This pathway was not known to be important in hepicidin regulation in the liver.” This is the first time that researchers have been able to identify and tell that the NFkB pathway regulates liver hepcidin production.
“It was not a blind screening, but rather we used our existing knowledge about hepcidin regulation. When we don’t have a deep understanding of a disease, but need to discover drug candidates, this kind of unbiased strategy is more efficient,” she says.
The researchers tested the ability of this compound to regulate hepcidin production. “The small molecule targets and inhibits the NFkB pathway signaling thus increasing hepcidin production and reducing iron overload,” says Basu. They tested three more compounds that target the same pathway to confirm that the NFkB pathway is indeed a key to regulating hepcidin production. “There are other signalling pathways that regulate hepcidin production but our discovery places NFkB pathway as an important negative hepcidin hormone production,” Basu says.
When the pathway in the zebrafish model of Hemochromatosis was inhibited using the four compounds, the hepcidin production was restored and iron overload was reduced, thus reducing the severity of the disease.
To further reconfirm the role of the NFkB pathway, the researchers removed it in zebrafish. This led to overproduction of hepcidin hormone in the fish, confirming that the pathway negatively regulates the production of the hormone.
None of the four compounds tested in zebrafish is approved for use in humans; one compound tested is approved for use in poultry. “The target pathway has been identified even though the tested compounds cannot be used as drugs. What is important is that we have found a strategy for therapy,” says Dr. Sachidanandan. “Now that we know the pathway to be targeted, it’s easier to discover drug molecules.”
“In India, Hemochromatosis is still not commonly seen, perhaps because of our underlying iron deficiency. But Thalassemia, is a serious problem where iron overload is very common. We are now working to see if we can apply this therapeutic strategy for Thalassemia patients,” Basu says.

‘New spinal surgery will cause less tissue damage’
","The new method, minimally invasive spine surgery (MISS), ensures less damage to the surrounding muscle, less pain and faster recovery after surgery, according to Dr. M.J. Naidu of Naidu Hospitals.
Sunshine Spine Centre director G.P.V. Subbaiah and M.J. Naidu Hospitals head M.J. Naidu jointly inaugurated the new centre for minimally invasive spine surgeries on Friday.
Explaining about the concept, Dr. Naidu said that spine surgeries were traditionally administered as open ones. In MISS there were no long incisions that involve significant damage to the muscles surrounding spine, he said.
The two hospitals have jointly launched ‘My Spine Centre’ here.
Open spine surgery was typically recommended only when non-surgical treatment — medication and physiotherapy — did not relieve pain and doctors were able to pinpoint exact source of pain.
MISS, however, is being used for a wider range of spinal procedures and some common procedures like decompression and spinal fusion.
In decompression, a portion of the bone was removed and in spinal fusion small bones (vertebrae) of the spine were fused.
The centre was being established to provide all medical services to the patients, Dr Naidu said.

'The Crew 2' review: Better than the original "," Much like the first Watch Dogs, The Crew had a fantastic premise. The thought of driving across an entire country, edge-to-edge, was ambitious, and to some extent The Crew delivered. Yet, it had a ham-handed story that was close in a revenge tone, the worst part of Watch Dogs too. While Watch Dogs 2 did reinvent itself in a lighter tone with success, The Crew 2 seems to take that same path, with mixed results.


What’s it about?
Think of The Crew 2 as a frankengame of sorts. The best parts of the most popular games out there cut down to their bits and pieces, in a development chopshop. Then assembled together into The Crew 2, then glossed over with a shiny coat of paint. This is not necessarily a bad thing; it actually makes The Crew 2 a lot better than its predecessor.
At its core, the game resembles the popular Forza Horizon series a lot more than the other games. With a lot of similarities to the latest Need for Speed Payback. There is a threadbare story connecting the dots, which has you select a driver and race to the top of the American motorsports food chain. The overtly happy-voice actors ham their way through all their voice lines, appropriately grating your nerves to dust, and making you just want to get the initial parts of the game over with and get to the racing.
How does it play?
The best part of The Crew 2 is the way it uses its ideas on the game world. In addition to driving, you can also fly a sports plane or drive a jet boat. Both of these handle really well. Using a mechanic called Fast Fav, the game actually lets you switch amongst your favourite plane, car or boat any time. What it also does neatly in the intro is the way that it uses the environment to bend cinematically, as the city folds like in Inception. The menus and interstitial loading graphics too are just plain rad. Just wish it carried that consistency throughout.
A racing game is as good as its racing, and The Crew 2 does not excel in that department. The cars, while they look appropriately gorgeous, feel heavy and weighed down, making it incredibly hard to control, especially with that handbrake that seems to work like a drift button. There’s no effortless flow into a corner drift, like Forza Horizon allows you to do — even though both share the arcade style controls with simulation-like looks. On the flip side though, offroading seems to work really well with these controls. The boat racing has great eye candy, but feels too slow and sluggish.




The same goes for the world. At some places, especially in the wild, open spaces, the detail is incredible. Grass moving in the wind and mountains in the distance, provide a picturesque setting to race in. In cities, it just feels like buildings are made of papier mache, with realistic roads. The water sequences are sublime, with every frame, desktop wallpaper-worthy. Add to that some spotty guides to mark out your race path, and you’ll be seeing that annoying ‘Wrong Way’ sign way too often.
The simple online component and the ability to just drive across the USA — experiencing glitzy Las Vegas to San Francisco to New York and everything in the middle — is undoubtedly the best part of the game, and quite the sublime experience. 
The Crew 2 is a fun game to play, especially if you want fun. Judging by Ubisoft’s dedication to constantly making The Division or Assassin’s Creed Origins fun, they will tweak and make The Crew 2 a lot better.
Should you get it?
The Crew 2 is leagues better than the first game, that is for certain, though it is quite far away from the leaders in the genre. If you are looking out for a fun car-racing game that splits into other genres of motorsports, then The Crew 2 will satisfy.

Folly of fake forwards
"," Fake forwards that are circulated every morning and shared a thousand times without any supporting facts or evidence is not a new practice in India. The Nipah Virus Havoc, Air India Free tickets scam and a lot more have been flashing on millions of phones. But what comes as a surprise is the increasing number of killings, mob deaths and lynching cases due to these forwards.
With over 200 million active users in India, exchanging messages every day on India’s popular messaging application, WhatsApp, it becomes difficult to pull out the source of these forwards. End to end encryption on the application makes it all the more difficult as no third party, including the company itself, has access to messages shared between two numbers. 
Long messages in English, Hindi and various regional languages are being circulated over WhatsApp in most of south India, including the states of Telangana, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Karnataka. During the last week of May, a man was abused by a mob over a WhatsApp forward where he was accused of being part of the ‘deadly Pardhi gang’.
Another message accompanied by a reportedly fake video of child abductors has been doing rounds that has cost lives all across the country. It started with two lynching cases in less than 24 hours in Jharkhand in 2017, and following cases of a supermarket clerk, an old woman, a 26-year-old youth, a transgender woman and two Assamese youth were beaten, thrashed or abused to death for being mistaken as child abductors from the fake videos, with no concrete proof during late May this year. 
Voice of youth
“The whole scenario is devastating and saddens me,” says Sanchita, who is pursuing Mass Communication in Bangalore. Sanchita Singh, the 19-year-old student believes that she, as a part of the young generation, understands how the internet works and how everything shared is not authentic, and simply ignores any forwards that involve accusations. 
“I think it’s important to cross check the information we share over any medium and mention a proper source to it. If people start taking law in their own hands over a few videos or messages shared that have no basis of authenticity, measures beyond ignorance have to be taken to cross verify and inform if the information is actually true”, she adds.
Anisha Rajasekar, a journalism student from Chennai has been added to a WhatsApp news group by her family members as they think it will help in her education. “I receive a lot of these forwards on the group, if I know that the news shared is fake or baseless, I make it a point to inform the person who has shared the message that it might be faux and request them to not forward it any further.” 
S Divya, who’s pursuing Bcom, puts forth a point about how the pictures and videos that are accompanied with these massages trigger people’s emotions. “Even people who are illiterate and cannot read might be triggered by the gore visuals that are presented on these fake videos, resulting in a larger audience being misled,” she adds.
“It’s the baby boomers who are easy trap for such news,” says Raghav Bherwani, a 19-year-old law student. It is the responsibility of youngsters to inform the older generation about how everything on the internet is not true, how these men might not actually be child abductors, how one doesn’t have to stop eating fruits because of Nipah virus and more, says Raghav.
“The public needs to let the legal system do its job and not motivate vigilante sayings like ‘if you want to see justice, you have to do it yourself’ because maybe a person is still innocent until proven guilty by a competent court,” he adds.

A look at the history of female video game protagonists "," They have been objectified, relegated to the background, been one-dimensional love interests and damsels in distress. The last few years, however, have seen a change in how women are depicted in video games. We decided to map the long route they took to reach the centre stage of interactive entertainment.
Suited beginnings
When Metroid first débuted in 1986, you got to fight space pirates and monsters as a hero in an androgynous space suit. In a master move by Nintendo, it was a surprise twist at the end that revealed that the character was female. Thus, Samus Aran became one of the first playable female heroes in the gaming world, and she continues to don her iconic suit and kick ass as a galactic hunter for hire to date.




Then came the stoic, strong and super-focused Chun Li, who made her début in Street Fighter II, as one of the first fast fighters. At the same time, Mortal Kombat gave us Sonya Blade. However, these two were just two characters in an ensemble. This would change with the arrival of Tomb Raider.
The Rise of the Tomb Raider
One of the most recognisable female characters in gaming today, Lara Croft was the de-facto sex symbol of the ‘90s. While the first few games were excellent, somehow her depiction was as more of an object than a strong-willed woman. This set in motion a chain reaction of using female protagonists as fuel for prepubescent gamers. The ‘90s, incidentally, also marked a rise in female antagonists, namely SHODAN from System Shock and Ultimecia from Final Fantasy VIII.
As gaming grew up with the times, so did the role of the central female characters. Jill Valentine of Resident Evil fame was one of the first heroes to emerge, as did Aya Brea, Yuna and Aerith from Squaresoft’s iconic games. Lara Croft’s popularity was still undeniably strong, with the character undergoing a successful reinvention. The reboots of the franchise over the last decade have changed our hero into a vulnerable, yet iron-willed individual with purpose, thrown into the dark and gritty world of relic hunting.
To the forefront
In the last few years, games with female protagonists have been etched in our memory. The Uncharted series, despite having an iconic male lead, made room for Elena, Chloe and Nadine to steal the show, with Chloe eventually taking the starring role in The Lost Legacy, widely accepted as one of the best Uncharted games. The traditionally male-dominated Assassin’s Creed also saw the stealthy style of Evie Frye used as a counterpoint to her brash brother in Assassin’s Creed Syndicate.
2017 saw Wonder Woman in theatres, but it also saw Aloy in Horizon Zero Dawn, breaking that stereotypical perfection heroines have to have. Her visual flaws did nothing to take away from her lovable character, great attitude, and excellent robot fighting skills. 




While they have been doing their fair share of shooting and slugging, female leads have been vehicles for some great emotional storytelling as well. The Last of Us let you play as Ellie, a small girl, as she makes her way across zombie-infested cities, surviving not only monsters, but all manner of madness. In the upcoming sequel, we see that she has grown into a formidable fighter, and in a beautiful narrative choice, identifies as gay. Max from Life is Strange is also a similar character, who takes players on a journey where several subjects from sexuality to suicide are maturely tackled.
Smarts and sass
Several games have chosen to go down a more stereotypical route, but have gone to great lengths to add depth to the characters. One example is Bayonetta, a sassy, sexy, fashionista witch, who wears clothes made of her own hair and prefers to accessorise with guns on her hands and feet. She occasionally breaks into over-the-top pole dancing moves, but is always a compelling character, who is not only strong but also highly individualistic, with a serious set of principles. From the same studio as Bayonetta, there is also Nier: Automata, featuring the blindfolded android 2B, a perfect woman made to make jaws drop. However, her personality constantly questions her very existence, making you stop and ponder this very ‘Ghost in the Shell’-like existence and the perversion of creation in her world.




Identify yourself
The upcoming Assassin’s Creed Odyssey lets you choose your own sex, with both sides properly voiced and fleshed out, a trend that was previously reserved for massively multi-player online games and role-playing games.
While we would love to see more games starring characters like Ellie, 2B or Aloy, the prospect of choosing what sex we want to play as or identify with, is refreshing, and takes the experience in a body positive direction, where we have female role models our sons and daughters can respect. After all, it is them who will be playing these games.

Mars may have hosted life before earth
"," The crust that encases rocky planets and makes possible the emergence of life took shape on Mars earlier than thought and at least 100 million years sooner than on Earth, researchers said on June 27. 
Analysing grains of the mineral zircon extracted from a Martian meteorite known as Black Beauty, they determined that the Red Planet’s outer layer hardened 4.547 billion years ago, only 20 million years after the birth of the Sun.
“Mars’s primary crust formation — which is the end product of planet formation — happened much faster than previously thought,” said Martin Bizzarro, a scientist at Denmark’s Centre for Star and Planet Formation and senior author of a study published in Nature. “Our results indicate that Mars could have had an environment with oceans, and potentially life, much earlier than Earth,” he told AFP. 
Water is considered to be an essential precursor for life, at least as we know it. Mars was once much more Earth-like, with a thick atmosphere, abundant water and global oceans. Up to now, mathematical models have suggested that the solidification of the Red Planet took up to 100 million years. The new study tackles the question by examining a chunk of Mars that streaked into the Saharan Desert and was discovered in 2011.
The Black Beauty meteorite weighed 320g when found. The researchers secured 44g of the precious space rock, and crushed five — enough to extract seven bits of zircon that could be used in experiments. By measuring the lead decaying from uranium that had been trapped in zircon as the young Mars’s molten magma hardened, the scientists were able to precisely date the crust from which the zircon formed.
“I’m glad we chose that strategy,” said Mr. Bizzarro. “Zircon is like a time capsule.”
There are two main models for the formation of planets. 
In one, it occurs in stages, with small dust particles coalescing into “planetesimals” — rock fragments ten to 100 km in diameter — that collide to form planetary embryos, and then planets, over a time scale of 50 to 100 million years. 
According to a more recent model, planetary growth unfolds more quickly and is fuelled by so-called “pebble accretion”, the layered accumulation of particles measured in centimetres and metres that are loosely bound with gases.
“Our data supports newer models indicating the very rapid formation of terrestrial planets,” the authors said.
The new timeline suggests that something similar may have happened on our planet, but only after Earth was “reset” by the giant impact that formed the Moon about 4.4 billion years ago, Mr. Bizzarro said. 
Mars is thought to have a dense metallic core with a radius of about 1,800 km, consisting primarily of iron, nickel and sulphur. The core is surrounded by a largely dormant mantle — some 1,500 km thick — made mainly of silicon, oxygen, iron and magnesium. 
Finally, the crust averages about 50 km in depth, with a maximum of about 125 km. Earth’s crust averages 40 km, but is one-third the thickness of the Martian crust once planet size is taken into account.

'Octopath Traveler' review: Brand new retro
"," The Japanese Role-Playing Game has been reinvented in several ways. From the open-world extravaganza of Final Fantasy XV and Ni No Kuni, to the high school social simulator slash dungeon crawler of Persona 5. Several games have stayed true to the formula and expanded those familiar turn-based battles into some incredible stories with superb world building. Though there is a special place in our collective hearts for the retro JRPG and the days of the Super Nintendo. Something along the lines of Chrono Trigger, Final Fantasy VI, has stayed to this day with their amazing level of storytelling in the form of games like To the Moon and Undertale — which is exactly where Octopath Traveler lies, the latest JRPG from veterans Square Enix.


What’s it about?
As the title suggests, Octopath Traveler is eight stories, told from the perspectives of eight strangers from across the land, as they come together. Much like Dragon Age: Origins, you start off the game as one of these characters and experience the world through their eyes and their stories, as they meet the other characters along the way. Rather than tell one overarching story of good souls versus some dark lord, Octopath instead transcends this, telling separate stories that masterfully intertwine.




While each character’s story is quite humdrum with its moments, it’s the presentation and combat that make you want to replay the game from another character’s perspective. You can choose from Ophelia a cleric, Cyrus the scholar, the merchant Tressa, Olberic a warrior, the beautiful dancer Primrose, Alfyn the apothecary, Therion the Thief and H’aanit the hunter. Each of their stories functions as a whole, and while the stories are quite expected, they are entertaining. The best part is, once you finish one character’s journey, you really do want to spend time experiencing the world through the perspectives of the other characters.
How does it play?
Each character has a unique ‘job’ which in most games is ignored, save for battle. In Octopath, each of the characters has path abilities that help them through the story. Like Alfyn and Cyrus can glean important information. Primrose can bewitch and charm NPCs, while Therion can steal from them. You will constantly use these abilities in the world, as well as in battle.




One of the best parts of Octopath Traveler, that will keep you coming back for more, is the battle system. These too make use of characters’ abilities, like H’aanit can recruit wild animals and use them in battle, while Olberic challenges NPCs to duals, allowing you to fight them for experience. In addition to that, Octopath adds a layer of strategy across the well-oiled bones of the familiar turn-based battle system paradigm. 
With a risk/reward boost system that allows you to save up an attack boost point per turn, allowing you to unleash large attacks or healing abilities, if you’ve saved them up. Battle is so much fun and Octopath throws some fiendish enemies your way, to strategically dispatch off, perfect for the Switch.
Octopath Traveler is a beautiful-looking game. Taking the top-down perspective and pixel art of JRPGs and transforming it into a 3D game. So the textures are actually pixel art, yet the game moves and scales effortlessly. While there’s a prevalent tilt shift blur around the edges, allowing for sparkling bokeh of sunlight shimmering off a distant water body. The lighting effects are nothing short of sublime. While the entire ambience of the game is wonderfully down-to-earth fantasy, rather than something straight out of The Lord of the Rings. 
Should you get it?
The Nintendo Switch has finally got a role-playing game worth playing. Taking that spirit of Super Nintendo JRPGs and transforming it into something worthy of any modern RPG that you can octo-replay.

Watch: Origami-inspired underwater trap helps study delicate marine creatures
","Studying soft-bodied deep sea creatures like jellyfish and squid have been a difficult task for marine biologists as existing underwater tools cause damage or even kill them.
Now, researchers from Harvard University’s Wyss Institute have developed an origami-inspired sampler using folding polyhedral sides that can trap deep sea soft creatures without causing them any harm. The research was recently published in Science Robotics.
 

 
“Origami, the Japanese art of folding, is used as an inspiration to help us build 3D objects from 2D sheets.We have developed a way to fold 3D shapes from its 2D net using only one actuator [component responsible for movement],” explains Dr. Zhi Ern Teoh from the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences at Harvard University in an email to The Hindu. “Minimizing the number of actuators is key because incorporating actuators is a relatively more complex engineering task and you have to figure out ways of attaching, powering, sensing and coordinating the folds. Therefore even though the system of linkages looks more complex, it consists entirely of revolute joints which are mechanically much simpler.”
The device — named Rotary Actuated Dodecahedron (RAD) — can be attached to any remotely operated vehicle (ROV). The pilot of the ROV uses cameras to position the sampler near a sea creature of interest and then tells the operator of the sampler to close the sampler, entrapping the creature. The device was tested in the open ocean at a depth of 1,600 to 2,300 ft and the researchers say that it can be modified to withstand higher pressures at increasing depths.
“We approach these animals as if they are works of art: would we cut pieces out of the Mona Lisa to study it? No – we’d use the most innovative tools available. These deep-sea organisms, some being thousands of years old, deserve to be treated with a similar gentleness when we’re interacting with them,” adds collaborating author David Gruber from City University of New York in a release. “We’d like to add cameras and sensors to the sampler so that, in the future, we can capture an animal, collect lots of data about it like its size, material properties, and even its genome, and then let it go, almost like an underwater alien abduction.”

The way forward for Citizen Science
","“Citizen science in India is still in its infancy, but it is the way forward,” says Mohammed Dilawar who runs the Common Bird Monitoring of India, programme from Nashik. This programme, started in 2012, now has over 2,000 citizens, from 34 states, involved in observing and making notes about the common birds in their locality. The organisation is now in talks with Wildlife Institute of India to validate the data using statistical tools.
While it is not new that amateur scientists have made scientific observations that mattered, Internet usage and the ensuing possibility of involving huge numbers of citizens in data collection and analysis is relatively new in India. Mr Dilawar’s belief that Citizen Science (CS) is the way forward is echoed by the scenario in the West, for instance, where the situation is quite mature. CS initiatives like Zooniverse, eBird, etc, have participation that runs into tens of thousands, and what’s more, the databases built up by these have found their way into numerous peer-reviewed publications.
In an article published in the journal Science in April, authors Rick Bonney, Jennifer L. Shirk, Tina B. Phillips et al discuss this phenomenon and outline a future course for CS initiatives. Expressing the desire that the term citizen science, regardless of size of the project, will grow to refer to those programmes that truly do science, they emphasise the importance of developers employing “sound research or monitoring design.” This cannot be overemphasised in a climate where critiques of CS are many times based on the contention that untrained personnel cannot come up with data that is of the quality equal to that obtained by professionals.
There is a recent instance where this contention has been proved wrong. Studies involving monitoring of sharks have shown that quality of data collected by citizen scientists can be as reliable as that collected using automated tools (Gabriel Vianna, PLOS ONE, April 23). This is just one instance, and increasingly, Citizen Science initiatives are being treated with the seriousness due to scientific study.
Meanwhile, Bonney, Shirk, Phillips et al stress upon the importance of organising existing CS projects for maximum impact. Project redundancy and repetition being a danger of such large projects, project developers could “adapt, adopt or collaborate with already-proven projects.” They also suggest that developers can look at new possibilities and opportunities for data collection, for instance during natural and manmade disasters, such as oil spills, wild fires or earthquakes. They moot the important idea of networking CS projects around the world so that the research can contribute to a better understanding of phenomena like climate change.
But in India, where the numbers are still small and this concept is yet to catch on, there are obstacles still. While technology need not pose a problem anymore given the ubiquity of mobile apps and even the Internet, there are practical difficulties.
“Sometimes, some scientists like to mark out certain species and areas as their domain. Citizen Science will neutralise this monopoly,” says Mohammed Dilawar. According to him, while a collaboration with larger CS projects worldwide is welcome, the projects should also retain the local nature to some extent to be beneficial in inculcating in the people the culture of doing science.

WhatsApp sharing limited data with Facebook on payment feature
"," Popular messaging app WhatsApp has claimed it shares limited data of payment service with its parent firm Facebook and the social media major does not use the information for commercial purpose.
“Facebook does not use WhatsApp payment information for commercial purposes, it simply helps pass the necessary payment information to the bank partner and NPCI(National Payment Corporation of India). In some cases, we may share limited data to help provide customer support to you or keep payments safe and secure,” WhatsApp claimed on its website. WhatsApp is running beta version of its payment service in India. 
According to government sources, the Ministry of Electronics and IT has written to National Payment Corporation of India to verify compliance around WhatsApp payment and check if WhatsApp is sharing data with its parent firm Facebook.
 The ministry has asked NPCI to verify compliance of WhatsApp payment it scales up its service. 
WhatsApp on its website said that when a user makes a payment, the mobile messaging app creates the necessary connection between the sender and recipient of the payment, using Facebook infrastructure. 
“We pass the transaction information to the bank partner, which is called a PSP (payment service provider), and to NPCI (National Payment Corporation of India), so they can facilitate the movement of funds between the sender’s and receiver’s bank accounts,” the website said.
When contacted, WhatsApp spokesperson said, Facebook processes UPI (Unified Payments Interface) transaction data as a service provider for WhatsApp, and does not use WhatsApp payments transaction data for commercial purposes. 
The IT ministry has expressed concern around data safety Facebook users in India following data leak from its platform to Cambridge Analytica. The ministry on June 7 again issued to Facebook seeking explanation on reports that it shared information of users with mobile device makers. WhatsApp claimed that it also does not store any sensitive payment information such as one-time password send for the transaction, account number or full debit card details. 
“Today, almost 1 million people are testing WhatsApp payments in India. The feedback has been very positive. People enjoy the convenience of sending money as simply and securely as they send messages. We’re working closely with NPCI and multiple banks including our payment service providers to expand the feature to more people and support India’s digital economy,” the spokesperson said.

Pigment in Goa mushroom may help fight cancer
","The mycological laboratory of the Department of Botany, Goa University on Wednesday reported the discovery of a new pigment from local wild mushrooms.
“We are proud to report a new suphur-rich melanin biopigment of immense bioindustrial, biomedical (anti-cancer, anti-tumour) and biotechnological potential from local Roen alamis (wild variety of Goan mushrooms that grows on termite hills) or Termitomyces species,” said Dr. Nandakumar Kamat, Assistant Professor of Botany, department of Goa University here on Wednesday.
“Our paper was published on July 9 in Mycology: International Journal Of Fungal Biology affiliated to Mycological Society of China, and published by Taylor and Francis, U.S.. This discovery shows the chemical nature of the brown or black colour that you see in these wild edible mushrooms,” explained Dr. Kamat, with more than two decades of research experience on mushrooms.
Dr. Kamat said that his Ph.D student, Rosy de Souza, who is a national scholar under DST INSPIRE, cracked the problem in three years, which had eluded scientific community from 40 countries for the past 100 years. 
“More than 50 teams are working on these mushrooms, globally, but we in Goa got the lead now. People of Goa who consume these mushrooms are actually eating sulphur-rich melanin. We declare it as world’s first sulphur-rich edible melanin. Its structure is similar to black pigment found in human hair,” said an excited Dr. Kamat. 
He said that the Chinese editors of their paper have advised them to continue their research on this pigment.

Madurai ryot hits bumper crop
","Amidst sob stories of crop failure from farmers and signs of an impending drought, a Madurai farmer has blended ingenuity with scientific techniques to produce a bumper harvest.
While the yield per hectare in the past in Madurai’s rural areas was not more than 10 tonnes, S. Sethumadhavan, a farmer in Alanganallur near here, has harvested a record yield of 24 tonnes of paddy per hectare — highest in the State.
Taking to farming 15 years ago, Sethumadhavan, from what he says, has mastered the techniques that have come with the introduction of System of Rice Intensification (SRI) over the past few years.
Here is his secret: as a part of the SRI, he used the CR 1009 variety of paddy seeds. First, he got the soil in his land tested and adopted the best-suited practices to maximise yield. The planting of ‘Daincha’ as a green manure crop, before sowing seeds, added to the soil quality.
“Instead of limiting to one type of fertilizer, a mix of organic and chemical fertilizers was used. Then, the use of simple machinery such as the kono-weeder helped me increase the yield three fold,” Mr. Sethumadhavan says.
When he told the Agriculture Department officials that he wanted to participate in the competition for high yield, they guided him about the use of technology, type of seeds and techniques to be followed.
“Selection and testing of soil are extremely important if farmers want to maximise their yield,” says R. Sridhar, an agriculture officer who guided the farmer . “Though the region has a lot of wells and the farmer had copious water supply, it was effective water management that contributed to the high yield,” the officer says.
“The yield is the highest in the State,” Jaisingh Gnanadurai, Joint Director, Agriculture, announced on Thursday. Proper handling of the over 10 techniques that encompass SRI proved highly beneficial , said R.M. Lakshmanan, assistant director, Agriculture, Alanganallur.
It can be recalled that Periasamy Solaimalai, a farmer from Madurai, bagged the “Krishi Karman” award in 2013 for a yield of more than 20 tonnes of paddy per hectare. Knowing well that his was a success story, Mr. Sethumadhavan says, “I’m confident of winning a national award.”

Scientists confirm Einstein's supermassive black hole theory ","A team of international scientists observing a star in the Milky Way have for the first time confirmed Einstein's predictions of what happens to the motion of a star passing close to a supermassive black hole.
Einstein's 100-year-old general theory of relativity predicted that light from stars would be stretched to longer wavelengths by the extreme gravitational field of a black hole, and the star would appear redder, an effect known as gravitational red shift.
“This was the first time we could test directly Einstein's theory of general relativity near a supermassive black hole,” Frank Eisenhauer, senior astronomer at the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics, told journalists. “At the time of Einstein, he could not think or dream of what we are showing today.”
A team of scientists at the European Southern Observatory started monitoring the central area of the Milky Way using its Very Large Telescope to observe the motion of stars near the supermassive black hole 26 years ago. The black hole is 26,000 light years away from Earth and has a mass 4 million times that of the Sun. The scientists selected one star, S2, to follow. With an orbit of 16 years, they knew it would return close to the black hole in 2018.
Over 20 years, the accuracy of their instruments has improved and so in May 2018, they were able to take extremely precise measurements in conjunction with scientists from around the world.
This showed the star's orbital velocity increasing to more than 25 million kph (15.5 million mph) as it approached the black hole. The star's wavelength stretched as it sought to escape the gravitational pull of the supermassive black hole, shifting its appearance from blue to red, Odele Straub from the Paris Observatory said. The scientists now hope to observe other theories of black hole physics, she said.
“This is the first step on a long road that the team has done over many years and which we hope to continue in the next years,” Reinhard Genzel, who led the international team, said.

Kolkata Museum celebrates early tool-makers of T.N., A.P.
","One of the earliest stone tools from the region, discovered by Robert Bruce Foote almost 150 years ago from various sites of Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh, have been put on display for the first time at the Indian Museum in Kolkata.
“Forty-two stone tools, which include hand axes, scrapers, mullers, corn crushers, pounders and celt, are being displayed at the Indian Museum’s temporary exhibition room. These tools, discovered by Foote, are the first technology developed by hominoids for sustenance as hunter gatherers,” Indian Museum director Rajesh Purohit said.
While a large number of the tools collected by Foote, considered the ‘Father of Indian Prehistory’, is with the Madras Government Museum, about 200 stone tools are in the collection of Indian Museum, which is the oldest in Asia.
The exhibition sought to highlight that the tool-making technology of the prehistoric times was one of the oldest in the world, Dr. Purohit added.
He referred to recent research publications by archaeologist Shanti Pappu, which established that tools discovered at Attirampakkam in Tamil Nadu and the adjoining areas, used by the Palaeolithic population, could be dated to 1.5 million years ago.




There is also an interesting story as to how the tools landed in Kolkata, almost 1,600 km from Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh, where they were discovered.
Professor K. Paddayya of Deccan College, who inaugurated the exhibition, said Foote came to India in 1858 as an assistant geologist with the Geological Survey of India (GSI).
It was during his visit to Kolkata to meet his superior, Thomas Oldham, who was heading the GSI then, that Foote brought these stone tools to Kolkata.
The first tool, a hand axe was found on May 30, 1863, from the Parade Ground at Pallavaram in Chennai. The discovery led Oldham to announce at a meeting of the Asiatic Society in August 1864 that his colleague had discovered stone implements from the prehistoric times from Tamil Nadu, Prof Paddayya recalled.
“These are the stone tools which Robert Bruce Foot took to Vienna from Calcutta in 1873 and they were displayed at an international exhibition of science and scientific instruments,” said Prof. Paddayya, who has done extensive research on the Palaeolithic and Neolithic cultures.




Authorities at the Indian Museum, after a painstaking search of their collection, confirmed that the GSI had donated these stone implements, discovered in batches in 1883.
Sayan Bhattacharya, education officer, said that along with the exhibition, the Museum also organised a stone tool making workshop by Aviek Biswas, a fellow at the Centre for Archaeological Studies and Training.
The workshop not only demonstrated techniques of tool-making but also explained to the participants the importance of these stone tools.

China aims to outstrip NASA with super-powerful rocket
","China is working on a super-powerful rocket that would be capable of delivering heavier payloads into low orbit than NASA, a leading Chinese space expert was quoted as saying on Monday.
By 2030, the Long March-9 rocket under development will be able to carry 140 tonnes into low-Earth orbit — where TV and earth observation satellites currently fly — said Long Lehao, a senior official from the Chinese Academy of Engineering, according to the official Xinhua news agency.
This compares to the 20 tonnes deliverable by Europe’s Ariane 5 rocket or the 64 tonnes by Elon Musk’s Falcon Heavy, which in February catapulted one of the US entrepreneur’s red Tesla Roadster cars towards Mars.
It would also outstrip the 130 tonnes of NASA’s Space Launch System, which is due to become operational in 2020.
China’s Long March-9 would have a core stage measuring 10 metres in diameter and boast four powerful boosters, each with a diameter of five metres.
Xinhua quoted Long as saying the rocket could be used in manned lunar landings, deep space exploration or constructing a space-based solar power plant.
In addition, China is working on a reusable space rocket, which is expected to make its maiden flight in 2021. The first stage and the boosters will be retrieved after a vertical landing, Long said in a speech in Beijing.
China is pouring billions into its military-run space programme, with hopes of having a crewed space station by 2022, and of sending humans to the Moon in the near future.
The Asian superpower is looking to finally catch up with the U.S. and Russia after years of belatedly matching their space milestones.
China is also planning to build a base on the moon, the state-run Global Times said in early March, citing the Communist Party chief of the China Academy of Space Technology.

Underground lake detected on Mars ","Using a radar instrument on an orbiting spacecraft, scientists have spotted what they said on Wednesday appears to be a sizeable salt-laden lake under ice on the southern polar plain of Mars, a body of water they called a possible habitat for microbial life.
The reservoir they detected — roughly 20 km in diameter, shaped like a rounded triangle and located about 1.5 km beneath the ice surface — represents the first stable body of liquid water ever found on Mars.
Whether anywhere other than Earth has harboured life is one of the supreme questions in science, and the new findings offer tantalizing evidence, though no proof. Water is considered a fundamental ingredient for life.
The researchers said it could take years to verify whether something is actually living in this body of water that resembles a subglacial lake on Earth, perhaps with a future mission drilling through the ice to sample the water below.
“This is the place on Mars where you have something that most resembles a habitat, a place where life could subsist,” said planetary scientist Roberto Orosei of Istituto Nazionale di Astrofisica in Italy, who led the research published in the journal Science.
“This kind of environment is not exactly your ideal vacation, or a place where fish would swim,” Orosei added. “But there are terrestrial organisms that can survive and thrive, in fact, in similar environments. There are microorganisms on Earth that are capable of surviving even in ice.”
The detection was made using data collected between May 2012 and December 2015 by an instrument aboard the European Space Agency's Mars Express spacecraft that transmits radar pulses, which penetrate the Martian surface and ice caps.
“This took us long years of data analysis and struggles to find a good method to be sure that what we were observing was unambiguously liquid water,” said study co-author Enrico Flamini, chief scientist at the Italian Space Agency during the research.
The location's radar profile resembled that of subglacial lakes found beneath Earth's Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets.
Mars long ago was warmer and wetter, possessing significant bodies of water, as evidenced by dry lake beds and river valleys on its surface. There had been some signs of liquid water currently on Mars, including disputed evidence of water activity on Martian slopes, but not stable bodies of water.
Orosei said the water in the Martian lake was below the normal freezing point but remained liquid thanks in large part to high levels of salts. Orosei estimated the water temperature at somewhere between 14 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 10 degrees Celsius) and minus 94 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 70 degrees Celsius).
It remains to be seen if more subsurface reservoirs of water will be found or whether the newly discovered one is some sort of quirk, Orosei said.
If others are detected and a network of subglacial lakes exists like on Earth, he said, that could indicate liquid water has persisted for millions of years or even dating back to 3-1/2 billion years ago when Mars was a more hospitable planet.
The question would be, Orosei added, whether any life forms that could have evolved long ago on Mars have found a way to survive until now.
“Nobody dares to propose that there could be any more complex life form,” Orosei said.

Street Fighter Anniversary collection review: Back to the streets
"," Any kid growing up anywhere in the world in the 80s and 90s will fondly remember going to the arcades. Referred to by parents as havens of sin, for us we saw it as an escape into the fight clubs where we could test our mettle. One of those games that allowed us to do so was Street Fighter, a game that we challenged and were challenged by others. It’s been 30 years of the fighting game and it’s still going strong. To mark this, Capcom has launched a special collection of all the past Street Fighters.
What’s it about?
Street Fighter is a one-on-one fighting game, one of the games that made the genre so popular, that today it’s a serious competitive e-sport. Featuring iconic characters like Ken, Ryu, Chun-Li, Guile, Akuma, over the years the roster has expanded and evolved, introducing newer characters.
This collection of classic Street Fighter games has the very first game right upto Street Fighter III. That includes each sequel’s sub games, in all its glory. Also included is the excellent Street Fighter Alpha series, with Alpha I, II and III.
How does it play?
The 30th Anniversary Collection is loaded with nostalgic goodness. Capcom has put the games in their entirety, as they appeared on the Arcades. You can choose to play it in 4:3 screen aspect ratio, which was popular then, or you can choose to stretch it across the 16:9 ratios of today, which is not advisable, since it stretches the onscreen fighters. The best part though, is that you can turn on an arcade mode that includes the scanlines and coloration of those old CRT displays.
The Switch edition, especially, is worth noting, so you can take the fight on the go. It makes the most sense, especially when you’re docked to the console. Though the Xbox and PlayStation controllers are better for ergonomics. You can not only play against someone the usual two-controller way, but you can also connect online with some of the games and play against people across the world. Not only that, you can play on a local network on the Switch.
Should you get it?
If you love Street Fighter, and want to relive your arcade days, then look no further than the 30th Anniversary Collectors edition. It’s after all, twelve whole games in one.

TIFR researchers show how liver regulates outflow of fat
"," A grammar textbook example of a pun is the sentence “Life depends on the liver”. Indeed, the liver is a very important organ in the body since it regulates the metabolism of, among other things, fat in the form of lipid droplets.
Lipid droplets accumulate in the liver during “fasting, as in during sleep. Yet, the liver controls the release of these lipid droplets into the blood, thereby preventing excessive deposition of very low density lipids (VLDL) into the blood stream which could lead to heart disease. While this role of the liver is well known, the question of how it happens has not been addressed until recently. This question was taken up by Roop Mallik’s group at the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Mumbai.
In a paper published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, US (PNAS), the researchers led by Dr Mallik show that the motor protein kinesin transports lipid droplets to the endoplasmic reticulum within the liver cells, from where it is secreted into the blood. During fasting, kinesin is removed from the lipid droplets, and this ensures they do not reach the endoplasmic reticulum, nor are they secreted into the blood. This tempers the secretion of lipids from the liver during fasting and protects the organs.
In their first experiment, the group of researchers extracted lipid droplets from cells and watched them move in a test tube. There they found that when they added specific compounds that blocked the motor protein kinesin, the droplets stopped moving. “This is how we found for the first time that kinesin is a key factor,” says Dr Mallik. They published these results in the journal Nature Methods. Following this study, they experimented with rats and found the connection between regulation of lipid transport within the liver cells and that of the motor protein kinesin.
Reactive droplets
They found that the protein ARF1 (ADP-ribosylation factor 1) increased the breakdown of fats in the lipid droplets. It binds to the droplets and pinches off phospholipid molecules from their surface, thereby increasing their surface tension. This makes the droplets “reactive” and they interact more strongly with the endoplasmic reticulum. “We showed that high insulin in the fed state causes both ARF1 and kinesin to bind together to lipid droplets. This means that reactive droplets will be selectively transported to the smooth endoplasmic reticulum at the periphery of liver cells,” says Dr Mallik. Because of this, the reactive droplets can interact with the smooth endoplasmic reticulum and supply fat for the assembly of VLDL particles inside the endoplasmic reticulum. “These fatty VLDL particles will be subsequently secreted out from the liver into blood, and the fat inside will be used up in other tissues of the body to generate energy,” he explains. 
The research is relevant in times when heart disease, for instance, is such a common ailment, also aggravated by faulty diets. Revealing plans for the future, Dr Malik says, “We hope to find molecules which can change the affinity of kinesin to lipid droplets. These molecules are potential drugs that reduce fat secretion from the liver and therefore reduce the amount of fat circulating around in blood. This fat is a major cause of heart disease, diabetes and obesity.”

More than 1,000 gene variants linked to educational attainment identified
","Scientists have identified nearly 1,300 genetic variants associated with how much education someone may complete – far more than the 74 variants initially discovered in a smaller study two years ago.
The research, published in the journal Nature Genetics, is one of the largest genetics studies to date. It is based on genetic information from over one million individuals with European ancestries – more than three times the size of the 2016 study.
The total influence of the genetic variants is small, explaining about four per cent of the variation in educational attainment across individuals, the scientists said. They found that genetic variants on the X chromosome explain virtually identical amounts of variation in men and women. This finding lends support to the hypothesis that there are no genetically based sex differences in the amount of variation in educational attainment, the researchers said.
“Even variants with the largest effects predict, on average, only about three more weeks of schooling in those who have those variants compared to those who don’t,” said Daniel Benjamin, an associate professor at the University of Southern California in the US. “Yet when we analyse the combined effects of many genetic variants, taken together they can predict the length of a person’s formal education as well as demographic factors,” Benjamin said.
Scientists have known for many years that demographic factors are associated with educational attainment, including household income and maternal education.
To assess the importance of the gene variants in educational attainment, the scientists established a “polygenic score” that captures the predictive power of a combined one million genetic variants – including those specifically linked to educational attainment and the other remaining variants that the scientists had measured across the genome. The scientists found that the predictive power of the score is as large as that of demographic factors.
“The very small effects of individual genetic variants confirms what we have seen in our earlier work, and it’s an important finding in itself,” Benjamin said. “It would be completely misleading to characterise our results as identifying ‘genes for education.’ Yet the polygenic score is useful for research because it combines the effects of a very large number of genetic variants,” he said.
For the latest study, the scientists analysed a combined 71 data sets comprising over 1.1 million participants with European ancestry from 15 different countries and who were at least 30 years old. Educational attainment is primarily influenced by environmental and social factors, but it is also influenced by genes associated with, for example, cognitive function such as memory and personality traits such as conscientiousness.
“We found that many of the genes associated with educational attainment are influential in virtually all stages of brain development and in neural communication within the brain, said Peter Visscher, a professor at the University of Queensland in Australia.

Apping up Amit
"," Amitraj is a typical Bengalurean entrepreneur. Amitraj is also fictional, and someone I have made up for this column by agglutinating the personalities of some half a dozen people I know running startups in Bengaluru. 
Amit is a name used by many South Indians, especially those active on social media, to poke gentle fun at the North Indian stereotype of someone clueless about the non-Hindi environment he lives in. But do not let the Amit in the name of my made-up entrepreneur fool you. Amitraj is the best sort of Bengalurean entrepreneur there is. He can converse in half a dozen tongues. And because he can, he is constantly engaging in conversations with everyone he meets in the course of his daily life in Bengaluru.
His day sometimes starts with realising that he has run out of toothpaste. But hey, he is a startup guy. He immediately opens an app that will run tasks for him such as buying a tube of toothpaste at a kirana store nearby and then schlepping it to his doorstep. Amitraj is waiting eagerly. The eagerness is as much for the toothpaste as it is for engaging in small talk with the delivery guy who will bring the toothpaste to him. When he comes, Amitraj asks him about how the job is, what he likes about the job, what he does not. He tut-tuts along with the delivery guy when he cribs about how people just use him these days to get booze delivered and not important things like toothpaste. He sends the delivery guy off with a generous tip and much goodwill.
Shiny-toothed, and otherwise freshened up too, Amitraj is ready to head to his workplace, a co-working space, his sixth in as many months. This is because he wants to try them all out before he decides where he will work out of for a longer term. He tries to make ‘I change my workspace as often as I change my underwear’ his trademark joke, but it only draws him dirty looks and he cannot understand why.
Amitraj fires up the latest carpooling app, where he knows there is someone who will take him halfway towards his office, and confirms his ride. He knows that the car driver he is pooling with only sticks to the main roads and tends to get stuck in traffic jams that could have been easily avoided, but he does not mind. He likes it even, for it allows him longer conversations with the driver, and more importantly, the constantly changing set of others who hop on to the car pool. Every day, thrilled with a new nugget of information or lived experience that he has added to his collection, he gets off the car, and opens a bike taxi app with his office as the destination.
Presently, pleasantly even, his motorcycle pilot reaches him. Amitraj hops on, and tells him about the destination. And by the time the bike is on its way, somehow finds himself deep in conversation with the bike pilot. Amitraj is reluctant to end it, after all it has only been a dozen minutes of meaningful talk, but the bike has reached his office, the fancy co-working space.
Amitraj is there for the next twelve hours or more. Often more. But in that time, he has ordered food thrice. Once each from the three startups trying to win the food delivery opportunity. And two out of three times he has conversations with the chap bringing in the food. He could not do so the third time for he was on the phone with someone who was interested in buying a tiny piece of furniture that he put up for sale, more as an experiment, on the portal of a startup that allows people to sell used goods.
Amitraj works hard at his startup idea. Yet, the startup hasn’t made even the tiniest dent in the market it is operating in. Yet. But if I were a betting man (or as they like to call them these days, a venture capitalist), I will definitely put my money on Amitraj making it big.

Novel method developed to measure protein digestion
"," By labelling spirulina and two legumes (chick pea and mung bean pea) with stable, nonradioactive isotopes of carbon (13C) and hydrogen (2H) respectively, researchers at St. John’s Research Institute have found a new way to accurately measure the digestibility of dietary proteins.
In the six adults who consumed the labelled proteins, 85% of the spirulina protein was absorbed while only about 57% was absorbed in the case of both chickpea and mung beans. The results were published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition.
The research team led by Anura V Kurpad from the Institute’s Department of Physiology found that removing the hull or skin of mung bean before ingestion increases the average digestibility of essential amino acids by 10%. There are two ways by which the hull reduces digestibility. While anti-proteases present in the hull block the action of intestinal digestive enzymes, the polyphenols in it reduce the activity of the digestive enzyme.
“We knew the hull has anti-nutrition factors that hinder digestion and that dehulling will increase amino acid digestibility. But the 10% increase in digestibility when dehulled was not expected,” says Sarita Devi at the Institute’s Division of Nutrition and first author of the paper.
“The hull has less effect in the case of chick pea whereas it is a substantial problem in mung bean,” says Prof. Kurpad.
In another study, which will soon be published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, the team used stable isotopes to label and measure protein digestion in meat (chicken) and egg. At 92%, the essential amino acid digestion was highest in cooked chicken, followed by whole boiled egg at 89% and egg white protein at 86%.
“The amount of essential amino acid digested and absorbed is far higher in animal-source protein than plant-based protein,” says Prof. Kurpad. “In contrast, one has to consume about 40% more dal to get the same amino acid into the body as animal source protein. On the other hand, legumes are good for the environment and land and offer many other beneficial nutrients and so a balance has to be reached when deciding on the source of high quality protein foods in the diet.”
Of the 20 amino acids that we need, the body cannot synthesise nine; dietary protein is the only source of these essential amino acids. But till now there was no way to know how well the protein consumed is digested and absorbed by the body.
The crude method adopted so far was to feed protein-rich food and measure the nitrogen content in the faeces. “But protein is only digested and absorbed in the small intestine. In the large intestine the microbiome takes away or adds nitrogen. So measuring nitrogen in the faeces as an index of what has been digested and absorbed can be misleading,” says Prof. Kurpad. “If you have wrong information about digestion, we will end up with wrong recommendation for the quantity of specific food-based protein to be consumed.”
The team has been working for over 15 years on a stable carbon isotope (13C) method that they developed to measure the true amino acid requirement in humans. These studies have defined the requirement of amino acid has to be consumed every day to meet the protein requirement, and formed the primary evidence for the 2007 WHO/FAO/UNU Expert Committee Recommendations. These recommendations were very important since they overturned the earlier values for amino acid requirements set by the WHO/FAO/UNU in 1985, which was based on the nitrogen balance measurements from urine and faeces, and were inaccurate. 
“Since even digestion measurement was not correct, owing to difficulties in accessing small intestinal events, we devised the dual-isotope method to measure digestion in the small intestine,” he says. These results, while setting up a new method, will inform policies on feeding populations and individuals the appropriate amounts and types of food.

NASA counts down to launch of first spacecraft to ‘touch Sun’ "," NASA counted down on Friday to the launch of a $ 1.5 billion spacecraft that aims to plunge into the Sun’s sizzling atmosphere and become humanity’s first mission to explore a star.
The car-sized Parker Solar Probe is scheduled to blast off on a Delta IV Heavy rocket from Cape Canaveral, Florida early on Saturday.
 The 65-minute launch window opens at 3:33 am (local time), and the weather forecast is 70 percent favorable for takeoff, NASA said.
 The probe’s main goal is to unveil the secrets of the corona, the unusual atmosphere around Sun.
 Not only is the corona about 300 times hotter than the Sun’s surface, it also hurls powerful plasma and energetic particles that can unleash geomagnetic space storms and disrupt Earth’s power grid.
“The Parker Solar Probe will help us do a much better job of predicting when a disturbance in the solar wind could hit Earth,” said Justin Kasper, one of the project scientists and a professor at the University of Michigan.
 The probe is protected by an ultra-powerful heat shield that is just 4.5 inches thick (11.43 centimeters).
 The shield should enable the spacecraft to survive its close shave with the center of our solar system, coming within 3.83 million miles (6.16 million km) of the Sun’s surface.
 The heat shield is built to withstand radiation equivalent up to about 500 times the Sun’s radiation here on Earth.
 Even in a region where temperatures can reach more than a million degrees Fahrenheit, the sunlight is expected to heat the shield to just around 2,500 degrees Fahrenheit (1,371 degrees Celsius).
 Scorching, yes? But if all works as planned, the inside of the spacecraft should stay a cooler 85 F (29 C).
 The goal for the Parker Solar Probe is to make 24 passes through the corona during its seven-year mission.
“The sun is full of mysteries,” said Nicky Fox, project scientist at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Lab.
“We are ready. We have the perfect payload. We know the questions we want to answer.” 
The tools on board will measure the expanding corona and continually flowing atmosphere known as the solar wind, which solar physicist Eugene Parker first described back in 1958.
 Parker, now 91, recalled that at first, some people did not believe in his theory.
 But then, the launch of NASA’s Mariner 2 spacecraft in 1962 - becoming the first robotic spacecraft to make a successful planetary encounter - proved them wrong.
“It was just a matter of sitting out the deniers for four years until the Venus Mariner 2 spacecraft showed that, by golly, there was a solar wind,” Parker said earlier this week.
 He added that he is “impressed” by the Parker Solar Probe, calling it “a very complex machine.” Scientists have wanted to build a spacecraft like this for more than 60 years, but only in recent years did the heat shield technology advance enough to be capable of protecting sensitive instruments, according to Fox.
 Tools on board will measure high energy particles associated with flares and coronal mass ejections, as well as the changing magnetic field around the Sun.
“We will also be listening for plasma waves that we know flow around when particles move,” Fox added.
“And last but not least, we have a white light imager that is taking images of the atmosphere right in front of the Sun.” When it nears the Sun, the probe will travel rapidly enough to go from New York to Tokyo in one minute - some 700,000 km per hour, making it the fastest human-made object.

IISER Pune find species can turn invasive in the same ecosystem
"," Invasive species are normally considered to come from outside a given ecosystem. But a study by researchers from the Indian Institute of Science Research and Education (IISER) Pune have shown that selection process for dispersal in fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) can lead to evolution of traits related to invasive potential. So a native species can become invasive in the same ecosystem.
Though the team led by Sutirth Dey from the Institute’s Biology Division did not specifically study for invasion potential of the flies, the experiments they conducted did show the flies acquiring three important traits — increased aggression, exploration and activity — which together is more likely to make them more invasive.
“Faced with vagaries of climate change and habitat destruction, there is an increasing possibility for the evolution of these traits in many mobile organisms,” says Prof. Dey. If dispersal to safer environments is the “first line of defence” for organisms to cope with adversities, becoming an invasive species even within the same ecosystem might be the ugly fallout.
In a study published in June 2017 in Oikos, the researchers subjected four populations, each containing about 2,400 flies, to artificial selection for increased dispersal over 33 generations. This was done by placing the flies in a bottle and connecting it to another using a long pipe. Only the first 50% of flies that moved to the second bottle were allowed to breed. Thus there was a direct selection for dispersal propensity — ability to leave the source area. And every 3-4 generations, the distance between bottles was increased by using a longer tube. This was done to mimic increased habitat fragmentation.
Dispersal traits
Within 10 generations of selection, the dispersal propensity and ability to travel long distances was significantly greater in the selected flies than the controls. The selected fruit flies displayed the similar characteristics after 20 generations.
“We checked for dispersal propensity in the 10th and 20th generation without food and water, which was similar to the selection procedure. The absence of food and water acted as drivers and led to increased dispersal propensity in the flies,” says Sudipta Tung. “Then we became more ambitious and wanted to check whether the flies dispersed even in the absence of an external driver for dispersal. Even in the presence of food and water, we found that after 33 generations, the selected flies still displayed greater propensity and ability to disperse.”
“Even when there was no reason for selected flies to disperse [due to presence of food], they were still dispersing. So dispersal had become constitute,” he says.
The propensity to disperse was same in both sexes but males dispersed to longer distances than females. They also found that the selected population had larger number of flies that travelled long distances.
When organisms evolve in response to selection for greater dispersal the body size tends to become bigger. But in a paper published two days ago in Evolution, they found that selection did not lead to any increase in body size in both sexes. The studies were carried out using flies from 49-69 generations.
Selection for dispersal is likely to be at the expense of fecundity and longevity, but neither was observed. 
Behavioural traits
“But we observed distinct changes in three behavioural traits — activity, exploration and aggression. And these three traits are closely related to the invasive potential of a species,” says Tung. “Other research groups have shown that these behaviours are found associated with invasive potential in some species.”
The selected flies exhibited greater activity than the controls and this increased activity was seen in the absence and presence of food. After 24 hours, the activity of the selected flies was significantly more than the control males but the time spent resting and quality of rest/sleep were the same in the selected flies and controls.
The selected flies also exhibited greater exploratory tendency. This tendency helps the species to survive in a new environment. In many species, there is a strong relationship between exploration and invasion.
The selected flies exhibited greater aggression. Aggression helps species to retain resources and mates or gain new ones. But in the experiments carried out by the researchers, the flies exhibited elevated aggression even though there was no obvious fitness advantage. The selected flies did not have to compete with native flies either. “In our experiment, aggression has likely evolved as a correlated response of dispersal evolution,” they write. 
In collaboration with Dr. Kavita Dorai from the Department of Physical Sciences at IISER Mohali, the researchers looked at what was responsible for the change in behavioural traits. “Since dispersal is a complex process, it is difficult to figure out the genes responsible for it. So we looked at the changes in the levels of the underlying metabolites,” says Prof. Dey.
Octopamine, a neurotransmitter, was significantly elevated — 2.2 fold higher — in the selected flies. “The elevated octopamine level explains the underlying mechanism behind the observed changes in behavioural traits in the selected flies,” Prof. Dey says. 
Dispersal is an energy intensive process. The selected flies showed increased levels of cellular respiration to meet increased energy demand. There was increase in the levels of Adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is the energy currency for cells. Other energy-related molecules too were elevated in the selected flies.

Mbappé scores this World Cup; a Trump devotee wants a temple and more
","19 and thriving
French footballer Kylian Mbappé has levelled up with the legendary Brazilian Pelé for scoring at least twice in a World Cup match.
But what followed his triumphs is the realisation that he’s just 19, which was then followed by a vow to donate his match salary (roughly €20,000) to charity. If that doesn’t make the world clutch at their hearts, I don’t know what will.




But the rest of us, while totally impressed, found ourselves wondering what we were doing at 19, which heralded a slew of hilarious memes of existentialism.
Twitter user @holumiede shared “I was being sent to my room at that age,” while @TheHarryMcC added, “I am also 19 and today I am eating a ham sandwich while watching Netflix on the couch.” Same, Harry, same. 
Hare Trump?
Bussa Krishna; by now, the name is familiar to Indian netizens. The guy from Telangana who literally worships Donald Trump. 
The 31-year-old farmer has gone all out, making space in his home for his Trump shrine, to which he does regular aartis. I’m already starting to gag.
His justification? That after the tragic killing of engineer Srinivas Kuchibhotla in the United States, he hoped that the regimented prayers would change the situation for Indians living there.
It’s something of nightmares, but one can kind of see he has good intention, but he’s not necessarily gotten great press for it. He’s admitted that he’s been advised to see a psychologist, especially with his plans to build a Trump temple.
As Trump would say, “SAD!”

Twitter may block account for abusive chats during live broadcasts
"," Twitter is getting tough on those who send abusive comments on its live-streaming platform Periscope as the microblogging site said it would suspend the accounts of such habitual offenders from August 10.
The company will enforce its Periscope Community Guidelines more aggressively by reviewing and suspending accounts of repeat offenders, TechCrunch reported on Saturday. 
“As part of our ongoing effort to build a safer service, we are launching more aggressive enforcement of our guidelines related to chats sent during live broadcasts,” according to a Periscope blog post.
The Periscope Community Guidelines apply to all broadcasts on both Periscope and Twitter, the post added.
Currently, Periscope’s comment moderation policy involves group moderation to determine if someone can continue chatting. 
So when someone reports an abusive comment, Periscope randomly selects a few other viewers to review the comment to determine if it is spam, abuse or appears alright. 
“Starting on August 10, we will also review and suspend accounts for repeatedly sending chats that violate our guidelines. If you are in a broadcast and see a chat that may violate our guidelines, please report it,” the Periscope blog post said.
“We’re committed to making sure everyone feels safe, whether you’re broadcasting or just tuning in. Look out for more changes across policies, product, and enforcement as we continue to make both Periscope and Twitter safer,” it added.

","Pulse-pounding new video games and more ways to enjoy them are at the centre of the Electronic Entertainment Expo extravaganza officially kicking off here on Tuesday.
The annual E3 expo promised glimpses at trends such as collaborating in online teams instead of playing solo, and blazingly popular battle royale death matches such as those at the heart of Fortnite and Playerunknown’s Battlegrounds.
Microsoft is hard at work on a next-generation console along with a cloud service that would let players stream games to any device.
Microsoft is adding five new game studios, one it is creating in Southern California and another four it is buying, Xbox team chief Phil Spencer said. “We are making one of our greatest single year’s investments in teams by adding five new creative studios,” Mr. Spencer said at a media event ahead of the formal start of the Expo.
Microsoft has been criticised for lacking hit video games exclusively for play on Xbox, while Sony has dominated this console generation with PlayStation 4 models.

Pushing bats off their holy roosts
"," It is not just thousand-year-old deities that dwell in the ancient temples of southern Tamil Nadu. Bats too make their home in the little nooks and high ceilings that these stone structures offer. However, temple renovations could be lowering bat numbers in these sacred spaces, suggests a preliminary, yet-to-be-published survey.
The sight of bats inside some temples in Tirunelveli district piqued the interest of T. Ganesh (Senior Fellow, Ashoka Trust for Research in Ecology and the Environment; ATREE) and his students. How many bat species dwell in these temples and what makes them suitable bat homes?
The team, which began studying these bats since 2011, visited 22 temples across three towns (Kallidaikurichi, Ambasamudram, Alwarkurichi) in May 2018. They found 37 bat roost sites of seven species (including the Leschenault’s rousette Rousettus leschenaultii and the Lesser mouse-tailed bat Rhinopoma hardwickii) in 18 temples. They also noted temperature, humidity, light and noise at these roost sites; basic analyses show that higher roost height and a combination of both noise and low light played a crucial role in bats selecting specific roost sites.
The team also noticed that temple authorities used several methods to prevent the mammals from roosting: they blocked bat entrances using nets and logs, filled up existing cracks, added lights, reconstructed temple towers and painted the old dark stones white. Six temples implemented some of these renovations in the later half of 2014. 
Dropping numbers
The numbers of Schneider's leaf-nosed bat (Hipposideros speoris) dropped from 211 in May 2014 to 26 this year. However, a more detailed and robust study would be required to understand this better, says Chetan Misher, one of the research students at ATREE who conducted the study. 
Temple renovation is indeed a main cause of disturbance to bats, according to D. Paramanantha Swami Doss (assistant professor at St. John's College, Payalamkottai), whose team has also been studying these temple bats for the last 15 years. Bat diversity could also be decreasing here, he adds.
“We recorded a [member of] Tadarida species [free-tailed bats] for the first time in Tirunelveli district from the Brahmadesam temple, but when I went there a few days ago, there were none left,” he added.
While Dr. Doss hopes to focus on bat awareness sessions for local residents, Dr. Ganesh and his team hope to provide bat houses outside temples that the bats could use if renovations drive them out of their holy roosts.

The JBL Go 2: A functional tool
"," On first look, the JBL Go 2 speaker appears like a box of mints and also reminds us of the small plugin radio sets of the early 2000s. The kind of devices that were cheap and offered a chance to browse through FM channels and check the occasional cricket score. However, the speaker is well-designed, sturdy and small enough to easily fit into the pocket of your jeans or backpack. It also looks good, and remained steady on different kinds of surfaces without giving any trouble. A small blue light on top flashes when the device is switched on. We also liked the design elements, like the gently-curved edges.
The power button, Bluetooth switch and volume controls are on the top of the device and are fairly user-friendly. A flap on the right-hand side covers the micro USB charging port and an audio input, presumably as part of the water-resistance function.
The music test
The key test for any speaker is good audio quality. On this front, the Go 2 performs much better than average. The audio quality does well for most forms of movies, music and podcasts and worked much better than standard laptop speakers. The vocal quality is clear and can be easily heard in a large room. However, the speaker does not work too well with songs that have a lot of bass, especially at higher volumes. The functional built-in microphone is an added bonus.
On battery life, the device lasts for approximately five to six hours at low and moderate volume levels. It does take three hours to completely recharge. Syncing to devices is smooth and the review device hardly gave us any trouble on that account. The audio cable should help in case of any issues with syncing.
The verdict
If you are someone who loves watching movies on tablets or listening to podcasts, this device would be a great companion. 
It does its work with ease and does not give the user much reason to complain on the performance front. At ₹2,999, it is affordable as well.

A device that attempts to plug pollution at source
"," Deadly carbon emissions need to be challenged with not just activism, but also innovation. Chakr Shield is a device that plugs pollution at source. It converts particulate matter emitted from diesel generators into non-toxic ink that can be used for sketching, textile and paper printing. While it was developed last year by Delhi-based startup Chakr Innovation, a hardware company working towards creating a sustainable environment, it is now getting into significant partnerships.
In Bengaluru, the technology giant Dell announced its partnership with Chakr Innovation, with an interesting line-up of events. Tahera Peeran showcased her khadi collection, hand-painted with POINK (Pollution into Ink), while artist N Ponnappa did a live cartooning session. “We have been using Chakr Shield since December 2017, and Dell has shipped 1,50,000 boxes with labels and packaging using POINK. It aligns with our philosophy of using technology for the benefit of society and giving back to nature,” said Rajeev Kapoor, India Vice President, Dell.
Chakr Shield is a retrofit which can be added to any diesel genset with a capacity ranging from 15 kVA to 2,000 kVA. It captures over 90% of the particulate matter emissions at source, with no impact on the genset. This is soot, or carbon black, which then goes through several processes, where carcinogens and heavy metals are removed. The result is a purified carbon-based pigment that is further processed into ink.
Arpit Dhupar, Kushagra Srivastava and Prateek Sachan, engineers from IIT Delhi, founded the company in 2016, and created Chakr Shield the same year. Currently at work in Dell India’s manufacturing units across India, Dell now intends to use it at all their units across the globe.
The company has been awarded for its innovation by the Department of Science and Technology, Government of India and FICCI, and has received a grant from Indian Oil for new technology development.
“We haven’t commercialised POINK yet, but have been partnering with companies. As of now, Dell consumes 600-800 litres of ink per month. It’s not possible to scale up the production without tie-ups, so we are exploring these with Mahindra, Infosys and Godrej.

Even small dams have severe impact on river ecology
"," It seems to stand to reason that small dams cause less environmental problems than large ones. But the first study on small hydropower projects in India proves that they cause as severe ecological impacts as big dams, including altering fish communities and changing river flows.
Such hydroprojects, which usually generate less than 25 megawatts of power and consist of a wall that obstructs a river's flow, a large pipe that diverts the collected water to a turbine-driven powerhouse to generate electricity and a canal that releases the water back into the river, are touted to be better than large dams because they submerge fewer regions and barely impact river flow. Such projects receive financial subsidies — even carbon credits — for being ‘greener’.
To see how green such small dams really are, scientists from organisations including Bengaluru’s Foundation for Ecological Research, Advocacy and Learning (FERAL) compared almost 50 kilometres of three river tributaries — over one undammed and two dammed stretches — of the Netravathi river in the Western Ghats of Karnataka. 
They studied three zones in detail: above the dam (upstream), in the area between the dam’s wall and the powerhouse, sometimes completely devoid of water (‘de-watered’) and below the powerhouse (downstream). Here, they studied differences in water depth and width, which signify how much habitat is available to the river's denizens, and habitat quality through factors including dissolved oxygen content and water temperatures. 
Their results show that changes in water flow in the dammed sections reduced the stream’s depth and width; water in these stretches was also warmer and had lower dissolved oxygen levels. These changes were most evident in the ‘de-watered’ zones and worsened in the dry seasons.
Habitat quality
This decrease in habitat quantity and quality showed in fish diversity too. The team found that un-dammed stretches recorded a higher diversity of fish species, including endemics (species seen only in the Western Ghats).
“The upstream and downstream stretches get disconnected and this impedes the river,” says Suman Jumani, lead author of the study and researcher at FERAL.
Such small hydro-projects cropping up on rivers in the Ghats is a serious worry, she adds, especially because they do not require environmental impact assessments.
“It is not a question of small versus big dams,” says Jumani. “Small dams are not necessarily bad if there are proper regulations in place.”
Regulations could include limiting the number of dams in a river basin or maintaining a minimum distance between dams on the same river stretch.

Google Doodle celebrates Georges Lemaitre, the founder of the Big Bang theory
","On Tuesday, Google celebrated the 124th birth anniversary of Belgian astronomer Georges Lemaitre with a doodle. Lemaitre is credited with what is popularly known as the Big Bang Theory, which says that the universe originated from a single atom, which he referred to as the Cosmic Egg. He is also believed to be the first to have come up with the theory that the universe is expanding.
Born in 1894, he served in the Belgian army during the First World War. He went on to study physics and mathematics and also trained to become a priest. He studied physics and astronomy in some of the world's most prestigious institutions, including University of Cambridge, Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. 
In 1927, he published the paper which theorised – one that was derived from General Relativity – that the universe is expanding. This theory was substantiated by Edwin Hubble two years later, and it would soon be known as Hubble's Law. 
Albert Einstein had initially rejected Lemaitre's theory, but he later changed his mind. Hubble furthered research on the theory of the Big Bang, and it led to a new branch of science known as relative cosmology.
In 1934, Lemaître received the Francqui Prize, the highest Belgian scientific distinction -- one of the proposers being Einstein. In 1953, he was given the inaugural Eddington Medal awarded by the Royal Astronomical Society. He died in 1966, shortly after having learned of the discovery of cosmic microwave background radiation.
The doodle website depicts Lemaitre “within the constantly expanding universe that he first envisioned, surrounded by galaxies expanding outward just as he said they would.”

ISRO set to launch its TV channel
"," The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) will have an year-long Vikram Sarabhai centenary celebration starting in August 2019 to honour the visionary scientist and its legendary founding father.
 In a few months’ time, it plans to roll out a dedicated ISRO TV channel showcasing space applications, developments and science issues, targeting young viewers and people in remote areas in their language. 
Series of events
Sarabhai, the architect of the Indian space programme, the first ISRO chief and renowned cosmic ray scientist, was born on August 12, 1919.
ISRO’s tributes to Sarabhai start with naming the first Indian moon landing spacecraft of the Chandrayaan-2 mission ‘Vikram’. The mission is planned for early 2019. A chair each at Sarabhai's two alma maters, Cambridge University and Gujarat University, as also at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), would be set up, apart from giving awards, scholarships and fellowships in the country and abroad, ISRO Chairman K. Sivan said at a news conference on Sunday, the 99th birthday of the legend.
Sarabhai was only 28 when he sowed the seeds of a space agency around the late 1940s and 1950s. “We have planned an year-long centenary of the visionary architect of the space programme and our first Chairman, Dr. Sarabhai, during 2019-20. A series of activities will be organised nationally and internationally to commemorate the great international scientist,” Dr. Sivan said.
The events are being taken up with an initial outlay of ₹ 50 crore. 
Earlier, former Chairman of ISRO K. Kasturirangan unveiled a new bust of Sarabhai at the remodelled atrium of ISRO headquarters, Antariksh Bhavan.
Dr. Sivan said 100 lectures by science luminaries would be held across the country and in association with the International Astronautical Federation, the global space networking body. Space clubs, knowledge centres and talk shows are also among the plans.
Public satellite launches
As it strengthens its public outreach, ISRO will shortly start allowing the public to watch satellite launches from its Sriharikota launch centre. “We are opening our space port to visitors just as NASA (the U.S.’ National Aeronautical and Space Administration) does,” Dr. Sivan said.

University of Hyderabad increases bioavailability of harpin biopesticide "," Researchers at the University of Hyderabad have found that harpin biopesticide brought about 80-90% reduction in severity of fungal infection in tomato plants when it is encapsulated in chitosan nanoparticles. The fungal infection was caused by Rhizoctonia solani. The reduction in disease severity is only about 50-55% when the biopesticide is used without loading it in nanoparticles. The results were published in the journal Carbohydrate Polymers.
Though harpin is used against several bacterial, fungal and viral infections, poor bioavailability is a major hurdle when harpin protein, taken from the bacteria Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae, is just sprayed on the leaves like any other pesticide.
Chitosan to the rescue
To address the issue of poor bioavailability of harpin arising from the inability to permeate into plants, the researchers led by Prof. Appa Rao Podile from the Department of Plant Sciences turned to nanotechnology. They used the biocompatible and biodegradable chitosan in nanoparticle size to encapsulate the biopesticide. Chitosan nanoparticles are capable of getting into the plant through the stomata (pores on the leaves through which gas exchange takes place) and then diffuse through the cell wall to enter the cells. The team found that chitosan nanoparticles containing harpin pass through the cell wall and end up in the chloroplast of tomato plants.
As a result, bioavailability of harpin inside tomato plants increases sharply when loaded in chitosan nanoparticles. Also, less amount of harpin will have to be sprayed on leaves when it is contained in nanoparticles.
Chitosan by itself has another advantage. “Chitosan’s antifungal property and its role in triggering plant defence responses are already well known. Its ability to biodegrade inside the plant without harming the plant cells is why we chose it for encapsulating harpin,” says Prof. Podile. 
The disease severity in tomato reduced significantly and there was fivefold decrease in fungal biomass in the case of harpin encapsulated in nanoparticles compared with bulk harpin sprayed on leaves. While the fungus failed to colonise and infect tomato leaves upon extended incubation, it completely destroyed the leaves used as controls. 
Laboratory studies found harpin was released from the nanoparticles in two phases. “The biopesticide adsorbed on the nanoparticles gets released in a burst in the first 48 hours followed by slow release up to 120 hours,” says Dr. Sandhya Rani Nadendla from the Department of Plant Sciences at UoH and first author of the paper.
Currently, the shelf-life of harpin nanoparticle is limited to 30 days as the encapsulation loses its efficiency. “The nanoparticles are currently stored in a liquid phase. We are trying to make some chemical changes at the time of preparation of chitosan nanoparticles to make it more stable. We are also trying to make it in a powder form by spray drying to further increase the shelf-life,” says Prof. Podile.
Tomato plants and R. solani fungal infection were only used as a model system to test the efficacy of chitosan nanoparticles containing harpin in controlling the disease. “The objective was not to develop an exclusive disease control method. We used this particular fungal infection as an index,” he says. “The plant defence activated by harpin is broad-spectrum so can control even bacteria.”
The team is planning to test harpin-containing chitosan nanoparticles on a large-scale on four different crops and at least two pathogens per crop. Two of the crops to be tested will be grown in fields and two others will be greenhouse crops.

'Amazing dragon' fossils rewrite history of long-necked dinosaurs ","Fossils unearthed on a hillside in northwestern China are forcing scientists to rethink the history of a dinosaur lineage that produced the largest animals ever to walk the planet.
Scientists on Tuesday announced the discovery of Lingwulong shenqi, an early member of the well-known group of plant-eating dinosaurs called sauropods with long necks, long tails, small heads and pillar-like legs. Lingwulong lived 174 million years ago during the Jurassic Period.
Its name means “amazing dragon from Lingwu,” the closest city to the site where a farmer spotted the fossils while herding sheep.
The scientists excavated bones from at least eight to 10 Lingwulong individuals, the largest of which was about 57 feet long, said paleontologist Xing Xu of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, who led the study published in the journal Nature Communications.




 
Lingwulong represents the earliest-known advanced member of the sauropod lineage, as defined by anatomical traits that distinguish them from primitive sauropods that first appeared tens of millions of years earlier. The discovery pushes back by 15 million years the appearance of advanced sauropods, a lineage that later would include Jurassic giants like Diplodocus and Brontosaurus as well as Cretaceous Period behemoths like Argentinosaurus, Dreadnoughtus and Patagotitan that were the largest land animals on record.
“Previously, we thought all of these advanced sauropods originated around 160 million years ago and rapidly diversified and spread across the planet in a time window perhaps as short as 5 million years,” said University College London paleontologist Paul Upchurch, a study co-author. “However, the discovery of Lingwulong means that this hypothesis is incorrect and we now have to work with the idea that, actually, this group and its major constituent lineages originated somewhat earlier and more gradually.”
Lingwulong lived in a warm and wet environment with lush vegetation including conifers, ferns and other plants. Its neck was not as long as some other sauropods, and it may have grazed on low, soft plants with its peg-like teeth. Because so many individuals were found together, the researchers suspect Lingwulong, like other sauropods, lived in herds.
Lingwulong belonged to a sauropod subgroup that previously was thought to have been absent from East Asia because it evolved after that land mass split from the rest of Pangaea, an ancient supercontinent. “Our discoveries indicate that eastern Asia was still connected to other continents at the time,” Xu said.

Ramana Gogula’s pursuit for a green future
"," There was no phase in Ramana Gogula’s life where he was doing only one thing at a time. The composer-entrepreneur was part of the founding team of Sybase, a cyber database firm even as he was composing music for films. His film stint spread over 25 projects, yet not many in the industry knew about his entrepreneurial ambitions. He may have distanced himself from films for a while (he last composed for Venkatadri Express), his goals have only gotten bigger. Besides his brain-child Earthen Glow that provides off-grid solar lighting to villages, he’s now also a Vice President, Clean Technology Innovation at Stanley Black & Decker, Inc and a venture partner at Anthill Ventures, roles that are helping build an energy-efficient future for the country.
The social entrepreneur is on a globe-trotting spree, scheduling meetings with global giants, grooming startups, attending top business summits in a bid to mainstream the use of clean technology. He says, “The world is now trying to make devices that use electricity more efficiently. I am trying to do my part in minimising the use of electricity and connecting the country with clean technology power sources and reduce carbon emissions.” His aim with Earthen Glow has been to ensure optimum utilisation of distributed solar, something that’s not centralised. “That’ll allow poor families some light, ensure education for children, helping them extend work hours.”
Technology shift
His role with Stanley Black and Decker is an extension of these interests; engaged in popularising the use of solar pumps over electric AC pumps. “Over 25 million pumps in the country that draw water out of the earth through borewells, irrigation consume almost one-fifth of the power generated in the country. There’s a tremendous burden on subsidies that the Government faces. Here we are building the next generation solar pump that uses brushless DC motor to pump water from the ground.”Also, the solar energy is diverted to provide off-grid lighting, cold storage, drip irrigation. 




The biggest challenge lies with the farming community. “It’s important to not intimidate them and educate them on the technology shift.” He realises the need for solutions to be cheaper and more accessible. “Sensitivity is crucial too,” Gogula points out. Direct interaction with people at the bottom of the pyramid has helped him understand the complexity of many issues. A tie-up with T-Hub now has him identifying startups who can make a difference to agriculture, clean technology and integrate innovations across the globe on one platform.
The response from startups has been promising, his mentoring/investing role with emerging companies have taught him important lessons. “Startups start with a problem, you identify a clear solution to it, build the technology and find people who pay for it. If not, the cycle repeats. I’ve learnt that startups need to learn very fast, the good ones complete that cycle quickly.”
Music plays on
 Music has always been a part of Ramana Gogula’s life, though he misses composing for films. “My focus is on finding a solution for a larger population of the country now. In a year or two, I might get back to making films and compose music too. I am currently working on my second album, it’s coming after a gap of 15 years.”
For now, he enjoys listening to the various kinds of music, plays the guitar and teaches his daughter too. “If I didn’t play music, I wouldn’t be as creative as I am. I still sing, play music, it’s more for myself than public consumption. I am very grateful for a few films in which I have been able to articulate my talent. When the time is right, I’ll go back and let people know, I’m ready. Look at Robert De Niro’s drive at 74. I see myself being like that.”

Dual mechanism for embryonic stem cells to maintain pluripotency
","Embryonic stem cells are capable of generating all the cell types that compose the organs and systems of the human body. Now, researchers at Pune’s National Centre for Cell Science (NCCS) have found a dual mechanism that keeps specific genes off, which helps the embryonic stem cells maintain pluripotency — their ability to give rise to all the cell types. The dual mechanism functions in such a way that even if one mechanism fails, the other can function as a back-up and help the embryonic stem cells maintain pluripotency.
Embryonic stem cells contain multiple endocytosis-associated genes whose expression is suppressed unlike in the case of the specialised or differentiated cells. Some of the genes are directly responsible for or involved in the regulation of the transport of molecules present on the cell surface membrane to the interior of the cell. The precise mechanism by which the expression of endocytosis-associated genes are turned off in embryonic stem cells and the role of endocytosis (transport of molecules from the membrane surface to inside the cell) in maintaining pluripotency was not known. A team led by Dr Deepa Subramanyam from NCCS has deciphered them. The results were published in the journal Scientific Reports.
“We attempted to identify and ascertain if certain genes that are associated with endocytosis have their expression kept under check or not in stem cells, and if these genes had any role in maintaining the stemness of embryonic stem cells,” says Dr Subramanyam.
The team identified two pathways — polycomb repressive complex (PRC2) and embryonic stem cell-specific cell cycle (ESCC) regulating microRNAs — that suppressed the expression of the endocytosis-associated genes in embryonic stem cells but not in cells that have already differentiated. While the expression of 50 endocytosis-associated genes is kept under check by one pathway (PRC2), the expression of a smaller subset of 12 genes is also reduced by the action of the second pathway (ESCC).
The PRC2 complex has four subunits, and when one particular subunit (Ezh2) was knocked down it led to significant increase in the expression of endocytosis-associated genes. Similar results were obtained when another subunit (Suz12) was knocked down.
Stem cells have a class of small non-coding microRNAs called the ESCC-family of microRNAs. The microRNAs work by binding to the complementary sites seen on messenger RNA (mRNA). “Of the 50 endocytosis-associated genes, 21 genes had complementary sites for the microRNA, indicating that these 21 could potentially be controlled by microRNAs,” she says.
“The function of the PRC2 complex is to suppress the expression of the 50 endocytosis-associated genes. And the microRNAs function as a back-up, in case the expression of some of the genes is not completely shut down by the action of the PRC2 complex,” says Dr Subramanyam. The stem cells will continue to exhibit pluripotency as long as the expression of the endocytosis-associated genes is turned off.
To confirm that the genes have to necessarily be turned off for pluripotency to be maintained in stem cells, the researchers introduced the genes into stem cells in such a manner that the expression of these genes was not turned in the stem cells. “We introduced only one gene at a time and we tested a total of two genes. In both cases, the embryonic stem cells began losing their pluripotency and there was an upregulation of differentiation markers,” says Ridim Dadasaheb Mote from NCCS and first author of the paper.
“Our work will be helpful in regenerative medicine. Understanding the pathways and mechanism of endocytosis can now give us a handle to try and convert induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells, which are pluripotent, into specialised cells, such as neurons, by altering the expression of the endocytosis-associated genes,” says Dr Subramanyam.

Gaps in India’s digital accessible information on bird occurrence
"," With citizen science, especially in bird sightings, taking off in the country, scientists tried to use these online data to study if bird occurrence has altered across India over time. Though a lot of information is available after the 2000s, they found very little data before 1980 has been made available digitally, making comparisons impossible.
Comparisons are crucial in science and tell us how natural systems change over time. The effects of climate change are also usually studied this way: comparisons of climate and bird occurrences in the past, for instance, can tell us how changing climates could have led to the avian patterns of the present.
It was with this in mind that scientists at the Wildlife Institute of India (WII) and the University of Kansas accessed more than 2 million bird occurrence data points from across India to evaluate the “digital accessible knowledge” of bird species occurrences. They explored two sources: the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF, a network funded by the world’s governments focused on making scientific data on biodiversity available online); and eBird, the world’s largest biodiversity-related citizen science project where users contribute information on bird sightings.
“Curating this data using multiple levels of filtering took a huge amount of time,” said Gautam Talukdar (WII), co-author of a study published in Current Science.
Gaps in data
Finally, making sure each record had all necessary information including correct species names, they obtained 16,510 records of 1,021 species for the pre-1980 period, and 9,01,658 records of 1,151 species for post-2000, clearly showing good coverage after 2000, but a paucity of data before 1980. Their maps reveal that the most spatially dense data after 2000 was from Kerala. Jammu and Kashmir, the higher elevations across the Himalayan front, and northeastern India had very sparse data.
Incorporating information from the several museum specimens – in foreign and Indian museums, as well as institutional collections (such as those in the Zoological Survey of India) – could be crucial to generate bird occurrence data before 1980, said Dr. Talukdar.
These gaps need to be addressed, agreed Praveen J. of Bird Count India (an Indian collective that coordinates several birding activities and encourages using eBird for documentation).
“Old papers may now be online but their data are not in searchable databases yet,” Praveen said. “Even the field notebooks of some of India's birding pioneers are still in private shelves and not digitised.”

Roadkills of wild animals in the Ghats
"," The roads that Valparai’s tourists love driving through to spot wildlife also see numerous animal deaths. Road surveys show that almost 3,000 animals died on approximately 1,500 km of roads in Tamil Nadu's Valparai plateau in 2011-12 alone.
Valparai’s road network meanders through rainforest fragments and tea, coffee, cardamom and eucalyptus plantations in the Anamalai Hills of the Western Ghats. Along with people, animals – including endangered Asian elephants and lion-tailed macaques – also live on this high-elevation plateau. However, fragmentation of habitats ensures that wildlife have to cross roads when they move about. A study recorded 73 reptile deaths on the Valparai roads in 2001; mammal and insect deaths are also frequent here.
Scientists of the Nature Conservation Foundation (NCF) walked along eleven road sections passing through various habitats in the Valparai plateau. They noted roadkills of all animal taxa across seasons (surveying totally1473.4 kms, including a State Highway) in 2011-12.
Their results, published in the journal Current Science, show that 2,969 animals died on Valparai’s roads during this time, which translates approximately to an average of 21 animals per 10 km of road. Almost 50% of these kills comprised amphibians — toads, frogs and caecilians (limbless, snake-like amphibians). Rodents and shrews comprised a majority of the 148 mammal kills. The Indian crested porcupine, the brown palm civet (a fruit-eater endemic to the Western Ghats), larger mammals like sambar deer and endemic lion-tailed macaques also figured in the list of mammal roadkills.
When the team compared deaths across seasons, they found that roadkill rates were 2.4 times higher during the monsoons than during summer. This could be because many amphibians breed and move across land during the monsoon, write the authors. What habitat the road passed through also mattered; roads passing through tea plantations, followed by forests habitats, saw the highest deaths at 1,402 and 948, respectively. Forest patches had the highest mammal roadkills.
The team’s findings could help identify specific management measures for different habitats to prevent or reduce roadkills in Valparai and similar places. According to the authors, roads through forest patches need urgent attention because forest-dependant and endemic species died most here. Drains along roadsides with underpasses at regular intervals can also provide safe passages for small-sized taxa like amphibians.
“But mitigation measures have to be taxa- and habitat-specific, and should be implemented on road stretches which see a lot of roadkills,” said P. Jeganathan (NCF), lead author of the study.

Supercapacitor built from discarded lithium ion batteries
","Used old batteries can now help create supercapacitors, which can in turn create better long-lasting batteries.
Scientists from CSIR–Central Electrochemical Research Institute (CSIR-CECRI) in Karaikudi, Tamilnadu, and CSIR–Central Salt and Marine Chemicals Research Institute (CSIR-CSMCRI) in Bhavnagar, Gujarat, collected discarded lithium-ion batteries and created reduced graphene oxide from them. This new material showed high specific capacity at low current making it an ideal material for next generation high-performance supercapacitor.
“The specific capacity was found to be 112 farad per gram from fundamental evaluation, which is almost equal to the commercially available ones. Also the ones available in market today are created using activated carbon which is expensive and environmentally hazardous while our method is cheaper and fully environmental friendly” explains by Sivasankara Rao Ede, Ph.D scholar from CSIR-CECRI and one of the first authors of the paper published in Colloids and Surfaces A: Physicochemical and Engineering Aspects.
The new electrodes made using the reduced graphene oxide showed high stability even after 20,000 cycles. They also had high retention capacity where 70% of the efficiency was retained even after 85 cycles. The efficiency slowly increased and reached 108% after 20,000 cycles. The long-term stability and robustness of the capacitor are the key parameters for qualifying as suitable candidates for commercial application.
“Today lithium-ion batteries are used widely and disposed after they run out, leading to mounting e-waste. We tried a new method and succeeded in recycling and reusing these batteries,” says Dr Subrata Kundu, from CSIR-CECRI and one of the corresponding authors.
The graphite anode and aluminium and stainless steel from dismantled batteries were used. The graphite was converted into graphene oxide by oxidation and subsequent exfoliation. Graphene oxide was further reduced to reduced graphene oxide.
Supercapacitors are now being used explicitly in wind turbine pitch control, rail (on-board or wayside), automotive (including hybrid vehicles), heavy industrial equipment, UPS and Telecom systems for power delivery and memory backup. “We are further evaluating the capacitive nature of our prepared electrode in two electrode system and hope to bring it out soon for large scale commercial applications,” says H. C. Bajaj, emeritus scientist at CSIR-CSMCRI and the other corresponding author.

Now, a spider silk based capsule to deliver vaccines
","Scientists have developed microcapsules made of spider silk that can deliver vaccines directly to the heart of immune cells.
To fight cancer, researchers increasingly use vaccines that stimulate the immune system to identify and destroy tumour cells. However, the desired immune response is is not always guaranteed. In order to strengthen the efficacy of vaccines on the immune system and in particular on T lymphocytes, specialised in the detection of cancer cells researchers developed this new spider silk microcapsules
This process, described in the journal Biomaterials, could also be applied to preventive vaccines to protect against infectious diseases, and constitutes an important step towards vaccines that are stable, easy to use, and resistant to the most extreme storage conditions.
The human immune system is largely based on two types of cells: B lymphocytes, which produce the antibodies needed to defend against various infections, and T lymphocytes. In the case of cancer and certain infectious diseases such as tuberculosis, T lymphocytes need to be stimulated.
However, their activation mechanism is more complex than that of B lymphocytes: to trigger a response, it is necessary to use a peptide, a small piece of protein which, if injected alone, is rapidly degraded by the body even before reaching its target.
“To develop immunotherapeutic drugs effective against cancer, it is essential to generate a significant response of T lymphocytes,” said Carole Bourquin, from the University of Geneva (UNIGE), who directed this work. “As the current vaccines have only limited action on T-cells, it is crucial to develop other vaccination procedures to overcome this issue.”
Scientists used synthetic spider silk biopolymers – a lightweight, biocompatible, non-toxic material that is highly resistant to degradation from light and heat.
“We recreated this special silk in the lab to insert a peptide with vaccine properties,” said Thomas Scheibel, from the University of Bayreuth in Germany and one of the authors of the study. “The resulting protein chains are then salted out to form injectable microparticles,” said Scheibel.
Silk microparticles form a transport capsule that protects the vaccine peptide from rapid degradation in the body, and delivers the peptide to the center of the lymph node cells, thereby considerably increasing T lymphocyte immune responses.
“Our study has proved the validity of our technique. We have demonstrated the effectiveness of a new vaccination strategy that is extremely stable, easy to manufacture and easily customizable,” said Bourquin.
The synthetic silk biopolymer particles demonstrate a high resistance to heat, withstanding over 100 degree Celsius for several hours without damage. In theory, this process would make it possible to develop vaccines that do not require adjuvants and cold chains. An undeniable advantage, especially in developing countries where one of the great difficulties is the preservation of vaccines.
One of the limitations of this process, however, is the size of the microparticles: while the concept is in principle applicable to any peptide, which are all small enough to be incorporated into silk proteins, further research is needed to see if it is also possible to incorporate the larger antigens used in standard vaccines, especially against viral diseases.

Forty-five new exoplanets discovered
"," Scientists have discovered a trove of forty-four planets in solar systems beyond our own in one go, dwarfing the usual number of confirmations from extrasolar surveys. 
The findings will improve existing models of solar systems, and may help researchers investigate exoplanet atmospheres.
 Novel techniques developed to validate the find could accelerate the confirmation of more extrasolar planet candidates.
 Astronomers pooled data from NASA’s Kepler and the ESA’s Gaia space telescopes. They confirmed existence of these 44 exoplanets and described various details about them.
A portion of the findings yield some surprising characteristcs.
“For example, four of the planets orbit their host stars in less than 24 hours,” said John Livingston, a graduate student at the University of Tokyo in Japan.
“In other words, a year on each of those planets is shorter than a day here on Earth,” said Livingston, lead author of the study.
 These contribute to a small but growing list of “ultrashort-period” planets, suggesting that they could be more common than previously believed.
 

What are exoplanets?


“Sixteen were in the same size class as Earth, one in particular turning out to be extremely small - about the size of Venus - which was a nice affirmation, as it’s close to the limit of what is possible to detect,” said Livingston.
 Scientists hope to understand what kinds of planets might be out there, but can only draw valid conclusions if there are enough planets for robust statistical analysis.
 The addition of a large number of new planets, therefore, leads directly to a better theoretical understanding of solar system formation, researchers said.
 The planets also provide good targets for detailed individual studies to yield measurements of planetary composition, interior structure and atmospheres - in particular, the 18 planets in several multi-planet systems.
“The investigation of other solar systems can help us understand how planets and even our own solar system formed. The study of other worlds has much to teach us about our own,” said Livingston.

New route to clean wastewater
"," Self-propelling nanomotors, just 200 nanometre in size, could be used for wastewater management in chemical industries. Developed by researchers from Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Kolkata, and The Institute of Mathematical Sciences, Chennai, the nanomotor can be used for transporting catalysts needed in harsh chemical environments and removing unwanted chemicals in water.
Nanorods (rod shaped nanomotors) are made using ammonium heptamolybdate tetrahydrate and dispersed in the solution to be treated. When hydrazine sulphate is added to water, it reacts with the nanorods producing nitrogen gas. This leads to an osmotic stress in the fluid and causes the nanorods to move along the direction of the gas evolved. 
The paper published in Frontiers in Chemistry says that this nanomotor is amongst the fastest reported active nanoparticles.
“Molybdenum based soft-oxometalates are non-toxic and easy to synthesize. The complementary charge interactions on the surface trigger their motion. The speed can be increased by increasing the concentration of the fuel hydrazine on the surface of the nanorods and they were found to remain in their motile state for about three days,” says Prof Soumyajit Roy from the Department of Chemical Sciences, IISER Kolkata and one of the corresponding authors of the paper.
Structure matters
The anterior end of these structures is capped like a pencil while the posterior end consists of a series of rod like protrusions. “We believe that these exposed ends of the rods provide a more accessible reaction surface than the capped end. 
Therefore, the fuel hydrazine preferentially reacts at the posterior open end and generates gaseous nitrogen which triggers motion and the propulsion speed reaches up to a maximum of 600 metres per hour.” says Prof. R. Adhikari from Department of Physics at IMSc, Chennai who is one of the corresponding authors of the paper, in an email to The Hindu.
In a paper to be published in the journal Nanoscale, the researchers have shown that another type of nanomotor in the form of a sphere (using titanium dioxide, heptamolybdate and gold) can also be used for delivering a catalyst to a particular area of interest by using visible light. The nanospheres were found to move away from visible light. “The catalyst triggers a reaction and the pollutants get adsorbed on the nanospheres leading to quickly removal of organic pollutants from water. The solution can then be filtered, dried and the nanosphere can be retrieved,” says Apabrita Mallick, an Integrated PhD student at IISER Kolkata and one of the first authors of the paper.

Real-time monitoring of KSRTC schedules begins
","The Kerala State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) has started keeping tabs on its fleet and collection of each schedule and that of depots on real-time basis with General Packet Radio Service (GPRS)-enabled Electronic Ticketing Machines (ETMs) carried by the conductors.
The supply of 2,000 new-generation ETMs in the Thiruvananthapuram zone of the transport utility has been completed.
With this, the corporation is in possession of information such as number of tickets sold between bus stops, frequency of the service, and running time of the buses operating from the 21 depots in the zone.
Training for ATOsTraining has been provided to Assistant Transport Officers (ATOs), who have been entrusted with the task of monitoring the services at the depot level.
The bus crew have started rising to the occasion after some were pulled up for bunching of services and tailing parallel services when the training of the ATOs was on.
“We have provided another 300 ETMs across the State till date. The remaining 1700 ETMs will be supplied to the other four zones — Kollam, Ernakulam, Thrissur and Kozhikode — to complete the project by June,” a top official of the KSRTC told The Hindu here.
The ETMs feed a wealth of information to allow effective planning of schedules and cater to the needs of commuters.
As real-time data transfer takes place from the ETMs directly to the control room, the authorities can keep tabs on the collection of each schedule at the zonal level and at the control room too.
The authorities can text messages to the ETMs that are equipped with the SIM of Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd. The mobile number of the crew is fed into the system so that they can be contacted in case of emergency or to pass on information while the bus is running.
The new ETMs were initially used on the Pampa-Nilakkal chain services during the last Mandala-Makaravilakku season at Sabarimala to check operational efficiency and overcome teething problems.
The facility will help avoid bunching of services and trip curtailment. Each ETM, supplied by a Bangalore-based firm, costs Rs.9,500, and the corporation has spent Rs.3.8 crore from the Plan fund for replacing the old ones, which are over five years’ old.
The introduction of the ETMs is part of a technology upgrade being worked out to streamline services and tide over financial crises.

Upstart: Pinnacles and pitfalls
"," Here is how it goes down usually: You’re a very smart person. Everything you’ve done in school and college reinforces that. Class topping, school topping, state topping marks all the time. You clear through the hoops and hurdles that entrance exams pose easily enough. You land an excellent job straight out of college. You do well there too, just by going through the motions. Ennui strikes soon enough, and if you are close enough to the age of 30 and still with very little real responsibility, this is when the idea of taking the risks associated with starting up seem not all that scary. 
So you dive into it. You start your own company. Alone, or maybe with one or two people whom you thought you could trust in and would share the same burdens — banal, legal, intellectual, and whatever else that starting up entails — as you in an equal manner, or more often than not, in an equitable manner based on how you are slicing up the ownership of the company. Given your track record through school, college, and the job or jobs you have held, you expect this startup to be a success every which way. Just that, despite everything, the startup turns out to be an utter failure. Some do not bother about that. They move on, to either another startup if they have the security cushion for that, or to something stabler (which usually means a job at a large company), where they can, at the very least, sustain themselves and make enough money to live well. And then you also have a significant percentage of such people who take the failure of their startup very badly.
The Indian startup ecosystem, for better or worse, trails trends of the Silicon Valley startup ecosystem by a few years. In this particular case, it is definitely for the better. An award-winning article by journalist Jessica Bruder, titled bluntly enough ‘The Psychological Price of Entrepreneurship’, and written way back in September of 2013, took an in-depth look at a problem that was plaguing the Bay Area startup world back then. Starting up was brutal. Not on your finances, but on your peace of mind. The exaggerated and aggrandised hero worship of success stories such as those of Mark Zuckerberg or Elon Musk had meant that anything less stellar was failure. And for people used to success all the time, this hit hard. Now, three or four years after this phenomenon had peaked in the Silicon Valley, I am seeing it more and more in the Indian startup ecosystem. At this point, it remains anecdotal and not backed by any comprehensive data, but the volume of anecdata that I seem to have gathered rings many alarm bells.
So, before this actually becomes the sort of epidemic it played out in the Bay Area — and I personally know some half a dozen people who were affected by it — I hope that the structures that support the Indian startup ecosystem realise the danger of what such a breakout can do, and make sure that it has the right safety nets for those who fall off the tightrope walk that entrepreneurship often can be.

Over 500 genes linked to intelligence identified "," Scientists have identified over 500 genes linked to intelligence after comparing DNA variations in more than 240,000 people from around the world.
 The study, published in the journal Molecular Psychiatry, sheds new light on the biological building blocks of people’s differences in intelligence. Researchers from Harvard University in the US, University of Edinburgh and University of Southampton in the UK identified 538 genes that play a role in intellectual ability.
 They also found 187 regions in the human genome that are linked to thinking skills. Genes found to be linked to intelligence also appeared to influence other biological processes, researchers said. Some genes linked to intellectual ability are also associated with living longer, scientists found. They also found that genes linked with problem solving powers were associated with the process by which neurons carry signals from one place to another in the brain.
 Using these genetic discoveries, scientists predicted seven per cent of intelligence differences in an independent group of individuals using their DNA alone.
“Our study identified a large number of genes linked to intelligence,” said David Hill from University of Edinburgh. “We were also able to identify some of the biological processes that genetic variation appears to influence to produce such differences in intelligence, and we were also able to predict intelligence in another group using only their DNA.” 
“We know that environments and genes both contribute to the differences we observe in people’s intelligence,” said Ian Deary, from University of Edinburgh. “This study adds to what we know about which genes influence intelligence, and suggests that health and intelligence are related in part because some of the same genes influence them.”

Conquering the emperor of maladies "," The title that the cancer specialist, Dr Siddhartha Mukherjee chose for his Pulitzer-prize winner book on cancer was “The Emperor of All Maladies.” It signifies both the awe and a sportsman-like admiration of the challenge posed by the opponent, cancer. Earlier in 1971, President Richard Nixon of the US, on a similar vein, declared a “war on cancer,” with a federal funding of $1.4 billion. And over these 47 years, the US National Cancer Institute alone has spent $90 billion on the war on cancer. We are yet to win.
Each year, 1.73 million new cancer cases are reported in the US, with apparently one cancer death every 20 minutes. In India, it is 2.5 million people, with one death every 8 minutes. It is thus urgent and vital that solutions be found for this deadly disease, which has been with us since the dawn of civilisation.
Cancer occurs when an otherwise healthy cell is damaged, leading to uncontrolled growth, affecting the health of the body. Damage can occur either because of inborn or inherited errors in one or more genes affecting the cell, or due to lifestyle and environmental factors. While normal cells are programmed to multiply and grow to a certain size and stay so, cancer cells, whose DNA is mutated by such damage, go on rampant growth leading to tumours. The cancer specialist removes these errant cancer cells and tumour by medication or surgery. But the big challenge is not the first treatment alone, but that it should not recur and/or metastasise (move to and affect other parts of the body). The fight against cancer is thus to uproot the cause of the damage once and for all.
Immunity
It is here that we turn to the in-built defense mechanisms in the body. These are through the immune system, which is a complex network of cells, tissues and the molecules they make to help in fighting infections and other diseases, including cancer. White blood cells play the main role here. In particular, there is the group of cells called B-lymphocytes which recognise the shape of the molecules in the invader, and make proteins called antibodies which lock on to the invader and removes it. (Importantly, this shape is ‘remembered’ so that when a fresh attack by this same invader occurs, B cells are prepared!) Another set called T cells release chemicals that push the invading cells to commit suicide. In this process, these T-killer cells are aided by a group called T-helper cells. In addition, there is another group called dendritic cells which help activate both the B- cells and T-killer cells, enabling them to respond to specific threats. 
Each cell has on its surface a little marker, a small molecular ID- card or a biometric, called an antigen. These are small molecular fragments found on the cell surface. Antigens in the normal cells of the body are recognized as “self” by the immune system of the body and left alone. But when “foreign” cells such as those of an invading microbe or virus enter the system, their ‘non-self’ antigens are detected, attacked and thrown out of the body by the B and T lymphocytes.
This is also the basis of vaccines. In a vaccine, we introduce the disease- causing germs (either in the dead from or highly- disabled “live” form) into the body. This causes the immune system to recognise the “non-self” foreign antigen, grab it (using the antibody proteins) and throw it out of the body. Plus, the immune system ‘remembers’ this non-self antigen and when the invader comes again, has the B cells make antibodies against it and remove it from the system, thus offering protection for a long time. This is the basis behind vaccination against many diseases, including cancer-causing viruses such as human papilloma virus (HPV) and the hepatitis B and C viruses.
Once bitten, twice prepared
How is this relevant to other forms of cancer? Cancer cells too have antigens on their surface. These form the cancer-associated antigens, including some that have not been seen previously by the body’s immune system. These are called neo-antigens. They are foreign to the body, and come from the invader. 
In the current excitement on the cure of the cancer, this idea of using our immune system and make an anti-cancer vaccine is on the high table. This is not a preventive vaccine (as the HPV or hepatitis vaccines are) but a therapeutic (or treatment) vaccine. Here, the doctor first treats the cancer by existing methods. In order that it does not recur, nor metastasise, he/she then takes a piece of the cancer tissue from the patient, and has the neo-antigens identified. Next, he/she works with a group of scientists who use computer methods to check which fragment will trigger the patient’s immune system best to fight the cancer cells. The so-chosen neo-antigen is used to make the vaccine, and once the vaccine is made, use it on the patients to protect them from further recurrence of the illness and thus get rid of the cancer, hopefully forever.
Some cancer vaccines are already in the market; for example, HER2 against breast cancer, Provenge against prostate cancer, and T-VEC against melanoma. Increasingly though, some researchers want to read the patient’s genome, sequence the DNA or RNA of the tumor there, identify the mutations therein and make a specially constructed ‘personalised’ vaccine for the individual. The emperor may hit and maul. But now that we are adopting the Boys Scouts slogan, “Be Prepared”, will his days be numbered?

IIT Kanpur researchers find why babies need to move in the womb
","Formation of joints in the developing embryo and their maintenance after birth is sensitive to mechanical movement. Now, researchers at Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kanpur have deciphered the molecular mechanism underlying this phenomenon. They have demonstrated how permanent cartilage is formed in an embryo due to mechanical movement. They also found out how permanent cartilage is lost and temporary or transient cartilage is formed in its place in the absence of movement.
While permanent cartilage lines the joint, the transient cartilage is a bone-forming one. Earlier this group demonstrated that during embryonic development, a bipotential cartilage population gives rise to both permanent and transient cartilage. BMP and Wnt are two major signals regulating this process. While BMP promotes transient cartilage formation, Wnt promotes permanent cartilage formation.
In patients with osteoarthritis, the permanent cartilage acquires all the characteristics of a temporary cartilage, which affects joint function. Currently, in people with osteoarthritis, it is not possible to reverse the fate of permanent cartilage that has become a temporary-like cartilage. The work done by a team led by Prof. Amitabha Bandyopadhyay from the Department of Biological Sciences and Bioengineering at IIT Kanpur suggests that it might be possible to prevent osteoarthritis from worsening if intervened at an early stage. The results were published in the journal Development. The work was carried out in collaboration with the laboratory of Prof. Paula Murphy of Trinity College Dublin.
BMP signaling — which helps in the formation of transient cartilage — is normally not present in permanent cartilage cells in a joint. That transient cartilage forms in the place of permanent cartilage due to joint immobilisation was already known. And independently, the team had shown that BMP signalling promotes transient cartilage formation. “So we wanted to find out if immobilising the joints in a chick embryo allows the BMP signaling to come up in the joint cartilage cells. We did find that happening,” Prof. Bandyopadhyay says.
The investigation into what causes the BMP signaling to be present in future permanent cartilage cells when the joint is immobilised led them to a surprise finding. The lead author, Pratik Singh, found out that an inhibitor of BMP signaling (Smurf1) is absent in the joint that is immobilised resulting in increased BMP signaling. “The role of the Smurf1 inhibitor is to maintain a BMP-free area thereby enabling the progenitor cells to become permanent cartilage. But due to increased BMP signaling the permanent cartilage gets converted into transient-like cartilage,” says Prof. Bandyopadhyay.
The Smurf1 inhibitor is not directly involved in joint cartilage formation but creates an environment that permits the formation of permanent cartilage by keeping the BMP signalling under check. Mechanical movement seems to act like a toggle switch. In the presence of it, Wnt – the signal that promotes joint cartilage – is on and BMP signalling is off in the joint cartilage cells. The opposite is true when the joint is immobilized. This is the reason why immobilisation of joints causes greater disturbance to permanent cartilage than even inhibition of Wnt signalling.
“We are now investigating if osteoarthritis is also associated with appearance of BMP signalling in the wrong place. If so, we can block the BMP signaling in these cells during the early-stage of osteoarthritis to possibly prevent the condition from worsening,” he says.

Indian-origin mathematician Akshay Venkatesh gets prestigious Fields Medal ","Akshay Venkatesh, a renowned Indian-Australian mathematician, is one of four winners of mathematics’ prestigious Fields medal, known as the Nobel prize for math.
New Delhi-born Venkatesh, 36, who is currently teaching at Stanford University, has won the Fields Medal for his profound contributions to an exceptionally broad range of subjects in mathematics.
The Fields medals are awarded every four years to the most promising mathematicians under the age of 40. The prize was inaugurated in 1932 at the request of Canadian mathematician John Charles Fields, who ran the 1924 Mathematics Congress in Toronto. Each winner receives a 15,000 Canadian-dollar cash prize. At least two, and preferably four people, are always honoured in the award ceremony.



The Hindu Quiz: How well do you know the Fields medal?


The citation for Venkatesh’s medal — awarded on Thursday at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Rio de Janeiro — highlights his profound contributions to an exceptionally broad range of subjects in mathematics and his strikingly far-reaching conjectures.
The other three winners are: Caucher Birkar, a Cambridge University professor of Iranian Kurdish origin; Germany’s Peter Scholze, who teaches at the University of Bonn and Alessio Figalli, an Italian mathematician at ETH Zurich.
Upsetting the celebration, someone stole Birkar’s medal after the awards ceremony. Organizers said they were cooperating with authorities to retrieve the prize.
Birkar, a Kurdish refugee from Iran teaching at Cambridge University, put the gold medal, worth around $4,000, in a briefcase and soon afterward realized that it had been stolen, according to event organizers.
Security officials at the Riocentro venue, Riocentro, found the empty briefcase in a nearby pavillion. Police reviewed security tapes and identified two potential suspects.
“The International Congress of Mathematicians is profoundly sorry about the disappearance of the briefcase belonging to mathematician Caucher Birkar, which contained his Fields Medal from the ceremony this morning,” organizers said in a note.
From being a child prodigy to becoming one of the most renowned researchers in the field of mathematics, Venkatesh’s journey has been full of achievements and accolades.
He moved to Perth, Australia, with his parents when he was 2.
He participated in physics and math Olympiads — the premier international competitions for high school students — and won medals in the two subjects at ages 11 and 12, respectively.
He finished high school when he was 13 and went to the University of Western Australia, graduating with first class honours in mathematics in 1997, at the age of 16.
In 2002, he earned his PhD at the age of 20. Since then, he has gone from holding a post-doctoral position at MIT to becoming a Clay Research Fellow and, now a professor at Stanford University.
Venkatesh has worked at the highest level in number theory, arithmetic geometry, topology, automorphic forms and ergodic theory.
His research has been recognized with many awards, including the Ostrowski Prize, the Infosys Prize, the Salem Prize and Sastra Ramanujan Prize.

What is cryptojacking and how can it infect your computer?
","The transition to a digital economy has rendered financial services more dependent on technology, and the maintenance of a robust framework to protect personal information has acquired greater importance. The already difficult task of keeping pace with hackers trying to access online finances has become even more complicated with the emergence of cryptocurrencies. It has spawned a new breed of hackers – cryptojackers. To understand cryptojackers, however, you need to understand cryptocurrency miners.
Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are based on a technology called blockchain, which involves maintaining a digital ledger to publicly record transactions.
A blockchain is reliant on the network of computers that run the software for the cryptocurrency. The computers participate in the relay of information regarding transactions made between holders of the currency. These computers, called nodes, can be operated by anyone who downloads the bitcoin software available for free online. When a transaction is initiated, encrypted details are transmitted among all nodes.




This web of nodes includes those operated by miners, whose objective is to group the outstanding transactions into blocks and then add them to the blockchain, since doing this involves a reward. Adding encrypted transactions to the blockchain is accomplished by the miner's cryptocurrency software solving a complex mathematical puzzle involving the numerical keys to the encryption.
Once a node has hit upon the right combination, it conveys its success to other nodes. Subsequently, other miners drop processing that block and move on to the next. The winning node that registers a transaction by adding it to the blockchain is rewarded in Bitcoin.
Often, the cost of mining becomes prohibitive since high-end machines with substantial computing power are required to solve the puzzle in a timely manner. The electricity required to power the hardware is also considerable, adding to the cost.
Cryptocurrencies are a boon for individuals or corporations which seek financial anonymity. The lack of a central regulatory authority has made it possible for trade in illegal goods to happen through the virtual currencies. However, exchanges that trade bitcoin have witnessed massive fluctuation in prices owing to speculation. The trade in bitcoin remains lucrative.
The valuation of a single bitcoin was ₹65,693 on January 1, 2017. Its value had peaked at ₹12,59,942 in December 2017, before conceding gains owing to factors such as governments proposing laws to outlaw cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin was valued at ₹7,40,376 at the time of writing. This implies that if a lakh of rupees was invested in bitcoin in January 2017, it would have yielded ₹19.17 lakh at the end of the calendar year.




Another way to have to a piece of the cryptocurrency pie is by leveraging hardware assets to mine for coins. The software for mining cryptocurrencies like bitcoin are open source and are available online. Applications that can be used for the same include Bitcoin Miner (which is available for free download on Windows through the Microsoft Store) and Easy Miner, among others. However, the hardware processing speed required to make mining a feasible are found only in high-end workstations that are powered by GPUs. Hence lone-wolf miners are a rare tribe in the sooty underbelly of the dark web.
The latest threat to computers worldwide is the rise of cryptojacking. The phenomenon is not restricted to the miniscule minority that trades in cryptocurrencies or uses their systems to mine for coins. All users who browse the internet are vulnerable to their systems being ‘cryptojacked’.
To work around the cost overruns that diminish the lustre of mining as a lucrative proposition, attackers have taken to employing malware to force an entry into the computers of remote users, and then using their hardware to mine for coins. This form of distributed computing can be profitable since it eliminates the cost burden of owning a mining rig with hundreds of processors. With more people on the Internet than ever before, there is greater computing power -- be it through desktops, laptops, tablets, or even mobile devices -- that can be maliciously subverted without the knowledge of their owners.
Cryptojackers usually target popular websites which draw audiences numbering in the millions every day. Once the malware patch has been embedded on a website, it infects the web browsers of visitors, slowing down their machines, often causing them to overheat.
Websites and apps which do not seemingly charge a fee for your consuming their content survive on revenue from digital advertising. However, websites like the file-sharing platform Pirate Bay have been found to be employing code which hijacks your system and uses it for mining Monero – a cryptocurrency whose value has almost increased fivefold in the past six months.
Many websites view this as an alternative source of revenue, bypassing intrusive advertisements. In return for content and services, proprietors of websites farm out processors located in disparate geographic locations to mine cryptocurrencies. Coinhive is a tool that allows companies to ‘monetize their digital business with their users’ CPU power.’ The tool patches the JavaScript for the website’s pages, enabling it to stealthily access the hardware of its users without their knowledge.
According to digital security firm Wandera, scripts like Coinhive can be embedded on to any app or website, and that users of social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and Pinterest are exposed to links containing malicious scripts. The increase in number of mobile devices which are being used to access the internet has also put a large segment of devices running on relatively open environments such as Android at risk of being infected. Wandera found that mobile devices that fell prey to cryptojacking websites and apps increased by 287% between October and November 2017.
Apple’s iPhones are also vulnerable to being cryptojacked. Wandera researchers found that an iPhone 7 which had a browser tab infected by Coinhive open for two hours, would result in the battery being completely depleted. It was also found that the temperature increased by 20 degrees Celsius from the ambient core temperature when the processor was used for mining at the behest of cryptojackers.
Most of the websites that have been found to use staelth to mine bitcoins on remote systems, use Coinhive. Despite the burgeoning processing power of handheld devices, laptops and desktops possess greater muscle to cruch the numbers required to solve hash functions for mining. Here is a list of applications that could protect your computer from attacks by cryptojackers.
1. NoCoin




It is an extension that can be loaded on web browsers like Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Opera. In addition to Coinhive, it provides security against other mining software which mine for bitcoin, ethereum, and ripple. However, it also allows users to turn off protection for certain websites. This provision gives users the authority to wilfully trade their processing power for the services offered by a particular website. NoCoin is an open source tool, the code to which is available on Github.
2. MalwareBytes




Unlike NoCoin, this a software package that acts as a bulwark against a wide variety of malware, and also hackers who try to breach private networks. It is an enterprise software with versions for both personal and professional use. The company boasts that its product detected and quarantined 1,30,000 WannaCry ransomware infections in the first week of its outbreak. Corporate networks are at greater risk to cryptojacking since the the terminals are usually interlinked and possess advanced hardware. MalwareBytes also allows users to remove particular domains or IP addresses from its block list.
3. minerBlock




minerBlock is another anti-mining browser extension that can block cryptojacking attempts by software patches on websites. It maintains a blacklist of compromised websites, and lets users manually add to this list. It is particularly effective in combating code snippets that may be hidden inline in web pages. This extension can block, as well as defuse attacks that have previously breached a system's firewall.
While these tools are not completely infallible, they provide a first line of defence against potential security breaches. Given the dependence of critical personal information on technology, the consequences of voluntarily, or involuntarily letting cryptominers trespass on your computing real estate can be far-reaching.

Creating a visual map of monsoons and bird migrations
"," The pied cuckoo, sometimes called the rain bird, is a migrant, and much like migrants across the world, is seen as having mystical qualities. Every year, in a wide curve, the pied cuckoo follows the south-westerly winds that blow in across the Indian Ocean, leaving Africa for the Indian subcontinent. If you believe folklore, the bird brings the rains. 
Of course, we don’t care to any more, because, “We have systematically been educated out of our connections with nature,” says M D Madhusudan, Scientist and Co-founder at the Nature Conservation Foundation (NCF), a non-profit based out of Mysuru. 
Madhusudan himself is a bit of a storyteller, who talks of Kalidas’ Meghdoota, which tells of the long wait for the rain by everyone from the black-and-white bird to the poet with a pitcher. The scientist combines this with a recent interest in how data can be represented visually to communicate complex concepts to the layperson. He says he’s simply following through on an effort first initiated by his colleague, Dr Suhel Quader, in 2011.
The human connect
Legends, songs, parables, have all told of the migration of the pied cuckoo, some from within south India, some from Africa. But tracking the movement of birds is not easy. “If a single scientist were to track a bird species like the pied cuckoo across hundreds of thousands of square kilometres and over many years, can you imagine the number of people that would have to be employed to gather such data,” he asks. Instead, scientists have partnered with thousands of enthusiastic birdwatchers across the country to form a citizen-science network. Not only does such collaboration yield insights into the distribution and abundance of birds, it also helps in understanding large-scale phenomena, such as patterns of bird migration. “It is only with the data collected by thousands of citizen birdwatchers over many years, that such a visualisation on a continental scale is even possible.”


All you need to track birds is a pair of binoculars and a smartphone, with the eBird app. You get on a platform, provided in this case by The Cornell Lab of Ornithology, Cornell University, and start recording. This open-access global citizen-science project enables you to see your own data, plus country-wide and worldwide data, of all birds. You can look at hotspots and even donate to the cause. If you look for the pied cuckoo, you’ll see that its sightings in Delhi, for instance, peak in July and September. “When large numbers of people participate in such an effort regularly, it becomes possible even to track the timing and progress of bird migration,” he says.
The tech connect
Allison Lieber, Program Manager, Google Earth Outreach says that “Many natural phenomena and events remain understood only to people in specific regions, but with the interactive map stories published in Earth’s Voyager feature, anyone around the world can learn about the implications of such events.” It can be used by anyone from armchair travellers to educators and students who want to learn more about the world, but it is also useful for NGOs and journalists. 
Google Earth Engine is a planetary-scale remote-sensing analyses platform. In simple terms: “It is a huge archive of public data, co-located with powerful computing infrastructure, that can run complex algorithms efficiently on very large data sets just using the browser on your computer. Scientists today can access and analyse data without necessarily having to download a single file,” says Madhusudan. Put poetically, by Lieber, it is “a visualization and storytelling platform built to inspire curious minds to explore, learn and care about our vast, fragile planet.” 




The data of interest for the pied cuckoo project used 37 years of rainfall data from the Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station (CHIRPS) dataset from the University of California, Santa Barbara. The data is represented as an image for each day of the year, with each pixel in the image storing a value for the amount of rainfall that has fallen on a certain region on earth on a given day. Google Earth Engine is then able to perform computations on these values. So, for a given place, you can analyse 37 years of daily rainfall data and boil it down to an average value for each day of the year.




Madhusudan analysed the two data sets — of the monsoon, and of the pied cuckoo distribution. “The resulting map has two layers: the ‘blue’ layer of the monsoon leverages satellite technology and the formidable computing capabilities of Google Earth Engine, whereas the ‘red’ layer, depicting the pied cuckoo distribution comes from far humbler sources — thousands of birdwatchers around the country,” he says. 
So does the movement of the pied cuckoo coincide with the monsoon? The data speaks for itself. The answer is yes. What is it about the pied cuckoo though? Much like a migrant, it builds bridges — to a deeper understanding of life beyond ourselves, and yet, connected with us.

NASA rover data shows Mars had organic compounds, methane
"," Curiosity rover has detected a bonanza of organic compounds on the surface of Mars and seasonal fluctuations of atmospheric methane. The findings released on June 7, mark some of the strongest evidence ever that Earth's neighbour may have harbored life.
But NASA scientists emphasized there could be nonbiological explanations for both discoveries made by the Curiosity rover at a site called Gale crater, leaving the issue of Martian life a tantalizing but unanswered question.
Three different types of organic molecules were discovered when the rover dug just 5 cm into roughly 3.5 billion-year-old mudstone, a fine-grained sedimentary rock, at Gale crater, apparently the site of a large lake when ancient Mars was warmer and wetter than the desolate planet it is today.
Curiosity also measured an unexpectedly large seasonal cycle in the low levels of atmospheric methane. About 95 % of the methane in Earth's atmosphere is produced from biological activity, though the scientists said it is too soon to know if the Martian methane also is related to life. Organic molecules are the building blocks of life, though they can also be produced by chemical reactions unrelated to life. The scientists said it is premature to know whether or not the compounds were created in biological processes.
Whether anywhere other than Earth has harbored life, perhaps even in microbial form, is one of the paramount questions in science.
“There's three possible sources for the organic material,” said astrobiologist Jennifer Eigenbrode of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland. “The first one would be life, which we don't know about. The second would be meteorites. And the last one is geological processes, meaning the rock-forming processes themselves.”
“What the organic detections in the rock do is to add to the story of habitability. It tells us that this ancient environment on Mars could have supported life,” Eigenbrode said. “Everything that was needed to support life was there. But it doesn't tell us that life was there.”
Christopher Webster, an atmospheric science research fellow at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California, said it is possible existing microbes are contributing to the Martian atmospheric methane. “With this new data, we again cannot rule out microbial activity as a potential source.”
The amount of methane peaked at the end of summer in the northern hemisphere at about 2.7 times the level of the lowest seasonal amount. The scientists were surprised to find organic compounds, especially in the amounts detected, considering the harsh conditions, including bombardment of solar radiation on the Martian surface. 
After drilling, Curiosity heats the rock samples, releasing the compounds. Referring to the findings regarding organic compounds and methane, Webster said, “They hint at an earlier time on Mars when water was present and the existence of primitive life forms was possible.”
The scientists hope to find better preserved organic compounds with Curiosity or other rovers that would allow them to check for chemical signatures of life.
The research was published in the journal Science.

Indian role in producing super-heavy element 117
","On May 1, 2014, Physical Review Letters confirmed the existence of a new super-heavy element 117. Super-heavy elements are elements beyond atomic number 104. They do not exist in nature.
It is a memorable day for scientists in India. Drs Susant Lahiri and Moumita Maiti from the Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics (SINP) joined the other international collaborators led by Professor Christoph Duellmann at GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research, in carrying out the historic experiment. Presently, Dr Maiti works in the Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee.
A few atoms of the super heavy element emerged when calcium-48 ions at high energies impinged on a specially prepared target of berkelium-249 (Bk). Presently, researchers call the element ununseptium for its 117 protons (20 protons of calcium and 97 from Bk). An atom of element 117 is 40 per cent heavier than an atom of lead.
The international team consisted of 72 scientists and engineers from 16 institutions in Australia, Finland, Germany, India, Norway, Poland, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States.
Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) in the U.S. produced 13 mg of berkelium-249 (half life of 330 days), a heavy element over an 18- month campaign by neutron irradiation at its High Flux Isotope Reactor. ORNL chemically separated and purified the isotope before shipping it to Mainz University which made the special target assembly that could withstand the intense calcium ion beams from the GSI accelerator.
Drs.Maiti and Lahiri estimated that the cost of 33mg of Bk is about $ 7.4 million. They also revealed that it was loaned to GSI.
How many of these nuclei have been produced to date? Is there a scientific need for producing more of these nuclei?
“Previous to our experiment, experimenters working at the accelerator laboratory in Russia, Dubna, have reported the observation of four atoms of the nuclei of the element 117 isotope with a mass number of 294 ....The main interest in the current generation of experiments lies in the proof that an atomic nucleus with 117 protons can exist, which means that element 117 exists,” said Prof. Christoph Duellmann, the group leader of the team and Professor at Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz. “Whether more data are needed for such a proof, will be decided by the joint working party of the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry and the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics, which reviews claims for the discovery of new elements and makes a judgment if the presently available data are sufficient or not.”
About any practical applications if follow up research leads to the discovery of more super-heavy elements, Prof. Duellmann said: “This cannot be foreseen at the moment. The study of super-heavy elements is currently a purely fundamental research topic. If future generations of scientists will succeed to synthesize much more stable super-heavy elements, maybe even in larger quantities, new materials would naturally be found: for example a solid block of element 117?
What will its properties be? Will it be more useful for certain applications than other known materials? “While I do not expect that the possibility of producing such quantities in the next decades, new avenues for the production of super-heavy elements may eventually be found and open these exciting prospects. If we look back only 100 years, the expectation to ever study element 117 did not yet exist.
“Hundred years later, we study its production and some of its properties. For other super-heavy elements, like flerovium (element 114), first chemical studies are conducted, with single atom quantities. The prospect that in the future it may be possible to find new materials is very fascinating.” Dr Duellmann hoped.
“The Indian team shared significantly and with responsibility, five and half months-long round the clock beam time at GSI, Darmstadt, Germany.” Dr Lahiri stated.

The Sydney Morning Herald claimed that the Australian researchers have co-created element 117; it is legitimate to call Lahiri and Maiti also the co-creators of the element.
So how did the collaboration between SINP and GSI Helmholtz Centre start? “On my personal endeavour, I started this collaboration with GSI Nuclear chemistry group, whose present spokesperson is Professor Christoph E. Duellmann” Dr Lahiri said. The Department of Atomic Energy funded SINP to carry out this and similar projects.
“It is now for more than 10 years that we are involved in the Super-Heavy Element (SHE) research (chemistry and physics of SHEs). The present result is a part of our continuous endeavour,” he added.

Small launcher will have a big impact
"," A small Indian satellite launch vehicle that was made in three days by a handful of people at about 10% of current costs looks set to revolutionise the global satellite launch industry.
The SSLV (small satellite launch vehicle) is being developed at a furious pace at ISRO’s Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre. The SSLV will be an on-demand rocket for small satellites weighing about 500-700 kg. It will be autonomous and highly intelligent, versatile and capable of adapting to different launch situations and requirements. 
Its first test launch is planned for mid-2019. Once proven, the SSLV’s production would be offered to industry through Antrix Corporation, according to ISRO Chairman K. Sivan. 
The SSLV is said to be Dr. Sivan’s dream concept for a quick-response space vehicle, and the project was initiated when he was the Director of the VSSC until January this year.

Prysm technology: Starship enterprise
","These days, sophisticated networking platforms interconnect employees of an organisation so well that it doesn’t matter where people work from. However, there are occasions when a project demands the active collaboration of external subject experts, who are not employees. When the success of a project could hinge on how well these experts are integrated into the internal business ecosystem, you need something more.
One of the leading providers of collaborative workplace solutions is Prysm. On the ‘Prysm screen’, any type of content can be projected at the same time: Word, PDF, PPT, worksheet, video, and more. They can all be mirrored on different devices, moved around on the screen, edited by people at different places simultaneously in real time, making it a digital visual workplace that is a platform of platforms.




The key component of this technology is Laser Phosphor Display, patented by Prysm. Light from ultraviolet lasers is directed onto a screen that is coated with colour phosphor stripes. Phosphors are activated by the energy of the lasers, thereby producing an image.
The advantages of this system are: the screen is made up of tiles, so it can be easily customised; there is no distortion of images if you change their original size; images are clearly visible when viewed from any angle; and the system consumes very low amounts of power.
Guest mode
One of the new features is the ‘guest mode’. Imagine that a bank is using Prysm technology. The guest mode allows a person who is not an employee, to join the organisation’s internal system using an access code. The guest will be able to perform most functions that the employees can, except download content. The guest will have access, until it’s revoked, says GB Kumar, Vice President, APAC, Prysm Inc, while explaining the new features of the technology, at the company’s Bengaluru office.
Another update is ‘live source’ video streaming from any number of sources. “Ten screens can open up on the Prysm screen showing video content. Anyone can edit or annotate any of the screens,” said Kumar.
One of the big pluses of the Prysm technology is that it is third-party agnostic. It is compatible with existing collaboration platforms as well as video conferencing solutions from Cisco, Polycom, Skype for Business or Lifesize.
‘Co-browsing’ is another feature recently added. It allows different people in different locations to interact with the same web page or browser session simultaneously. In other words, all team members have the same view of the web content, and they work collaboratively on the same project. This is similar to what Microsoft OneDrive or Google Drive does, but on a much bigger scale, at an enterprise level.
Flexible system
Prysm technology powers many Fortune 1000 companies, and its customers belong to different industries including technology, energy, finance, healthcare, media and education. The company recently partnered with Vega Global for the APAC region. It has also tied up with Dell EMC for technology solutions for smart cities in India. Recently, it acquired Kaybus, a startup which is into the enterprise knowledge automation software.
The flexibility of the system — which provides the same laser phosphor display experience on an ordinary touch display system — is an advantage that is fuelling wide adoption of the technology. “It works for organisations like banks that have many branches across the country. The customer needn’t buy our screen. They get the collaboration appliance from us, which provides the same experience on the screen they have. So, the cost comes down drastically,” says Kumar.
He says customer experience centres have seen good deployment of this solution. “This is a new way of storytelling. It’s not like running just a PPT. We allow multiple collaborative applications to run simultaneously on a single platform accessible from anywhere on any device,” he said.
Other segments that have deployed the solution are global companies that have a base in India, Indian MNCs that have global operations, banking and financial companies, innovation centres, command and control centres of large Indian conglomerates, smart campuses, manufacturing and automobile companies, operations centres where brainstorming is key, and television studios.

Actual problems are solved only by ‘whole men’ ","“If you have ever had a medical procedure, chances are you are benefited from the arts. The stethoscope was invented by a French flautist–physician named Rene Laennec who recorded his first observations of heart sounds in musical notation”. Thus begins an article by the physiologist Dr Robert Root-Bernstein in the July 6, 2018 issue of Science. He discusses how incorporating the humanities, arts, crafts and design into curricula makes better scientists. He points to the recent report released by the Board on Higher Education and Workforce of the US National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine (NASEM), which has recommended that humanities, arts, crafts, and design (HACD) be integrated with science, technology, engineering, mathematics and medicine (STEMM). Dr Root-Bernstein quotes the developmental biologist Conrad Waddington, who said: “The acute problems of the world can be solved only by whole men, not by people who refuse to be, publicly, anything more than a technologist or a scientist or an artist”; and Professor Charles West, President of the US National Academy of Engineering, who says: “Engineering systems cannot be wisely envisioned, designed or deployed without an understanding of society, culture, politics, economics, and communications - in other words, the very stuff of the liberal arts and also of the social sciences”.
India produces over 1.5 million engineering graduates every year, from 3,345 colleges and institutes. Sadly, a major portion of these graduates are not employable. As Ms. Maria Thomas wrote in the Economic Times last year, the rapid growth of India’s IT industry during the last three decades had led thousands of students, often pushed by their parents, to pursue a profession that often guaranteed wealth, status - and with same luck, a one way ticket out of the country. Likewise India produces 52,000 doctors (MBBS degree) every year from about 1,700 medical colleges. Over 6.3 lakh students take the pre-medical entrance tasks, and a significant number among them manage to get into private colleges, paying hefty sums. Here again, it is the parental push for better future for their children. The quality of most doctors, particularly in small towns and rural areas is well known. Most of them are ignoramuses when it comes to HACD. These are not what Dr Waddington termed as “whole men”.
Where does the deficiency lie? Right at the school level. Over the last seven decades, governments - both central and state - have abused the school system by fiddling around with the curricula, depriving schools of much needed money, appointing ill-qualified teachers through quota systems (many of them not bothering to come to schools), playing with the syllabus and myriad other modes of interference. Education analysts such as Pratham have shown that the government school system is so bad that an eighth class student cannot solve a fifth class problem, and a fifth class student is unable to answer a third class question. People have preferred sending their children to private schools, and these are money-making machines, not easily affordable by the lower middle class families. This, combined with the need for steady jobs and income for the child once he/she graduates, has played havoc with our education system, Thus were born coaching centres, run by the politically connected, which take students right at the secondary school level and send them through tortuous courses so that they may pass engineering and medical entrance examinations. And in none of these coach centres, nor in the schools, are students taught HCAD at any level, and those who successfully come out of these mechanised teaching factories are absorbed in the NITs, IITs or medical colleges, but with no ‘soft skills’. It is high time that the school system is revamped and HACD introduced from the very beginning.
It is with this deficiency in mind that the IITs, BITS Pilani, Manipal Academy of Higher Education, and a few others, have tried to make up through the introduction of ‘core courses’ in the first few semesters, where the students are taught language, literature, humanities and social sciences, arts and crafts, and design. Happily enough, several IITs now have actual departments in some of these subjects (besides technology and science departments) where faculty members teach and also do research in areas of HACD. (One beautiful example of this was the design of the convocation robes designed at the IIT Hyderabad last week, using Ikat stoles made by local weavers). These core courses at IITs and BITS are of some help. Similarly Christian Medical College at Vellore requires their graduating doctors to spend a year in rural India. Working in villages gives the young scholar a perspective of the community, its needs and its talents and enriches the mind. And professional IT companies offer months-long sessions to their trainees in generic and stream learning plus “soft skills”. What about the other technological and medical institutions?
Sadly, the Central Ministry of Higher Education does not appreciate the value of liberal arts and HCAD. A glaring display of this has been the identification of four institutions of technology, and one “green field” institute yet to be made, as Institutions of Eminence. Tellingly, not one university or institute devoted to HACD was thought of as eminent! What the government decides is eminent is at variance with what the professional scholars think.
Given this disconnect, here is one suggestion: why should some of these ‘green field’ institutes not concentrate on HCAD rather than more technology-based ones? Better yet, rather than start institutes, establish Trusts that catalyse and promotes HCAD?

Mobile nanotweezers can pick, drop live bacteria
","A team from Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru, has succeeded in designing a new class of mobile nanotweezers that can pick up, hold and move tiny cargo, the size of molecules, in a fluid. The work by Souvik Ghosh and Ambarish Ghosh of Centre for Nanoscience and Engineering, IISc, overcomes the earlier limitation of nanotweezers that were only able to trap and hold the molecules. Apart from nanoscale assembly – where tiny objects such as nanodiamonds or quantum dots need to be picked up and moved to a desired location — this has applications also in microfluidics, where live bacteria need to be manipulated and in biomedicine.
Picking up and moving molecules suspended in a fluid, such as a colloid, is a busy area of research. Plasmonic nanotweezers — nanosized tweezers made of noble metals, which have been studied so far to trap cargo, have the limitation that they are fixed in position. When they are illuminated by light, they develop a ‘potential gradient’ around them. This is like a slope, and nearby particles get attracted to the potential’s minimum just as things roll down a slope. However, the limitation is that it can only capture particles that are within the range of the field.
In the new work, the robotic, mobile nanotweezer can pick up tiny particles and move them over a short distance when the microrobots are subjected to an external magnetic field. “We can tune our trapping and releasing mechanism by subsequently turning the incident illumination on and off. To move these nanotweezers, we use a rotating magnetic field which rotates the helix [of the nanotweezer] and [moves it] like a cork-screw,” says Souvik Ghosh, first author of the study published in Science Robotics.
The colloidal particles move due to thermal fluctuations, therefore it is very difficult to manipulate the nanoparticles. Also as the size of the particles decreases, so, too, does the trapping force. The researchers’ main challenge was to overcome this and generate sufficient trapping force using a small amount of laser power. To achieve this, small helical structures are grown on a pre-patterned substrate by electron beam evaporation of silicon dioxide (made of mostly glass). “The substrate is kept at an extreme angle to the incoming vapour flux and rotated slowly to achieve the helical shape. Apart from glass, we also combine silver (plasmonic properties) and iron (magnetic properties) nanostructures at appropriate places on the helical body,” explains Souvik Ghosh, in an email to The Hindu.
As a next step, the team is working on parallelising the process. Thus, a series of microrobots will work together like an assembly line. “This will allow us to scale up our technology and will surely have commercial impact, and initial results are promising,” says Mr Ghosh.

Move on from fake news, U.S. is fighting 'deepfake' "," Hey, did my congressman really say that? Is that really President Donald Trump on that video, or am I being duped? 
New technology on the internet lets anyone make videos of real people appearing to say things they’ve never said. Republicans and Democrats predict this high-tech way of putting words in someone’s mouth will become the latest weapon in disinformation wars against the United States and other Western democracies. 
We’re not talking about lip-syncing videos. This technology uses facial mapping and artificial intelligence to produce videos that appear so genuine it’s hard to spot the phonies. Lawmakers and intelligence officials worry that the bogus videos called deepfakes could be used to threaten national security or interfere in elections. 
So far, that hasn’t happened, but experts say it’s not a question of if, but when. 
“I expect that here in the United States we will start to see this content in the upcoming midterms and national election two years from now,” said Hany Farid, a digital forensics expert at Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire. “The technology, of course, knows no borders, so I expect the impact to ripple around the globe.” 
When an average person can create a realistic fake video of the president saying anything they want, Farid said, “we have entered a new world where it is going to be difficult to know how to believe what we see.” The reverse is a concern, too. People may dismiss as fake genuine footage, say of a real atrocity, to score political points. 
Realizing the implications of the technology, the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency is already two years into a four-your programme to develop technologies that can detect fake images and videos. Right now, it takes extensive analysis to identify phony videos. It’s unclear if new ways to authenticate images or detect fakes will keep pace with deepfake technology.
Deepfakes are so named because they utilize deep learning, a form of artificial intelligence. They are made by feeding a computer an algorithm, or set of instructions, lots of images and audio of a certain person. The computer program learns how to mimic the person’s facial expressions, mannerisms, voice and inflections. If you have enough video and audio of someone, you can combine a fake video of the person with a fake audio and get them to say anything you want. 
So far, deepfakes have mostly been used to smear celebrities or as gags, but it’s easy to foresee a nation state using them for nefarious activities against the U.S., said Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., one of several members of the Senate intelligence committee who are expressing concern about deepfakes. 
A foreign intelligence agency could use the technology to produce a fake video of an American politician using a racial epithet or taking a bribe, Mr. Rubio says. They could use a fake video of a U.S. soldier massacring civilians overseas, or one of a U.S. official supposedly admitting a secret plan to carry out a conspiracy. Imagine a fake video of a U.S. leader or an official from North Korea or Iran warning the United States of an impending disaster. 
“It’s a weapon that could be used timed appropriately and placed appropriately in the same way fake news is used, except in a video form, which could create real chaos and instability on the eve of an election or a major decision of any sort,” Mr. Rubio told The Associated Press. 
Deepfake technology still has a few hitches. For instance, people’s blinking in fake videos may appear unnatural. But the technology is improving. 
“Within a year or two, it’s going to be really hard for a person to distinguish between a real video and a fake video,” said Andrew Grotto, an international security fellow at the Center for International Security and Cooperation at Stanford University in California. 
“This technology, I think, will be irresistible for nation states to use in disinformation campaigns to manipulate public opinion, deceive populations and undermine confidence in our institutions,” Grotto said. He called for government leaders and politicians to clearly say it has no place in civilized political debate. 
Crude videos have been used for malicious political purposes for years, so there’s no reason to believe the higher-tech ones, which are more realistic, won’t become tools in future disinformation campaigns. 
Mr. Rubio noted that in 2009, the U.S. Embassy in Moscow complained to the Russian Foreign Ministry about a fake sex video it said was made to damage the reputation of a U.S. diplomat. The video showed the married diplomat, who was a liaison to Russian religious and human rights groups, making telephone calls on a dark street. The video then showed the diplomat in his hotel room, scenes that apparently were shot with a hidden camera. Later, the video appeared to show a man and a woman having sex in the same room with the lights off, although it was not at all clear that the man was the diplomat. 
John Beyrle, who was the U.S. ambassador in Moscow at the time, blamed the Russian government for the video, which he said was clearly fabricated. 
Michael McFaul, who was American ambassador in Russia between 2012 and 2014, said Russia has engaged in disinformation videos against various political actors for years and that he too had been a target. He has said that Russian state propaganda inserted his face into photographs and “spliced my speeches to make me say things I never uttered and even accused me of pedophilia.”

Heart of the matter
"," The house of HyperX has been cranking out some excellent hardware of late. We’ve been particularly impressed by the Cloud line of gaming headphones the company produces, like the Cloud Revolver and Stinger, which produced great sound in addition to being some of the most comfortable headphones we’ve tested. Today, we have the HyperX Cloud Stinger Core in the house, and it’s time to see if it is cut from the same cloth as its peers. 
The Stinger Core is advertised as a headset for console gamers, with the packaging declaring its affiliation with PlayStation boldly. The headset itself, which features a plastic construction, comes with blue accents that further emphasise this relationship. 
The Core features a rather short cable, clearly meant to plug into a DualShock controller and keep things neat and tidy, and the cable features volume controls and a mic mute switch. The mic itself is attached to the left earcup, and while it can swivel, it is not the detachable kind. 
The Core, while decently comfortable, is a far cry from the rest of the Cloud line-up in terms of comfort. The rigid plastic construction and foam earcups press down rather hard on the ears and the crown of the headset also features only a small, thin cushion, making this the least comfortable headset in the line-up. The fact that they do not fold up in any way means portability is not their strong suit either. 
Sound, on the other hand, is quite good, and the Core reproduced most of the media we threw at it well. It provides a decent soundstage for music playback and we found it competent while gaming, picking up little environment details and isolating sound direction well.
All things considered, while we were a little disappointed with it on the comfort front, the Cloud Stinger Core’s redeeming factor is its price. Compared to even the regular Stinger and higher variants like the Revolver, the Core is priced at a very aggressive ₹3,000 (approximately), which makes some of these trade-offs acceptable. On the whole, it is a very competent package, though we do urge that you try and get your hands on one and try it on for size before investing in it.

Green energy boost for Africa
","Sub-Saharan Africa’s lack of electricity is hindering development but this can be reversed if countries turn to ambitious, large-scale renewable energy projects, an environmental think-tank suggests.
The region — home to 41 per cent of the world’s energy-poor people, with 65 per cent of primary schools and 30 per cent of health centres having no access to electricity — faces an energy crisis that development models are not addressing, according to a report by the Green Alliance.
“Even with robust economic growth, [the region’s] existing energy infrastructure is a brake on progress. With population growth continuing to outstrip electrification, the number of people without energy access is only projected to grow,” say the authors. “This has significant implications for development, with impacts on health, education and household economy. Disproportionate amounts of time and income are spent securing energy by other means, such as gathering wood, which also has detrimental impacts on the natural environment.
Low carbon, decentralised energy can reach communities much faster than expanding existing, inefficient central grid systems. And it offers immediate improvements to people’s lives. Projections for achieving universal energy access in sub-Saharan Africa acknowledge this potential and assume that just over half the provision will need to be mini and off-grid solutions. Such options will also be more resilient in the face of climate changes.”
The study was launched as the Labour party pledged to back clean power for Africa. Chuka Umunna MP, the shadow business secretary, said: “The green economy presents huge opportunities for dynamic and innovative British businesses to export overseas and increase energy access in regions such as sub-Saharan Africa through renewable technology. We are clear that Britain must be a world leader in the low-carbon economy. This is key to growing the high-skilled, better-paid jobs we need as well as powering development across the globe that benefits all.”
“Yes, there is still poverty, disease and conflict in Africa. But the fact is that in the last 15 years, the African continent has been fired by the spirit of progress. We can see it in the technology hubs of Lagos and Nairobi, the successes in fighting diseases, the number of kids going to school, the burgeoning, emerging middle classes. Consider Nigeria, with its population of 170 million. It currently has the same grid power as Bradford — a city of half a million people. As Nigeria makes those investments, there will be lots of opportunities for British businesses. So we need to wake up to what is happening in Africa.”

Mcr-1 gene seen in K. pneumoniae bacteria
"," Increased prevalence of mcr-1 gene that confers multidrug-resistance has now been reported in Klebsiella pneumoniae bacteria, increasing the fear of infection by pan drug-resistant bugs. This gene endows resistance against last hope antibiotic — colistin. A study published in Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy found that about 10% of the K. pneumoniae bacteria studied were resistant to colistin. 
During January–February 2016, a total of 200 K. pneumoniae isolates from pus, blood, sputum, and urine were studied. Of this, 21 were resistant to colistin, and further screening revealed that four harboured mcr-1 gene.
“This gene was first reported in December 2015 in E. coli isolated from chicken in China, and by 2017 it had spread to all continents and [is] seen in bacteria isolated from humans, chicken and environment,” says Prof. Kashi Nath Prasad from the Department of Microbiology at Sanjay Gandhi Postgraduate Institute of Medical Sciences, Lucknow, and the corresponding author of the work. “Evidence suggests that the overuse of colistin in farm animals has given rise to the emergence of mcr-1 gene. Since this gene is present on a mobile genetic element (plasmid) of bacteria such as E. coli and K. pneumoniae, the frequency of transmission to other bacteria is likely to be very high.”
Molecular studies revealed that one particular isolate carried mcr-1 gene and blaNDM-1 gene. “The blaNDM-1 encodes for a protein that gives resistance to all beta-lactam antibiotics. This shows that the particular isolate was resistant to carbapenems, third-generation cephalosporins, aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin) making the treatment very difficult,” says Sanjay Singh, research scholar at the institute and first author of the work.
Evolved gene
Interestingly, mcr-1 gene was seen in the chromosomal DNA of the bacteria. “The mcr-1 gene is usually found in the plasmid (small DNA in the cytoplasm) and the resistance gene is transmitted among different species. But now we have found this gene in the chromosome showing that it has evolved and stabilised. Whole genome sequence studies are needed to understand the exact location of this gene to decode how they are transmitted from one bacterial species to another,” adds Mr Singh. “The presence of the gene in the chromosome also means that Indian population may be harbouring mcr-1 gene for a longer period of time and it remained undetected.”
Further studies by the group also found that mcr-1 gene was more prevalent in K. pneumoniae than E. coli, which is in stark contrast to findings from other countries. While less than 1% of the E. coli studied was resistant to colistin, it was about 10% in the case of K. pneumoniae. More studies are needed to understand this contrasting behaviour. The team is also looking for this gene in other bacteria causing human infection and its mode of dissemination. 
 “As such K. pneumoniae is considered more notorious and difficult to treat bacterium; hence emergence of mcr-1 gene in this bacterium is a major health-care threat. Adequate measures like total ban on colistin use in veterinary practices as growth promoter and its judicious use in human medicine may prevent the emergence and dissemination of this resistance gene among the bacteria. Preservation of the efficacy of colistin is the need of the hour to treat patients who are infected and likely to be infected by multidrug resistant bacteria,” adds Dr. Prasad in an email to The Hindu.

Scientists discover tattoos on Egyptian mummies
","Researchers have discovered the oldest figurative tattoos in the world on the upper arms of two ancient Egyptian mummies, the British Museum said on Thursday. A male mummy was found to have tattoos depicting a wild bull and a Barbary sheep on its upper arm, while a female has linear and S-shaped motifs on its upper arm and shoulder.
The artworks appeared as dark smudges in natural light but researchers at the British Museum and Oxford University's Faculty of Oriental Studies found the tattoos in 2017 with infrared photography.
“It's actually providing completely new insights into the use of tattooing,” Daniel Antoine, curator of physical anthropology at the British Museum, told Reuters.
“The location of these tattoos suggests they were designed to be highly visible on the upper arm and the shoulder,” he said, adding that the discoveries push back by 1,000 years evidence for tattooing in Africa.
The mummies were unearthed 100 years ago in the Egyptian town of Gebelein, around 40 km (24 miles) south of modern-day Luxor. They date to 3351 to 3017 BC, which is the Predynatic period before Egypt was unified by the first Pharaoh.
Researchers said the female tattoos may have denoted status, bravery or magical knowledge, while the male's were likely symbols of virility and strength. Prior to the discovery, archaeologists believed tattooing in Egypt was only performed on women, as tattoos were only depicted on female figurines of the period.
The oldest surviving tattoos are geometric designs on a mummified corpse known as Otzi, who lived around 5,300 years ago and was discovered preserved in the Italian Alps in 1991. The research, lead by Antoine and Oxford University's Renee Friedman, was published in the Journal of Archaeological Science on March 1.

Over 100 million duplicate accounts likely: Facebook
","Social networking website Facebook on Sunday said it had over 100 million “duplicate” registered accounts on its user base, as per its estimations. Besides the nearly 5 to 15 million “undesirable” accounts registered with it worldwide, the percentage of such false accounts, including “user-misclassified” ones, may be higher in developing markets such as India, the company said.
At the same time, the company admitted that its estimated figures “may not” accurately represent the actual number of such accounts and it was continually seeking to improve its enumeration methodology.
“There may be individuals who maintain one or more Facebook accounts in violation of our terms of service. We estimate, for example, that ‘duplicate’ accounts [those that users maintain in addition to their principal account] may have represented between approximately 4.3 per cent and 7.9 per cent of our worldwide MAUs [Monthly Active User] in 2013,” Facebook said in the SEC filing.
According to the latest quarterly report, Facebook said the percentage of duplicate or false accounts is higher in developing markets such as India and Turkey.
As of March 31, 2014, the site had 1.28 billion MAUs, an increase of 15 per cent from last March 31. Users in India and Brazil represented key sources of growth in the first quarter of 2014 relative to the same period in 2013, the filing with SEC said.
In all regions, an increasing number of MAUs are accessing Facebook through mobile devices, with users in India, Brazil, and the United States representing key sources of mobile MAU growth over the first quarter of 2014, as compared to the same period in 2013.
“In 2013, for example, we estimate user-misclassified accounts may have represented between approximately 0.8 per cent and 2.1 per cent of our worldwide MAUs and undesirable accounts may have represented between approximately 0.4 per cent and 1.2 per cent of our worldwide MAUs,” it further said.

French team tests virtual reality path to pain relief
","The very thought of visiting a hospital emergency department is stressful enough for many people, even without the discomfort or pain of an examination or treatment.
Enter an immersive virtual-reality programme created by three graduates being used in France to relax patients and even increase their tolerance of pain — without resorting to drugs.
“What we offer is a contemplative world where the patient goes on a guided tour, in interactive mode, to play music, do a bit of painting or work out a riddle,” said Reda Khouadra, one of the 24-year-olds behind the project.
As patients are transported by chunky VR goggles into a three-dimensional world of Japanese zen gardens or snowy hillsides, they become more tolerant of minor but painful procedures such as having a cut stitched, a burn treated, a urinary catheter inserted or a dislocated shoulder pushed back into place.
Curbing anxiety
“The virtual reality project ... enables us to offer patients a technique to distract their attention and curb their pain and anxiety when being treated in the emergency room,” said Olivier Ganansia, head of the emergency department at the Saint-Joseph Hospital in Paris. “I think in 10 years, virtual reality won’t even be a question any more, and will be used in hospitals routinely.”
The Healthy Mind startup is not a world first but has landed a $20,000 prize from a university in Adelaide, Australia, which will now pay for the three founders to present their project at Microsoft’s headquarters in the U.S. city of Seattle.

Apple iOS 12 to share location of emergency calls in the US
"," Apple is using technology from RapidSOS, a New York startup, and is updating the iPhone’s next operating system to automatically deliver quicker and more reliable information by pinpointing the location of 911 calls to about 6,300 emergency response centres in the U.S. 
An estimated 80% of roughly 240 million emergency calls in the U.S. this year will come from mobile phones which are mostly capable of precisely tracking where their users are. Most emergency centres, however, are unable to get detailed location information from 911 calls and must use other methods which can be unreliable and inaccurate. Emergency responders are sometimes dispatched a mile or more away from a caller’s location.
The planned changes were on announced Monday during a 911 convention in Tennessee. They’ll be part of iOS 12 which the company will release in September as a free update. 
That can take up precious time and often isn’t very accurate, especially when calls come from inside a building. . 
The approach developed by Apple and RapidSOS sends location data from an iPhone to a “clearinghouse” accessible to emergency calling centers. Only the 911 calling centers will be able to see the data during the call, and none of it can be used for non-emergency purposes, according to Apple.
Individual call centers will each have to embrace the technology required to communicate with the RapidSOS clearinghouse. Some centers already have the compatible software, according to Apple, but others will have to install upgrades to their existing software.
Apple expects calling centers for large metropolitan areas to upgrade more quickly than those in rural areas.
Tom Wheeler, a former chairman for the Federal Communications Commission, believes Apple’s new approach for locating 911 calls will set a new industry standard. “This is going to save a lot of lives,” said Wheeler, now a visiting professor at Harvard University. He said he hopes other phone makers will follow Apple’s lead.

Neanderthals hunted in bands, speared prey up close: study ","Neanderthals were capable of sophisticated, collective hunting strategies, according to an analysis of prehistoric animal remains from Germany that contradicts the enduring image of these early humans as knuckle-dragging brutes.
The cut marks — or “hunting lesions” — on the bones of two 1,20,000-year-old deer provide the earliest “smoking gun” evidence such weapons were used to stalk and kill prey, according to a study the journal Nature Ecology and Evolution.
Microscopic imaging and ballistics experiments reproducing the impact of the blows confirmed that at least one was delivered with a wooden spear at low velocity. “This suggests that Neanderthals approached animals very closely and thrust, not threw, their spears at the animals, most likely from an underhand angle,” said Sabine Gaudzinski-Windheuser, a researcher at Johannes Gutenberg-University Mainz, Germany.
“Such a confrontational way of hunting required careful planning and concealment, and close cooperation between individual hunters,” she said.
Neanderthals lived in Europe from about 300,000 years ago until they died out 30,000 years ago, overtaken by our species.
It was long thought that these evolutionary cousins — modern Europeans and Asians have about 2% of Neanderthal DNA — were not smart enough to compete, and lacked symbolic culture, a trait supposedly unique to modern humans.
But recent findings have revealed a species with more intelligence and savoir faire than suspected.
They buried their dead in ritual fashion, created tools, and painted animal frescos on cave walls at least 64,000 years ago, 20,000 years before Homo sapiens arrived in Europe.
Hominins — the term used to describe early human species, as well as our own — most likely started hunting with weapons more than half-a-million years ago. 
3,00,000-to 4,00,000-year-old wooden staves found in England and Germany are the oldest known spear-like implements likely used for killing prey. But there was no physical evidence as to their use, leaving scientists to speculate.
The new find from the Neumark-Nord area of Germany removes that doubt, said Gaudzinski-Windheuser. “As far as spear use is concerned, we now finally have the ‘crime scene’ fitting to the proverbial ‘smoking gun’,” she said.
Lake shore excavations from the same site since the 1980s have yielded tens of thousands of bones from large mammals, including red and fallow deer, horses and bovids. 
They have also turned up thousands of stone artefacts, attesting to a flourishing Neanderthal presence in what was a forest environment during an interglacial period 135,000 and 115,000 years ago. The old deer bones examined for the study were unearthed more than 20 years ago, but new technologies helped unlock their secrets: which injuries were lethal, what kind of weapon was used, and whether the spears were thrown from a distance or thrust from close up.

What makes stainless steel non-magnetic whereas ordinary steel and iron are magnetic?


S.P.S. JAIN


Greater Noida, Uttar Pradesh

We have to first understand how magnetic fields are generated around magnetic metals to answer this question. We know that within each atom, electrons spin on their axis that, in turn, causes magnetic field around them. Some electrons spin clockwise, some counter-clockwise. Generally they are paired so that the magnetic fields are cancelled. Iron which is a magnetic substance has three unpaired electrons. Each electron generates a magnetic field of its own.
If all the fields pull in the same direction then you have a magnet. In other words, the magnetic fields are aligned in a magnet. In the case of stainless steel, there are several types of them. In general they are made of iron (Fe), carbon (C), and about 10 per cent chromium (Cr). Some contain Nickel (Ni).
But other metals are added to obtain different properties. As stainless steel contains iron, a magnetic metal, one it would seem that it would be magnetic. However, when nickel (Ni) is added to stainless steel the result is a non-magnetic form of stainless steel, called austenitic stainless steel. At the atomic level, all the iron atoms act as mini magnets that are aligned in the same direction.
The net effect of this is that collectively the magnetic properties of all the iron atoms add up to produce the overall magnetisation of the material. This is known as ferromagnetism. But the addition of other elements to iron changes the properties. For instance, when chromium and nickel are added, the arrangement of atoms changes completely and this, in turn, affects the magnetic properties of iron. The nickel and chromium that are added to iron tend to cancel the magnetic fields and the net outcome is that stainless steel becomes a non-magnetic substance.

Traffic jams in the brain ","Neurons transport cargo of various sizes constantly, and many times, this can lead to traffic jams. A new study of the roundworm (Caenorhabditis elegans) and fruitfly (Drosophila) shows that such traffic jams can be due to purely physical constraints, not involving any chemical signalling processes. Such stalling of cargo can happen in neurons afflicted by neurodegenerative diseases.
A recent study shows that it can happen even in normal cells. This could be a method adopted by the neuron to regulate the flow of mitochondria, vesicles containing neurotransmitters, and the like, along the length of its axon. The axon is the long arm of the neuron, which reaches out to the synapse or nerve endings. The study is published in the journal Traffic.
The researchers compare this to Indian roads. On the road, there are vehicles of several sizes and people walking, all moving on the same narrow lane. If one of these vehicles should stop for some reason, traffic tends to pile up temporarily. It eases out once the vehicle moves on and the traffic jam is cleared. Similar traffic jams of cargo happen in the axon.
Eureka moment
“It was really exciting to see that such traffic jams can happen among the tiny cargo in the brain,” says Parul Sood, first author of the paper, who is a research scholar at Tata Institute of Fundamental Research in Mumbai. When the team was brainstorming to find a way of demonstrating this, she had a “Eureka!” moment: “I quickly went through my data to see if vesicles rushed through the location from where a stationary cargo — the presumed physical block — mobilised, and they did, showing that indeed vesicle motion was physically blocked at that location!”
Apart from the cargo, there are bits of cytoskeleton floating in the body of the axon. This includes microtubules, which are like roads for the cargo to move along. The cargo can halt for any reason, it could be that it has fallen off a microtubule or that it has arrived at the end of the microtubule, or some other reason, leading to an accumulation of cargo.
Dr Sandhya Koushika of TIFR, Mumbai, a co-author, and in whose lab the experiments were performed, explains, “We found that there were particular locations in the cell which were susceptible to forming these accumulations. The most susceptible regions were those that were actin-rich. When you have concentrations of actin, in this region when the cargo stalls, it’s a double whammy. The amount of space allowed for the cargo to move has really shrunk.”
This could be a way to regulate the traffic down the axon. Dr Gautam Menon, from The Institute of Mathematical Sciences, a co-author of the paper, draws an analogy to the Mumbai-Chennai highway. “Suppose you are making things in Mumbai and sending them down to Chennai. Now suppose you want more stuff, you don’t want to send a signal all the way up to Mumbai,” he says. An efficient way to regulate this is to park it along the way in different locations, and summon the cargo when needed. This is not a static accumulation but dynamic.
“Many people, especially biologists, are not greatly attracted to the idea that you may not have classical regulation… [where] something turns on, something turns off and there are changes in levels of protein etc. Here we show it can happen in perfectly healthy neurons with no changes in levels of proteins,” adds Dr Koushika.

Linking Aadhaar with digital wallets: It's not all black and white!
"," Digital sustenance was familiarised or rather enforced upon the common man, which is still one of the foremost advantages to emerge out of demonetisation and ATMs perennially running out of cash (which still continues in major parts of Hyderabad). The dependence on digital wallets henceforth has been immense. PayTM’s first-mover advantage in this arena was of great benefit to the firm but the list of its counterparts are impressively long too-Freecharge, Airtel Money, Idea Money, Amazon Pay, Ola Money, Lazy Pay and the latest entrant Tez by another major Google has brought a lot of renewed excitement into this space. However, nearly all of them have put up a united front in pushing their alert button hard to customers on linking wallets with Aadhaar, even when the March deadline seemed a fair distance away. And now, users aren’t even given the benefit of choice if they’re to add cash into their wallets — the KYC enforcement has put many users in a spot of bother.
Some haziness
 Even as the haziness surrounding the security norms of the Aadhaar-link up prevails, most of the wallets have brought in a series of tough-to-resist cashbacks and offers to lure the user into parting with his/her KYC number. PayTM now provides a voucher facility for those who wouldn’t want to force the link-up, however the simplicity surrounding money transfers cease to exist anymore. PayTM users have an advantage of adding money through their Uber accounts — which still is oblivious to the Aadhaar-drama. Amazon Pay has time and again induced users with gift vouchers for every minimum sum they add on to the wallet, the most recent one being the ₹100 flat cashback to an addition of ₹300. Ola Money and Airtel Money have been on the forefront to provide temporary monetary advantages to those who adhere to the KYC with similar offers too.




To fall for the trap or not is something the user has to decide. Another way to look at it is the inevitability of the link-up — just that it has come earlier than needed. Most of these majors play up with the fact that there’s little else choice. 


Although the Aadhaar tie-up here is to ensure accountability to all the purchases, why is anonymity a tough bargain? ‘Why would a regular citizen who may use the wallets merely for mobile recharges’ even bother about accountability? It’s something they come prepared with when they enter the online space. With/without the link-up too, a transaction is recorded on the digital wallet for future reference. Another option that majors can consider is to involve the link-up is with purchases of higher order, where the danger surrounding authenticity/accountability can sometimes be high.
The other side
An advantage that these moves have brought in-is the trust of Unified Payments Interface (UPI)-oriented purchases, which involves a unique number authorised by a bank account holder. Though the KYC connection still exists with the bank, Tez, the Google-based payment app has made impressive use of the facility. That a major like Google is taking this forward has ensured a trust factor unlike the other apps. The user-friendly interface coupled with its right timing into the market will very likely give a tough competition to PayTM in the coming months.

SUVs, posh villas, pricey plots purchased from NSEL funds: Enforcement Directorate
","High-end vehicles, posh villas and flats, expensive plots, shares in beach-side hotels and vast tracts of agricultural land are some of the purchases made by the accused of the multi-crore payment scam in National Spot Exchange Limited (NSEL) through money laundering.
The trail of money that went into the alleged illegal purchase of these assets from genuine NSEL funds has been investigated by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) which has been probing the Rs. 5,600-crore payment crisis in the bourse that got public last year after investors claimed they were cheated.
An investigation report of the agency submitted in the court has identified the modus operandi deployed by a firm — Mohan India Pvt. Ltd. — and its subsidiary units in “laundering” the funds of the stock exchange.
“Generally, layering is the process through which the laundered money is channelised for its ultimate integration into the system.
“In this case, it is evident from the evidence gathered so far that the defendants (Mohan India and others) have attempted to layer the proceeds of crime generated through their criminal activities in various manner like purchase of high-end vehicles like Range Rovers, luxurious villa for their use which have no relation with their legitimate business activities,” the ED report accessed by PTI reads.
The ED, a few months ago, had attached assets worth Rs. 125 crore in the name of the firm and its other business associates under the provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA).
The Central probe agency has identified these assets to be the “proceeds of crime”.
Mohan India Pvt. Ltd. is one of the large defaulters of the scam with initial liability of Rs. 922 crore and according to latest data it owes Rs. 600.08 crore, of which it has paid Rs. 52.85 crore to the exchange.
The ED probe found that while Mohan India group of companies had “received funds in their settlement accounts from NSEL purportedly on account of sale of sugar..., they were eventually transferred to various individuals and entities and payments were made to car dealers, developers, construction firms etc by way of transfers, NEFT/RTGS payments/pay orders.”
The agency, in a voluminous report, has furnished the documentary proof of the movement of all this money sourced from NSEL to the end purchase of real estate or cars by tracking bank transactions spread across various parts of the country.
“Investigations under the PMLA have revealed that the defendants (Mohan India Pvt Ltd and others) were dealing in sale and re-purchase of sugar without having any physical stock of sugar. They had received funds from NSEL on account of sale of sugar which they have not delivered to NSEL at all.
There was no question of NSEL allowing them to invest these funds in real estate,” the probe report said.
The agency has also recorded a number of statements of the officials of the NSEL and Mohan India Pvt. Ltd. under PMLA before preparing and submitting the first investigation report in this case to the court.
The ED said it attached luxury vehicles like a Toyota Fortuner, three Range Rovers, flats in Gomti Enclave in Lucknow, eight plots of land in Karnal in Haryana, a posh flat in Mumbai’s Borivali, plots in costly addresses like Mehrauli, Hauz Khas, Jor Bagh and Sainik Farms in Delhi and other such assets as “there was a likelihood of immediate sale or disposal of such high-end vehicles and luxurious properties (by the firm in question) and the non-attachment of the same would have frustrated the proceedings under the Act (PMLA).”
“It was revealed that funds obtained from NSEL were diverted for the purposes other than the purpose for which they were obtained raising the suspicion that the said amounts were laundered by MS Mohan India group,” the ED said in its report.
The agency has also relied on a report of the I-T department against the firm that said that the “godowns which were declared to NSEL (by the firm) as designated warehouse had no capacity to store the quantity of sugar traded by them (Mohan India and others) on the NSEL platform.”
The ED has said that its probe in this case is “still in infancy at this stage” and further investigation is on.
The Rs. 5,600-crore payment crisis at NSEL and the alleged scam is being probed by different agencies like the Mumbai Economic Offences Wing and the Income Tax department.

Bomb hoaxes at Central station, private hospital
","In the aftermath of the twin bomb blasts at Chennai Central Station on May 1, the city is witnessing a spree of bomb hoax calls, causing great anxiety.
On Thursday, Chennai Central Station and a private hospital were the latest ‘targets.’
A senior official of the Government Railway Police said their helpline received a call around 10 a.m. about a bomb in Central station.
The bomb disposal squads of the Railway Protection Force (RPF) and Chennai Police were alerted.
After searching the entire station and finding nothing, security officials concluded that the call was a hoax.
“After analysing call details, it was found that the caller is a resident of Bangalore, who is involved in petty crimes, and uses several SIM cards to avoid detection,” he added.
An RPF official said that two sniffer dogs and 12 persons were pressed into service to conduct checks at the station.
Similarly, a person called the police control room and alleged that a bomb had been planted in a private hospital in T. Nagar.
A squad was sent to inspect the hospital, but it found nothing of significance.
A senior police official warned that stern action would be taken against those who make such hoax calls that disrupt daily life and cause panic.

Chennai train blast: TN police ‘identify’ more suspects
","Some more suspects in the >twin bomb blasts in the Kaziranga Express have been identified, Tamil Nadu Police said on Sunday claiming it has got “positive” clues on the explosions that killed a woman passenger and left 14 others injured.
Perusal of CCTV footages at the Chennai Central Station, Bangalore City Railway station and those between Bangalore and Chennai has led the CB-CID police, probing the explosion to zero in on some “positive” leads, a senior official involved in the investigation said in Chennai.
He said “some more suspects have been identified” but declined to elaborate, saying it would hamper investigations.
The official said a police team sent to Guwahati was camping there and questioning some of the passengers who travelled by the train looking for more clues that could help them track down the perpetrators of the blast.
The CB-CID police have sought the help of experts to confirm whether a suspect who boarded the Bangalore-Guwahati express at Bangalore and who was masking his face with handkerchief, was the same person who was seen hurriedly alighting at Chennai, the official said.
Police are also looking at the possibility of the blasts being the handiwork of Indian Mujahideen or some sleeper cells, he said.
A police team is continuing investigation at Bangalore.
The CB-CID has also deputed a team to Patna against the backdrop of investigations indicating that explosions there hours before Narendra Modi’s rally, was similar to that of Chennai blast.

Police request Facebook, Twitter to block Amrita-Digvijaya photographs
","The Delhi Police Crime Branch has sent an official request to social networking sites Facebook and Twitter asking them to block the circulation of intimate photographs of journalist Amrita Rai and Congress leader Digvijaya Singh.
The development comes a day after a case was registered against unknown persons for hacking into Ms. Rai’s e-mail account.
According to the police, Ms. Rai had requested them to block the circulation of the photographs as it was harming her reputation.
She also told them that she was being threatened through these pictures.
“Ms. Rai had filed a complaint on Thursday evening. We have registered a case under Section 66 of the IT Act and 509 of the Indian Penal Code against unidentified persons. We sent an official request to social networking sites on Friday to provide us with information about the origins and Internet Protocol addresses from where the photographs were being circulated. We have also asked them to block further circulation of the photographs,” said a police officer.
Talking about developments in the case, the officer said it was too early to determine the identities of persons involved or the motive behind circulating the photographs.
“The headquarters of these social media sites are based abroad and it takes time for them to respond or provide information. Our Cyber Cell has already begun investigations and we hope to find the source IP address soon,” said an officer.
Ms. Rai had also tweeted that someone had hacked into her e-mail account.
“My email/computer been hacked & contents tampered with. It is a serious crime in India and encroachment of my privacy. I strongly condemn it [sic].”
The officer revealed that Ms. Rai had in her complaint alleged that the hackers had created a fake Twitter handle in her name and that she was being harassed through abusive tweets. She also gave the police a list of Twitter handles from which she was receiving abusive comments and tweets.
Officers probing the case have not ruled out physical tampering of her laptop either.
“There is a chance that her laptop was tampered with physically, but as of now we think it was hacked through a wireless Internet facility,” the officer added.

Coastal tourism to get a boost
","Several beaches in Karnataka are set to get a facelift with the Union government approving Rs. 45-crore phase one of a project to develop tourism in ‘Coastal Karnataka Tourism Circuit’.
This is one of the four circuits identified in Karnataka for tourism development.
In Dakshina Kannada district, beaches at Uchila, Someshwar, Ullal, Tannirbavi, Panambur and Surathkal are likely to be taken up for development apart from some islands. They will get facilities such as approach roads, toilets, and watchtowers, according to sources in the Tourism Department.
While Director of Karnataka Tourism G. Satyavathi confirmed that the Centre has approved the Rs. 45-crore project, official sources said this was only the first instalment of the bigger project envisaging expenditure of about Rs. 500 crore to develop more than 140 beaches. In the next three years, about Rs. 150 crore is expected to be spent, with bulk of it coming from the Union government.
Though the plan was to provide cottages along the beeches, there is no government land outside the Coastal Regulation Zone (200 m away from the high tide line) in Dakshina Kannada. The department, however, hopes to encourage private players to build cottages for tourists.

Four circuits identified

A study conducted by Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services Ltd. for the government of India’s Tourism Department has identified four circuits for development in Karnataka. One of them, the Coastal Karnataka Tourism Circuit, comprises destinations in Dakshina Kannada, Udupi, and Uttara Kannada districts along the coastline extending up to Goa.
The study said, “Based on the carrying capacity assessment, tourism potential, and discussion with the Department of Tourism, Karnataka, the Circuit 1 (coastal tourism) … has been proposed as the priority circuit.” It listed Mangalore’s good connectivity with domestic and international destinations via air, rail and road network as a key advantage. It said tourism destinations in the three districts have good connectivity with Mangalore, with NHAI having taken up the project to upgrade the national highway from Talapady to Kundapur into a four-lane road.

Key positives

Significant tourist inflows, diversity and quality of tourism assets in terms of beaches, scenic destinations, backwaters, wildlife sanctuaries and adventure tourism, and historical monuments were other key positives for the circuit.
The poor state of approach roads, and lack of drinking water facility, parking, food and beverages outlets, quality wayside amenities and public conveniences on the way to some of the tourism destinations were mentioned as weaknesses.
But the coastline circuit had significant potential for development of beach tourism, “given that Karnataka shares the same coastline with Goa and Kerala”, the study concluded.

A silent killer that’s not an election issue
","In March, the World Health Organization released its latest study which estimated a total of 7 million deaths worldwide in 2012 caused by exposure to air pollution — one in eight of all global deaths. Indoor air pollution was linked to 4.3 million of the deaths that occurred in homes which depend on biomass or coal for cooking.
In August 1997, on the eve of India celebrating 50 years of independence, the Energy and Resources Institute, in a detailed study assessing the country’s record of environmental protection and conservation of natural resources during that period, found that a total of 2.5 million premature deaths took place in 1997 alone as a result of air pollution, both indoor and outdoor. The majority of these were caused by pollution indoors that stemmed from cooking on inefficient cookstoves burning largely inferior forms of biomass.
India is currently voting in its general election – the world's largest democracy began voting on 7 April and finishes on 12 May – but if the record of previous governments is any indication, environmental issues are unlikely to be a priority. There is, no doubt, a credible framework of legislation in place in India to support any attention give to environmental issues, but the institutions and processes that translate intent into action remain weak and ineffective.
(On the subject of climate change, the government announced its a national action plan in 2008, the provisions and contents of which were put together over the following two years in a rigorous exercise involving governments of all states, members of civil society and various thinktanks. However, the implementation of the plan remains far below stated targets and goals.)
Apart from the serious and widespread problems of water pollution – both on the surface and below the ground – erosion and degradation of soil, and loss of forest density and biodiversity, the problem of air pollution in several parts of the country is alarming. While outdoor air pollution gets some attention from the public and decision-makers, indoor air pollution, which afflicts at least two-thirds of Indian homes, remains neglected.
More than 300 million people in India have no access to electricity, and those that do still do not have a stable supply. As a result, kerosene lamps and candles are used widely in many Indian homes, with high levels of air pollution affecting hundreds of millions. Women and children are particularly vulnerable because they spend more time at home. Perhaps even more serious is the dependence of around 700 million people on the burning of biomass in their homes, using inefficient stoves that emit large quantities of smoke, leading to high doses of air pollution.
Fortunately, some solutions have been devised. As part of its Lighting a Billion Lights campaign, the Energy and Resources Institute has reached almost 3,000 villages in India and Africa, introducing the decentralised use of photovoltaic panels. An important apsect of this campaign is that a local female entrepreneur is trained to set up a central charging station in a village using solar panels on rooves. She charges lightweight, LED solar lanterns, with a socket for charging mobile phones. After charging the lanterns for the whole village in the daytime, she rents them out at night. This provides the entire village with clean, efficient and reliable lighting, based on a sustainable, market-oriented model. Similar programmes have been launched with improved stoves in a large number of villages, reducing indoor air pollution drastically.
Unfortunately, elected governments in India have largely failed to come to grips with the problem of indoor air pollution, and those campaigning in the ongoing election show scant understanding of this pervasive problem. With irrational subsidies on kerosene, the transition to cleaner fuels in many Indian homes may, therefore, remain slow. Fortunately, with falling solar power prices and the demonstrated success of the Lighting a Billion Lights campaign, many NGOs and even the private sector are now emulating the lights model. This promises well for the future.

Prison diaries
","On December 22, 2012, Chetan Mahajan reached Bokaro to reason with angry parents of students enrolled in Everonn, the Chennai-based IIT coaching chain. Mahajan had been with the company for just three months. The Bokaro branch of Everonn had begun losing teachers to other institutes that paid a higher salary. Increasingly uneasy, the parents of enrolled students demanded a refund; rumours that the company was shutting down only served to compound the problem.
Mahajan, in Bokaro for what he thought would be a meeting with parents, found himself arrested and jailed. Mahajan spent the next month in Bokaro’s prison. From that experience came Mahajan’s first book, Bad Boys of Bokaro Jail (Penguin), an account of both his prison days and an inside view of the state of Indian prison and justice system. “I always wanted to write, but didn’t know that this would become my impetus,” he says. Completely blind-sided, Mahajan initially expected to be out of jail within days, even hours. “I wasn’t legally liable for what had happened. I hadn’t cheated the parents or taken their money. I was only an employee and I thought the whole thing would clear up soon. It didn’t sink in till I actually found myself being taken to the jail.”
Incarcerated in an under-trial jail, Mahajan met and interacted with people he never thought he’d meet. The book begins with a series of text messages he exchanged before and during the initial procedure that led to his arrest. “I changed my phone recently, but my old phone had all the messages stored, and I wanted to include them.” The frantic worried tone of the messages underline Mahajan’s growing panic that day.
The feeling only worsened in jail, with his phone, laptop and other means of communication taken away. “For the first few days, I didn’t know what to do. I was afraid and confused.” He adds that he remembers the watershed moment when he chose to write his experiences down. “I knew that to survive inside, I’d have to turn this negative, crushing experience into something positive.” On his brother’s next visit, Mahajan asked him for supplies — notebook, pens, to begin documenting his life in prison.
In the acknowledgement, Mahajan thanks the students and the Jharkhand police, admitting that he looks at what happened to him as a sort of blessing in disguise. “I am a different person because of this experience. I look at people differently. I am kinder, more accepting, more understanding of poverty and hardship. I understand that everyone deserves a second chance, and this chance can change their lives.”
Mahajan encountered many different people during his incarceration. Some became friends whom he has returned to the prison to visit. “That place is very familiar now. And some people I wanted to go back and keep in touch with. I want to know what’s happening to them.” Mahajan has changed names to protect identities. “I can’t protect the jailer’s identity, whose sympathy I was grateful for, but there were certain prisoners who helped me in ways that, if their names were revealed, would land them in trouble.”
Mahajan describes the illegal but expertly constructed ways in which prisoners survive the harsh environment, with everything from cell phones to cigarettes coming at an absurdly inflated price.
For his family, “this is more than a book. This is a window into my life and what happened to me when I was separated from them. Each one of my family and friends tell me that they’ve read it in a single sitting.” Mahajan hopes that his book will strike a similar chord with readers too. “Initially, after my release, I was barely functional. I was asocial and had nightmares. It took me very long to snap out of it.”
A lot has changed for Mahajan and he has shed the bitterness and anger. “I was angrier with my employer than with the justice system. It was them I expected help from, but it was too late coming.” In that one month, Mahajan did not once face a judge. His comparatively short stay in an under-trial prison became an example of a much bigger problem facing the country: life as it is for the crores of under-trial prisoners in Indian jails.
While Mahajan doesn’t plan to change the course of his career — education being his chosen path — he wants to help change and improve the lives of those inside prisons. “If there are groups working towards this goal, I’ll be more than happy to do my part.”

From the heartland of humour
","
“Ticket ticket... Idhu LSS bus pa... edaiyile nikkadhu,” cautions the conductor on a crowded bus. “
Edaiyile nikkathunna?... Indha bus yenna polyester veshtiya?” a witty comment from a passenger eases the stifling atmosphere as those on board break into laughter. Such hilarious incidences are everyday happenings in Madurai, where everyone from kids to the elderly sport a funny bone.
It’s a city where every second person walking on the road may pass comments with no inhibitions. Humour runs in their blood, as the slang and the body language are amusing to any outsider. From the earlier times, this clan has thrived on the thinnai pechu and arattai culture. Time-pass here was always synonymous with the comical keli and kindal.
Whether in a family gathering or a temple festival, the ubiquitous nakkal and naiyandi can never be missed. Even during serious and solemn occasions people always find an opportune moment just to insert little humour. This is a trait that’s peculiar to the Temple City. Else how can one explain the fact that top comedians in Tamil cinema hail from Madurai?
Be it Vadivelu’s goofy and slapstick comedies or Vivekh’s witty and chucklesome humour, they all definitely stem from experiences and incidences in Madurai. Who can hold back laughter when Vadivelu lets out his trademark cry, ‘
vandhuttangayya… vandhuttangayya’? While Ganja Karuppu induces laughter with his typical facial expressions and the highly stretched out slang native to the region, Soori, a relatively new entrant is increasingly leaving the movie halls in splits with his dialogue delivery.
Actor comedian Vivekh says, “Humour can always be found in a place where there’s fearlessness. The audacious remarks and lively diction are something unique to the people here.” He says, the Vattara Vazhaku (local dialect) of the region can never be boring as it’s laden with subtle humour. “My inspiration for film comedy comes from here. Spend a day on the Madurai streets and you will be amused at the way these people speak and behave. They have an inherent ability to be hilarious,” vouches Vivekh.
K. Gnanasambandan, Tamil scholar and popular debate personality who has spent his childhood and youth in the villages, recalls numerous anecdotes. “These days, people pretend to be decent and have stopped cracking jokes. The urge to speak in English has also marred certain earthy and rustic Tamil words that are humourous,” says Gnanasambandan. “But, people in Madurai speak their mind. They are candid and convivial and give much importance to relationships. They are known for their timing sense and presence of mind.”
Historically, Madurai is where the Tamil language flourished and people gathered for trade and festivals. “Humour is born out of pain. People here laugh their problems off,” says R. Venkatraman, retired professor of history. “We have not given enough respect to humour and hence even our classical literature is quite serious, whereas, folk literature is more light-hearted.” He refers to Kutrala Kuravanji and the Pallu Padalagal that’s laden with plenty of humourous left-handed compliments and taunting called as ‘Yesal’ in Tamil.
Also, Madurai has a thriving theatre scene. Street-plays and koothu are an everyday affair, where people interact liberally. The arguments born out of these are laced with comical overtones. Like for instance, karagattam and pattimandram are known for their witty repartees. “The tremendous humour sense that we come across in common people has evolved over years. It comes out of melancholic experiences. When one sees life’s lessons from outside, they look hilarious,” says Popular pattimandram speaker S. Raja.
Stand-up comedian M. Christopher Gnanaraj points to the rural lingo that evokes laughter. “The villagers convey even serious matters in a comical way. They package advices in the form of a hilarious joke. These are called ‘
Solavadai’ in Tamil,” says Christopher. He gives few examples -- ‘
Konavayan kottavi vitta mathiri’ (One shouldn’t try to be too creative in difficult times and end up bringing upon more trouble). “Even a poor man would express his poverty in a humorous way with an evident nonchalance in the tone,” he says. ‘
Naan iruken thothala, yen veedu iruku pothala’ (My house is flimsy and my life is clumsy).

Madurai slang


posaketta paya : useless fellow

patraya podu: sit and relax

imbutukoondu: very little

roota kudukatha: Don't tell lie

yekkoi: Elder Sister

Madurai humour club

Stared in 1991 by K. Gnansambandan in association with the Madurai Meenakshi Mission Hospital, the Madurai Humour Club provides a platform to its members, both young and old, to share their jokes. The club encourages only clean comedies and is just a year away from celebrating silver jubilee. Gnanasambandan also publishes ‘Sirippu’, a laughter magazine.

Objective behind Assam killings is to trigger communal conflagration: Shinde
","Pointing out that 31 of those killed in the Assam violence were from the minority community, Union Home Minister Sushilkumar Shinde on Sunday said the objective of the group behind the killings seemed to be aimed at triggering a full-fledged communal conflagration.
“During the last few days, there have been wanton acts of depredation leading to the deaths of 32 persons, mainly women and children. Of these, 31 belonged to the minority community. These innocent lives were lost at the hands of cadres of a certain group,” said Mr. Shinde, appealing all to maintain calm and peace.
Stating that the Armed Forces would definitely control the situation, Mr. Shinde also called upon public leaders of both the Bodo and minority communities to ensure that the situation did not deteriorate further.
These acts started only after the group began steadily losing its cadres either through surrender or eliminations during the operations when they opened fire at the Armed Forces, he said. “The Central government cannot remain unaffected by these killings and is determined to ensure the safety and security of innocent human lives. The determination is all the more important since these incidents are targeted at the minorities. I strongly condemn the acts of this group which is targeting women and children of the minority community,” said Mr. Shinde.
The MHA has already deployed 43 companies of Central Armed Forces and 10 more companies are being sent. “The Defence Ministry has also deployed 15 columns of Army comprising approximately 1,500 soldiers. These numbers are not fixed and can be increased as per requirement,” he added.
Condemning the act of violence, the Amnesty International India on Sunday said: “The first incident of shooting took place in a village in Baksa late on Thursday evening (May 1), and two other shootings occurred in Kokrajhar and Baksa the following day, with bodies continuing to be found on Saturday morning. All the victims were from Muslim families.”
The organisation said the Assam government and the police had alleged that the killings were perpetrated by an armed group, the Songbijit faction of the National Democratic Front of Bodoland (NDFB), which has denied responsibility. In July 2012, clashes broke out between the Bodo and Muslim communities, resulting in the killing of over 75 people and displacement of thousands, it said, urging the Assam government to protect the rights of all communities and bring the guilty to justice.
While Assam Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi has decided to hand over the probe into the killings to the National Investigation Agency, the agency is yet to receive a formal communication in this regard.

Clicking for a calling
","It’s noontime, baking hot, and I am passing by India Gate in New Delhi in an air-conditioned car. Thank God for it! Peeping out, I see the barricaded road leading to the early 19th Century monument — popular on tourists’ to-do list otherwise — nearly deserted. Who visits a roasting Delhi in May-June, after all?
And then I catch this sight — a bunch of eager beavers. With cameras hanging round their neck, they form an uneven line, just where the police barricade starts on the stretch of Rajpath that ends at the Gate, each flashing sample photos from albums. Pretty palpable is their hope for the odd tourist to arrive and hire their services.
No, they are neither a new phenomenon at India Gate nor have I spotted them for the first time. In fact, I remember reading a news item some time last year that the photographers of India Gate had been barred from entering the area. So they are back now!
A parallel thought also hits my head: even in the best of weather, who gets a photo clicked by them at a time when even the cheapest mobile phones have in-built cameras?
The question needs an answer, and I soon find myself amid them. They take me for that one odd tourist they have been waiting for; offer to click my photo with the edifice as the backdrop. “Rs.30, 40 or 50? See samples, photo in two minutes,” the offer is concise. “One for the memory, madam,” they try their luck.
I pose the niggling question to them. Soon names get exchanged, a conversation ensues and in that stream bobs the answer. Rather, the constant struggle, to find the answer. Impressive is their everyday fight to keep the means of livelihood ticking, even in the harshest of environments
“We are nearly 200 of us here. Every day, by 10 o’ clock, we arrive here hoping to make some money,” says Salim. No, he doesn’t own the camera, a Nikon D3000. “We are all employed by a group of people, some get a daily wage from them, some others get commission for photos clicked,” says the Sangam Vihar resident.
Summer is a terrible time for them. “In this heat, we wait the whole day. Hardly anybody comes,” states Salim’s mate Ajay. Ajay belongs to a U.P. village. “There is nothing there for me; I am somehow hanging on here. My neighbour in the rented room in Mandawali is in this job; he brought me to the employer three years ago,” he says. In tourist season, each of these men — in their 20s and 30s — earns between Rs. 5000 and 6000 per month. In summers, the amount dwindles to around Rs.4000. Pointing at another photographer, Salim says, “Vinod is married, has two children, it becomes very difficult for him at times.”
So how do they manage to deliver a photo to a tourist in two minutes? “We bring printers with us. There are about 40 portable printers at this point of time on the India Gate lawns,” pipes up photographer Sonu. No, they don’t own the printers either. Sonu points out a man standing some distance away, saying, “He is my employer. You can talk to him.”
The man — seemingly in his late 30s — identifies himself as Sandeep Rajput. “We have been in this business for the last 8-10 years. I have grown up playing at India Gate; my father, grandfather were balloon sellers here,” says Sandeep. His interest lies in outdoor photography, but he has not got a break yet. “I am carrying on here like this, can earn at the most Rs.15,000 per month,” he says.
Camera phones indeed put a spanner in his business. So does Police harassment. “We have to pay policemen every day to be here,” he says. In an attempt to join hands “to get permission from the authorities, maybe an I-D card,” 36 such ‘employers’ came together two-three years ago to form a union, he says. “It is a registered body named Photographer Welfare Association.”
Mukesh Kumar, the union president, says the biggest blow was when the Police banned their entry to the area just after the December 16 rape case. “When we came back, there were other people operating in collusion with some policemen.” They have been trying to approach Delhi Tourism, the New Delhi Municipal Council and Delhi Police, for permission to be on the lawns. “We also did dharna in front of Sonia Gandhi’s house, Sheila Dikshit’s house,” relates Mukesh.
“NDMC told us, fill forms, we will give you kiosks. It has been over a year now,” says Mukesh’s senior union colleague Sandeep. “We have never done anything illegal here. In fact, a fellow photographer, Raju, has been awarded a tamra patra by the Police Commissioner for alerting them about a bomb at India Gate some time ago,” points out Santosh, a senior union colleague.
Santosh has some fond childhood memories of India Gate. His father was also a balloon seller. “Those days, cars were allowed on this road. When it rained, we would run to one of the rooms under India Gate. Once, a bunch of us climbed till the top of the Gate,” he recalls, laughing.
NDMC has recently employed a private guard agency to help maintain security in and around India Gate. You can spot the men in uniform with sticks in hand moving about. “Their job is to chase us away, people who try and make a living by selling balloons, water bottles, a photograph for a memory. Each of these 36 union members employs at least five young men. So you can imagine how many people are depending on this means of livelihood,” says the old man. Before he walks away, he tells me something one can’t disagree with, “Those in authority should realise that the easiest thing to do is to crush those who don’t have a voice.”
Meanwhile, tomorrow is another day for Sonu, Salim and his ilk.

Coimbatore Corporation orders study of all water schemes
","Coimbatore Corporation has ordered the Tamil Nadu Water Investment Corporation to study the water supply schemes so as to make the best of what is available.
According to sources, the civic body issued the order to the Corporation about 15 days ago asking it to study the Siruvani, Pilloor I and II, Bhavani and Aliyar schemes.
The Corporation will study if the civic body is making best use of the schemes available, if there are lacunae in using the water from the schemes, what needs to be done to improve the water supply situation and if that requires additional infrastructure.
The sources say the study will also tell the Corporation if it needs to go in for an additional drinking water supply scheme – Pilloor III, as is being suggested at some quarters.
The Corporation supplies Siruvani water for 28 wards, Bhavani for wards in Kavundampalayam, Vadavalli and Veerakeralam and Aliyar for wards in the South Zone. For the remaining areas, it pumps Pilloor water from the Pilloor I and Pilloor II schemes.
The sources say that the Tamil Nadu Water Supply and Drainage Board implemented four of the five aforementioned schemes at various points in time.
The Corporation then implemented the Pilloor II schemes a few years ago under the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission scheme.
Now when a comprehensive study is being ordered, there will emerge a clear picture of how best to use the schemes as they all serve the purpose for meeting the residents’ needs.
When such a study is being done, the Corporation will know how to link the schemes, if localities in the city are getting water from the nearest reservoir, if not, does the city need new reservoirs or should the pipelines of various schemes need to be interlinked at vantage points, and much more.
The sources say that the civic body will decide on the next course of action based on the Corporation report and add that this will not overlap with the report already prepared for the implementation of the 24x7 water supply scheme.

Managing the monsoon
","Forecasts by the South Asian Climate Outlook Forum and the India Meteorological Department indicate that the south-west monsoon rainfall may be deficient. Also, there is a possibility of the evolution of an El Niño event during June to September. There is a 45 per cent probability that central, west, north-west and south India will receive below normal rainfall. There is also a 40 per cent chance that eastern States like Odisha, West Bengal, the north-east, and most of Jammu and Kashmir may get normal rains during the south-west monsoon period. Paddy arrivals in the market are also sluggish, indicating that actual production is either lower than the estimated production of 107 million tonnes of rice, or that some of the stocks is being held back in the anticipation of a higher price.
In the current scenario of climate change, predictions of extreme weather events are becoming difficult. In March-April this year, we had unexpected hailstorms and heavy rainfall in parts of central and north-west India. Outside India also, most of California is experiencing extreme drought with storage levels in the major reservoirs as well as lakes well below historic levels. Australia experienced what has been described as the Millennium drought which led to the growth of water markets and to renewed emphasis on water security measures.
In India, unlike in the United States and Australia, agriculture is not just a food producing enterprise but also the backbone of the livelihood security of nearly 60 per cent of the population. Therefore, there is no time to relax in the area of taking anticipatory steps to safeguard food, water, energy and livelihood security in rural India, in the event of an erratic monsoon. We should initiate proactive steps immediately to ensure food and drinking water security for not only people but also for the over one billion farm animal population. Aberrations in monsoon behaviour are not uncommon, having been with us throughout our agricultural history. What is new is the difficulty in forecasting caused by factors coming under the generic title, “Climate change.”
The recent report of the Inter-Governmental Panel on Climate Change has warned of higher mean temperatures and a rise in sea level if we do not take action on cutting down greenhouse gas emissions. The low carbon pathway of development still remains a topic for academic discussion rather than for political and practical action. International prices of food and other agricultural commodities tend to remain volatile. The right to food enshrined in the National Food Security Act can be implemented only with the help of our farmers, unlike the right to information which can be implemented with the help of files. Right now, the government has enough stock to fulfil the legal obligation of providing 5 kg of wheat, rice or millets per month to nearly 75 per cent of our population. With one widespread drought, the current food stocks may disappear. Even this year, market arrivals of paddy have been as low as 42 per cent in West Bengal, 34 per cent in Bihar and 23 per cent in Odisha. Hence, there is no time to relax in the areas of food production and safe storage
Fortunately, we still have a large untapped production reservoir in most foodgrains even with technologies available on the shelf. What is important is the mobilisation of group endeavour among farm families with small holdings in areas such as plant protection, water harvesting and post-harvest technologies. The new government must accord priority to both water security and water use efficiency. Water harvesting in homes, farms and factories must become mandatory. Tamil Nadu has already initiated steps in this direction. The rain-cum-solar energy centre functioning in Chennai is a source of credible public information on rainwater harvesting and solar energy use. Such centres need to be replicated in all our cities, towns and block headquarters.
The latest technologies for using the available water in the most efficient manner possible should be adopted. On fertilizer use efficiency, there are technologies such as those developed by the International Fertilizer Development Center (IFDC) in the U.S. which can help improve the efficiency of urea use by about 50 per cent. Methods of managing the triple alliance of pests, pathogens and weeds must be popularised.
Besides causing food and water shortage, deficient rainfall adds to the problem of energy shortage. In every calamity lies an opportunity for progress. Harvesting of the sun in homes, offices, fields and factories should also become mandatory; it can help increase energy supply in rural and urban areas. At the post-harvest stage, a national grain storage policy with these three components must be adopted — we should promote the use of small storage bins, like the Pusa Bin, at the farm level. Second, we should implement the rural godown scheme for safe storage of foodgrains and perishable commodities at the village level. Such a rural godown scheme was introduced as early as 1979, but the programme has yet to take off in a manner that can make a difference to preventing the loss of food items at the village/block levels. Third, we should establish a national grid of ultramodern foodgrain silos in at least 50 locations in the country, each capable of storing about a million tonnes. Unfortunately, there is still a mismatch between production and post-harvest technologies, with producers and consumers unable to get the full benefit of higher production.
For the food and water security of farm animals, we need to earmark potential areas for establishing cattle camps where the animals can be looked after during a drought emergency. These camps should have access to water. A suggestion I had made over three decades ago that we should identify and establish groundwater sanctuaries at appropriate places is yet to be implemented. These are concealed aquifers which should be tapped only when absolutely essential. Like a wildlife sanctuary, they should be protected from exploitation. The establishment of such sanctuaries — at least one each in the 130 agroclimatic zones generally identified in our country — will help us to save precious cattle and other farm animals, both from distress sale and starvation deaths.
As the speaker in the “Sardar Patel Memorial lecture” series on All India Radio, which I delivered in 1973, I had suggested that we should develop drought, flood and good weather codes to minimise the adverse impact of unfavourable monsoons and to maximise production in a good monsoon year. The drought code consists of a series of dos and don’ts during deficient rainfall. As in the case of drought and flood codes, seed banks consisting of seeds of alternative crops should be maintained. Seed reserves are as important for crop security as grain reserves are important for food security. For example, during the recent and severe drought in California, it was found that some of the earlier crops like millets had survived with a reasonable yield, while wheat or rice could not withstand the severe drought.
Fortunately in our National Food Security Act, there is provision to procure and supply under the Public Distribution System, local grains like ragi, bajra, jowar and a whole series of minor millets. Since such crops require milling, they have been referred to as coarse cereals. They should be referred to as climate smart nutri cereals. They are now being provided at Rs.1 per kg — an extremely attractive price from the point of view of resource poor consumers. Such underutilised crops are now known to be rich in macro and micronutrients and could help in the fight against protein hunger caused by the deficiency of protein in diets and hidden hunger caused by the deficiency of micronutrients such as iron, iodine, zinc, Vitamin A and Vitamin B. If the Food Security Act is backed by a nutrition literacy movement, the demand for climate smart nutri-cereals will grow. This will help in promoting the cultivation of crops which may do better under drought conditions.
In each of the major agroclimatic zones, at least two members (a woman and a man) of every panchayat or local body should be trained to be climate risk managers. They can help the rest of the community in implementing the provisions of the proposed drought, flood and good weather codes. The government has recently introduced a national policy on agroforestry. Agroforestry combines the benefits of carbon sequestration and local food security. The inclusion of fertilizer trees in agroforestry systems can help build soil carbon banks.
This year is the International Year of Family Farming. Family farming is both a way of life and a means to livelihood. India has probably the largest number of family farmers. Our aim should be to make every family farm a climate smart farm, equipped with the knowledge and technologies essential to manage the expected El Niño triggered adverse rainfall conditions.

Railway security is a nightmare
","Four hours after two explosive devices went off on the Bangalore-Guwahati Express in Chennai on Thursday, the national capital’s iconic Old Delhi station was on red alert, or so television channels reported.
Passengers shoved their way, with their luggage, through a door-frame metal-detector, which beeped in protest uselessly. The police were putting up a brave show of searching some passengers’ bags, but it was a Sisyphean task: for every one held up, hundreds more passed by.
The bombing of the train has once again underlined that India’s economic lifeline — its railway system — is a security nightmare. The bad news is: there isn’t much that can be done.
India’s Railway Protection Force, mandated to protect trains along with the State government-controlled Government Reserve Police, has thrown its hands up. “Look,” one officer told The Hindu, “there are more than 13 million passengers transiting railway stations every day. How on earth do you search all their luggage, and frisk all of them?”
Government data show that cases of on-train robbery have grown from 382 in 2003 to 1,096 in 2013, while murders have gone up from 246 to 270 — suggesting all kinds of criminals, not just terrorists, have a free run of trains.

International problem

It isn’t only India which faces problems protecting its trains. In December, a suicide-bomber killed 16 people at the railway station in >Russia’s Sochi, the latest in a long string of attacks. In 2004, >an attack on trains in Madrid killed 191 and injured over 1,800 — numbers rivalling the >2006 bombings in Mumbai. London saw >suicide bombings in 2005, killing 52 commuters and injuring over 400.
Last year, the police in Canada charged Tunisian national Chiheb Esseghaier, an industrial biotechnologist, and Palestinian Raed Jaser, with conspiring to derail a high-speed train between Toronto’s Union Station and New York City, 550 kilometres to its south-east. Large parts of the track are unmonitored by closed circuit television, making such an attack easy to execute.
In 2009, the United States’ Government Accountability Office published a review of railway security measures. The study noted that the “the number of riders passing through a subway system — especially during peak hours — make the sustained use of some security measures, such as airport style passenger screening checkpoints, difficult”.
Though many operators in the United States have made investments in passenger and baggage screening operations, the costs are daunting. New research may change that — for example, systems capable of detecting weapons and explosives as passengers pass through turnstiles — but only in the distant future.

Tough challenge

Experts agree the answer is stopping terrorists before they reach the stage of executing an attack. In the Canadian case, the attack was pre-empted because intelligence services in that country and the United States were able to infiltrate the plot early on. “Effective offensive police and intelligence work targeting terrorists is best defence,” says Ajai Sahni, the Director of the Institute of Conflict Management in New Delhi.
It is also important to keep some perspective on the risks posed by terrorism to the Indian rail passengers. In 2013, a year when the rail system saw no terrorism-related fatalities, 103 passengers were reported killed in five major accidents.
In 2010, the year of the bombing of the >Gyaneshwari Express by Maoists, 117 died because of accidents. In most years, >accidents claim far more lives than terrorism — and railway passengers are far safer than road commuters.

He is survived by daughter Tara Murali and two sons, Ramesh Pattabhiraman and P. Vasanthkumar. The last rites and cremation were performed on Thursday evening at Mylapore.
Narada Gana Sabha secretary R. Krishnaswami recalled Mr. Pattabhiraman’s association with the Sabha in the 1960s. “He was a supporter of good causes and during his two terms as a committee member of the Narada Gana Sabha in our infant stages, he was very supportive,” he said.
Veena maestro and Vice-Chancellor of Tamil Nadu Music and Fine Arts University E. Gayathri said that Mr. Pattabhiraman was a very fine gentleman and both Ms. Sulochna, his wife, and he were connoisseurs of music and art. “Though he held a very senior position in the Academy, he would not show it. I always regarded him in a special light,” she said.
Renowned Bharathanatyam artist and guru Sudharani Raghupathy recalled that Mr. Pattabhiraman was a great soul and loveable person.
“Inspite of his age, he would take the trouble to appreciate artists, including the very young ones. Usually people are very stingy with kind words, but he was a man who had a kind word for everyone,” she said.

When bullets rained on Muslim families in Bodo village
","“It was around 4.30 p.m. when we heard rattling sounds coming from the western side of our village. The continuous sounds of rapid firing advanced on us. There were about 40 of them, some in battle fatigues and faces covered with black cloth, and some others wearing khaki. All of them held weapons. They torched houses, fired indiscriminately at people and hacked those had fallen to bullets. Some people jumped into the river to save their lives. But the militants fired at them also. I just managed to flee the scene and snatched our old trunk and jumped into the Beki river. Holding on to the floating trunk, I swam for about 20 minutes and reached here,” said Rezia Bewa, 60, a widow of Nanke Khagrabari in Baksa district of the Bodoland Territorial Area District, giving a firsthand account of the massacre of 18 persons, most of them women and children, by suspected militants on Friday afternoon in her village of migrant Muslim families.
Ten bodies were recovered on Friday night and eight others on Saturday, some floating in the Beki and some lying on the banks of the river. The village is located on the fringes of the Manas National Park.
Moidul Islam, a Class V student, said a bullet whizzed past him even as he saw one man being hit by another bullet. Moidul was not able to trace his mother Maibul Nessa and five-year-old sister Jaigan Nessa till Saturday afternoon while he fled into a nearby jungle and stayed there until he was rescued by villagers. The villagers said more than 20 persons were still missing.
Kasem Ali, 30, who was home, first mistook the firing for gunshots fired by forest guards at timber smugglers. “Some of us ran towards to the forest camp. But more firing came from the camp direction. I ran to the nearby jungle and hid there and came out only when someone told me that the Army had already arrived at the village,” he said.
Fakhruddin, 52, had just arrived at the Bhangarpar market on Friday afternoon when he suddenly got a call from his 11-year-old son Sariful Islam that militants had attacked the village.
“My son told me to get back and save them. As I turned back, I saw the houses in my village across the Beki going up in flames. I jumped into the river and swam to rush back home. By the time I reached there along with some others, all houses including mine had been reduced to ashes. Bodies of women and children were lying here and there in pools of blood. I could find none of my family members anywhere in the village,” Fakhruddin told The Hindu on Saturday. His two minor sons were rescued by the villagers as they were holding on to a log and swimming in the river on Saturday morning. However, Fakhruddin’s 12-year-old daughter Alia is still missing.
Most of the male members of Nanke Khagrabari had been at the daily afternoon market here, about 35 km from Barpeta Road town in lower Assam’s Barpeta district, when the militants swooped down on their village. They watched helplessly as their houses went up in flames.
About 500 people, including 200 minor children of the village, have taken shelter in a relief camp opened by the Baksa district administration at Narayanguri Azadpur L.P. School. The administration also brought rice, salt, dal and mustard oil for distribution among them.

Security stepped up at railway stations in Mysore division
","Security has been stepped up at important railway stations in Mysore division following the twin blasts onboard the Bangalore–Guwahati Express at Chennai Central station on Thursday.
Divisional Railway Manager Rajkumar Lal told The Hindu they had security protocol in place that automatically came into effect during such situations. He, however, added that he had given instructions to senior security personnel to personally supervise the operations.
“Though there are no major threat perceptions regarding Mysore division, nothing is left to chance. At the Mysore station, we have an established security protocol for the rakes maintained at the station,” he said.
“While some of the cleaning operations have been outsourced through private contractors, there is no entry without ID cards. In addition, their activities are monitored by the Railway Police and the Railway Protection Force,” said Mr. Lal.
In addition, senior officials conducted random security checks, he added. Mr. Mohanan, a senior official in charge of security, said important trains were checked for suspicious objects by sniffer dogs while the RPF squad provided security for all long-distance trains running in the division. “The squad accompanies the trains running through sensitive areas,” he said.
Another official on condition of anonymity said that while preventive measures were in place, there was also a high degree of monitoring though it was unobtrusive by nature. Most of these security protocols came into place following earlier terror attacks on trains.
In the meantime, the Integrated Security System for Mysore is being put in place in a phased manner and this includes round-the-clock monitoring of the station premises through a network of closed circuit television (CCTV) cameras, vehicle and baggage scanning instruments and metal detectors at the main entry and exit points.
Mysore is one of the important stations identified for implementing the Integrated Security System in view of its tourism importance and originating passenger traffic from the station.
Apart from the platforms, the parking area and maintenance section would also be under surveillance. Mr. Lal said that while some of the measures are already in place, implementation was an ongoing process. It would be completed in another six to eight months at an estimated cost of Rs. 3 crore, he said.

Equal in every way
","On April 15, 2014, India’s Supreme Court took a major step in making India more inclusive and humane, by according legal recognition for the first time to the ‘third’ gender or ‘transgender’ people. The fact that these people do not belong to either the male or female gender should not be used, the highest court directs, to block their entry into educational institutions or employment. The judges went further to classify transgender people as ‘other backward classes’, thereby making them eligible for affirmative reservations in education and public employment.
The significance of this enlightened judgment — in reversing a long history of ‘unspeakable violence’ endured by transgender people since colonial times — is highlighted by a significant report titled ‘Transcending the Binaries: Transgender Exclusions in Law and Policy’ by Shubha Chacko and Arvind Narrain, for the forthcoming India Exclusion Report 2013-14 by the Centre for Equity Studies.
Transgender people, they explain, are people who live fully or partially the gender role ‘opposite’ to their biological sex. They quote Veena, a hijra in Bangalore, who declares, “I am a transgender, a woman, dalit, sex worker, socialist, and poor. I am all these things and much more. And I fight to build up a world where I will be accepted for everything I am.”
But the ambiguous sexuality of transgender people, their refusal to accept the sexual identity imposed on them by biology and birth, has led to a long history of social and official refusal to accept them as equal citizens or human beings. Instead they are treated — often violently — as the ‘other’, what the authors describe as ‘invisible, ridiculous, horrific or disgusting’. They are “often laughed at, shunned, rejected by their families, denied jobs, ration cards and passports, and exploited by others in the professions they are allowed into (for instance, seeking alms and sex work). They repeatedly face a host of problems from institutions as diverse as family to the medical establishment including the arms of the state, particularly the police. The social and cultural practice of discrimination coupled with poverty, illiteracy and limited opportunities of employment have led to increased vulnerability of these communities.”
The report highlights the many ways that both criminal and civil law in India have criminalised and legally withheld elementary rights from transgender people. The authors trace the contemporary criminalisation of transgender people to the 1897 amendment to the Criminal Tribes Act of 1871, sub-titled ‘An Act for the Registration of Criminal Tribes and Eunuchs’. Under this statute, a eunuch was ‘deemed to include all members of the male sex who admit themselves, or on medical inspection clearly appear, to be impotent.’ Any eunuch who appeared ‘dressed or ornamented like a woman in a public street….or who dances or plays music or takes part in any public exhibition, in a public street….[could] be arrested without warrant and punished with imprisonment of up to two years or with a fine or both.’ A eunuch was considered incapable of acting as guardian, making a gift, drawing up a will or adopting a son. Although this ‘law stands repealed today in theory’, Chacko and Narrain find that it ‘continues to exist as part of the living culture of law’.
There is the infamous Section 377 of the IPC which makes punishable ‘unnatural offences’ of voluntary and consenting sexual intercourse which goes ‘against the order of nature’. The Immoral Trafficking Prevention Act 1896 has been amended to be gender neutral and, in theory, does not criminalise sex work; but by making soliciting and running brothels illegal, sex workers are continuously vulnerable. The report finds that transgender sex workers tend to be arrested on charges of stealing and extortion rather than for sex work. Apart from sex work, the only other profession that society permits transgender people to enter is begging, but anti-begging laws, another colonial legacy, are used to arrest and detain transgender people who solicit alms for a living.
Chacko and Narrain also show how sexual non-conformity is used to bar access of transgender people to many civil rights, even though they in theory enjoy the same fundamental rights as people who accept the sexual identities that biology has assigned them. Prior to this historic judgement of India’s Supreme Court, “The Indian state’s policy of recognising only two sexes and refusing to recognise hijras as women, or as a third sex (if a hijra wants it), has deprived them, at a stroke, of several rights that Indian citizens take for granted. These rights include the right to vote, the right to own property, the right to marry, the right to claim a formal identity through a passport and a ration card, a driver’s license, the right to education, employment, health so on. Such deprivation secludes hijras from the very fabric of Indian civil society.”
Transgender people are excluded both by state and society. They are not protected by the state when raped, they are only offenders. Shubha Chacko explains that the state does not even count them, because they do not count. They trouble us so much because they force us to question body and desire; and their existence challenges — even subverts — patriarchy, which celebrates masculinity, while here is a group that rejects their biologically-given manhood. And it is a very lonely community. However oppressed you are, say as a dalit or a Muslim, at least you have your family to fall back on. But not transgender people. They have only people ‘like them’ to fall back on, no one else.
The progressive — even if greatly belated — judgment of the Supreme Court will not change overnight the destinies of people who do not conform to the sexual practices of the majority of the population. But it reminds us of the unacceptable ways that our society and law treat people of difference — with contempt, injustice and violence. It will hopefully pave the way for a more humane and inclusive world for people who may or may not be like you or me, but that in no way makes them less human.

KSRTC bus fares may go up by 7 per cent in two days
","The Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) has decided to hike bus fares across the board by an average seven to eight per cent, and the formal announcement will be made in the next couple of days.
The last time the transport corporation increased bus fares (by 10.5 per cent) was on June 15, 2013.
Addressing presspersons here on Friday, Minister for Transport Ramalinga Reddy said that the KSRTC proposal to hike bus fares comes in the wake of increased diesel prices and maintenance cost.
The transport corporation had incurred loss amounting to Rs. 200 crore, and the implementation of the proposed hike was inevitable, he said. On April 24 this year, Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC) hiked fares across the board by an average of 15 per cent.
Asked about the quantum of hike, the Minister said, “It is very less; may be half of the BMTC bus fare hike.” The hike could have been avoided if the State government had extended tax exemption to all road transport corporations (RTCs), he added. With the extended deadline for installing emergency doors in luxury buses ending on April 30, he said that the department had launched a drive against buses plying without the mandatory exit doors. Buses without emergency exit doors, including inter-State ones, operating from the State would be seized. More than 50 private buses without emergency exit doors had been seized in the Majestic and Kalasipalyam areas in Bangalore and a few elsewhere.
He said that emergency doors would be added to all single-door KSRTC Pushpak buses.
Such doors have been fixed on 100 Pushpak buses and work was on to provide the facility in another 200 such buses.
In November 2013, the department announced that buses without emergency doors would not be allowed to operate after April 30, 2014.

Prolonged drought condition hits mango productivity
","Mango productivity has been hit in the district due to prolonged drought conditions, according to growers.
In only a matter of few years, the productivity had come down to 30 per cent of the original yield due to water shortage, said V. Vaideeswaram, president, Erode District Mango Growers' Association. Alphonso, Bangalora and Imam Pasand varieties are mostly grown in Erode district.
Mangoes have started arriving in large quantities from Salem and other parts of the State to the markets in Erode. Though the mango season has begun, it will take a month more for fruit-cutting to begin in the district.
Due to the low productivity, there is no compulsion for the growers in the district to ripen mangoes in bulk by artificial means, Mr.
Vaideeswaram said. The stocks kept in the market come under periodic scrutiny of the Food Safety department. Mangoes ripened with calcium carbide stones are confiscated.
Farmers say artificial ripening of fruits is not unusual the world over. For, ripe fruits cannot be transported. The raw fruits, after harvest, are first transported and then ripened at places close to consumption. But, ripening of the fruit with calcium carbide, a chemical material made of limestone, is illegal in India due to health risks, reflecting in vomiting, diarrhea, and burning sensation. The Food Safety Department, sources said, confiscates mango stocks if it is found that only the outer skin of the fruit has ripened while the flesh remains firm and more fibrous. Such fruits, the sources said, are more acidic and have shorter shelf life. ""In Erode district, growers use doses of ethylene to induce ripening. This method of ripening is legal,"" Mr. Vaideeswaram said.

Assam violence: Nine more bodies recovered in Baksa district
","Nine more bodies were recovered from a village in Baksa district on Saturday morning, taking the toll to 32 in the violence unleashed by >NDFB-Songbijit militants in Bodoland Territorial Administration Districts (BTADC) area in Assam.
The bodies of the victims, including four children and two women, were recovered from Khagrabari village under Salbari sub-division adjacent to the Manas National Park, official sources said.
Bodies of two children were identified as Ilina Khatun and Ariful Islam.
Three children, aged between seven and ten years, who were hiding in a forest on the banks of river Beki were also rescued, the sources said.

The Army has been staging flag marches in the >violence-hit areas to instil confidence among people and to bring the situation under control, the sources said.
The violence started when heavily armed NDFB-S militants entered a house and shot dead three members of a family, including two women, and injured an infant of a minority community near Ananda Bazar area in Baksa district on Thursday.
This was followed by indiscriminate firing by the insurgents at Balapara-I village in neighbouring Kokrajhar district in the early hours on Friday which left eight persons dead and injuring several others in their own houses.
Last night, 12 bullet-riddled bodies, including those of five women and a child, were recovered from Nankekhadrabari and Nayanguri villages in Baksa district where nearly 100 houses and a wooden bridge were set ablaze by the ultras.
Meanwhile, police fired in the air at Basbari in Baksa district when a mob armed with spears and sticks tried to set ablaze a Forest Range office on Saturday morning.
The agitators complained that their houses had been burnt down by militants and government had failed to protect their lives and property, official sources said.
A total of 22 people have so far been arrested in connection with the violence.

Dispute over Rs.3 costs litigant Rs. 20,000
","The Madras High Court Bench here has imposed a cost of Rs.20,000 on a litigant who initiated criminal proceedings against a government bus conductor and three managerial-level officers of Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation for having issued Rs.10 ticket instead of a Rs.7 ticket for travelling from Manapparai to Vaiyampatti in Theni district on July 1, 2013.
Dismissing a criminal revision petition, Justice P.N. Prakash ordered that the litigant should pay Rs. 5,000 to each of the four individuals, against whom he had initiated the proceedings, within two weeks. “The entire prosecution case is a clear abuse of process of law and an attempt to browbeat and intimidate the respondents who are public servants,” the judge observed.
The petitioner had initially moved a private complaint before a judicial magistrate court accusing the TNSTC bus conductor Saravanan, Cumbum Branch Manager Pandiyarajan, Deputy Manager (Commercial) Ganesan and Assistant Manager (Maintenance) Archunan of having committed offences under Section 166 (public servants disobeying law) of the Indian Penal Code.
The Magistrate recorded the sworn statement of the complainant and dismissed the private complaint on the ground that the latter had not made out a prima facie case against the accused for issuing process to them. Not leaving it at that, the petitioner had moved the High Court through the present revision petition and questioned the Magistrate’s decision.
“At the first blush, I thought that the Conductor was illegally demanding excess fare from passengers. On a close scrutiny of the case, it appears that the Conductor had given Rs.10 denomination ticket to the revision petitioner for the alleged travel from Manapparai to Vaiyampatti. I am at loss to understand as to how this action of the Conductor would amount to an offence under Section 166 IPC. After all, he is acting under the directions of the government by giving 10 rupees ticket,” the judge added.

Bangalore-Mangalore high-speed rail project may face many challenges
","The proposed high-speed rail connectivity between Bangalore and Mangalore could be the most challenging among such projects being planned to decongest the State’s capital.
Minister for Infrastructure R. Roshan Baig, who announced last week that the new infrastructure policy would be formulated after consultations with all stakeholders, had spoken about the need to bring investment to implement high-speed rail projects connecting Bangalore to Mangalore, Mysore, Kolar, Tumkur, Hubli and Belgaum.
G.G. Mohandas Prabhu, who formerly headed the infrastructure subcommittee of the Kanara Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said introduction of any more passenger trains on the Bangalore-Mangalore railway line would not be easy.
The tripartite agreement that Hassan Mangalore Rail Development Company Ltd. (HMRDC), floated to undertake gauge conversion of the line, has entered into with the Railways and the State government limits the movement of passenger trains on the line. The line capacity is to be used primarily for goods services, according to a key feature of the agreement.
The agreement says, “SWR (South Western Railway) shall be entitled to run on the project railway, the equivalent of the passenger services that already were operational on the MG (metre gauge) track … without payment of any access charges. Provided, however, that any new passenger service on the project railway shall be commenced only with the prior written consent of HMRDC.”
Mr. Prabhu, a member of the Konkan Railway Users Consultative Committee, said the State government would have to first take steps to ease the conditions in the agreement before thinking of increasing the passenger train service or talking about high speed trains.
R.L. Dias, leader of the Udupi Yathri Sangha, told The Hindu that it was impossible to run high-speed trains on the track which had deep slope between Sakleshpur and Subramanya Road. Passenger trains take about two-and-a-half hours to cover the 55-km stretch, with two locomotives used.
If the government was keen on high-speed trains, it would have to ensure laying of a line to Bangalore via Nandikur, Karkala, Ujire, Charmadi and Mudigere, he said. This proposal, he said, had been submitted to the Railway Board. The line could be linked to the Sakleshpur-Kadur line, which is under construction. Another new link line from Mudigere to Belur could provide a track that could take high-speed trains between Mangalore and Bangalore, he said.

Where getting married at three is not unusual
","Neelu (name changed), an eight-year-old, speaks like one and her eyes have the gleam and wonder of a little girl.
The only aberration here is that Neelu, a class IV student who loves studying English and Maths, has been married for five years.
“
Shaadi kab ho gai, kuch yaad nahi [I remember nothing about when I got married],” she says.
Neelu, like several other young girls, was married off on Akshaya Tritiya or Akha Teej, the third lunar day of the Indian month of Vaishakh.
Considered extremely auspicious, Akshaya Tritiya — it fell on a Friday this year — is best known in Rajasthan for the large number of child marriages that are solemnised on this day.
In Neelu’s village, Chittorgarh district’s Ganpatkheda, getting married at three is not out of the ordinary.
Child marriage, despite the discourse on social development and progress, is still rampant in Rajasthan and cuts across regions, caste groups and districts.
This age-old social practice, which was based on mutual economic benefit, has now grown to be used as a way to impose control over female sexuality.
About 400 km from Neelu’s village, Nathi Bai, a 57-year-old woman from Bagon ki Dhani near Jaipur, uses a unique brand of logic to justify child marriages.
“I was seven when I got married. Earlier, young girls were often married off along with their elder sisters in order to save money,” she says.
“They just understand more these days...in our time, girls and boys would roam around naked till they were 10, but now they are attracted to each other very early on,” she says.
Community members concede that it is strange for child marriage to persist to this day but maintain that the rationale behind the practice has changed. Whereas earlier financial and logistical concerns would necessitate the practice, parents today perform child marriages because technology has led to a rise in precocious sexual maturity, they said. “Money is not an issue anymore; everyone has money. But there is the mobile phone and the Internet and WhatsApp available to children [today]. Everyone has access to pornography, and there is this heightened sexual urge among children these days. So, parents want to marry them off early,” says Dayal Bairwa of Renwal near Jaipur.
Curiously, popular perception holds that child marriages helps deal with the rapidly falling sex ratio. “If a boy isn’t married off by 21, there’s a good chance he will stay unmarried... because there are so few girls left,” says Laduram Chaudhary.
“We think girls should be married off by 15 as [unlike] earlier girls and boys understand stuff [today]... now they know everything,” he says.
The efforts of the police and administration continue to be limited to issuing circulars and alerts. The Jaipur district administration recently issued an order that anybody participating in a child marriage — including caterers, musicians or priests — would be liable to be prosecuted under the State’s new Child Marriage Act of 2006.
“We had issued a circular alerting all police stations about this issue...if any such case is found then a FIR is registered,” says ADG (civil rights) R.P. Singh.
However, social activists say formal complaints/FIR against child marriages are few and far between.
But there are those that have dedicated their lives to confronting the pernicious practice.

>Bhanwari Devi, a grassroots social activist who was allegedly gang-raped for raising her voice against child marriages, feels things are changing.
Bhanwri, who received the full support of the people of her village Bhateri on issues ranging from literacy, health, education and rape, found herself alienated and ostracised when she spoke out against child marriages.
“Back then, it was very difficult. Nobody would listen to me and you know what happened then,” says Bhanwari, whose case led to the framing of the >Vishakha guidelines on sexual harassment of women at the workplace.
“Even now, things are not easy and I am still looked at with suspicion. But there has definitely been a huge change. Now, parents want their girl children to study and then get married at the right age. It is not a complete transformation but these things take time,” she says.

Six killed in accident on Grand Southern Trunk Road
","Six people travelling in a car, five of whom were of the same family, were killed in a road accident on Grand Southern Trunk Road at Madurantakam on Monday. The victims include an 18-month-old boy
The victims, hailing from Ginjee, were on their way to Chennai to attend a function. Kancheepuram district police sources said Maheswaran (30) was driving a Wagon R belonging to Baskar (35), a physiotherapist. On the bypass across the town, Maheswaran rammed a private bus that was slowing down.
The driver of a lorry that was travelling close to the car hit the brakes. However, as it was raining, the road was slippery and the driver was unable to bring the lorry to a halt. The lorry rammed the car that ended up trapped between the two heavy vehicles.
Maheswaran, Baskar, his wife Bhakiayalakshmi (30), a lecturer in a private engineering college in Tiruvannamalai, their son Harsha Aniruth, (18 months), and their two relatives Krishnan (72) and Karthik Balaji (24) died instantly.

Glitter and glad tidings
","There was a time when parents and family elders would take it upon themselves to buy gold every time whenever it was possible. And on occasions like Akshaya Tritiya, a small gold souvenir, if not an elaborate piece of jewellery, simply had to be bought for posterity’s sake. Of late however, an increasing number of young professionals have also begun to invest in the precious metal on such occasions. The reasons vary from carrying forth family traditions to making sensible investment choices.
Anubha Singh, a communications professional, prefers to buy some jewellery every year on Akshaya Tritiya. “I started doing this because I grew up watching my parents do so. Also it seemed like a good investment option. No matter how small, I ensure I buy a piece of jewellery. Earlier I would buy it for myself, now I buy something for my two-year-old daughter. It might seem silly to some people but in the long run the value of the jewellery I accumulate will only increase. The fact that it is keeping in mind the family tradition is just an added bonus,” she says.
According to popular belief buying something new and valuable on this day ensures continued prosperity. For Divya Nambiar though it also means a security investment. “I set aside a small sum every month so I can buy some gold or diamonds on Akshaya Tritiya. It could be anything from earrings to bracelets or even just a gold coin. At least I know that I have a small treasure of my own. Also the gold coins I bought over the last five years proved helpful when I was investing in property last year. When I needed a little extra cash I could fall back upon the gold that I had invested in,” she explains.
Rahul Nigam, brand manager at Meena Jewellers, who has been in the jewellery business since the early 1990s agrees that the trend has been changing over the years. “Earlier I’d see parents buying gold on such occasions for their daughters or daughters-in-law. However, these days the same youngsters who’d scoff at this habit of their parents are now investing in the precious metal. We get a lot of pre-orders from these people and they pick up the jewellery on Akshaya Tritiya day. Basically, young professionals these days are aware that the value of gold will never drop and it is a good security investment for them – much less riskier than investing in stocks,” he says, adding, “It is so easy to spot a young buyer because there is a sense of pride and confidence in them when they choose the piece of jewellery they’d like to buy. When they accompany their parents, it is usually the parents’ choice that comes to fore. But this is different.”
Incidentally, he says that it is young women who buy pieces of jewellery on Akshaya Tritiya. “Men prefer to invest in gold coins that thay can store in their lockers and use as and when required. Women on the other hand would rather buy jewellery because they want to enjoy it,” he smiles. Rahul adds that with the elections going on, this year’s sales haven’t been high so far. “With all the checking going on, there have been restrictions on the amount of cash people can carry.” Now with polling complete in and around Hyderabad, they hope to see more business.

Does footage from Bangalore hold the clue?
","The Government Railway Police and the Railway Protection Force here started analysing CCTV footage from the City station soon after the >twin blasts in a Guwahati-bound train from there at the Chennai Central railway station on Thursday.
“We have a hunch that the suspect could have boarded the train from the [Bangalore] city railway station, which left around 11.30 p.m. on Wednesday, and investigations are on to locate and identify the suspect,” a senior police officer said.
The 40 cameras at various points of the station could have recordings for three hours up to the departure of the train, another senior police official said.
The police have obtained call details from mobile-phone towers near the station.

Water-level in Vani Vilas Sagar fast depleting
","Owing to the fast depletion of the water-level at the Vani Vilas Sagar in Hiriyur taluk in the district, there is a possibility that Chitradurga city and Hiriyur taluk could face shortage of drinking water in the coming months.
The Vani Vilas Sagar was constructed across the Vedavati, by the kings of Mysore during the 1890s to provide water for drinking and irrigation in the surrounding areas. The dam, however, has not reached its full capacity in the last nine decades owing to various reasons, including scanty rainfall in the region.
Presently, the water-level in the dam is about 68.5 ft against the full reservoir level of 145 ft, and the dead storage level is 60 ft. Silt accumulationThere is a considerable decrease in the storage capacity of the dam owing to silt accumulation. No steps have been taken to remove silt from the dam since its construction, sources said. The water available in the dam can be supplied for another two months, sources said. Apart from Chitradurga city and Hiriyur taluk, water has to also be supplied to premier institutes such as ISRO, DRDO and India Reserve Battalion as per agreements signed with them.
The authorities have also granted permission for the construction of barrages at some places across the Vedavati in Kallod and check-dams at certain places, which would further reduce the flow of water to the dam. Instead of granting permission for construction of barrages and check-dams, the authorities should first remove silt from the dam as it had considerably affected storage capacity, sources added.

And it stopped, short…
","Bidding adieu to the clock-less clock tower in Russell Market, we head towards Palace Road. The clock tower in the Central College premises is perhaps the second oldest in Bangalore. If the Russell Market clock tower stands uncared for, surrounded by haphazardly built structures around it, the one in Central College is clouded by the Bangalore Metro project. As if to say ‘far from the madding crowd’, this regal clock tower stands quietly on the lush green campus. So quiet, that it doesn’t even tick.
“It must have stopped working more than ten years ago,” friendly souls on the campus offer. “The maintenance of this clock has been taken up by Titan. We have been asking them to set it right, somehow it hasn’t happened…,” the officer in the Engineering Department of the Bangalore University explains.
Central College was started in 1858 as Central High School with just about five students. In those days it was just a small shed with the Rev. J. Garrett as its principal. For a period of eight years, between 1876-1884, the vice-principal was Mushir-ur-Talim, grandfather of the great scientist Homi Jehangir Bhaba. The administrative block of the college -- as the small inscribed stone slab on the face of the building says -- was built in 1882, also the year in which the clock tower was built. The university itself was set up in 1886 on the same premises. The clock tower and other red sandstone buildings on the premises of Central College were constructed around the time when the Attara Kutcheri (now the High Court of Karnataka), Carlton House and the Cubbon Park library were built.
Most books on Bangalore’s monuments and historic buildings speak of this strikingly beautiful structure in glowing terms. One of the most accurate descriptions says this: “The Gothic style architecture is characterised by a steep roof of Mangalore tiles, topped with row of decorative ridge-tiles, iron crested towers, turreted parapets and gables, intricately done plaster motifs conspicuous in the elevation in a contrasting colour, cast iron railings and pilasters and parilions rising from the wing.” A. Jayaram, an expert on Bangalore, says the The Central College main block has many similarities with the St.Andrew’s Church on the Cubbon Road. The latter was earlier referred to as the Scottish Kirk.
It is interesting how the clock tower became a part of the life of people on the campus. In the Central College Centenary Souvenir brought in 1958, there are several references to the clock tower. In a joint article “Reminiscences”, C. Rajagopalachari and his close friend, the Kannada writer Navarathna Rama Rao write: “We knew intimately and loved everything in the College from the lawn and the cricket field -- Oh, what a cricket field it was, with a border of ancient trees which gave shelter to boys young and old while they watched the varying fortunes of the battle their soldiers were fighting on the field -- everything from the lawn and the cricket field to the venerable trees which bounded them, and from the straggling outhouses by the muddy pond, to the austere red College building with the gaunt clock tower keeping watch over it…”
The clock tower which has now entered the realm of ‘timelessness’ was an object of curiousity and questioning always. K. Dwarakanath records this in the souvenir. “When I came from the Maharaja’s College to Central College in Bangalore, this Gothic architecture was one of the first three features that struck my mind. Another was the clock tower which is unique in its own way. I remember how in many a general knowledge test, there was this question on how many clocks that the tower has, and many students gave wrong answers…”
We too did a small quiz as we stood there – beaming happy smiles, most said: “Oh, we don’t know…”

(This is second in the three-part series on Clock Towers in Bangalore)

","About 500 security personnel fanned across railway stations in the Capital, the bomb disposal squad began extensive checking and sniffer dogs were deployed to look for explosives as a high alert was sounded across Delhi stations following the bomb blast at the Chennai Central railway station on Thursday.
“The dog squad has been deployed since morning, while the bomb disposal squad is on standby. Checking and frisking of passengers and their baggage has been increased. While usually there are adequate number of policemen at the station premises, around 500 personnel are on patrolling duty at the stations on Thursday,” said Deputy Commissioner of Police (Crime and Railways) Sanjeev Bhatia.
Officials claim the situation is under control even on normal days.
“General Railway Police personnel are onboard all long distance trains. Different teams keep changing their personnel as per the jurisdiction. The presence of cops on board helps check petty crimes as well,” said Northern Railway spokesperson Neeraj Sharma.
Though officials claim presence of manpower and round-the-clock surveillance, some recent incidents — cases of dacoity onboard trains — in areas closer to the Capital have of late exposed the chinks in the security apparatus.
For their part, the authorities term such cases as aberrations. Railway officials here said that the GRP had recently launched an extensive drive against robbers and busted a gang with the arrest of three active members from neighbouring Ghaziabad.

Care to take a stand?
","
It’s Never too Late, Priyanka Baranwal’s debut novel, talks about how we live deluded lives — lives where we think we are safe, where we believe nothing bad can happen to us.

The plot thickens

The story revolves around Maya, whose picture-perfect life is cruelly destroyed by two insensitive delinquents. She married Rajat, the love of her life, and watched their beautiful bundle of joy, Sejal, grow. They were happy in their little bubble, until that horrific night.
Will Maya have the strength to fight her fate? Will she be able to save her five-year-old and herself in Rajat’s absence? Will she be able to break stereotypes and face the male-dominated society after that fateful night? Will Rajat stand up with her as she decides to battle her fears and ensure the culprits are severely punished?
In a nation where women are taught to be submissive at every stage, where a woman is repeatedly told that she needs a man to protect her, where she is forced to stay closeted from the rest of the world, Maya stands out. In a society that faults women for heinous crimes like rape, Maya stands up.
The story starts by portraying the relationship between Maya and Rajat, one of love and respect for each other, in simple, yet captivating language. All too soon, there’s a twist in the tale and the book is hard to put down till one knows the outcome.
Maya is an inspiration to readers with her strength in the face of adversity, smart thinking, courage and the will to go on. What struck me as novel was the series of facts at the end about rape in India. It may seem morbid but it’s the sad state of affairs in the country.
I believe the plot has been written with the intention of making a difference — not just in the lives of women, but everyone, the central theme being to face our fears, emerge victorious over them by never giving up, to keep trying no matter how desolate the future may seem. Fate won’t ever give you something you can’t handle.

Wandering prankster sent police into a tizzy
","A backpack with a laptop, two cellphones and 35 SIM cards obtained without identity proof — this was 23-year-old S. Sivakumar’s arsenal as he spread panic in the city with a bomb hoax. The native of Bangalore, who has been a pavement dweller on Walltax Road for the past few years, sent law enforcement agencies into a tizzy by claiming that a bomb was planted in Chennai Central station, five days after one person died in the twin blasts there.
Around 10 a.m., on Tuesday, Station Master Govindasamy of Chennai Central received an anonymous call. The man on the line said that a bomb would explode close to the main ticket counter. Bomb squads, along with city police, combed the station for a few hours before they concluded that the threat was a hoax.
With prank calls of this sort becoming a headache for the police, the Cyber Cell actively pursued the case.
“We were tracking the mobile number but soon, the prankster changed SIM cards although the handset remained the same. He kept shifting between Egmore, Waltax Road and Saidapet,” said an investigating officer.
When investigators contacted the prankster in the guise of bankers selling credit cards, his answer was simply, “I know you are cops. Catch me if you can.”
Police managed to nab Sivakumar by Tuesday evening. “He roams around the city and notes down phone numbers on posters of missing persons. He then calls on the number and claims he knows where the missing person is and will provide details in return for money. He has cheated many people this way,” said Deputy Commissioner of Central Crime Branch, S. Jeyakumar.
Five persons who were injured in the blasts were shifted from the Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital to the Railway hospital, Perambur. Seven of the 14 who were injured have already been released and two are recovering after surgery.
Anjaneyalu (29) of Andhra Pradesh, G. Hari (29) of Bangalore, Bijan Kumar (14) of Manipur, Bimal Kumar Das (43) and Saren Barman (31) of West Bengal were shifted to the Railway Hospital.

The best sheets
","My grandmother always stressed the importance of making the bed well, especially when one has house guests. To this day I love watching her make the bed, she makes it look effortless and the end result is beautiful. The sheets she uses are soft and sweet smelling, and have been collected over the years from trips abroad—good quality bed linen wasn’t always available in India as it is now. The bed linen is freshly laundered and ironed; first to go on the bed is the fitted sheet, a top sheet is then added and the corners folded back neatly and the sides tucked into the mattress, a pillow inserted into a matching case is placed at the head of the bed. When it is cold a blanket is layered over the top sheet. The finishing touch is a pretty counterpane that covers the bed and finally cushions are artfully placed on top.
I recently made a trip to a department store to buy some new bed linen, the number of brands, variety in design and material was astounding. Fitted sheets, pretty duvets, even things like mattress protectors were available.
“People are more open and willing to invest in home décor not just in terms of interior design but also the products and items they use when it comes to bed linens, pillows, bed runners etc,” says Arun Bhawsingka, CEO Creative Portico Pvt Ltd, their brand Portico New York which deals with bed and bath furnishings is available at most department stores. Home décor magazines, television shows and social media has heavily influenced and exposed people to the art of making the bed, “The influence of international trends and many brands now available in the market has created more awareness,” says Akanksha Himatsingka, Director of Atmosphere Furnishings which has stores across the country. “More importantly it is the visual influence of social media platforms such as Pinterest, Instagram, etc, that offer a variety of DIY bed linen ideas, which many are embracing and experimenting with.”
Portico New York prides itself on having bed linen to suit every budget, “We do solids and self-jacquards. We also have theme based designs, which could be teamed with matching comforters and duvets,” says Arun. Portico New York has also had fashion designers like Manish Arora and Neeta Lulla design bed linen for them.
Bed linen is all about personal taste and style, whether you want bright motifs or subtle prints, pastel colours or vibrant tones. “We have a range of solids, stripes and patterns in percale and satin sheets at Atmosphere,” says Akanksha “The products are versatile, most of our sheets can be coordinated with the various designs offered.” This allows you to mix and match bed linen. “We don’t believe in collections and trends. We add new items every year but they all belong to the same world,” says Yamini Namjoshi, Brand Director of Bandit Queen which is an India based luxury home-linen brand that is available around the world. “A lot of detail and time goes into creating our products so we want them to be timeless in design and usage.” Bandit Queen customises bed sheets based on size and if you want to feel truly special they can monogram your initials on the bed linen.
With summer upon us try to keep bed linen cool and light. “Summer bedding should be light and easy, it can be fresh solid colours or interesting multi-coloured stripes in light tones mixed with neutrals,” says Akanksha.
Cottons and linens or even cotton-linen blends work best for the season. Thread count is something we have all heard about when it comes to choosing bed linen. Thread count is basically the number of horizontal and vertical threads that make up one square inch of fabric. So the higher the thread count the softer the sheet feels, but it is important to remember that higher thread count also weakens the fabric.
“Thread count is important to a degree,” says Yamini. “But the more threads you have in one square inch means that the thread used is thinner, which could make the fabric weaker. So there should be a balance between the tactile feeling of the material and durability.”
When it comes to buying bed linen pay attention to quality along with design. Considering the number of hours we spend in bed, the material should be comfortable, feel good and most of all enhance sleep.
Because after a hard day’s work nothing beats the feeling of getting in to a bed made with comfortable sheets that smell of sunshine and forgetting the world outside for a few hours.
Pay attention to the quality of the bed linen
Don’t buy sheets that have a high thread count, the material will be weaker
While buying fitted sheets make sure you know the dimensions of your mattress so that you buy the right size
Change your bed sheets at least once a week

Native dog breeds have their day
","There has been an increase in the demand for native breeds such as Sippipparai and Rajapalayam at the Dog Breeding Unit of the animal husbandry department at Saidapet.
Records show that in 2012-13 nearly 50 puppies of native breeds and 11 pedigree puppies were sold. The year before, 32 native breed puppies and 10 pedigree puppies were sold. The demand for native breed puppies has been on the rise since 2010-11, when the unit sold 26 native breed puppies and seven pedigree puppies.
Animal husbandry department authorities said that with the increased demand for native breed puppies, the waiting time for each breed would be more than a year. As the department did not breed dogs on a commercial basis, they would not be able to meet the demand, they said.
The unit is one of its kind in the State and was started in the 1980s to promote native dog breeds such as Rajapalayam, Sippipparai, Kombai and Kanni. However, Kombais and Kannis are now bred only by private individuals.
With a steady increase in the demand for native breeds, the State government in 2012-13 allocated Rs. 30 lakh for the renovation of kennels in the unit. With the funds, the authorities created tick channels (as during the summer the canines suffer from tick bites leading to spread of diseases), fixed tiles on the kennel walls and floors and an exhaust fan for each kennel, and raised the height of each kennel to nearly three feet.
The authorities have also provided individual water supply for the kennels, mainly to reduce heat radiation, and clean water for bathing the canines every day, the officer said.   
A senior animal husbandry officer conceded that a couple of years ago, the condition of the kennels were very bad. With the renovation, they are better now, he said.
The unit launched the pedigree breeding programme in 1997 because of public demand. At present, the unit houses nearly 30 canines including five puppies.
The prices of some of the breeds at the unit are less compared to those quoted by private pedigree breeders. For example a male Rajapalayam puppy is sold at Rs. 1,500 and a female at Rs. 1,250. The same puppy is sold at Rs. 7,000 by a private breeder (with proper documents about the lineage of the breed) and Rs. 5,000 without the documents.
Except for the Dalmatians, the unit has fixed a nominal price for the rest of the breeds housed there.

Low price leaves acid lime farmers with a bitter aftertaste
","For the farmers of Pudukottai district, the good yield of acid lime recorded this year hasn’t turned out to be a reason to celebrate, as poor price for their produce plays spoiler.
Despite severe drought conditions prevailing in the district for the past many months, acid lime farmers of more than 20 villages in Alangudi taluk, have registered good harvest, thanks to water from borewells.
The daily harvest from the villages stands of 15 tonnes is collected by the local commission agents and marketed in areas, including Tiruchi and Madurai. The cultivation cost has increased manifold due to various factors, particularly drought condition and load shedding.
Farmers adopt various methods for raising the crop. While a compact area is brought under comprehensive cultivation practice by some farmers, several others cultivate it as an intercrop. It is also raised in their backyard for commercial purpose.
Though the wholesale price for the fruits has shot up from Rs.15 per kg last year to Rs.50-Rs.60, the hike has not been enough to support the cultivation cost, say a cross section of farmers of Alangudi taluk.
What has come as a big shock to farmers is the exploitation by commission agents, who market it at Rs.150 per kg. There has been a good demand for the fruit this summer with patronage from juice stalls, says Selvam, a farmer of Senthangudi village.
The villages in Alangudi, Keeramangalam, Seriyalur, Kothamangalam, Kulamangalam, Senthankudi, Nagaram and Panankulam are the major areas noted for acid lime production in the district. A majority of the commission agencies are located in Keeramangalam, Kothamangalam, Vadakadu, Pulichangadu Kaikatti, Panankulam, and Kulamangalam.

In fight to save sister, woman takes down a caste panchayat
","After a year of determined struggle, Durga Gudilu, 22, has won the fight to save her sister from a marriage decided by a Vaidu caste panchayat here.
Ms. Gudilu succeeded in changing the minds of the panchayat members, all men, and on Sunday, they dissolved the panchayat to form a development panel instead, for the social uplift of the community.
“I opposed my sister’s marriage which was decided when she was born,” Ms. Gudilu told The Hindu. “Our parents educated us and we grew up in Mumbai. My graduate sister didn’t want to marry an uneducated man. That was her choice, and I supported her.” Ms. Gudilu’s family faced a social boycott. A woman of the socially and educationally backward community challenging the panchayat’s order was unheard of until then.
Ms. Gudilu approached her friends for help. “My parents were so scared to speak against the panchayat that they even threatened to kill themselves,” she said.
The Maharashtra Andhashraddha Nirmulan Samiti (MANIS), founded by >Narendra Dabholkar, the rationalist who was murdered, helped Ms. Gudilu. “We decided to hold discussions with senior panchayat members. Many were unaware of the fact that their work pronouncing punishments or deciding child marriages was unconstitutional,” said Krushna Chandgude of MANIS.
Swami Vaidu, a panchayat leader, said the decision to scrap the panchayat was in keeping with the changing times.

Bringing them to justice
","What happens to the election-related cases registered by the police in the city, now that the crucial part of campaign and polling is over?
The question assumes significance in the backdrop of police claims of cracking down on attempts to lure voters with money, liquor or gifts. The seizure of Rs.90 lakh from a person travelling on an APSRTC bus at Bollarum led to the arrest of the TDP nominee from Peddapally Assembly constituency.
K. Kamala, wife of former Minister K. Parthasarathy, who is the YSRC nominee from Machilipatnam Lok Sabha seat, was arrested a few days after Rs.45.10 lakh was seized from her while she was travelling on a bus at Vanasthalipuram. Criminal cases were registered in both instances, but the investigation is yet to be completed and charge-sheets filed.
In another instance, the Cyberabad police seized Rs.8.32 crore at Palamakula near Shamshabad from two persons believed to be agents of ‘hawala’ operators.
The police top brass maintained the possibility of politicians securing this to influence the ongoing elections cannot be ruled out.
Though crores of rupees were seized during police inspections at different places in the city, these cases attracted the attention of the public as prima facie evidence was found against politicians in the first two cases. Police suspect the role of politicians in the third case too.
Investigators invoked provisions of the Representation of People’s Act and the Indian Penal Code related to the bribing of voters, but connecting the accused with the alleged crime is the crucial task.
On the day of polling too, police slapped charges against some contestants on cases that include slapping the activist of a rival party, obstructing a police officer on duty from discharging their duty, and threatening polling agents.
How many of these cases will be taken to their logical end is to be seen.

Taking diversion could prove dangerous

Regular weekend checks by traffic police have come to deter people from drink-driving. Fines and jail terms for those who test positive during a breathalyser test, are making people stay away from the wheel after a drink. This has also controlled rash driving on the city’s roads and resulted in less number of accidents.
However, many drivers are now familiar with the timings and points where the traffic police look out for drink-drivers. Some have also been giving police the slip by finding newer routes.
“The main roads are not the only routes where accidents take place. Deaths from road accidents on internal roads of residential colonies and other areas are also high,” say voices from the public.
Surprise checks with breathalysers would surely rein in those drink-drivers running riot on the city’s internal roads or distant localities, they say. Proposals to intensify checks involving local law and order police were also mooted.
For some inexplicable reasons, the idea was shelved. Of the over 1,600 persons getting killed in road accidents in and around city, some are reported on routes where the traffic police had never conducted the weekend special drives.
Change in the timings and routes of the drivers would surely help in further controlling the accidents and saving lives, say many.

Thinking outside the frame
","A cheery painting here, a sculpture in a corner, an installation art there, a mural at the entrance… This is how new-age conference halls, boardrooms, executive lounges, office lobbies and college corridors look like. These areas once meant stiff leather chairs, notice boards and a staid painting or two that merged with the wall. Now, these are the new spaces for art. And, heralding this aesthetic change are executives with an artistic bent of mind, and those who believe art is a soothing, enriching experience.
Visitors to the expansive lobby of Le Meridien, part of the Starwood Hotels & Resorts network, are greeted by two large multi-media murals, created by Santhanam, a local artist. It showcases local agricultural traditions and serves as an introduction to Kongu culture. Inside, the rooms abound with decals bearing motifs of cotton, the staple crop which gives Coimbatore the moniker of Manchester of South India.
The art work, says P. Ramachandran, hotel manager, is in keeping with Starwood’s policy of recognising and showcasing local art. They also have plans to provide some space to local artists to sell their creations.
Industrialist Ravi Sam’s office in Sowripalayam is a gallery of sorts with elegant sculptures, water bodies, vibrant cushions and lots of wall art. Art, he says, frees up the mind and calms him down.
His staff loves the workspace too. “They are very proud of their workspace, and often, I notice them showing people around, and explaining the aesthetics,” he says.
Shankar Vanavarayar’s love for art, photography and artefacts is evident in his workspace. Once his collection crossed a certain number, he decided the art was not going to be just for his eyes; it would embellish public spaces. Some of the works hang in family-run enterprises, besides Kumaraguru College of Technology, of which Shankar is joint correspondent.
The visitors’ lobby, conference halls, and even some corridors in the college boast works by local artists. An entire wall has been dedicated to the works of renowned wildlife photographer T.N.A. Perumal. “Students love this display of art, and they seek to replicate it in their homes,” says Shankar. It makes art more accessible, and triggers curiosity, he adds.

Local touch

Pricol is another corporate where the walls have been home to art works for more than two decades now. A mixture of abstract, realistic and contemporary art has been showcased in the passages, offices and even factory. Most of these have been created by artists in Coimbatore and Chennai. Vanitha Mohan, vice-president, says it breaks the monotony and serious look of an office and lends it colour and life.
People have always invested in art in a private capacity, but why do they bring it in the public domain? After you acquire a certain quantum of paintings, you just feel the need to share their beauty with the world. How long can you look at something yourself, asks a collector.
So, they circulate the works, and shuffle them around the office space. This way, every work gets displayed, and it also lends a new, dynamic look.
Ravi Sam started collecting art when he was just out of college. “Initially, I was more into traditional art such as bronzes and Tanjore paintings. There was very little focus on contemporary art,” he says. Today, some of his collections are in storage; the rest are sprinkled around his work space. “For office, I choose something that can be easily understood by all. So, I opt for near-realistic paintings,” he says.
Shankar started displaying his art collection about five years ago. He says two reasons act as a trigger for wanting to take art outside personal spaces — when you have a sense of satisfaction in sharing your collection, and when you want to promote a local artist.
This is why he visits and purchases at exhibitions held at Kasthuri Sreenivasan Trust (KST) featuring student artists, especially those from the Government College of Fine Arts Chennai, and Kumbakonam.
Coimbatore has two main galleries — the 25-year-old KST and the more recent Contemplate Art Gallery, started by Rajshree Pathy, besides some new entrants. D Sarath Chandran, managing trustee, KST, works out an office where a painting of five horses takes over a wall. At the KST gallery, the focus, he says, is on regular buyers who value the ‘visual’ impact and don’t really buy art as investment.

Unique statement

In some spaces, art is bought en mass to suit the décor; it does not make an individual style statement. Shankar says art must not be there for effect. “It must not be an impersonal effort. In many ways, art affects your mood and your mood affects what you display. I do not believe in stacking a lot of stuff on the walls, just for effect. They must have a purpose. They must inspire, and educate.”

Choosing art for public spaces

hang works that will strike a chord with people
Realistic works draw attention
Avoid disturbing images; choose paintings that spread cheer
Keep rotating works; it keeps interest alive

Madras labour and May Day
","A rather confused reader, L.A. Rajendra sent me a letter shortly before May Day wondering who really had started the first trade union in Madras. He’d heard of at least four claimants to that honour and was thoroughly confused by not only these claims but also by the different stories circulating about those beginnings.
In fact, I’ve heard six names mentioned, Annie Besant and Ramanujalu Naidu were the additions to Rajendra’s four: M. Singaravelar Chetty, B.P. Wadia, G. Selvapathy Chetty and Thiru Vi Kalyanasundaram Mudaliar. But as far as I can gather, the story goes like this.
Selvapathy Chetty, a small businessman, took over a sabha his father was running and moved it to D’Mellow’s Road, Perambur, alongside the Buckingham & Carnatic Mills campus, where it was converted into a club of sorts. Moving on from religious discourses and bhajan singing that the sabha had originally offered, it began offering lectures by eminent personalities on a variety of current topics. Then, during the Great War, there were daily discussions on the progress of the war and what it all meant to India. A large number in the audience were mill workers and, before and after meetings, they would pour out tales of woe about the happenings in the mills to Selvapathy Chetty and his friend and fellow trader Ramanujalu Naidu. The two helped many of the workers to write petitions to the management, but, gradually, as they got more involved with the problems of the workers, they began to feel that something formal needed to be organised to negotiate with the mills’ management for the amelioration of the harsh working conditions.
On March 2, 1918, the two organised a public meeting near the mills where several speakers addressed a 10,000-strong audience, mainly of mill workers. Philosophical and religious themes, as advertised, were the subjects of all the speakers bar one, whose topic had only been whispered about. Thiru Vi Kalyanasundaram (ThiruViKa) forcefully urged them to form a trade union; that would be the only way they would get fair treatment, he had argued.
Selvapathy and Ramanujalu next went to meet Annie Besant of New India and invited her to address a meeting where the union would be inaugurated. She was unavailable but B.P. Wadia, her colleague, was. With Wadia presiding, a mammoth meeting was held on April 27, 1918 in Perambur at which the formation of the Madras Labour Union (MLU) was announced. Wadia was its first President, Selvapathy and Ramanujalu its first General Secretaries and ThiruViKa, Sella Guruswamy Chettiar and Dewan Bahadur Kesavapillai it first Vice Presidents. The Union survives to this day.
It has been claimed that this was the first trade union in India. This claim is perhaps in the context that it is still in existence, its name unchanged, and was formed as an organisation in rather formal circumstances. A year earlier, a union had been formed by mill workers in Ahmadabad, but from reports I’ve heard, it did not survive for long nor did it have a formal structure.
As far as the MLU is concerned, if I had to pick a founder, I would choose Selvapathy and Ramanujalu as its joint founders, though from what I’ve heard the latter would have most likely given the honour to the former.
Singaravelar was undoubtedly a fellow-traveller with this group when it came to trade unionism, but he was more a political figure. He was associated with the Congress Party, but broke with it over differences with Gandhiji, and, on May 1, 1923, at what was then the High Court Beach and Triplicane Beach, he announced the formation of his Labour Kisan Party of Hindustan and wanted May 1st declared a holiday. And, so, May Day, International Workers’ Day, came to India thanks to Singaravelar. He next helped form the Communist Party of India (CPI) over whose founding he presided in 1925. Then he broke with the Communists and became associated with the Self-Respect Movement and its overtones of Dravidian politics.
But thereafter, with age catching up, he gradually faded from the political scene, though maintaining an interest in all the causes he had espoused.

An architect’s story

My quest for information about J.R. Davis of Prynne, Abbott and Davis (Miscellany, April 21) brought me much information from P.T. Krishnan, who had a latter day connection with a successor firm, and a rather rude phone call from a reader who refused to send me his information in writing, which is the only way I like it as I am averse to long telephone calls that necessitate taking notes I’m hard put to later decipher.
From what Krishnan and I have been able to piece together, it would seem Prynne, Abbott and Davis (PAD) had its beginnings in one of the first firm of architects in Madras, Jackson and Barker, who set up practice around 1922. They were responsible for converting the Spencer’s-owned Connemara Hotel’s building, that at the time resembled something better suited to a forest lodge, into a then modern hotel building that reflected a classical art deco style. The remodelled Connemara opened in 1937 to rave reviews. Today’s façade and much of the main block are what Jackson and Barker bequeathed to the Connemara.
Shortly before World War II, H.F. Prynne took over Jackson and Barker when the partners were planning to return to the U.K. Prynne, curiously, was no architect; he was the Governor’s ADC. And his first architectural work, so to speak, was to convert the stables of his house on College Road into his firm’s offices. He was joined by Abbott and Davis. It is stated that Abbott never took his place with the firm, passing away during his journey to India. When Prynne went back to England in the early 1950s, Davis stayed on and ran the firm till the 1960s, when Kiffin-Petersen and Bennett Pithavadian (whose father changed his name from Fenn to Pithavadian), who had worked for the firm, took it over. Amongst the best buildings PAD designed were the University of Madras’s Library and Teaching (Clock Tower) Block and the Centenary Building, both raised in harmony with Senate House. If Abbott never made it to Madras, the bespectacled person explaining the Centenary Building’s model to Prime Minister Nehru in my 1957 picture today must have been Davis, though the University has named him as Abbott in a caption it has used. Davis was also responsible for the Bombay Mutual Building and Dare House on N.S.C. Bose Road.
Another noteworthy building the firm did design was Adyar Villa in Kotturpuram, the assignment for his home being given to it by M.A. Chidambaram, who was a good friend of Davis. The design, however, was by Kiffin-Petersen, an Australian, who favoured the Spanish villa style that Florida’s Palm Beach had made famous in the 1930s. Many of the corporate houses in the Boat Club area too were designed by him. Davis returned to England in the early 1960s before construction of Adyar Villa started and the building was raised during the Petersen-Pithavadian partnership that succeeded Davis.
When Kiffin-Petersen left Madras in the late 1960s, Prynne, Abbott and Davis was taken over by Pithavadian who ran it as a proprietorship. Then, in 1972, he took in partners and renamed the firm Pithavadian & Partners. Of Pithavadian Krishnan, who had worked with him, says, “A McGill University, Canada, graduate, he was a modernist more concerned with the problems of a poor country and used his civil engineering skills to produce functional and economical buildings. He won the President’s Gold Medal for the design of a low-cost house during the early years of his practice.” Later, however, he was responsible for another type of landmark in Madras, the IOB Building, “the first highrise in Madras responding to principles of designing for the tropics.”
I’d be glad to hear from my caller who prefers telephone-chat to writing if he has anything more to add to this — provided he sends it in duly written.

When the postman knocked…

- A copy of Ravenshaw’s 1822 map of Madras is with P.T. Krishnan and, he tells me, the five boundary pillars of the second esplanade, the one beyond the New Town Wall (Miscellany, April 14), are marked on it. Only, the present site of the Washermenpet Police Station is nowhere near where the boundary marker is shown on that map. The plaque had obviously been moved, as I had conjectured. Krishnan also tells me that the boundary markers also indicate on the map the boundaries of Royapuram, Tondiavoodu (Tondiarpet) and Washermenpet. Three paths led out of gates in the Wall and crossed the esplanade. These paths became, from west to east, Tiruvottriyur High Road, Monegar Choultry Road, and Mannarsamy Koil Street. Their gates, I reckon, would have respectively been what were called Ennore Gate, Trivatore Gate and Pully Gate. I look forward to more details of this area from Krishnan.
- Dr. R.V. Rajan (Miscellany, April 21), writes Dr. P.S. Venkateswaran, had studied to become a surgeon and went to England where he got his FRCS, but got interested in Venereology and became an internationally recognised expert on the subject. Dr. K.S. Sanjivi, who was part of Dr. RVR’s intellectual circle, retired as Professor of Medicine and was awarded the Padma Bhushan. But in what must be a unique record, Dr. Sanjivi’s brothers, Prof. K. Swaminathan and Dr. K. Venkat Raman, were also awarded the same honour. Swaminathan, Professor of English at Presidency College, turned to journalism after he retired and then became the Chief Editor of the 90-volume Collected Works of Mahatma Gandhi. Dr. Venkat Raman retired as the Director of the National Chemical Laboratory. As for Dr. RVR, as already mentioned, he went on to become the first Indian Dean of the Madras Medical College, but, points out Dr. Venkateswaran, it was a designation that came into being after the term ‘Superintendent’ had been done away with. Two Indians had served as Superintendents, Col. Pandalai and Dr. Sangam Lal. Dr. Rajam lived on G.N. Chetty Road in a house that has now given way to Ankur Plaza. As was the vogue those days, it was “a sort of semi-circular house (art deco?) with many doors. Dr. Rangachary’s house had 16 doors; Dr. Rajam had fewer.”

High-end jewellery on display
","A set of high-value designer jewellery made of cut emeralds from Zambia and rubies from Mozambique, which will be auctioned to raise funds for the education of the girl child, are on display at Tibarumals Jewellers in Basheerbagh between May 2 and 4.
The series of ornaments will go under the hammer on June 6 in Mumbai by Christie’s auction house. Its proceeds will go to ‘Nanhi Kali’, an NGO dedicated to work in the field of education to the girl child.
“This is a noble cause because young girls in villages in the State and elsewhere need a lot of support. Girls need tuition support, material support like stationary and social support, which we are providing through our work. This project will be of great help in funding more girls to continue their studies in schools,” said Dr. Preetha Bhakta, Head, Education Research and Learning Initiatives, Naandi Foundation.
Interacting with press persons, officials from Tibarumals Jewellers said the international gemstone company Gemfields was also associated with the auction.
“We have titled the project as ‘Project Blossoming’ and already have pledged a minimum of Rs.50 lakh to Nanhi Kali from the auction,” they said.

Myriad shades of reality
","An easy chair sits pretty in a corner near the entrance. The chair takes a step backward to narrate its story of lost souls. Artist Diptej Vernekar looks on as the spotlight falls on the chair and one sees a newspaper clipping which blends to form an empty tea cup. As the cup gets filled with tea, in appears a cocktail glass filled ice cubes. “The lost chair in a way talks about our culture in a fix – not able to forget the past yet not adopting modernity,” states young artist Diptej, who has been selected for Khoj International Artists’ Association, Delhi. His work is part of an exhibition titled ‘The Flight – Up, Up & Away’ put together by outgoing students of the department of fine arts, Sarojini Naidu School of Arts and Communication, University of Hyderabad. Diptej who hails from Goa has brought out the cocktail quality of his native place. “This 25-year-old chair made by my father was lying in my uncle’s backyard. This is like a rebirth to the chair,” he says.
As the budding artists of the university get ready to move out and spread their wings, they have created works as diverse and distinct as their sensibilities. The foyer looks like a mini-India with youngsters from Uttarakhand, Gujarat, Assam, West Bengal, Odisha, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, Karnataka, Goa, Chandigarh and Chhattisgarh. The interesting part is the way these young artists have also integrated mixed media, motor induced mechanisms, performance and sound and video projections to enhance the visual experience for the onlooker.
Monika Bijlani, a freelance artist from Bhopal speaks through her abstract work. “I try to seek perfection through my lines. The pressure of being a single parent comes out; the roughly done edges speak about the need for perfection,” she says. Afza Tamkanat asserts her identity as an artist and shuns away negativity through the earthen pots. On the walls are her water colour works with tea wash. “The earthen pots is a reaction to the feedback I got to my works,” she laughs. All her childhood memories of growing up with pets and surroundings and her artist father are reflected in the work.
Also standing majestically on a rhino is God of Shunya by artist Sujeesh Oncherry. “When I came from Calicut to Hyderabad, I found emptiness in this new place. Slowly the emptiness faded away. Rhino looks a powerful animal but is not. I wanted to depict the emptiness and in India, one is never short of gods,” he smiles. At Kartar Singh’s zone, there are ‘brains’ and Gandhi topis made of plaster of paris strewn around. “One intends to take something positive from every source but gets different kinds of information – positive and negative — from various sources. Everyone says they are aam aadmi but when they see power, they worship it,” says the artist from Chattisgarh.
Atindra showcases his life with family and friends on a canvas titled ‘I’. The Pictures have been interestingly pasted with benzene on mirror pieces cut as squares. “I have my school and college friends, my family members and others too here. I have left one square empty for people to walk in and be a part of my life,” he says.
Monica sums up the exhibition as an amalgamation of different thoughts and influences. “This shows how much professionalism we have acquired and our desire to work towards it.”
The exhibition by these 34 young artists is on till May 4 between 10 a.m. to 8 p.m.

Where brooms attract grooms
","There is a relation between brooms and grooms in this tiny village which is 25 kms from Rajahmundry city in East Godavari district. Brides here have a great demand so much so that grooms are willing even to pay kanyasulkam (a practice where the groom pays dowry to the bride) for a bride from Palla Kadiyam village.
It is a semi-rich village in Rajanagaram mandal which became famous for making broomsticks, an activity that became a cottage industry, providing livelihood to over 1,000 families.
A great source of self-employment, parents in the village don’t worry about their daughters’ marriage. “Girls after attaining marriageable age have wannabe grooms queuing up because it takes care of their employment, making brooms here in the village,” says Chintapalli Arjunudu.
According to Ch. Sahadevudu, the raw material to make broomsticks comes in gunny bags from Assam and Maredumilli in Rampachodavaram Agency area in the district. “A 50-kg-bag of dry grass used in the broom costs Rs. 2,000. After wastage, we get only 40 kg,” he says, explaining that soft grass is cleaned up before it is assembled into a broom.
A handle is made for a comfortable grip and buyers have a wide range of varieties to choose from.
Most villagers secure additional raw material like plastic pipes, coconut sticks and wire from places like Vijayawada.
Every household generates between 250 and 400 brooms every day which is then weighed, says Arjunudu. “Each bag of grass is used to make 150 to 200 brooms of four different varieties and the price ranges from Rs. 30 to Rs. 60,” he informs.
Citing financial constraints, Mr. Arjunudu says banks should come forward to give loans and the government must look into the issue.
The agent who helps the villagers secure raw material, also assists them in sale of their product. Some villagers go as far as Rayalaseema and Srikakulam areas to bring in grass or plastic pipes.

One critically injured in Chidambaram blast
","Despite Tamil Nadu coming under a security blanket after the May 1 twin blasts on a train in Chennai, a bomb blast rocked Cuddalore district on Saturday. A 34-year-old person was badly injured while he was allegedly making bombs in a house near Annamalai University at Chidambaram. The police are on the look-out for five of his associates, said to be at large.
The incident has raised safety concerns among people in this constituency reserved for Dalits, with barely two weeks to go for counting of votes polled in the recent Lok Sabha polls. Post-poll, minor incidents of caste clashes occurred in the district.
Only on Tuesday last did the ‘Q’ Branch CID of the Tamil Nadu Police arrest 37-year old Zakir Hussain, a Sri Lankan national suspected to be an agent of an ISI operative, in Chennai, and seize photographs of vital installations and counterfeit currency from him.
While the twin blasts on the Bangalore-Guwahati Express on Thursday eerily brought the shadow of terror to Chennai’s doorstep, the same day the Anti-Terrorist Squad of the Rajasthan Police and the Tamil Nadu Police arrested Asraf Ali, an Indian Mujahideen operative, at Porto Novo near Chidambaram.
Saturday’s blast occurred in a house at Annamalai Nagar, Chidambaram, which was rented out by a retired professor to Arul, one of the university staff. On hearing a loud sound around 11 a.m., the neighbours alerted the police. The blast shattered the window panes of the house, and blood was found splattered across its floor.
Even as the police and Fire Service personnel rushed to the spot, five inmates of the house took the injured in an auto to hospital. Thereafter, they disappeared. The police now do not see any conspiracy, but initial investigation revealed that the injured was a rowdy element and allegedly involved in several murders in Dindigul and Theni districts.
Speaking to 
The Hindu, SP A. Radhika said: “It was a country-bomb blast of low intensity. The injured is identified as Mohanram from Dindigul, and he was allegedly involved in murder cases in Dindigul and Theni districts. The investigation is on.”
Mohanram was allegedly involved in 13 criminal cases, and he was manufacturing country-bombs in his friend’s place. He is believed to have lost both his eyes in the blast.

We are all going on a summer holiday
","Words of a song…but just the thought of a holiday is fun. When it rains, schools get rain holidays. As for people dying, surely the holiday may be to honour him but do you really think people actually mourn at home?
Weekends are holidays; the trouble starts because all week long you pine for the weekend. Holidays are only fun because there are other days in between when you work hard, you work long, you may not work smart but you work!
Think of the British who came and ruled us — they pined to go back “home” to England BUT especially before the days of fast jetting around that was out of the question. Every few years maybe one could go back or else people would have journeyed and holidayed more than they were able to work!
So instead they made chota Englands whereever they could: and how ingeniously they did it. First was the climate, it had to be cool for God’s sake to resemble ‘home’ and then it had to have hills and vales and when they could not find any such place they actually created them . And at what cost, to themselves and everyone else! You have to hand it over to them, creating small English village type of homes, calling them ever so Englishy names like Dingle Dell and Gables, and what have you! The roads or lanes were called after the biggest house on the road like Havelock Lane and Havelock House.
The staff who had never even learnt to read or write made English soups and Yorkshire puddings and were horrified to make a rasam as they knew only Mulligatawny soup which literally means Pepper water. I wonder if they would have been as enamoured if the skins of the masters and mistresses and the little babas were NOT white? Just a thought.
But the end result is that we have these little old English Hill Stations dotted around the country side where we can all feel we have gone abroad or something: The trick is not to nip in and out but stay for a reasonable amount of time and get acclimatized, get into a way of life as it were. When people ask, “What? going away for weeks, what will you do there?” you answer the same thing you do back at home in your own corner of the hot plains.
First you have got away from the hot weather, you can breathe easier, you can play golf or tennis or what ever you do, except swim, I suppose. I mean nobody ever asks you, “Good Lord you stay in the same place for years? What do you do?” Reminds me of a thrice married young lady who was in the midst of much married couple who was celebrating its 40th anniversary or so; not to be put out, she asked, “Aren’t you people bored with each other?”

Lax security at City railway station a cause of concern
","Even though security has been tightened at the Bangalore City Railway Station in the wake of the twin blasts onboard the Bangalore-Guwahati Express on Thursday, much of the security apparatus at the railway station remains defunct.
All the three door-frame metal detectors at the entrance of the railway station are not functioning. The Railway Protection Force (RPF) personnel posted at the entrance have been given hand-held metal detectors to scan passengers and luggage. A senior official pointed out that the railway station is not equipped with baggage and vehicle scanners.
The hand-held metal detectors beeps at almost everyone passing by with a key bunch, said a security personnel, adding that “It is impossible for us to physically scan everybody especially during peak hours.”
Besides, of the 100 CCTV cameras installed under the Integrated Security System, only 40 are operational and the rest are yet to be connected to the control room.
So lax is the security at the railway station that a few months ago, the information display monitors were stolen. Though the CCTV camera footage showed a man stealing the display units, he could not be identified due to bad quality of images, according to a senior police officer.
Now, post-Chennai blast on the Bangalore-Guwahati Express train, at least 15 unauthorised entry points to the City Railway Station is a cause of concern. A senior officer of the Government Railway Police (GRP) said it is impossible to provide foolproof security to the Bangalore City Railway Station spread across a radius 2.5 kilometres with over 20 entry and exit points.
Apart from the two authorised main entrance and exit gates, people can walk into the station from various points that are unguarded. “Providing security cover at these points is impossible unless the Railway authorities put up at least a 10 ft. compound wall with barbed wire to prevent unauthorised entry,” he said.
Senior Divisional Security Commissioner, Railway Protection Force (RPF), S. Louis Amuthan said that there was staff shortage, and that they are managing the show by cancelling leaves granted to personnel and seeking reinforcement during emergencies.
The GRP and RPF have been complaining of staff shortage. “There are 10 platforms in the City Railway Station and even if one constable is deputed on each platform, we may need at least 20 personnel for the round-the-clock security,” the official said.
The 20-member GRP staff is not only expected to provide security at the entry and exit points, but also provide security on moving trains. A senior police officer of the GRP said 60 per cent of the posts in the department are vacant and that they have written to the authorities about it.

The Queen of May
","As we enter the month of May, with roses blooming all over and May Queen contests being planned in hotels, restaurants, clubs and residential colonies, one’s thoughts go back to the 1890s which saw Delhi’s first May Queen being selected. This is as per hear-say. Some however claim that the first such event did not take place during the viceroyalty of Lord Curzon but when Lord Lytton as Governor-General came here in 1877.
Going by what Norah Nicholson used to say till her death as a nonagenarian many years ago, the first May Ball was held at Ludlow Castle, where the European Club had been moved from the Town Hall because of a plague epidemic scare in 1898. She had, as a young girl, heard from her grannies that the function saw the crowning of Miss Ball as May Queen. Could have been a memory lapse for the contest winner’s father (Ball Sahib) was a noted magistrate at Agra in early 20th Century and later migrated to South Africa where he set up a lucrative legal practice. His daughter (living in the house on the hill) became May Queen in the city of the Taj in the 1920s, long after the famous contest was held at the Savoy in Mussoorie. According to the late Mrs Roberts, born in 1880, the name of the dimpled girl who won the title in Delhi was Heather Jones, and when she was crowned her admirers went wild with joy, while her rival Charmain Miller’s supporters gulped down their disappointment with large pegs of whisky on a night which was unexpectedly cool for that part of the year because of a strong breeze blowing from the Ridge.
Among those present were the Houghtons, Campbells, a visiting writer, Miss Saunders, Mr Maidens, who founded Maidens Hotel, a number of CMS clergymen and a Catholic priest of St Mary’s Church. This reverend Father impressed on the gathering that the first-ever May Queen was the Virgin Mary, to whom the month of May is devoted. Present also were the proprietors of London Stores, Spencer’s and Carlton’s from Kashmere Gate. Some Punjabi Muslim shoe merchants (who came to Delhi during the time of Shah Alam) and the Khatri businessmen, who settled down during the reign of Shah Jahan, also managed to enter Ludlow Castle hall. It’s worth mentioning that the Qaum Punjabian’s main face at that time was the Hanafi Siddiqui, whose family was more interested in setting up printing presses, madrasas and building mosques. The Khatris were headed by Lala Chunna Mal who, along with other elite, both Muslim and Hindu, used to “take the air” in the spacious Kashmere Gate area, then the lungs of the city. The most boisterous were the Tommies from the Red Fort and Daryaganj. They had come in their one-horse carriages, sounding trumpets, blowing whistles and raising hurrahs before parking their Ticca gharries at the hackney carriage stand on Ludlow Castle Road, which continued to exist till the early 1970s.
If one were to go by the treatise, “Delhi between Two Empires”, that was the time when many of the Mirzas and Mirs had come down a step or two from their high pedestal to become school teachers and clerks because of income constraints. Better off than them were the karkhandars or owners of small factories. One wonders how many of these neo-rich managed to be at the club which had presumably relaxed its rules for the much-touted May Queen show. According to historian Naryani Gupta, the Civil Lines had ceased to be the main residential area for the Europeans by then and “second-class Europeans” had begun to settle down north of Qudsia Garden and Nicholson Park. They were mostly Telegraph and Railway employees, like the ones depicted in the film “Julie”, in which Om Prakash plays the role of a bottle-happy Anglo-Indian dad. To select the May Queen may not have been the railwaymen’s prerogative but their presence at the renamed Delhi Club could not be overlooked as Heather’s father was a senior railway engine driver. Charmain Miller, first runner-up “and taller by far, burst into tears, burying her sweet face in her delicate hands as her boyfriend tried to comfort her with umpteen kisses,” recalled Mrs Roberts in the 1960s. The May Queen contests now are more lavish and popular but somehow one always thinks that the cultural pastures were greener when the Civil Lines was the centre of fashion, with hotels like Lauries, Cecil, Suisse and Maidens vying with each other. Railwaymen did not usually frequent them but still they formed an influential community since New Year’s Eve 1867, when the first train arrived in Delhi and its whistle was heard in the Walled City.

Classically, Zubin
","‘Political Views Test the Harmony’, punned the New York Times’ headline in a  recent Arts-section lead story that ran — with the subhead ‘Conductor of Israel Philharmonic (Orchestra) Speaks His Mind on the Middle East’ — over a frowning photo of a pained-looking Zubin Mehta, eyes closed, baton raised. At 77, Mumbai-born, Vienna-trained Mehta leads the orchestra that is Israel’s premier cultural ambassador.
Hosted by the American Friends of Israel to play at Manhattan’s Carnegie Hall, Mehta gave a lengthy interview to the NYT in which he said, “I speak openly about a country that I see, from my private musician’s perspective, as going in the wrong direction (with) the settlements… They know I’m a friend and being in a democracy, I express my opinions freely.” Courageous words uttered publicly in a city whose powerful Zionist lobby rules its impressive cultural and intellectual worlds; tolerated because Mehta has proven his solidarity with Israel repeatedly. During the Gulf War, he played through the fall of Scud missiles while the audience donned gas masks — and stayed to listen. He played when Hezbollah’s rockets fell and, another time, rescheduled concerts so audiences could get home before the curfew.
The maestro’s association with the IPO harks back to when he was invited, at 25, to substitute for an indisposed conductor. He had never heard of the orchestra founded 25 years earlier, as the ‘Palestine Orchestra’, for talented Jewish musicians who were banned from performing in pre-Nazi Europe. At its inaugural concert in 1936, the legendary Arturo Toscanini, then the highest-paid conductor in the U.S. and a staunchly anti-fascist non-Jew, had volunteered to conduct the opera gratis. Later, the IPO named Mehta its Music Director and, in 1981, Music Director for Life. “That title’s just a handshake, there’s no contract,” Mehta explains. “I’ll stay as long as the players want me.”
Not just the players but all of Israel seems to want Mehta, an unlikely national hero as a Parsi who, despite a cosmopolitan life spent abroad, remains Indian at heart. (Moved, for instance, by hearing of Raj Kapoor’s death before a Moscow concert, Mehta shared the news with the audience and dedicated his performance to the Russians’ beloved superstar.)
As conductor of the redoubtable New York Philharmonic from 1978-1991, Mehta became a celebrity, lionised by the media, darling of socialites. Sexy and glamorous, ‘Zuby baby’ came from the Los Angeles Philharmonic to head the world’s best, most difficult orchestra. He had occasional problems with players and critics though never with audiences who idolised his musicality as much as his dashing stage presence. (Still handsome, Mehta has aged gracefully to embody dignity onstage.) He mentored and promoted young players, took his elite orchestra to Harlem, commissioned Ravi Shankar to compose a sitar concerto that they performed together at the Philharmonic where, on Saturday mornings, he introduced children to classical music. At one such ‘Young People’s Concerts’, he handed over his baton to a 12-year-old to conduct in his place! Visiting Parsis, attending Mehta’s morning rehearsals, would go backstage to be heartily welcomed by “
aapro (our own) Zubin” with jolly conversation and gifts of CDs.
When he declined to renew his contract after 13 years, everyone was disappointed. He left Manhattan’s rat race because “spiritually, it’s necessary to have time to study, to rethink.” He wanted to do “more opera, more touring, things out of my routine.” And he did that: He gained popularity with a universal TV audience by conducting the ‘Three Tenors’; now he heads the opera in Florence, Italy, and tours worldwide. Each year, he spent three months with the IPO. “Israel and its people remind me of India; people are always talking, arguing, laughing,” he observes. “The orchestra — the country itself — is like a warm close-knit family. It’s one of my spiritual homes; I’ve grown up with them, I’ve been there since 1961.”
Musically, too, he’s had serious disagreements with Israeli society: his passion for 19 century German composer Richard Wagner is not reciprocated. As Hitler’s favourite, Wagner is loathed in Israel where survivors still bear Auschwitz’s tattoos. “He was 110 per cent anti-Semitic,” Mehta concedes. “But, he’s half my world.” When the IPO played Wagner for an encore at a 1981 concert, Israelis booed and walked out. Mehta has not dared revisit Wagner, an opera lover’s dream. Still, “the relationship with my favourite orchestra is a lasting marriage” based on a shared devotion to music. When Mehta was honoured by Washington’s Kennedy Center, the IPO flew in from Israel to serenade him! On his — and the IPO’s — 70 birthday, they surprised him by playing “Happy Birthday” at their Carnegie Hall gala.
For years, Mehta has made music education a priority. In Mumbai, he honoured his musician-father by establishing the Mehli Mehta Foundation, which trains 300 children in Western classical music. In Tel Aviv, the Buchmann-Mehta School of Music trains Israeli musicians, while his ‘Mifneh’ programme caters to 250 young Arabs in the West Bank that he often visits. “With my Indian passport, I have no problem. The Indian ambassador in Ramallah sends his car.” Mehta’s dream is to find an Israeli-Arab to play in the IPO. “May be,” he muses, “music will help us come together.”

Suspected IM operative taken to Rajasthan
","Ashraf Ali, a suspected Indian Mujahideen operative who was nabbed on Thursday from his hideout near a mosque at Port Novo in Cuddalore district, has been taken to Rajasthan for further investigation.
According to police sources, his involvement has been ruled out in the twin blasts that rocked Chennai Central on Thursday.
The police version is that Ali had sneaked into the State in the guise of a volunteer of the Hazrat Nizamuddin Dargah in Delhi to offer religious lectures in different States. He had adopted this modus operandi to avoid suspicion.
The Rajasthan Anti-Terror Squad zeroed in on his whereabouts in Port Novo on Thursday evening after a nationwide manhunt spanning several weeks.
The 40-year-old Ashraf Ali is the main suspect in the setting up and running of sleeper IM modules in Jodhpur. Ali, who belongs to Uttar Pradesh, was running a footwear shop in Jodhpur. The sleeper module in Rajasthan was busted by the Ant-Terror Squad and the Delhi Police Special Cell in March.
Following the arrest of two terror suspects in Jodhpur with explosives last March, Ali immediately left Jodhpur for Delhi by train, and from there he arrived in Chennai by train and was lodged there for a while.
The interrogation of the arrested terror suspects in Jodhpur led the police to clue in on the likely involvement of Ali.
Monitoring his mobile records, the Anti-Terror Squad traced him to Port Novo. ATS sleuths, with the assistance of the Cuddalore district police, accosted the suspect while he was loitering around a mosque at Port Novo.
The suspect was taken to the Thukkambakkam police station where he was grilled by the Tamil Nadu police who probed various angles, including whether he was involved in Thursday’s blast on the Bangalore-Guwahati Express.
After extensive inquiry, Ali was produced before Chief Judicial Magistrate Kingsley Christopher for remand.
While he was waiting in the court, he swooned. The police had to sprinkle water to bring him back to his senses and produce him before the magistrate. Passing an order on the plea for transit remand, the court directed the ATS to produce him in the local court in Jodhpur within five days.

Bharata’s magnanimity
","Even when we are clearly in the wrong, we do not accept blame for our conduct. We tend to blame someone else for our wrongdoing. But Bharata was an exception. Rama was sent to the forest by Dasaratha, upon Kaikeyi’s insistence.
Bharata had no hand in this. In fact, Bharata was not even in Ayodhya, when Rama’s banishment took place. It was only when he arrived in Ayodhya, did he come to know of what had happened. He was furious with Kaikeyi for what she had done. He did not want to rule the Kosala kingdom and went to the forest in search of Rama.
When he met Rama, he said that it was not Dasaratha or Kaikeyi who was to be blamed for what had happened, but he himself was the culprit. So here we have a man, who did no wrong, but blamed himself. Bharata’s magnanimity is a lesson for us all. To take the blame for what others have done is a rare quality, said Kidambi Narayanan, in a discourse.
Bharata wanted Rama to come back to Ayodhya and take charge of the kingdom. So he said to Rama that it was the tradition for the first son to become king, when the father died.
He also said that only a person whom the people liked should be made king, and the people of Kosala were unanimous in desiring Rama as their king. Moreover, Kaikeyi had sinned in getting Rama exiled, and Bharata did not want to accept kingship that came to him as a result of his mother’s sinful act.
Bharata tried every method possible to get Rama to agree to his request. But Rama stuck to His stand, and sent Bharata back to Ayodhya.

BMTC agrees to extend bus services till 1 a.m.
","Finding public transport late in the night may not be impossible anymore. Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC) has bowed to requests by citizens to extend services on select routes till 1 a.m.
BMTC Managing Director Anjum Parvez has directed the corporation’s traffic department to conduct a survey to shortlist the routes. “This exercise is to be completed in 10 days,” said Kumar Pushkar, Director, IT, BMTC. Recently, the corporation had arranged for 20 per cent of its fleet to operate till 11.30 pm.
The BMTC’s decision to extend services till 1 a.m. follows the submission of a petition by ‘change.org’. The online petition to extend services till at least midnight received more than 15,000 signatures.
The petition was initiated by city-based lawyer Shashank Kumar, who met Mr. Parvez earlier this week to submit the same. In addition to the online petition, a survey of 6,800 Bangaloreans conducted by change.org saw 98 per cent of the respondents seeking extension of services. The result of this survey was also handed over to the BMTC.
A release by change.org said Mr. Parvez had assured them that some buses would ply till 1 a.m. on select routes and these services would originate from either Kempegowda Bus Station (KBS) or Shivajinagar. It added that ‘these special buses would operate on a trial basis to see the extent of demand from the public. The MD said that the routes would be changed as per demand. More routes would be added depending on the response’.
Mr. Shashank Kumar is expected to meet the BMTC’s traffic and planning team on Saturday. “The agenda is to figure out the routes. The MD has told us that due to labour norms, the buses will operate from 5 p.m. to 1 a.m. We will also discuss whether to deploy the new 36-seater Midi buses or the regular ones,” he said.

I am no object, do you hear?
","Having had a fairly conservative upbringing in a Tam Brahm, artistically-inclined household – although we lived in the north and later, in cosmopolitan Bangalore – I am rather naive when it comes to picking up inappropriate behaviour. Oddly, my family discussed subjects such as sex and dating quite openly. My siblings and I, however, had no inclination to date or party.
After an all-girls school and college education, I went overseas to study and work. In the decade I spent there, I got accustomed to walking to my car in my swimwear after a swim. I wore western clothes quite comfortably and assumed that the freedom of personal space I enjoyed was a given everywhere. And then I settled in Chennai as the man I married lived here.
My social circle was exclusive and I was frankly tired of being cocooned again. After working for myself for a few years, I decided to find an employer. I liked my work and the routine that went with it. I found the conservative attitudes at my office, amusing though. My work wardrobe comprised only saris and salwars with dupattas for a purpose. I saw it as a way to blend in. In the first two years, I found that my friendliness and cordiality left the men confused. I would smile and wave at the watchman just as I would a colleague or the boss.
When I walked into the lunch room, I would find many roving pairs of eyes following me, checking me out openly in a way that made me question myself. I would furtively check if my kurta was torn or if my bra strap was showing. A lot of men would ping me about work on chat and I would reply efficiently and breezily thinking I was being professional.
The same guys wouldn’t look me in the eye if they passed me at lunch. One time, a senior colleague who always stopped by my workspace for a chat, said, “I don’t ever see you in a sari. Let me know when you wear one.” I mumbled a reply and ran to my cubicle. A few days later, he returned to ask me when I would be in a sari. “You can’t be serious!” was my indignant reply. And to this day, when I do wear a sari to work, I wonder if he thinks it’s for him.
Another senior colleague I respected and admired came crashing down from the pedestal when he pinged to say he wished to speak to me every evening at 8 p.m. and then asked for my number. I froze and changed my chat status to ‘busy’ and discreetly sought help from a couple of young male colleagues. There was a time when I relied on these two to escort me up to the door of the restroom – I was that nervous. I continue to be cordial to him and am relieved that the matter ended there.
Then there was this colleague who seemed to strike a seemingly harmless conversation about work on chat and then suddenly phrases such as “orgasmic delight” found their way into his typed messages. I was no prude but such familiarity assumed a certain comfort level which was absent.
And recently, during the lunch hour, a male colleague made an insolent remark about a young girl’s attire, “Look! She seems to have stepped out of the shower in a towel!”
It fairly summed up the weird mix of people I work with. I have come to realise that for many men, my friendliness and extroverted nature are a sign of “availability”. I am wiser now, I recognise the signs of inappropriateness more quickly but I refuse to change. And for every weirdo out there, I am thankful for the handful of great men in my office who look me in the eye and treat me like a person.

Little things in life
","It has become a routine to wake up, get ready for the day, go to work or class, come back home, eat and sleep. People have become robots. There is not enough leisure time. In fact, there is no time even for family and friends. We hardly acknowledge the presence of a child or parent at home. We simply want to lie down and rest.
Once in a blue moon, during a family function or inevitable occasion, we remember people. The meeting usually goes, “How long has it been?”, “Do you remember that time when…” We plan to get together every weekend after remembering the fun we’ve had in the past, of the “fun and happy memories” and “those were the days, man”. But we forget that we have gotten used to lives that are mostly about work, stress and exertion; that all we want during the weekend is to rest and recharge for next week.
By this I don’t mean that we should drop everything and live without any responsibilities. All I’m saying is that we shouldn’t miss the little things in life. Leave your work behind at the office and spend time with your child, talking about his/her day. Try talking to your parents about your day. Make it a point to go out with your friends occasionally, if not every weekend. What is the point of working so hard if you don’t have any memories to enjoy later in life?

Idukki water level enthuses KSEB
","Though summer rain has not made any impact on the water level in the Idukki reservoir, the storage level is far better when compared to last year.
The Kerala State Electricity Board (KSEB) is hopeful of the summer season passing without much hassle.
As per the estimate on Friday, the storage level in the Idukki dam is 36.7 per cent, which is considered a good sign of the summer season passing without much trouble. It has been attributed to the decision taken by the government against releasing water during the end of the last monsoon season, when the level reached the brim.
An official of the KSEB (Generation) at Moolamattom told The Hindu on Friday that power generation varied considerably and remained at a high level.
Though the generation level during the past 24 hours till Friday morning was 5.34 million units (mu), on the previous day it was 11.9 mu. “The low production level was owing to low demand, it being a holiday,” the official said.
The Idukki reservoir is a hydroelectric project reserved for meeting the summer demand when the consumption goes up. The water level continued to decline with summer rain having little impact on the reservoir capacity.
However, it is after a long time that the water level is at a considerably better position during the peak month of May. The reservoir area received a rainfall of 4.2 mm during the past 24 hours.
There is variation in the generation level as the demand fluctuates during the peak consumption period of summer.
An official at the Dam Monitoring and Research Wing, Cheruthoni, said the water level on Friday was 2,333.5 ft. The early arrival of southwest monsoon last year had been a favourable factor. The delayed summer this season also helped in keeping the water level at a high in the reservoir. The generation level each day was decided considering the demand factor.
The Idukki reservoir meets nearly 45 per cent of the total power consumption in the State.

A knee-jerk reaction?
","Each time there is a terror strike in the country, security agencies start taking steps to secure all possible establishments, especially railway stations and airports. However, all these are mere knee-jerk reactions at best. The hangover lasts barely a few days and soon it is back to “business as usual”.
As usual, the Delhi Police swung into action to make the railway stations secure after news of the blasts at a Chennai railway station on Thursday morning. In an attempt to make arrangements as fool-proof as possible, they even started video-recording in trains bound for long distances. With the idea to record suspicious elements and activities in trains, a constable was seen carrying a handycam to record the happenings inside the coaches. Another tagged along carrying a loud-speaker, announcing safety instructions to passengers.
The video-recording, according to the police, will serve a dual purpose. It will help detect suspicious activities on the spot as well as store the footage for future reference.
Another way to spot suspicious activity at Delhi railway stations involves police personnel dressed in civil clothes scanning the crowds with a pair of binoculars. The personnel scans the railway station with the binocular and informs the back-up team in case he spots suspicious activity.
In the past too the Capital has seen many such temporary security beef-ups at places where terror struck, but these measures were not lasting ones. For instance, after the 2011 Delhi High Court blast, the police claimed that the security had been upgraded at all court complexes. However, they arrested a gang planning to a murder an undertrial inside the Rohini court premises on Wednesday! One of the arrested men was caught while trying to enter the court in a lawyer’s attire. Interestingly, the arrest was made only because the police had prior knowledge about the murder attempt. Otherwise, lawyers are not frisked at entry points.
As for the latest security beef-up, how far and how long these measures work, only time will tell!

Filtering content on the internet
","On May 5, the Supreme Court will hear Kamlesh Vaswani’s infamous anti-pornography petition again. The petition makes some rather outrageous claims. Watching pornography ‘puts the country’s security in danger’ and it is ‘worse than Hitler, worse than AIDS, cancer or any other epidemic,’ it says. This petition has been pending before the Court since February 2013, and seeks a new law that will ensure that pornography is exhaustively curbed.
The petition assumes that pornography causes violence against women and children. The trouble with such a claim is that the debate disintegrates into binaries; the two positions being that pornography causes violence or that it does not. The fact remains that the causal link between violence against women and pornography is yet to be proven convincingly and remains the subject of much debate. Additionally, since the term pornography refers to a whole range of explicit content, including homosexual adult pornography, it cannot be argued that all pornography objectifies women or glamorises violent treatment of them.
Allowing even for the petitioner’s legitimate concern about violence against women, it is interesting to note that of all the remedies available, he seeks the one which is authoritarian but may not have any impact at all. Mr. Vaswani could have, instead, encouraged the state to do more toward its international obligations under the Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW). CEDAW’s General Recommendation No. 19 is about violence against women and recommends steps to be taken to reduce violence against women. These include encouraging research on the extent, causes and effects of violence, and adopting preventive measures, such as public information and education programmes, to change attitudes concerning the roles and status of men and women.
Although different countries disagree about the necessity of banning adult pornography, there is general international consensus about the need to remove child pornography from the Internet. Children may be harmed in the making of pornography, and would at the very minimum have their privacy violated to an unacceptable degree. Being minors, they are not in a position to consent to the act. Each act of circulation and viewing adds to the harmful nature of child pornography. Therefore, an argument can certainly be made for the comprehensive removal of this kind of content.
Indian policy makers have been alive to this issue. The Information Technology Act (IT Act) contains a separate provision for material depicting children explicitly or obscenely, stating that those who circulate such content will be penalised. The IT Act also criminalises watching child pornography (whereas watching regular pornography is not a crime in India).
Intermediaries are obligated to take down child pornography once they have been made aware that they are hosting it. Organisations or individuals can proactively identify and report child pornography online. Other countries have tried, with reasonable success, systems using hotlines, verification of reports and co-operation of internet service providers to take down child pornography. However, these systems have also sometimes resulted in the removal of other legitimate content.
Child pornography can be blocked or removed using the IT Act, which permits the government to send lists of URLs of illegal content to internet service providers, requiring them to remove this content. Even private parties can send notices to online intermediaries informing them of illegal content and thereby making them legally accountable for such content if they do not remove it. However, none of this will be able to ensure the disappearance of child pornography from the Internet in India.
Technological solutions like filtering software that screens or blocks access to online content, whether at the state, service provider or user level, can at best make child pornography inaccessible to most people. People who are more skilled than amateurs will be able to circumvent technological barriers since these are barriers only until better technology enables circumvention.
Additionally, attempts at technological filtering usually even affect speech that is not targeted by the filtering mechanism. Therefore, any system for filtering or blocking content from the Internet needs to build in safeguards to ensure that processes designed to remove child pornography do not end up being used to remove political speech or speeches that are constitutionally protected.
In the Vaswani case, the government has correctly explained to the Supreme Court that any greater attempt to monitor pornography is not technologically feasible. It has pointed out that human monitoring of content will delay transmission of data substantially, will slow down the Internet, and will also be ineffective, since the illegal content can easily be moved to other servers in other countries.
Making intermediaries liable for the content they host will undo the safe harbour protection granted to them by the IT Act. Without it, intermediaries like Facebook will actually have to monitor all the content they host, and the resources required for such monitoring will reduce the content that makes its way online. This would seriously impact the extensiveness and diversity of content available on the Internet in India. Additionally, when demands are made for the removal of legitimate content, profit-making internet companies will be disinclined to risk litigation much in the same way as Penguin was reluctant to defend Wendy Doniger’s book.
If the Supreme Court makes the mistake of creating a positive obligation to monitor Internet content for intermediaries, it will effectively kill the Internet in India.

Mum’s the word
","After the cultural extravaganza in my college, I was almost ready to face the forthcoming unit tests. I had to carry my ID card to write them. On my way to college, I realised that I had not kept my ID card in its regular spot in my bag. I panicked thinking it was in my other bag. Hoping against hope, I reached over to the normally empty side pocket. And lo! There lay my ID card. I knew my mother had kept it there. I had, as usual, thrown it on the table.
That evening, when I came home, I gave my mother a hug and thanked her. She just complained about my carelessness. But what is life without mothers complaining about our childish behaviour, right? This is my way of saying thanks to my mother for her love and tolerance towards my carelessness.

2G case: Court to commence recording of statements of accused
","A special CBI court in New Delhi is likely to commence on Monday the recording of statements of the accused, including former Telecom Minister A. Raja, in the 2G spectrum allocation scam.
Special CBI judge O.P. Saini, who had earlier supplied the draft questionnaire containing 1,718 questions running into 824 pages to the 17 accused, including Mr. Raja, DMK MP Kanimozhi and three top executives of Reliance Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group (RADAG), had fixed the matter for Monday.
The special court, constituted to deal exclusively with the 2G scam related cases, is also scheduled to start on Monday the recording of statements of the accused, including promoters of Essar Group and Loop Telecom, facing trial in a case arising out of the probe into the radiowave scam.
In the case involving the promoters of Essar Group and Loop Telecom, the court had given a questionnaire to the eight accused having 645 questions each and running into 308 pages.
CBI had filed charge sheet against them, alleging they had cheated the Department of Telecommunication (DoT) by using Loop Telecom as a “front” to secure 2G licences in 2008.
Essar Group promoters Ravi Ruia and Anshuman Ruia, Loop Telecom promoters Kiran Khaitan, her husband I.P. Khaitan and Essar Group Director (Strategy and Planning) Vikash Saraf are facing trial in the case along with three firms — Loop Telecom Ltd., Loop Mobile India Ltd. and Essar Tele Holding Ltd.
All of them have denied the charges levelled by CBI in the case, arising out of the probe into the 2G spectrum scam.
In the case involving Mr. Raja and 16 others, the court had on November 27 last year concluded recording of prosecution evidence after deposition of CBI’s Superintendent of Police Vivek Priyadarshi, the chief investigating officer, got over.
The court had recorded statements of 153 CBI witnesses, including Reliance ADAG chairman Anil Ambani, his wife Tina Ambani, former corporate lobbyist Niira Radia and Attorney General G.E. Vahanvati, running into over 4,400 pages.
Besides Mr. Raja and Ms. Kanimozhi, former Telecom Secretary Siddharth Behura, Mr. Raja’s erstwhile private secretary R.K. Chandolia, Swan Telecom promoters Shahid Usman Balwa and Vinod Goenka, Unitech Ltd. MD Sanjay Chandra, RADAG executives — Gautam Doshi, Surendra Pipara and Hari Nair — are facing trial in the case.

ATM robbery foiled, suspect flees
","In a daring attempt to rob an Automated Teller Machine (ATM), a young man used explosives to try to blow up the machine in Tiruporur, about 35 kilometres from the city, on Old Mamallapuram Road, past midnight on Saturday.
A police inspector attached to the Bomb Detection and Disposal Squad was injured while attempting to defuse an explosive left behind by the suspect. Kancheepuram district police sources said the suspect reached the ATM belonging to State Bank of Mysore, functioning from a private building, on a motorcycle, a little past 12.30 a.m.
Investigating policemen attached to the Tiruporur police station, who have picked up some clues, said the suspect, wearing denim jeans and a T-shirt, had masked his face with a plastic bag. He tied explosives around the cash vault and triggered it to explode. However, he was unable to break open the cash box.
After a resident, who was woken up by the sound of the explosion, came to the spot, the suspect sped away on a motorcycle. On receiving information, policemen reached the ATM and recovered a live explosive device, left behind by the suspect.
In the morning, bank officials came to the ATM and confirmed that there was no damage to the cash box or loss of money. On Sunday, they had placed a large amount of cash in the vault.
C.Vijayakumar, Superintendent of Police, Kancheepuram, said that inspector Swaminathan sustained minor injuries on his hands while attempting to defuse the low-intensity explosive that was made with petroleum jelly. The culprit had used some small voltage capacity batteries to ignite the explosive material – called `flurry’ – normally used to trigger low-intensity blasts in mines.

Indian FB users end up hacking own accounts
","Some Facebook users in India were tricked into hacking their own accounts by a scam claiming to reveal the passwords of their friends.
The scam compromised the user’s account by tricking them into using some code that takes control of their account and exposes their friends’ data in the process.
“What really happens when you paste this code into your browser console window is that a series of actions are performed using your Facebook account without your knowledge.
“Behind the scenes, your account is used to follow lists and users, and give likes to pages in order to inflate the follower and like counts defined by the scammers,” explained Satnam Narang, a security response manager for Symantec in a blog post.
The scam employs an instructional video explaining “Facebook Hacking”, which links to a Google document that contains some code.
The code allows users to see friends’ Facebook passwords, according to the scammers, with the instructions attempting to convince users to paste the code into their browser console window. The instructions explain that the code will take two hours to work.
In reality, the code performs actions behind the scenes using the would-be hacker’s Facebook account, including following certain users and liking pages. No doubt the scammers are being paid to artificially inflate the follower or like counts of some users and pages.

NIA to probe Assam killings; toll 32, hundreds flee their homes
","Nine more bodies were recovered in the Bodoland Territorial Area Districts of Kokrajhar and Baska on Saturday, taking the toll to 32 in the violence unleashed by the National Democratic Front of Boroland (NDFB)-Songbijit militants on Thursday and Friday.
The State government decided to hand over the investigation to the National Investigation Agency.
The nine bodies, four among them of children and two of women, were recovered from Khagrabari in Salbari sub-division adjacent to the Manas National Park in Baksa, official sources said.
The mayhem started on Thursday when heavily armed militants shot dead three members of a family, near the Ananda Bazar area, in the district. On Friday, insurgents opened fire at Balapara-I village in neighbouring Kokrajhar, leaving eight persons dead and several injured.
On Friday night, 12 bullet-riddled bodies, five among them of women and one of a child, were recovered from Nankekhadrabari and Nayanguri in Baksa, where ultras set ablaze nearly 100 houses and a wooden bridge.
The police opened fire in the air after a mob armed with spears and sticks tried to set ablaze a forest range office at Basbari in Baksa on Saturday morning, the sources said. This made hundreds of people flee their homes with some taking shelter in two relief camps.
Of the four BTAD districts of Baksa, Kokrajhar, Udalguri and Chirang, the first two were affected. Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi who chaired a Cabinet meeting decided to hand over investigation to the National Investigation Agency to find those responsible for the violence.
“Let the NIA investigate who is involved. No one will be spared if found responsible for the violence,” Mr. Gogoi told presspersons after the meeting here. “I want to coordinate with neighbouring Bhutan as the militants may hide there after committing the crime. If the NIA comes then that can be done,” the Chief Minister said.
The NDFB (Songbijit) has denied its involvement in the violence, claiming it was “a political conspiracy by the Assam government to trigger clashes between two communities.”
A press statement by NDFB Secretary (Information and Publicity Wing) N.E. Esara said: “We ask the Assam government and its officials to stay away from such accusation without the slightest justification.”

Birdwatchers throng backwaters of Tungabhadra dam
","Birdwatchers in and around Bellary district have been thronging the backwaters of the Tungabhadra dam at Hospet to catch a glimpse of Greater Flamingos (Phoenicopterus roseus) that have flocked in large numbers.
Greater Flamingos, with its majestic looks, are 1.5-metre tall, pinkish birds from the Rann of Kutch in Gujarat which migrate to the south in winter. They are known to congregate at Pulicat lake in Tamil Nadu in winter. They migrate to Gujarat in the summer to breed. On their way back, they spend some time in large reservoirs such as the Tungabhadra dam and Alamatti dam in Karnataka.
Samad Kottur, a bird watcher in Hospet and author of the book Birds of Hampi, is of the view that all the flamingos never stay the entire winter in the backwaters of the Tungabhadra reservoir. During their journey towards Pulicat, they stop wherever they find food and stay there for some days in November and December and continue their onward journey. On their return to Kutch, they spend some time in the Tungabhadra dam, Alamatti dam and other waterbodies in the vicinity. However, some non-breeding species stay till monsoon. As the water recedes, birds such as Greater Flamingos, feed upon the crustaceans, molluscs, algae, shrimps, worms, Blue Green Algae, seeds.

Help pouring in, rebuilding homes gets easier this time
","There have been seven fires -- both major and minor -- over the years in Masoodpur village of South Delhi’s Vasant Kunj, including last Friday’s that gutted 700 jhuggis here. But area residents say this is the first time that the response from the government agencies has been so well coordinated and efficient that they can focus on re-building their homes.
“Perhaps lack of an elected government has kept the politicians away and the model code of conduct continues to be in force so the work has been on smoothly without anyone trying to take credit for it,” said a resident.
Anand Bonik, who runs an electrical shop, said there have been no shortcomings in the facilities provided by the Delhi Government after the slum residents lost all their belongings to a fire that engulfed the area after a cylinder exploded in one of the huts. “Food, water, medicines….all facilities have been arranged for us here,” he said.
The government agencies reacted very quickly, said Vasant Kunj resident Rakesh Sapru, who was among the first ones to help jhuggi dwellers on April 25. “The administration has tried its best to work together and even a minor mishap that took place recently was dealt with efficiently. The only time we saw any politicising of the issue was when a representative from a regional party from West Bengal made an appearance here to rally support from the jhuggi dwellers who are mostly Bengali migrants,” he said.
Mr. Sapru’s gardener, Hamid Ali, is a resident of the slum cluster. He was at work when he heard about the fire and so rushed back home. “Now we are all helping each other re-build our homes,” he said.
A survey initiated by NGO Balvikas Dhara has numbered the jhuggi plots over the last week and has helped reach clothes and utensils to each family. “It is really good to see the administration care about the jhuggi dwellers. Previously, we had incidents when they have been termed Bangladeshis and some of them have been randomly picked up and taken to the police station,” said Debender Kumar Baral from the NGO.
On a visit to the site on Thursday morning one saw canvas tents provided by the Sub-Divisional Magistrate’s office and the Delhi Disaster Management Authority sheltering several families from the harsh sun, tankers of the Delhi Jal Board lined up, a tent dedicated to health facilities with a doctor and medicines, a contingent from the Delhi Police and Civil Defence personnel helping people and numerous NGOs and smaller organisations coming forward to help, especially with food.
Bamboo sticks were being erected and tied together to form the outline of their new homes. “Previously, contractors controlled a certain number of jhuggis but this time the area residents will build their own homes,” said Mr. Baral.
The jhuggi dwellers, however, express their dissatisfaction with the ex-gratia amount of Rs.5,000 per family that was sanctioned by Lieutenant-Governor Najeeb Jung.
“Local councillor Omwati has been denied a meeting with Mr. Jung, especially over increasing this amount,” said Mr. Sapru.

The selfies of the book biz
","We were sceptical at first. “But won’t you miss the smell of old books or the joy of pressing pretty flowers between the pages of your favourite novel?” we asked. As Gulzar writes in one poem, what of asking for books, dropping them or picking them up as excuses for forging relationships with complete strangers? (“
magar woh jo kitabon mein milaa karte thay sookhay phool, kitabein maangne, giraanay, uthaane kay bahaane rishtey bante thay, unkaa kyaa hogaa, wo shayad ab nahi hongey). “How will we write profound love notes and advice on books we give as gifts?”
The pragmatists gave us their reasons. “Technology is the way forward; think of all the space you will be saving at home/office.” How unromantic, real estate as the trade off for books.
Slowly, however, reasons for embracing e-readers like Amazon’s Kindle are emerging. “Think of all the trees we can save,” they say. True. And here’s another compelling one: for the sake of discovering interesting writers who are publishing exclusively on these e-readers. There is a quiet revolution apparently and we may lose out on reading some good books if we don’t catch up now, we hear.
Ok, here’s a compromise. How about, we keep our libraries and book shelves filled with novels, poetry, memoirs and magazines, while also peeking at these new-age e-readers every once in a while, to read what emerges in the future?
And here are four of Amazon India’s biggest successes explaining to the reader, why they chose to self-publish through Kindle Direct Publishing.

Sri Vishwanath

Ranked among the 50 most popular authors in the “Mind Body and Spirit” section by Amazon USA consistently for the last year and with over a quarter million books downloaded in the last 14 months on Amazon Kindle, Sri Vishwanath is among the best examples of Kindle Direct Publishing platform’s success in India. The 42-year-old cost accountant and company secretary, born and brought up in Mumbai, lived and worked in the United States. At 33, he came back to Mumbai leaving a job in the United States to venture into book writing.
“I had no clue about the book industry yet was very keen to get to the top tier in the spiritual/transformational book league,” he says. Vishwanath has written 13 books in the last seven years. Of the 13 books, titles such as Give Up Your Excess Baggage: 24 Simple Mind Exercises That Great Men & Women Effectively Use Every Single Day, The Power of Visualization - Meditation Secrets That Matter the Most, Seven Common Signs of A Spiritual Awakening have seen great response. His latest book is titled Stolen Idol.
“I have had over 500 reviews combined for my books in Amazon USA. So the response has been phenomenal,” says Vishwanath. “Like everyone else I went through traditional publishers initially but simultaneously also explored the self-publishing route. I kept writing books got close to securing big deals with a New York publisher but for some reason or the other the deal would not come through in the end. Eight years later, after completing 13 transformational titles I uploaded all my books on Amazon Kindle two years back. And readers in United States, UK and other countries loved it,” says a proud Vishwanath.
Ask him why he chose Kindle and pat comes the answer: “They have the simplest system for self-publishing. You can upload your book in less than five minutes if you have all the details and it gets published in less than 12 hours. They have got internal traffic as millions of Kindle users search for books.”
Vishwanath has even helped his son Vignesh publish on the platform. “He is 13 years old and wanted to publish a book. He had collected quotes of Vivekananda, Ramana Maharishi and others. He put it all together and we put it up on kindle. I never did any promotion other than helping with the title. He has sold over 600 books which is great,” he says.

Parvathi Ramkumar

Parvathi is a full time writer, professional book critic and now author of a fantasy novel The Grove of the Sun. “Writing, especially imaginative fiction, has always been a passion for me since I was a little girl,” she says. Born in Thiruvananthapuram, she began school in Los Angeles and has since then lived in Cochin, Hyderabad, Jaipur and Bangalore. The Bangalore-based author is also the granddaughter of noted Malayalam litterateur V. Madhavan Nair (Mali).
“My book, The Grove of the Sun, is a standalone high fantasy novel, unique in its setting and approach. It has Indian elements that are not drawn from mythology. It is about Order and Chaos in the whimsical land of Chimera, and one man’s discovery that all that he’s believed about his homeland may not be the truth after all,” says Parvathi. It took her over seven years to research, write and edit The Grove of the Sun.
“Fantasy, especially one that is not based on mythology, is relatively new in India,” she explains. Since the genre is new to India and the response of traditional publishers was lukewarm, Parvathi decided to go with KDP. “The Kindle store has worldwide reach. It gave me an opportunity to present my book to an international audience with a single upload. The book is available in India, the US and UK, Australia, Canada, and many more countries. There are also no extra costs nor any middlemen involved, and as a whole, it is a quick and attractive way to market my writing,” she adds.
About the response to the book Parvathi says, “It’s been pretty good so far. I’ve had interviews and great reviews in newspapers and magazines, as well as blogs, from readers and critics in India and abroad.”

Rasana Atreya

Rasana Atreya, who holds a Masters in Computer Engineering, worked in IT for a few years until the yearning to be a writer got too strong to ignore. “I started off with technical writing and later moved on to freelancing for newspapers,” she says.
“My first book is about superstition, our (Indian) obsession with the colour of one's skin, and the power of manipulation. This novel came about because Indian television is overrun with advertisements from manufacturers of fairness creams that promise everything from good grades to nirvana, if only you use their particular brand of product. This annoyed me enough to I wrote out a tagline - 

Fairness Creams: Finding Solutions to Life's Vexing Problems, One Application at a Time. Then I proceeded to write a novel around it. I worked on it for three years,” she says. The manuscript of her book Tell a Thousand Lies was also shortlisted for an award.
“I chanced upon the Tibor Jones South Asia award in 2012. This award was unusual in that they were asking for unpublished manuscripts. Getting shortlisted for this prize by Amit Chaudhuri and Urvashi Butalia did wonders for my self-confidence. I'd also been watching self-publishing stars Amanda Hawking and Joe Konrath,” she adds. Rasana wanted to self-publish but was quite nervous about it. “Around that time I was also offered a publishing contract by a publishing house. Ironically enough, it was these two things (the award and contract) that gave me the confidence to strike out on my own.”
She chose to self publish because, she says, many, authors - mid-list writers, not necessarily superstars - are making a living solely off of Amazon. “And their 70 per cent royalties don't hurt,” she adds. And her book has been received very well by readers, she insists. “It was much more than I'd hoped or expected. I've received fan mail from places as varied as Mexico and Pakistan. I've had people request me to ramp up my writing speed because they can't wait for my next novel. My book has been well reviewed on Amazon and Goodreads with a combined 300 reviews on these sites.” 
“Since my book has been doing consistently well, the Jaipur and Hyderabad Literary festivals invited me to be part of their panels in 2013,” she adds. Rasana, who has also helped her daughter self-publish,
explains that the beauty of self-publishing lies in the fact that you can track your sales by the hour. You can tell exactly how many people have bought your book, and from which country. You can also track exactly how much royalties you've earned each month.” On some months she has also sold more than 1,000 books online.

Ajay Jain

Ajay Jain is a full-time writer, journalist and photographer based in Delhi. He has written travel books like Peep Peep Don’t Sleep, and other titles such as Super Brand You.
“I initially published on KDP as that was the only major e-publishing platform. More importantly, Amazon ensured there were no barriers from day one. You could be an author, an independent or a big publisher, and you could be anywhere in the world - it allowed you to upload and list the book without any fuss. You could even decide your own pricing. Even after all these years, KDP remains an easy to publish platform,” he explains.
Ajay also enlists the fact that despite e-reading catching on fast, Kindle continues to remain a popular e-reading device/app. “I am also able to tap into an international audience, set prices in multiple currencies and also vary the same according to the purchasing power of various markets,” he explains, “In a nutshell, the distribution and simplicity of the platform ensures there are minimum barriers for publishers, authors and readers to come together.”
Ajay says that the response has been terrific to his books. “I was pleasantly surprised to see a deep penetration in the Indian market,” he says.

To dak runners with love
","Sher Singh is a dak runner employed by the Department of Posts and his job is to carry mail for 12 km from Raksham to Chitkul, the last village on the Himachal-China border. For the first time, his life has become the theme on which veteran journalist B. G. Verghese has based his book “Post Haste: Quintessential India”.
Stating that he wanted to demystify Bharat, Mr. Verghese said at the book release function on Thursday that he was inspired by the thought that the Election Commission spends so much money to ensure that even three out of millions of voters exercise their adult franchise. This means hiring the services of dak runners like Sher Singh who go to places fraught with danger so that every citizen is connected with the rest of the country. Former Union Minister Natwar Singh said: “I agree with George that the Indian democracy is flawed. But it is good in crisis management and reconciling contradictions.”
Addressing the gathering, which included a number of school students, Mr. Verghese said he was speaking on behalf of Sher Singh. “In 1982 he bought a radio and needed to renew his licence. So he went to the Post Office where he was told to apply for a job of dak runner…and his working language is of course Hindi.”
Asked by an enthusiastic school girl about the qualification of a dak runner, Mr. Verghese said: “His qualifications are grit and determination to fulfil his objective. He has to cross snow fields and cope with aberrant weather conditions. He also has to track the movements of wild animals and steer clear of them.”
Rajya Sabha MP Karan Singh said “the book is a must read because people these days are losing touch with their cultural heritage”.
Noted jurist Leila Seth said the book narrates stories through stamps.

Murder victim identified, cabbie suspected
","A young woman, whose body was found, chopped to pieces, on the banks of Porur Lake on Saturday evening, has been identified. Police suspect the involvement of a city cab driver, who is on the run.
Rekha Sriram, a Nesapakkam resident, was a business process outsourcing (BPO) centre employee and a consultant dietician at a fitness centre. Policemen at SRMC station, who are investigating the murder, said she had married Sriram, a software professional working in Ambattur, in February this year.
On Saturday, residents in the vicinity of the lake saw a gunny bag on the banks of the waterbody around 7 p.m. and alerted the police.
Policemen opened the sack to find the decomposed torso and head of a young woman. The victims’ hands and legs were recovered from nearby. Investigations revealed that Sriram had lodged a complaint with MGR Nagar police station on May 1 about Rekha not having returned home.
“On Sunday, Sriram identified the body as that of his missing wife at the Government Royapettah Hospital mortuary,” said an investigating officer.
The investigating team has found that Rekha had approached the Madhavaram police with a compliant of repeated harassment by Sitaraman alias Samson (25), a cab driver and resident of Sitapathi Street in Madhavaram. “Samson used to drive Rekha to work and home when she worked at a call centre in Vadapalani and was upset when he learnt of her marriage,” the officer added.
It is suspected that he along with a few accomplices may have murdered her and flung the body into the lake from Chennai Bypass. Police are searching for Samson and have found his car that is suspected to have been used to transport the victim’s body.

Security beefed up in central region
","Security was beefed up at railway stations and bus stands in the central districts in the aftermath of the bomb blast at Bangalore – Guwahati Express on Thursday. Round-the-clock additional security has been beefed up at the airport here.
The baggage of passengers were checked and sniffer dogs were pressed in to service at the railway junction here, shortly after the news about the blast spread.
Shortly after an alert message, the Railway Police Force personnel provided additional security arrangements at the railway junction and other stations and also near the bridges.
At the airport, the security arrangements were beefed up jointly by Central Industries Security Force, air force security and intelligence personnel besides dog squad. “We have been keeping a close vigil and a total of 268 CRPF personnel have been pressed in to service round-the-clock,” K.

CBI files charge sheet in trafficking case
","The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has filed a charge sheet in a case in which a woman was trafficked to the UAE through the Nedumbassery airport under a forged passport.
Seven persons, including two police officers, have been accused in the charge sheet, filed before the Ernakulam Chief Judicial Magistrate Court.
The case relates to the incident in which a 19-year-old from Kazhakuttam in Thiruvananthapuram was taken to Muscat through the Nedumbassery airport for sex work under a passport that belonged to another woman from Kattappana. The case, which was initially investigated by the Crime Branch, was handed over to the CBI along with three other cases of trafficking through the Nedumbassery airport.
The seven accused in the case are Santha, 46, of Punaloor, Kollam; Lissy Sojan, 43, of Karumathara, Thrissur; P.R. Shaji, 42, of Vallivattom, Thrissur; Raju Mathew, 44, of Lakkatoor, Kottayam; Sethulal of Kodungalloor, Thrissur; Prasanth Kumar, of Eriyadukara, Thrissur; and Varghese Raphael of Maradu. Varghese is currently absconding and believed to be in the Gulf. All the other accused were arrested and subsequently released on bail.
Two other accused, including the woman who was trafficked abroad, have not been charge-sheeted in the case.
The CBI report said Santha worked as an agent for Lissy Sojan, who operated brothels in the Gulf countries. She recruited the 19-year-old woman on behalf of Lissy after promising her a cleaning job in Dubai. Santha allegedly made a commission of Rs.15,000 for recruiting the Kazhakuttam native. Lissy wrongfully took possession of the passport of a woman from Kattappana and arranged for the victim’s photograph to be pasted onto the passport. Sethulal has also been accused of arranging the passport forgery.
Varghese Raphael, who worked for Lissy in the Gulf, sent the forged passport to civil police officer (CPO) Prasanth Kumar through courier.
He handed over the documents to Shaji, who took them to Santha.

Shoot-at-sight after Assam massacre
","The Army has been called out and an indefinite curfew imposed in the Bodoland Territorial Area Districts (BTAD) of Kokrajhar and Baksa in Assam after >militants killed 20 persons and injured 10, all Muslim migrants, in three separate attacks on Thursday night and Friday.
Unofficial sources, however, put the death toll at 23. The militants torched over 30 houses in four villages in Baksa.
Shoot-at-sight orders have been issued. The Army took out flag marches.
The Assam Police said the National Democratic Front of Boroland (Songbijit) carried out the attacks.
Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi called the attacks a cowardly act. Union Home Minister Sushilkumar Shinde spoke to Mr. Gogoi, and promised to send 10 additional companies of Central paramilitary forces sought by the State government.
On Friday evening, militants attacked Narayanguri village and adjoining areas near the Manas National Park in Baksa, killing nine persons, official sources said.
Eleven persons died in two attacks on Thursday night. Around 9 p.m., militants gunned down three persons in Baksa. Around half past midnight, five or six militants descended on a village in Kokrajhar and opened fire indiscriminately, Inspector-General of Police (BTAD) L.R. Bisnoi said. Eight persons — six women and two girls — were killed.
Mr. Bisnoi said the militant group had targeted civilians to avenge the killing of three militants of the outfit in an encounter with a joint team of the police and the Central Reserve Police Force in Sonitpur district on Thursday.
He said the outfit targeted civilians belonging to religious and linguistic minorities when it suffered reverses.

Media coverage on gender identity issues draws flak
","The media can be a positive force for improving human rights, health of homosexuals and transgender people in South Asia, says a new report developed by Centre for Advocacy & Research (CFAR) and UN Development Programme (UNDP).
The report, ‘A Framework for Media Engagement on MSM and Transgender Persons in South Asia,’ provides direction for how homosexuals and transgender communities should engage with the media and how the media itself should leverage its influence to reduce stigma and discrimination, educate and raise awareness of human rights issues and support strategies, programmes that improve the political, social and legal environments for homosexuals and the transgender people.
Examining media reporting in Bangladesh, India, Sri Lanka and Nepal, researchers found prejudiced, inaccurate and sensationalised news coverage that increased stigma and distorted public perception on sexual orientation and gender identity issues. It also enforced stereotypes and not reported community issues accurately.
“Though media coverage of HIV has increased over the last two decades, the coverage of issues relating to sexual orientation and gender identities has often been weak and objectionable,” said Edmund Settle, Policy Advisor at UNDP Asia-Pacific Regional Centre.
“By engaging with communities, raising awareness among media practitioners and wielding their powers for good, the media can influence public opinion and policies and programmes, and contribute to a more effective HIV response in the region,” said Mr. Settle.
The report recommends that community organisations create partnerships with all levels of the media – local, state and national – to improve accurate reporting and representation of key issues.
Taking the appeal forward, Akhila Sivadas, Executive Director, CFAR, said: “Today, more than ever before, there was both an imperative and an opportunity for community-based organisations to systematically harness the media, in particular the local language and district media and engage them in impacting policies and programmes with the decisive aim to advance social inclusion of and affirmative action for homosexuals and transgender persons.”
The authors and researchers of the report, CFAR, also noted reasons for hope. “Sexual and gender minority communities in the countries studied have made huge strides in recent years. On several occasions, they’ve been key ‘newsmakers’ and driven intensive periods of national discourse around key community issues.”
In India, media sensitisation workshops have improved coverage, as have partnerships between community and media to raise issues on HIV, human rights and human interest stories.

Zoo animals escape mercury’s fury
","As summer begins to peak and the mercury keeps its upwardly climb, the Nehru Zoological Park has made arrangements to help the animals, birds and reptiles here escape the hot weather conditions.
From air-coolers to rain guns and sprinklers, the authorities have covered the different zones of the zoo with the required paraphernalia, said curator B.N.N. Murthy.
“Most animal and bird enclosures have been enriched with different plant species that help reduce the temperature,” he said.
More than 100 sprinklers have been installed along the peripheries of the enclosures, and the bigger enclosures have been provided with rain guns that could throw water at a distance of about 30 metres.
There are eight rain guns for the enclosures of the chimpanzee, lions and others, while they would be installed for elephants and rhinoceros in the next couple of days.
Foggers that create a mist and keep the enclosures cool were already in place in the aviary, and also in the enclosures of some smaller cats. The others were draped with thunga dry grass and also khas-khas matting and watered regularly, Mr. Murthy said.
All the night houses to which the animals retire in the evening have been fitted with air-coolers, and these include those of the leopard, white tiger, lions, jackal and sloth bears.
“We ensured that the temperature in these night houses is at least 5 degree Celsius less than that outside,” he said.
In another move, the electricity department was approached with a request to ensure that the power cuts do not happen here during the day time.
“The APCPDCL has agreed to go for its load relief and have power cuts only during the early mornings and late evenings to help our efforts of keeping animals and birds comfortable during the hot day conditions,” Mr. Murthy added.

Good Grief
","
I am 18 years old. A friend told me that he had a crush on me and that, even if I were to reject his proposal, we would always be good friends. I told him that it’s better to stay friends and continued talking to him like before. My mom knew about this. Lately he has stopped messaging me. I miss him and don’t know what he is to me. I feel scared to share this with my mom. How do I handle this? - Crushed
It takes a lot of courage to ask a friend out. Since you’ve rejected him, he’s probably feeling disappointed and embarrassed to talk to you. Don’t over-analyse the situation. Try talking to him normally; if he hesitates to respond, give him some time (days, not hours!) and try again. If you still get the silent treatment, then may be he wasn’t as invested in your friendship as you were. That means it’s time to put the whole thing behind you and move on.

Making her presence felt
","Amidst the glitzy green carpet bombing, Indian International Film Academy took time to breath and introspect about some real issues in Tampa. And what better way to reflect than raising the concern for education of the girl child. IIFA screened the Indian episode of Girl Rising, the evocative documentary by Richard E Robbins. Written by Sooni Taraporevala and narrated by Priyanka Chopra, it tells the story of Rukhsana, the daughter of a daily wage labourer in Kolkata, who draws strength from her father’s will to educate her against all odds. He sacrifices his basic needs so that his daughter could dream and Robbins blends those colourful dreams with the stench of cruel reality around Rukhsana with amazing dexterity. In the discussion that followed, Priyanka and Shabana Azmi reflected on how they drew from their parents to become people who care about the world they live in. “As a child I used to travel with my doctor parents in the villages around Bareilly to distribute free medicine to people who could not afford it. I was very particular about the number of tablets to be given,” Priyanka reminisced.
Priyanka said the girl child should not be considered as a burden and Shabana pointed out human development index is more important than GDP of a country and empowerment of women is a crucial factor in it. “During the course of my visits as UNICEF ambassador I come across girls who complain that that they are discriminated against their brothers in terms of education and even quality of food,” said Priyanka. The actress, who spent some years in Boston as a student, was quick to point out that Indian families in the US are no different when it comes to the girl child. “It was often said that girls have to be saved from the Western influence and hence they should go to the nearby school while boys were free to studies in universities outside the home state. Also the more you forbid the kid to do something, the more he or she would like to indulge in it and the chances to flounder increase. I am not recommending late night parties but when you are living in a society you cannot block the cultural influence. I found this fear strange and stifling.”
Shabana Azmi who runs Mijwan Welfare Society said that gender discrimination was deep rooted and insidious. “You just have to take a look at the books prescribed in the school curriculum. Most of them have two questions: Where is your mother? And the answer would be: She is in the kitchen. Then, where is your father? And the answer would be: He is in the office. I raised this issue in the Parliament that why it can’t be the other way or at least the answers could both are in kitchen and both are in office.”
For Priyanka the catalyst of change came one Janmashtami night. “I know it sounds filmy but it is true. We found a baby girl abandoned beneath my mother’s car. She brought her home and nursed her. For me she became my younger sister. I would take out the clothes of my younger brother and dress her up. And I cried when she was sent to an orphanage. It opened the world to me and I realised all girls are not as privileged as I am.” She pointed out that it was her upbringing that kept her reminding that she had to give back to the society when she was in position of strength.
For Shabana the moment to reflect came when she did Mahesh Bhatt’s Arth. “I grew up in a communist household. We had a hand to mouth existence but gender equality was a given. My mother used to work when my poet father was not earning much. It was when I did Arth and played a character who says no to her philandering husband even after he says sorry that I realised how big a step it is. First the distributors said the ending won’t work because it is too much for an Indian man to say sorry and still not accepted by the woman. Anyway, the film got released and did good business but soon I started getting letters from women who were facing trouble in their married life. The last thing I wanted was to become an agony aunt but I felt that the film has proved to be a sort of catharsis for middle class women who are yet distinguish between a character and a real person.”
She said at Mijwan she has been able to ensure that no girl below the age of 18 gets married. “We often think that we are too small to make change. But it doesn’t take much to ask the maid at home whether her daughter is going to school or not and if she is facing a problem on can come forward to help her out.”

Coimbatore Corporation reschedules water supply
","From once in two days the Coimbatore Corporation has decreased the Siruvani water supply to once in four days. But, the duration of supply of four hours continues.
The Corporation is forced to decrease the supply to meet the summer demand, sources say and add that at this rate it will be able to extend the supply till the first week of June this year.
As on Friday, the Corporation received 62 million litres a day (MLD) as against the full supply of 87 MLD from the Tamil Nadu Water Supply and Drainage Board. The Siruvani Reservoir has 8.75 feet water.
The Siruvani water reaches 28 of the 100 wards in the city.
As for the supply from the Pilloor I and Pilloor II schemes goes, the Corporation receives 48.27 MLD and 86.43 MLD respectively. In the Aliyar supply again there is a dip as against the designed quantity of 7.5 MLD, the Corporation received only 4.5 MLD.
The sources say that where there is deficiency in water supply, the Corporation is diverting Pilloor water. In Thudiyalur in the North Zone, the supply has improved from once in 10 days to once in five days because it had recently linked the Bhavani water supply pipeline with the Pilloor pipeline for diversion of water as work was in progress.
The supply will further improve once the Tamil Nadu Water Supply and Drainage Board has completed the water supply augmentation there and is likely to open the pipeline for supply in the next few days.
Meanwhile, TWAD Board sources say that through the Coimbatore Corporation it has referred to the Tamil Nadu Government the Kerala Government’s request for sealing an exit pipeline that is below the dead storage level. The Kerala Government has been keen on sealing the pipeline alleging that more water was flowing through the pipeline and that it need the water for environment conservation to meet animals’ drinking water needs.
Last year, too, a similar situation arose but it was solved at the secretary-level talks the two Governments held.

Angst through artistry
","As many as 25 artists came together for a two-day workshop organised by State Gallery of Fine Arts under the leadership of Sivanagi Reddy, Director recently. “The quality of work and the display of professionalism by such young women is astounding. They all had ideas to contribute, and made art their medium to communicate,” says Ramani Mylavarapu who also presented a collage titled ‘All roads lead to ...’ through which she highlighted her concern about the lack of safety of women after the Nirbhaya incident, and after a woman was raped in a car near Inorbit mall in Hyderabad.
Another of her works depicted a girl wearing a black belt, in a defensive pose suggesting that girls should be trained in self defence in schools. In the background to the left there were software companies in the abstract, and to right, ‘Jhansi ki Rani’ subtly depicts inspiration.
Another painter Anjali Das, who hails from a village in Ongole, likes to paint Indian culture. One painting that stood out was three women in black and white, one involved with the Sankranti festivity rituals, the other two gossiping. She works with oil and water colours. Her dream career is to be an art teacher where she can teach children about Indian culture and traditions.
Also featuring her works was K.V. Nagamani from Kukatpally. She started painting after her schooling and later, pursued her degree in Fine Arts from JNAFAU. One of her most talked about paintings is titled ‘Wedding Celebrations’ in Telangana.
One of her most beautiful works was a tribal woman with a large vessel on her head, belonging to the East/West Godavari belt.
Saakshi Sharma, a painter from childhood, gave a more formal touch to her passion by obtaining a Bachelor’s degree at JNAFAU. She now spreads her love for art, by holding evening classes at her residence and also teaching art at St. Francis School, her alma mater. “Colours liberate me, especially when I get to watch them play out on canvas,” she says.
She feels that being able to portray an emotion or a series of events on canvas is a way of communicating. “When I am done with the painting, I need to hear it speak to me. Only then I know it is complete.”
So far she has done two series of works. One is a collection titled liberation, and the other, contrasting harmony, dreams and perfect imperfection.
Calcutta is known for its cultural learning and contribution to the art vista in the country. To give exposure to A.P., a set of miniature paintings from Calcutta were brought and presented to the audience.
The display was a feast for the eyes, especially a few paintings that were of great calibre. The whole exhibition was called Miniature 101, which was first exhibited at Chemould Art Gallery, Kolkata last year.
This exhibition asks the painters to express their thoughts in a very small two dimensional format, almost as if to say ‘Small is beautiful.’

FIR against Beni for objectionable remarks on Modi
","An FIR was registered against Union Minister Beni Prasad Verma on Saturday for violating the Model Code of Conduct by making “objectionable” remarks about Narendra Modi.
“The FIR was registered against Verma at Chhapia police station this morning for violating Model Code of Conduct by making objectionable remarks against Modi,” District Magistrate Vikas Gothalwal said.
“A person, who discriminates between Hindu and Muslim in this country and creates hatred between them, is not a human being, but a monster,” the Congress leader had said addressing an election rally in Maskanwa town on Friday night.
“Modi must tell whether he is a human being or not. On the massacre of the people in Gujarat you (Modi) say that it’s a reaction. You tease Muslims by stating that even if a puppy comes under you vehicle you feel sad,” he said.
The EC had, two days ago, censured Beni for his “insulting” remarks against Modi and warned that further violation could result in a ban on his campaign activity.
Beni said a person like Modi is an “enemy” of the country and democracy. “If such a person comes to power then self respect of 85 per cent downtrodden people of the country will end and dominance of handful persons will prevail in the society,” he alleged.
On April 8, another FIR was registered against Beni in Balrampur for calling BJP prime ministerial candidate the “biggest goonda” of RSS and that the party’s national president Rajnath Singh his “slave.”

I am… Manjunath – School resource person
","I am passionate about working with children. But before I discovered my love for children, I worked in Canara Bank and took voluntary retirement in 2001. I started pursuing my hobbies which had taken a backseat earlier. So from sitting behind counters, it was off to following my passions like cricket, theatre, music, reading, trekking and other adventure activities.
After a couple of years I started working with my wife in a school as a parent volunteer. That’s when my bond with children began. We did theatre, sports and other games and activities for children in schools. Then we also started working on science by using waste material and making toys as well as teaching children to do simple experiments. That was also when my sister-in-law started an organisation which had a branch called Balavihar that reached out to schools, including government, aided and unaided, that lacked certain facilities. We realised that some of them did not even have a library. So we started creating libraries, which later led to the building of our mobile library. This opened a whole new world of books for children. Then we tied up with an NGO called Asha For Education. This opened doors for us to reach out to schools with theatre and other cultural activities. We teach yoga, music, theatre and so on.
During one of these sessions, a parent from a well-known Montessori school saw my work and I was invited as a resource person. There began my journey independently, sans the group. Once a week, I work with Balavihaar and the rest of the week I visit schools like Creative, Magic Puddles and Namma Shaale. Since I am a voracious reader, story telling too became a part of my repertoire.
My work with children led to extensive theatre and voice exercises, exposure to the lives of people like Gandhiji, Einstein, Galileo and to know our own states like the heritage of the Cauvery river, History of India, the British Raj among others. When it comes to performing a play, I allow the children to take the lead in deciding the roles they want to perform as through the training they recognise their own strengths and weaknesses.
It’s a fulfilling and a challenging job, which is like a workout… painful while you are at it, but the end result is brilliant.

Visually-challenged paraglider flies solo
","On Wednesday afternoon, at Kamshet near Pune, a 36-year-old undertook his first solo paragliding flight. As soon as he landed, his trainers ran out and huddled around him. Amid cheers, one said, “We did it. You made history.”
Divyanshu Ganatra had just become the only visually-challenged Indian paraglider to have flown solo. “It was a spiritual high,” Mr. Ganatra told The Hindu before adding modestly: “I did it like everyone else does.”
A clinical psychologist who lost his sight due to glaucoma at the age of 19, Mr. Ganatra runs a counselling and corporate training organisation called ‘Yellow Brick Road’.
The flight was made possible by Templepilots, a paragliding club run by Avi Malik and his wife Anita Deshpande.
According to Mr. Malik, there are no official records of visually-challenged people having undertaken solo flights. A Master Instructor at the Association of Paragliding Pilots and Instructors, he stated that no other Indian had attempted this before. “There are probably one or two worldwide who have attempted this successfully,” he said. A hearing-impaired Belgian performed the same feat under his guidance last year.
For Mr. Ganatra, however, it wasn’t about the achievement or about proving a point to anyone. “I did it because of my love for the sport,” he said. For Mr. Malik and his wife, taking up his request was an “instinctive decision.” “The heart said yes first, the mind worked on it later,” Mr. Malik said.
What was most important was working together and having faith in each other. “I trusted them with my life. That is the only way I could have done this,” Mr. Ganatra said. Ms. Deshpande agreed. “It was about trust, and not about [never] flying anymore.”
The experience helped Mr. Malik stretch his own boundaries as a teacher as he sought to find new ways and means to guide Mr. Ganatra. “One way was using simulation, and working on other senses: touching, feeling and listening,” he said. To explain the concepts of aerodynamics, Mr. Malik asked Mr. Ganatra to use his hands to understand how the glider works.
In a ‘tandem’ flight with an instructor, he learnt what the experience could be like. An initial idea of using bells was discarded as Mr. Malik thought that audio signals broadcast through a radio would do the job. A quick and instinctive learner, Mr. Ganatra was ready for his flight after three days of on-ground training.
“The experience was an overwhelming mix of joy, fear and excitement. When you are in the sky, you taste freedom,” he said.

Piping his own brand of music
","A contested history of flamenco music traces its roots to Indian shores. It says migrants from Rajasthan travelled across Central Asia, through the Middle East and finally settled in modern-day Spain over a thousand years ago, creating, along the way, a musical idiom that culled influences from its travels. The title track of flautist Rajeev Raja’s debut album Cosmic Chant brings this journey full circle. It opens with soft flamenco guitar work, builds strength with drums and bass, breaks into a full-fledged Carnatic vocal section and closes with a conversation between the tabla and flute. Flamenco now has an Indian home.
Stories of such sojourns are central to Cosmic Chant. Above all, it narrates the journey of frontman Rajeev Raja himself, from a harmonica-toting boy born to Malayali parents and brought up in Bangalore, to playing with early jazz-rock city bands, onto accompanying the best in Mumbai’s 90s music scene, to finally creating his own Indo-jazz outfit: the Rajeev Raja Combine. In Kochi for a concert at JTPac, Rajeev says it all began with a stroke of luck. He was once jamming with a college classmate who handed him a two-rupee bamboo flute and suggested he try his hand at it. “I was amazed that I could play it. It’s almost as if the flute found me,” he says.
From these beginnings, Rajeev worked the competition and festival circuits with college bands, winning several accolades until he moved to Mumbai to work at an ad agency. Within a year there, he was absorbed into an Indian fusion band named Surya, which had Shankar Mahadevan on vocals, Salim, of Salim-Sulaiman fame, on keyboards, Sridhar Parthasarathy on mridangam with Faisal Qureshi on tabla and Taufiq Qureshi on percussion. “I would sit there in awe, listening to these amazing musicians, barely believing that I was playing with them. Bombay changed my life,” he says.
While Rajeev’s foray into Indian classical music began here, as a flautist he was exploring far different worlds. Largely self-taught, except for two years under an Indian classical flautist, Rajeev says his wide musical tastes have educated him. He counts among his idols, rock music flautist Ian Anderson of Jethro Tull, jazz flautist Hubert Laws, Western classical flautist Jean-Pierre Rampal, and India’s own Hariprasad Chaurasia. All these streams blend into the sound that Rajeev says defines the Rajeev Raja Combine. “I’ve had this sound in my head for 30 years; it’s only now that I’ve begun to realise it with this band.”
Alongside his music, for 25 years, Rajeev maintained a flourishing career in advertising. “At every job, I would tell my interviewers that my music meant as much to me as work, that rehearsals and concerts would all be a part of my life, without compromising my career responsibilities.” Juggling the two also meant that the principles of one fed into the other, for teamwork, collaboration and building off team members’ ideas were as integral to music as to advertising. In 2012 though, Rajeev quit as national creative director of DDB Mudra and plunged full-time into music.
All of these myriad influences come together in Cosmic Chant. The Combine comprises Hitesh Dhutiya on guitars, JD on bass, Chandana Bala on Carnatic Vocals, Vaibhav Wavikar on drums and Vinayak Netke on tabla. “The sound we were seeking was not one that paid lip-service to fusion with disparate elements hanging loose, but one which created an organic whole of the sum of our influences, right from the compositional stage onward.” Through eight tracks, that range from the rock music genre (‘Grunge’) and ballads (‘Nightingale Song’), to funk-rock (‘Friday Night Funk’) and smooth jazz (‘Mulligan’s Mood’), all laced with Indian Carnatic vocals and tabla, Rajeev’s dream has been realised. The compositions span from his earliest ever, named ‘Peace’, now dedicated to his wife, to more recent collaborations with Hitesh. 'Mulligan’s Mood' for instance was written in 1982, while Rajeev studied for his college final exams and happened to listen to Jerry Mulligan on the saxophone, when this tune popped into his mind

Cosmic Chant was released last October and has since done well for itself on online platforms, earning the Combine several gigs across the country. In the meantime Rajeev is busy with BrandMusiq, a company he’s floated that specialises in sonic branding, which creates a consolidated sound for brands, replete with a ‘mogo’ (musical logo) that can be adapted for any medium from television to radio. “This keeps me in touch with the marketing space besides providing an income, for the music doesn’t pay, just yet.” But that doesn’t matter for Rajeev admits that his music will always be niche. “We’re committed to creating an indie sound that’s artistically meaningful, with a depth of musical experience. Bollywood will continue to get the crowds and the money; but we’re in this for the long haul.”

SC rejects plea seeking action against police
","The Supreme Court on Friday rejected a contempt petition filed by an advocate against the Kerala police for not registering an FIR against the Mata Amritanandamayi Math after a former inmate wrote a book alleging sexual abuse at the math.
A Bench of Justices Ranjan Gogoi and Madan B. Lokur dismissed the plea after K.K. Venugopal, appearing for Kerala, submitted that no cognisance could be taken on the basis of statements made in the book (
Holy Hel
l).
In his contempt petition, Deepak Prakash alleged that the “rape” happened in a religious place and the victim was a foreign national. He said he had lodged a complaint with the police after the victim sent him a mail corroborating the averments in the book for registration of an FIR. Mr. Prakash said the Karunagappally police on February 26 refused to register an FIR. He said he forwarded the complaint to the Police Commissioner and the DGP for immediate action.
He said: “Unfortunately, because of political pressure, till date, no action has been taken. This amounts to collapse of law and order and violation of the apex court judgment in the Lalita Kumar case, in which the court mandated registration of FIR on receipt of complaint.” The petitioner said the police was duty-bound to register an FIR and investigate the matter.
The petitioner wanted the apex court to initiate contempt proceedings against Justin John, SHO, Karunagappally police station, Kollam; Debesh Kumar Behera, Kollam Police Commissioner; DGP K.S. Balasubramaian, and Principal Home Secretary L. Radhakrishnan.
Mr. Prakash said: “It is true that she has revealed her bad experience through her book and even after 15 years, the revelations amount to a clear case of rape in captivity. When the media asked her about the delay, the victim had said that it took years for her to overcome the mental trauma and write a book on the ordeal . Moreover, the Indian judicial system takes many years to complete the legal procedures.”

Chennai blasts probe: NIA is on board, says Jayalalithaa
","Denying >reports that the Tamil Nadu government had rejected the offer of help from the National Investigation Agency (NIA) for investigating the May Day twin blasts on board the Bangalore-Guwahati Express at the Chennai Central railway station, Chief Minister Jayalalithaa said here on Friday that experts from the agency had reached Tamil Nadu to study the scene of crime.
In a statement here, Ms. Jayalalithaa said that on Thursday, to an offer made by a middle-level Union Home Ministry official to send bomb-disposal squads or bomb-defusing equipment, the State Home Secretary replied that Tamil Nadu would seek help, if required. “I would like to say that NIA experts well versed in cracking bomb blast cases have come to inspect the blast site,” she said.
Explaining the efforts made by the Tamil Nadu Police after the blasts that killed a young woman, Ms. Jayalalithaa said camera footage from all stops of the train from Bangalore to Chennai Central was being analysed to find out the place where the explosives were planted. “Preliminary inquiries have shown that the bomb may have had a timer device,” she said.
She had ordered an inquiry by the State Crime Branch-CID.
The possibility of the blasts occurring in Andhra Pradesh had the train run on schedule was also being looked into.

Book love in the time of cinema
","Such are the accelerated times we live in that I wondered, in a moment of panic, if this essay might be too late. It was spurred by the demise of Gabriel García Márquez on the afternoon of 17 April, a Thursday. But that was fifteen days ago. On Friday, as the news reached these shores, my Facebook timeline was filled with sad reminiscences about yellow butterflies and perfumed crows. A day later, however, the week’s big Bollywood release, 2 States, had begun “trending” – even Márquez had to give way to Bhagat.
Imagine the irony. The author who kept reminding us of the vastness of time – those one hundred years of solitude; the bachelor who, after nine decades, decided to gift himself an adolescent virgin; the lifetime that Florentino Ariza spent waiting for Fermina Daza – was, post mortem, resuscitated in the social media for a mere twenty-four hours.
Authors die, but they leave behind work that lives forever. There can, therefore, never be a too-late tribute to Márquez, who, with Nabokov, went to war against the distressing modern-day tendency to view language as a loincloth, a functional invention that went about its job in the least ostentatious manner. Language, to these writers, was a queen’s wardrobe of silks, and they celebrated its riches lavishly.
We are advised, for instance, that alliteration is bad. Nabokov gave us, in successive sentences in Lolita, “globules of gonadal glow” and “Canoeing, Coranting, Combing Curls in the lakeside sun,” and Márquez, when recalling the first man Fermina Daza heard urinate, spoke of the “sound of his stallion’s stream.” I could carry on in this vein, but this is a column about cinema and it may be more pertinent to change tracks and revisit that old question: Can a movie hope to capture the essence of a book, especially when language is such a crucial component of the book’s essence?
Márquez didn’t think so. He said, in an interview, “I can’t think of any one film that improved on a good novel, but I can think of many good films that came from very bad novels.” Still, if we replace the question “Is this film a good adaptation of the book?” with “How does this director go about adapting this book?” – in other words, if we replace judgement with inquiry – the movie may end up worthwhile after all, if not an exact reproduction of the book, then perhaps a version of the book, one that exists honourably in a parallel dimension.

Lolita is certainly one of those films for me, and its opening scene is among my favourite of all time. The book opens with the famous words: “Lolita, light of my life, fire of my loins. My sin, my soul.” The movie opens with a man’s hand applying nail polish on a woman’s toes over a swooning piano score. Humbert Humbert’s devotion to Lolita, his servitude, his thralldom to her beauty, his helplessness, his obsession, his intent to shape her in the image he carries inside his perverted head – the themes of the novel are all here, in under two minutes. Even if we don’t hear the words “light of my life, fire of my loins,” we sense them.
Márquez, I think, would have approved of this film. At least, he would have been happier with Kubrick’s struggle with Nabokov than with Mike Newell’s attempt to put Love in the Time of Cholera on screen. Márquez’s first chapter is ostensibly about the death of Dr. Juvenal Urbino, but it is also about so much else: the scent of bitter almonds, a corpse under investigation, the old slave quarter, the parrot that learned to speak French like an academician, Fermina Daza’s loss of the doe’s gait of her younger years, the couple’s “trivial everyday miseries,” and a few dozen other things, including Schubert’s Death and the Maiden.
A film that stayed faithful to all these details would never end, and yet, it’s in what the filmmaker chooses to keep and what he leaves out that we get a glimpse of the film’s eventual success or failure. Newell opens with the parrot on a tree. Dr. Urbino climbs a ladder. He falls. He dies. Where Kubrick gave us mood, Newell gives us plot. A queen’s wardrobe is reduced to a loincloth.

2030 India will see massive housing crunch
","What should set alarm bells ringing for urban developers and policymakers is the data released by the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) that says more than 70 per cent of the buildings that should stand in India by 2030 are yet to be built.
According to CSE executive director (Research and Advocacy) Anumita Roychowdhury, while in the United Kingdom 80 per cent of the building stock that will stand there in 2050 has already been built, India is lagging behind with a mind boggling number of 70 per cent of the buildings, that includes homes, offices and commercial establishments, not being constructed.
“What is worrisome is that Indian cities use more of precious water and energy and generate massive amounts of waste. The construction boon can be a bane as unfettered growth can have a damaging impact. In India, buildings are responsible for 40 per cent of the energy use, 30 per cent of the raw material use, 20 per cent of water use and 20 per cent of land use. At the same time, they generate 40 per cent of carbon emissions, 30 per cent of solid waste generation and 20 per cent of water effluents. With almost 70 per cent of the building stock in India yet to come up, the country is looking ahead to a critical situation.”
As a major destination point for real estate, the National Capital Region will be particularly affected. Therefore, the CSE has stressed the need to see the scalability of the buildings that have to be constructed.
“At homes, we have to use our air conditioners judiciously. With more and more homes using air conditioners, the challenge is not to become energy guzzlers. High performance buildings will require good insulation. Poorly insulated buildings severely effect the efficiency of air conditioning units and are high energy losses,” said Ms. Roychowdhury, while conducting a two-day workshop on “Urbanscapes: How sustainable are our buildings and cities”. The CSE has stressed the need for conducting workshops for the benefit of architects, engineers and prospective owners of flats so that they can understand the energy-saving strategies for constructing homes.
Pointing out that traditional wisdom needs to be kept in mind while constructing buildings, Ms. Roychowdhury said only one per cent of Delhi’s population lives in Lutyens’ Delhi and the urban boom in terms of housing and commercialisation has taken place on the periphery of the city. “Therefore, people living in East Delhi have to travel long distances. We have congested places like the Chawri Bazar and scantily populated areas like Aurangzeb Road.”
Citing another example, she said cities like Chennai, which have hot humid climate, do not require air tight glass buildings. “However, quite a few tight glass buildings in Chennai are being constructed. It is important to understand that we do not require 100 per cent air conditioned buildings. A fine example is the traditional Chettinad homes which have sufficient cross-ventilation. A big verandah is a common feature in every traditional home there,” she added.

Poor vigil poses threat to railway passengers
","Even as intelligence sleuths alert police over possible terrorist attacks on railway stations and infiltration through trains, no foolproof measures have been taken to enhance vigil at busy stations.
In 2013, the Intelligence wing had cautioned the State Police against suspected terror groups targeting public places, particularly railway stations and had even pointed out that a ‘recce’ had been done on the Vijayawada railway station.
Subsequently, the Railways, Government Railway Police (GRP), Railway Protection Force (RPF) and the civil police were told to install surveillance cameras at parking lots, lounges, canteens, ticket and enquiry counters. They were also directed to streamline checking at entrances to railway stations. However, the directive was not properly complied with.
The GRP took several Bangladeshi nationals into custody at the Rajahmundry railway station for travelling without visa and related documents last year.
In fact, an Intelligence Bureau official had cautioned the railway authorities and police against infiltration through trains from neighbouring countries. “On information, we checked the Bangladeshi passengers at the Rajahmundry railway station, and we found that they were travelling without valid documents,” said Vijayawada Division GRP Superintendent of Police Ch. Syam Prasad. The Nagayalanka police arrested a Bangladeshi national in Krishna district in June last year. Police seized more than 2,000 gelatin sticks and wire bundles at the Guntur railway station late last year, but the case was undetected. In June, 2013, the Vijayawada City Police seized Pakistani currency, which was smuggled into India through trains. Two persons were arrested in this connection. “Owing to poor vigil, trains and railway stations have become targets for anti-social elements. We request the government to install more CC cameras and sanction the required staff to step up vigil at stations and on trains,” Mr. Syam Prasad said.

Love in the time of apps
","Long distance relationships. LDR. Whatever you call them, they still tend to suck most of the fun out of life. Here are a few apps that might help keep the spark in your relationship alive, unless of course, you are a firm believer of the adage, “Out of sight, out of mind.”

Couple

This app is a private way to utilise social media just for the two of you. You can have you own timeline using it to share photos, videos, voice notes, sketches and stickers. It also has a calendar — for those dates you just have to remember — and a feature that lets you both sketch simultaneously on the same screen in real time. Two of its best features, though, are: ThumbKiss, that lets you touch the same spot on your phones to make them both vibrate simultaneously and Thinking of You, that lets you tell your significant other how much you miss them and how often.

Handwritten

This app is the perfect way to blend today’s technology with that of writing long love letters. Handwritten, specifically for iPad users, allows you to personalise your mail by letting you compose the letter in your own handwriting. Use of a stylus is recommended.

Red Stamp

So you screwed up. And now he/she is sulking. This app might not earn you forgiveness, but it’ll help to partly make up for your boo-boo. Personalise a card and post it on Facebook, email, tweet, or text it to that special someone. Red Stamp can also print a high-end, eco-friendly paper postcard or luxe paper card and mail it in a coloured envelope to the recipient. Useful for birthdays, anniversaries or just to surprise your significant other. Major brownie points to be earned, y’all.

Voxer

Voxer, as someone very rightly put it, is a messaging app on steroids. Not only does it offer you everything a typical texting platform does, it also lets you use it like a walkie-talkie. You can send voice messages as well — they are all saved so you can play them back later. So it’s like a personal line just for the two of you. Beats a couple of cups and a really, really long thread.

Relationship Lovers Counter

‘So when’s your anniversary?’
‘June. No, wait, July. Or was it January?’
If you empathise with the above predicament, this app is here to save you a major fight or two. It keeps a track of how many days are left for your anniversary, even informing you if it’s a one-month or a silver jubilee. It comes with a love meter that rates your relationship on a scale of one to 10 (Hmmm, not sure if that is a good thing, though). And if you’re the kind of couple that likes making others uncomfortable, this app has a Twitter and Facebook connector to help you share the love on social media. Aww. Cho chweet.

SC asks Centre to furnish information on black money
","The Supreme Court on Thursday directed the Centre to disclose >all the information it received from Germany on 26 individuals who had stashed away their black money in LGT Bank, Liechtenstein.
On Tuesday, Solicitor-General Mohan Parasaran >disclosed the names of 18 persons to Ram Jethmalani, who is the petitioner. However, the list did not contain details of the amount each individual had invested. Information of 26 persons was given by the government in sealed covers.
Mr. Parasaran said of the 12 trusts that involved 26 individuals, investigation in 18 cases had been concluded by the Income Tax department and prosecutions had been launched in 17 cases (as one person is dead). The SG said investigations on eight other persons found no evidence of tax evasion in terms of Indian laws. He added that their names were in the second sealed envelope, and its contents weren’t shared with the petitioner.
A three-judge Bench of Justices H.L. Dattu and Ranjana Desai and Madan Lokur told the SG that it would decide on disclosing the contents of sealed covers.
When hearing resumed on Thursday the Bench passed a brief order directing the Union government to furnish all the details to Mr. Jethmalani within three days. Sources said the Centre had raised a demand of about Rs. 40 crore as income tax from the individuals against whom the probe was completed.
The Bench also appointed former apex court Judge M.B. Shah as Chairman of the Special Investigation Team, following the inability expressed by Justice B.P. Jeevan Reddy to head the SIT. The Bench appointed retired apex court judge Arijit Pasayat as vice-chairman of the SIT.
The Bench reiterated the order passed by the court in July 2011 specifying the terms of reference for the SIT.
The order said, “The SIT shall take over the matter of investigation of the individuals whose names have been disclosed by Germany as having accounts in banks in Liechtenstein and expeditiously conduct the same. The SIT shall review and assess whether investigations have been properly conducted before concluding if there is a need for further investigation.”
The Bench said, “The SIT shall also be charged with the responsibility of preparing a comprehensive action plan, including the creation of necessary institutional structures that can enable and strengthen the country’s battle against generation of unaccounted monies and their stashing away in foreign banks or in various forms domestically. The SIT shall be charged with the responsibilities and duties of investigation, initiation of proceedings and prosecution, whether in the context of appropriate criminal or civil proceedings of all issues relating to the matters concerning and arising from unaccounted monies of Hassan Ali Khan and the Tapurias. All other matters with respect to unaccounted monies being stashed in foreign banks by Indians or other entities operating in India may arise in the course of such investigations and proceedings.” The Bench asked the SIT to file periodic status reports to the court.
The Bench directed the Centre to issue notification on the constitution of the SIT within three weeks and posted the matter for further hearing on August 20.

Auto drivers demand water point, loo at stands
","Though the recent fare hike has alleviated their financial concerns, autorickshaw drivers said problems of parking spots, scholarships for their children and life insurance coverage still remain.
At the annual meet of Dakshina Kannada Zilla Autorickshaw Chalakara Sangha (ARCS) at Town Hall here on Tuesday, Alphonse D’Souza, president of the association, said the district administration should establish autorickshaw parks with basic amenities in the city.
Out of the 320 points where autorickshaws stand, the district administration had only recognised 140, he said. “None of the autorickshaw stands have lavatory facilities or drinking water facilities. This is a problem for both drivers and passengers,” Mr. D’Souza said, and added that the organisation demanded facilities be developed at 50 autorickshaw parks. Insurance — both as government schemes and from the Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) — remains a concern for the autorickshaw drivers. Mr. D’Souza said enrolment into the State government’s accident relief scheme had been stopped due to technical faults at Nemmadi Kendra.
Similarly, though the organisation had more than 1,000 members, only 410 members have insurance from LIC, said Subhash Kavoor, secretary of ARCS. “The government should enrol more drivers under the LIC’s Aam Aadmi Yojana,” he said.
Another major demand presented at the meet was an increase in scholarships given through LIC for the children of autorickshaw drivers. At present, children get Rs. 1,200 per year between class 9 and till the completion of pre-university college as scholarship. “LIC has limited the scholarships to just 15 per cent of the applications received. Until three years, it was 100 per cent,” said Prakash V.N, the general secretary of ARCS.
The association also sought a drive against those illegally plying in the city; regulating those who rent out autorickshaws to drivers for high rent; and supply of uniforms at a concession.

Man, not sartorially challenged
","Twenty-two-year-old Arjun Gupta is disgruntled with the inadequate selection of ties in his wardrobe; he almost chokes at the thought of looking unkempt at a social occasion. To him, dressing suavely is a way of life and is not just a matter of choice anymore. And he is not alone. A rising number of Indian men today are making conscious sartorial choices. Men are embracing the wide variety of ensembles that are available in the retail clothing market. A few years ago, however, not many would follow suit. “Twenty years ago we didn’t have a steady fashion industry; let alone men and their fashion sensibilities. We’ve evolved from an era where men would go to a tailor for a three-piece suit to pairing their high street trousers with designer shirts. They are experimenting with their wardrobe choices,” says designer JJ Valaya who is also a founding member of the Fashion Design Council of India (FDCI). In the last few years, there has been a paradigm shift in the Indian menswear industry. Few aspects of this shift however, haven’t been seemingly obvious.

The Evolution

“There are two parallels to the evolution of the Indian menswear market. The first one is the ready-to-wear menswear market that has taken the same path as the rest of the Indian menswear industry. The second one is the wedding market. Here’s where we see a major shift. We’re witnessing a more traditional wedding market where men are investing in customary Indian clothing for a wedding ,” elaborates Valaya. Menswear in India is not heavily influenced just by the international markets and Bollywood. Today, we are tracing our steps back to heritage Indian clothing. The demand for traditional Jodhpurs, bandhgalas and Nehru jackets has been more than ever. Market experts say that the demand for suits for a wedding has almost died. Agrees designer Raghavendra Rathore, who is noted for his signature Bandhgala designs, “Nehru style jacket worn over kurta; embroidered waistcoats with Jodhpuri pants, strategically embroidered shirts and jackets embellished bundies and Bandgala jackets in vibrant shades is more widely accepted in order to look different yet classic,” says Rathore.
This revolution comes only with increased awareness and accessibility. “The possibilities are infinite when it comes to styling. We also have a lot of options for accessories. The introduction of multinational clothing brands has only been a positive addition because men don’t need to travel to far off countries to shop for international brands anymore,” says Valaya.

The Modern Consumer

The advent of fashion magazines and Internet has contributed to this widespread sartorial awareness. The new media and the emergence of the fine dining culture too has encouraged us to go out more often than usual and been instrumental in bringing about this awareness. The average Indian man’s attention has shifted from making safe style choices to the intricacies. “They are more careful about the detailing now. We’ve grown from a point where the style sense of a man was limited to a classic blue shirt and khaki pants to this coming-of-age modern consumer who is more aware . He is not afraid to throw on a linen shirt with a printed tie,” says Nikhil Mehra of the Shantanu and Nikhil designer duo, who have been instrumental in amalgamating Indian heritage with western sensibilities through their designs.
It is no wonder then that fashion weeks in India too reserve a 20 per cent slot just to showcase menswear.

The Future

Where exactly do we see this market heading?
“The menswear industry is speeding ahead with a higher percentage of retail investment in this market. Although, it is necessary that we focus on making menswear more accessible and available in tier II cities because there is a growing demand,” believes Mehra. While accessibility of major brands remains questionable in a lot of Indian cities, the demand for them remains high. The market remains untapped in the smaller metropolises in India. Prolific brand strategies and an increase in the number of store franchises are areas that the marketers need to focus on. “70 per cent of the retail market today is menswear and we need a firm stage to display that. In addition, we also need more places dedicated to just menswear just like Aditya Birla Group’s multi-brand venture The Collective,” says Valaya. While the growth of the Indian menswear industry has been great, the industry needs investments to further augment this growth.

Menacing men with arms of clay
","Arasu, the manager of Illusions, a popular nightclub on R.K. Salai, has a name for the bouncer manning its door: ‘Another door.’
“You talk to the door, if the door is okay, then you get in,” Arasu declares proudly. The bouncer manning the door, who has overheard his boss’s comment, allows himself a nervous smile: it is eight in the evening and his day has just begun.
Once the sun has set over Chennai, it is often the bouncer who stands like a mountain of muscle between the most happening people and the most happening places in the city. As the alcohol begins to flow, people’s behaviour becomes unpredictable and these men, trained to gauge people, become alert.
“It’s all about guest management and having the presence of mind to identify trouble even before it crops up,” says Deena, who has been a bouncer with Pasha for the past six years. 
Customers showing up to a club drunk; a group of men seeking entry into a night club without the company of women; being too loud and arrogant even before getting past the front doors — these are some of the problems bouncers have to deal with even before the best remixes of the night are played.
“A few drinks down, even a gentleman creates trouble on some nights,” says Arasu, who depends on his bouncer to be his security blanket when he deals with his unruly clients. “He might be a small guy or he might be a big shot, but ego will be the same. None of these guys want to mess with me when I have a six feet tall guy with bulging muscles backing me up though.”
Most bouncers haven’t had the chance to finish school and come from a variety of backgrounds. With an interest in physical fitness and body building, being physically intimidating is a prerequisite to being a bouncer. On the face of it, he may seem to wield enormous clout and be able to decide for some people, the course of their Saturday night, but he has a tough job on his hands, one that brings unforeseen challenges his way every evening.
“I was once stopped and cornered by four guys when I was heading back home at 2 a.m.,” says the bouncer of a popular resto-bar in Chennai, asking not to be named because he does not want his wife to find out about his profession. “It’s okay though, I can handle up to five to six guys at a time, and it’s only when there are more than that, that I need to call for back-up,” says the bouncer, confessing to carrying a few weapons with him at all times.
“A drunk customer might challenge a bouncer to a fight, but most bouncers are trained to handle such situations sensibly. It’s a tough task, I must say. Sometimes when things get out of hand and I step in to handle the situation, they challenge me to a fight too,” says Muthu, head of security at Pasha. “But usually all this ends with the night. Come dawn, all is well again.”
With customers inebriated and incapable of making sound decisions, disputes between people, disagreements regarding the bill and general misunderstandings are an everyday occurrence. With time, most bouncers build a relationship with their guests and can often get their customers to listen to them. When things do get out of hand, the manager steps in to exercise his authority and deal with the situation as manhandling a high profile customer is not something a bouncer can risk.
“Once a guy got hold of my collar,” says Rajesh, who has been guarding the door of 10 Downing Street for over a year now. “Most threats made are empty though and the next time he came to the club, he apologised and we made peace, and that’s the way it usually happens.” Now a father of two, fearless Rajesh knows he has to watch his step. “If we get hurt while trying to stop a fight, we shouldn’t make a big deal out of that, that’s just part of the job.”
Not all occupational hazards of a bouncer involve the clenched fist. “I have many female friends who come here often. When they’ve had enough to drink, they sometimes insist I dance with them, but I have to politely decline because I am working,” says Rajesh.
While women don’t usually create trouble that is difficult to handle, trouble is often created when people want to ensure they are safe and not subject to any sort of manhandling. “Even if a girl slips, they assume she is drunk and some men think they can approach her. We usually notice men with such intentions and keep an eye on them,” says bouncer Soundar of 10 Downing Street.
Married for 20 years and a father of two, Soundar often sees people as old as his children visit the nightclub, but he would never allow his own to ever visit one. “Culturally, we are very different. My son is almost 20 years old now and to date, I’ve not even let him go to the beach by himself,” says Soundar, 40, who looks atypical for a bouncer with 
vibuthi on his forehead on a busy Sunday night.
Having only studied till Standard 8, he wanted to ensure that his children received a college education and proudly announces that both his children are now looking to pursue their Masters’ degree. “Every day I give my son Rs. 10 or maybe Rs. 15 for his expenses, not because I don’t have the money to give, but because I’ve taken care of everything he needs,” says Soundar, who gives his daughter Rs. 5 for her daily needs.
Most of these men — needless to say — come from humble backgrounds, earning anything between Rs. 6,000 and Rs. 15,000 a month. The biggest perks of the job are that they get to rub shoulders with the rich and the famous — apart from receiving tips from people who spend the equivalent of a bouncer’s salary on one night’s revelry.
“When a big political figure wraps his arms around you and talks to you, while hundreds of people outside are waiting for his attention, how can it not make you feel really happy?” asks bouncer Deena with a wide smile.

Total exports of mangoes from India in 2012-13 added up to only 55,584.98 tonnes (according to data from the Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority), and it is unlikely that the figure would go up to 70,000 tonnes this year.”

Police blame NHAI for increase in accidents
","The Tumkur district police have blamed the National Highways Authority of India for the increase in the number of accidents on national highways in the district as they say the NHAI has failed to provide the required infrastructure.
The police have identified 71 “black spots” on the three national highways passing through the district (36 “black spots” on the Bangalore-Pune National Highway; 29 on the Bangalore-Shimoga National Highway; and six on the Bangalore-Mangalore National Highway).
According to the police, in the last three years 1,469 people have been killed and 6,304 people injured in 5,844 accidents in the district.

Fatal accidentsIn 2011, 107 fatal accidents took place on Bangalore-Pune National Highway, 67 on Bangalore-Shimoga National Highway and 37 on Bangalore-Mangalore National Highway. While in 2012, the figures were 92, 71 and 45, in 2013, they were 106, 84 and 40 on these national highways, respectively.
According to the police, the NHAI has not not provided signboards to warn commuters. Even speed bumps and blinkers have not been provided.
Further, the police said, appropriate steps had not been taken at intersections and near village approach roads.
At many places, people walk across the highway as there are no underpasses or footbridges, leading to accidents, sources in the police said.
Referring to an accident that took place near Heggare on April 20 when a motorist died on the spot after colliding with a KSRTC bus, Additional Superintendent of Police R. Lakshman, told The Hindu,
“We registered a case against the engineer of the NHAI on April 20 for failing to take action to prevent accidents near Heggare on Bangalore-Mangalore National Highway.”
In January 2014, a meeting of the police and officials of the NHAI was held in which they were told to provide the required infrastructure.
Mr. Lakshman said that though they had promised to take action within a month, nothing had surfaced.
Assistant Executive Engineer of Bangalore-Shimoga National Highway Benjamin Samuel said that “if we lay speed bumps on this national highway, it will cause inconvenience to long-distance commuters and hence, we have to see the points and then take a decision on it.”
He said that signboards at some points had been put up and if additional signboards were required, which would be provided shortly.
Mr. Samuel said he was not aware of the police having registered a case against the NHAI officer. He said that he would speak with the officer about the issue.
An official from the NHAI told The Hindu, “Every day people of nearby villages open the median to cross the road, making it difficult to keep a watch and close it immediately.”
He said that they had responded to the Police Department and the remaining work would be completed shortly.

Palk Strait sees its first Kayak crossing since 1935
","The Palk Strait witnessed its first Kayak crossing since 1935 and Sandra Helen Robson, an Australian sea kayaker became the first woman to paddle across.
The 46-year-old Robson, who was kayaking from Germany to Australia, became the first woman kayaker to paddle across the Palk Strait on Thursday evening after circumnavigating Sri Lanka as part of her expedition, which began in 2011.
“I am pretty happy that I became the first kayaker to paddle across the Palk Strait after German canoeist Oskar Speck had achieved the feat in 1935,” she told reporters after touching the shore at 4.15 p.m. here.
She left Talaimannar at 6. 45 a.m. and touched the shore at 4.15 p.m., paddling for nearly nine hours. She was escorted up to the International Maritime Boundary Line (IMBL) by Lankan Navy and from there by the personnel of Mandapam Station of Indian Coast Guard, she said.
Retracing Speck’s journey from Germany to Australia (1932-1939), she began her solo kayaking from Ulm in Germany in May 2011. Last year she arrived in Mandapam from Gujarat after paddling her way in the western coasts and reached Vedaranyam.
Ms. Robson took a break at Vedaranyam to paddle around Sri Lanka, but had to wait for three weeks in Chennai for getting permission for paddling from Danushkodi to Sri Lanka and return. The authorities were too busy with the general elections and there was no sign of permission, she said. As she was running out of time, she flew to Sri Lanka on March 21 to circumnavigate Sri Lankan and cross the Palk Strait to reach Danushkodi. She took 33 days to paddle around the island nation and it was in this expedition, she had the longest paddling of 109 km non-stop, she told The Hindu.
Ms. Robson who had paddled to the southeast coast of India was planning to cover the east coast and the northeast in the third and fourth stages.
“I will set out for 13 months to paddle through Bangladesh, Myanmar, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia,” she said, adding she has planned to end her expedition in Australia in September 2016.
Her mentor had covered about 50,000 km, but she would end up with about 23, 000 km when she reached Australia as she could not paddle in the Middle East and did not get permission to paddle in Pakistan and some parts of India, she said.
Jehan Driver from the team of Quest Expeditions, which sponsored Robson’s journey in India, received her when she reached the shore here.

Rationalists oppose, NIMHANS concurs
","Agreeing to the objections raised by Mangalore-based Federation of Indian Rationalist Associations, Bangalore-based NIMHANS has cancelled a scheduled event on its premises.
In an open letter to NIMHANS Director, P. Satishchandra, copies of which were released to the press, president of the Federation Narendra Nayak had objected to renting out the NIMHANS convention centre for holistic karma healing planned for May 11. Acting quickly, Mr. Satishchandra has cancelled the event.
Mr. Nayak had asked whether karmic influences have any role in neurological disorders and said the NIMHANS Convention Centre has been rented out to an activity which goes totally against and in fact denies evidence-based medicine. He had urged the director to reconsider the permission granted pointing out the 2004 judgment of the Supreme Court which stated that unrecognised, not evidence-based so called “therapies” should not be given any sort of recognition or support by the government. NIMHANS being a government-funded body was covered by this definition, he said.
Dr. Satishchandra said he fully agreed with the contention of the rationalist and had called the organisers of the event and offered to refund the entire amount. He said the venue was booked “like a chowlty” (without his prior knowledge). He had acted the moment it was brought to his notice.
It was the philosophy of NIMHANS not to allow such psychological healing on its campus. “We cannot allow such spiritual thing,” he said.

The ‘cost’ of urban living
","What does living in the world’s second most populous city mean for your mind and body?
While the Capital’s graph on its health status and environmental well-being doesn’t read too well, healthcare providers say that physical health takes a hit due to being exposed to high pollution levels, unhealthy eating habits, shrinking green spaces, harsh weather and the stress of making a living.
Establishing a strong link between rising pollution levels in the Capital and the resulting health problems, Centre for Science and Environment (Research and Advocacy) executive director Anumita Roychowdhury said: “Despite the several measures being taken to control air pollution levels, Delhi has gone back to the pre-CNG days. We are seeing dangerously high levels of air and noise pollution, and sadly we are now dealing with multiple pollutants known to cause cardiac and respiratory problems and long-term exposure can lead to cancer and metabolic problems.”
“Current data [which is still under investigation] suggests that expecting mothers who have been exposed to high levels of air pollution or are living near roads [where there is constant exposure to vehicular pollution] have babies with reduced brain size,” Ms. Roychowdhury added.

Research study

It is, however, not the physical well-being alone that takes a hit.
A research study on urban mental health by the Indian Council of Medical Research has indicated that city life, with its work and social stress, has resulted in an increase in the number of people suffering from psychiatric illnesses and sub-syndromes like headache, tension and insomnia.
Fortis Hospital’s Mental Health and Behavioural Sciences director Samir Parikh said: “Urban living increases stress because of the kind of lifestyle, poor work-life balance and lack of support systems.”
Meanwhile, speaking about the changed diet of the urban population, Indian Dietetic Association president Rekha Sharma explained: “For over 99 per cent of the urban population, the city offers very limited space for exercise, which added with our vastly changed dietary habits is very dangerous for the physical well-being of the people.”
“Gone for urban dwellers is the opportunity and access to eat a variety of grains, including maize, millet, ragi, etc., and wholegrain foods. Instead, we are forced to use fine carbohydrates, extensively processed calorie dense foods and even the type of fats we eat now have changed. Today we consume higher percentage of saturated fats. This, over the years, has seen a rise in lifestyle-related diseases in a much younger population.”

Lapses make them vulnerable
","A visit to the major railways stations here following the blasts in Chennai on Thursday morning revealed various lapses in the security set-up. Though a number of measures have been initiated by way of deployment of personnel and equipment to prevent terror strikes, the Capital’s stations remain as vulnerable as ever.
At each of the New Delhi railway station’s six entry points — three from Ajmeri Gate side and three from Paharganj side — there is a baggage scanner and a metal detector manned by police personnel. A spot visit from the Ajmeri Gate side revealed that the main baggage scanner at platform number 16 was not functional. When the rush was less, security personnel deployed at the gate were seen letting passengers in without frisking. However, they started frisking them once the crowds grew.
The other baggage scanners were functional, but the security personnel seemed lax in checking passengers. Upon entering the station from Paharganj side, the careless attitude of the personnel was once again on display. They simply sat next to the baggage scanners and metal detectors, two of which were out of order.
While there are six designated entry/exit points to the railway station, there are other points of entry and exit too. Another baffling sight was to see the public walking across the tracks from adjacent areas like Tilak Bridge and Shivaji Bridge. No policeman was seen patrolling these open areas.
When asked, the personnel said that it was a tough job to check thousands of passengers each day.
“Thousands of commuters board trains from the New Delhi railway station each day. How much can we check each person? If we start checking thoroughly, passengers start getting impatient and fight over the delay in boarding their train. If people want better security, they need to co-operate with us,” said a personnel deployed at the New Delhi station platform.
The situation was the same at Hazrat Nizamuddin railway station.
However, security arrangements at Old Delhi railway station were marginally better. The station has four entry and exit points — two from the Chandni Chowk side and two from the Kashmere Gate side. All baggage scanners and metal detectors were functioning. However, the station does not have walls stretching beyond the platforms — as is the case with the New Delhi station too. Anyone can enter the station premises from nearby localities.
“This station is more vulnerable due to its location, as anyone coming from Chandni Chowk, Old Delhi or nearby areas can enter the premises from the adjoining roads. On an average, we discover three bodies on the tracks each day,” said a police officer deployed at the Old Delhi railway station.

She was also beaten when she threatened to report the matter to the police.
When the victim returned home and informed her parents, they initially preferred silence given the stigma.
However, news spread after the alleged rapists began to loiter around her house. When relatives and friends tried to catch the culprits, they slipped away. Sent for medical exam Members of the community then persuaded the family to take the girl to the Sardhana police station.

The matter relates to alleged stone-pelting by MNS workers at a Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) bus on the Jalna-Aurangabad road on October 20, 2008, near the Shekta village in Maharashtra. The driver of the bus, Ibrahim Shaikh, later lodged a police complaint after which a case was registered against Mr. Thackeray and six others.
However, Mr. Thackeray did not attend court proceedings and filed an application before the Judicial Magistrate seeking exemption from being present in court due to election campaigning.

Crafting a new legacy
","In the Fifties, two brothers settled in Manacaud near the Fort area. The brothers, T.N. Kochu Kunju Achari (1890-1960) and his younger brother T.N. Padmanabhan Achari (1893-1987), hailed from the famed Edavancaud family of Cheriyanad village in Chengannur taluk. They were not new to the city, as both of them had visited and stayed in the Fort, working in their capacity as the kottaram moothacharis.
As chief craftsmen to the Travancore royal family, members of the Edavancaud Chattoth Thiruvambadi family were truly the nobles among the traditional Vishwakarma clan.
The title of Edavankadu Achari was given to the eldest male members of the family; they attended to all the major construction and religious activities concerning the royal family of erstwhile Travancore. The members of the family were also the head craftsmen of the Subramanya temple of Harippad. The renovation works of the ancient temple were carried out under the order of the then Maharaja of Travancore Sree Moolam Thirunal Rama Varma. The works, which commenced in 1920s, was carried out by T.N. Kochu Kunju Achari, his younger brother T.N. Padmanabhan Achari and their cousin G. Padmanabhan Achari (Padmanabhan Achari was the maternal grandfather of Jagathy Sreekumar).
However, what made the fame of the brothers spread far and wide were the life size and miniature wooden figurines of Kathakali characters they created. According to P. Neelakantan Achari, the youngest son of T.N. Padmanabhan Achari, it was Sethu Parvathy Bai, the Amma Maharani of the royal family of Travancore, who asked his father and his brother to craft the Kathakali figures.
She asked the craftsmen to observe the Kathakali plays that were staged for the royals. Following her order, the brothers went to Fort Palace complex and closely studied the Kathakali artistes.
They made detailed sketches of the characters and their costumes and attire. The sketches formed a base for their carvings in ‘kumbil’ wood.
The royal family of Travancore owned many of the masterpieces made by the brothers. The life-size Kathakali figures made by the brothers are now exhibited in Kowdiar Palace, Pattom Palace, Kuthira Malika and Napier museum, as well as in various museums across the country and around the world. For their services, the brothers were presented veerasringalas.
Soon after they made Thiruvananthapuram their abode, Kochu Kunju Achari passed away. After his death, the hereditary title was passed down to his younger brother T.N. Padmanabhan Achari. The craftsman’s profound knowledge on silpasastra made him the supervisor in charge of the new idol made for Sabarimala temple.
In 1966, he received the first National Award for woodcarving from Dr. Radhakrishnan, the President of India. T.N. Padmanabhan Achari relocated to Pattom where the master craftsman spent the rest of his life.

RTI activist dies as car catches fire
","An RTI activist, who was trying to evict alleged land grabbers from a temple in Kasna village here, was found charred to death in his car on Thursday night. His family has alleged foul play.
According to the police, Chandra Mohan Sharma, who worked for a global automobile giant, was on his way home in Alpha Sector here around 11-20 p.m. when his car went up in flames.
Gautam Budh Nagar SSP Preetinder Singh said: “The people at the spot tried to break the car’s windows with stones, but they were unable to rescue Chandra Mohan.”
By the time the police reached there, the victim had succumbed to his burns. The body was then taken to a hospital for post-mortem.
The police said Chandra Mohan had been experiencing problems with his Chevrolet car. “Four days ago, he had removed the CNG kit from the car. Even on the day of the incident, he had trouble starting the car,” said Mr. Singh. The car will be sent for technical inspection.
While the police are investigating all angles, the victim’s family has alleged foul play.
“He was murdered because for the past eight to ten years he had been working to remove encroachers from a temple. He had been threatened and attacked many times, the last being on April 28. He was driving near Pari Chowk when his car was stopped and he was beaten and verbally abused,” said Videsh Kumar, brother-in-law of Chandra Mohan.
Mr. Kumar, who also lives in Kasna, said villagers were trying to evict some individuals who had encroached on temple land. “Chandra Mohan had filed an application to get details about this issue,” he added.
Chandra Mohan, who was in his mid-30s, is survived by his wife, daughter and son .

Despite poverty, Assamese migrants feel safer in U.P.
","On April 16, Feroz endured a 36-hour train journey from Lucknow to reach his village in Barpeta district in Assam. Eight days later, he went to the Chenga polling booth in his village, Radhakuchi Habi, and cast his vote. He returned to the Uttar Pradesh capital a few days later. The entire trip cost Feroz around Rs.10,000.
Despite his meagre earnings, Feroz travels from Lucknow to Assam to vote in every election.
Ali feared, as always, the possibility of attacks by Bodo militants as the train passed Kokrajhar, a two-hour drive from Barpeta. “The Bodos not only burn our homes, they also attack trains and rob people. They kill us without any hesitation. We breathe a sigh of relief when we reach home,” says Feroz.
Amid the unfolding of fresh ethnic violence in Assam, migrants from the State living in Lucknoware anxious about the safety of their relatives back home. Their only source of accurate information is the television.
“It’s only a matter of time before the violence spreads to other districts,” says Feroz, who is seated in a small thatched hut on the outskirts of Lucknow. He lives with his wife, four sons and a daughter. The violence in Assam, though alarming, is remote. Abject poverty and the terror of floods caused by the Brahmaputra has, over the years, forced thousands of Assamese to migrate to other parts of the country. Around 40,000 Assamese migrants live in the U.P. capital.
The Assamese started arriving in Lucknow three decades ago. Their migration peaked as the Bodoland movement caught fire, says Roli Misra, an academic with extensive field experience on the migrants’ issues. In Lucknow, most of the migrants live in squalor. The majority of these migrants pick waste for a living. But their deepest hurt comes when they are tagged as “Bangladeshis” despite carrying valid identity cards.
It is the concern that his name might be removed from the voters’ list — virtually a loss of identity and cause for persecution — that drives Feroz to vote without fail. “If I miss the vote at home, I fear they will chop my name off the voter list. Then I will have no home, no identity. Here we are always suspected to be Bangladeshis,” he says. Their physical and linguistic resemblance to Bangladeshis makes these migrants easy targets of police harassment. “The society still views us with suspicion. We fear that if we ever get reprimanded, our identities will be used to persecute us,” says Feroz’s son Ali (name changed), who is struggling with his studies in a college in Lucknow.
18-year-old Ali, who follows news keenly, views the violence back home with concern. “How do the Bodos get weapons unless the Tarun Gogoi government is helping them? They aren’t economically better off than us. So who is helping them? Why do only our people die,” he asks. Ali requests this reporter to conceal his identity, lest his friends in college find out about his living conditions. “I tell my friends that I live in a rented apartment. If they find out I live in this condition, I will be mocked,” he said.
Despite difficulties in paying colleges fees, he hopes to find a decent job some day. But few migrants can afford private education.
Administrative apathy and strict regulations make it difficult for migrants to get admission in public schools. The transfer of their voter cards to Lucknow is also hindered by administrative conditions. “They aren’t able to get ration cards in Lucknow as the administration demands that they must first cancel their original Assam-based ration cards,” says Sandeep Pandey, Magsaysay Award–winning social activist. Cancelling their ration cards back home, however, would effectively extirpate their identity.
By terming these migrants as “Bangladeshis”, the administration abdicates all responsibility, says Mr. Pandey. In 2009, he undertook a drive to convince the administration that the people it was uprooting from slums in Lucknow were in fact Assamese.
While things have since improved, the stigma remains in their minds, says Mr. Pandey. Despite that, Zain (25), a waste-picker, is thankful that in Lucknow they have a stable means of living and are secure.

Khairatabad tops in property tax collection
","The Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) which had a windfall in the form of high property tax collections during the month of April had the maximum collections coming in from the Khairtabad-2 circle.
After announcing an early bird offer of 5 per cent rebate for those paying the property tax in April, the civic body netted a total of Rs.109.53 crore in the month which happens to be Rs.78.93 crore more than the collections during the same period last year. In the year 2013-14, the total collections stood at a meagre Rs.30.59 crore.
Of the 18 circles of the GHMC, Khairatabad-2 topped the list, collecting Rs.27.39 crore which is Rs.18.59 crore more than the previous year’s April transactions. Kukatpally circle with Rs.10.86 crore, Secunderabad with Rs.9.54 crore and Abids-2 circle with Rs.8.73 crore are the other toppers in the list.
Ramachandrapuram circle with property tax collection of Rs.85 lakhs stood at the bottom of the list along with Charminar-2 with Rs.1.69 crore and Rajendranagar with Rs.1.96 crore.
“The rebate offer which actually worked out for just 20 days since it was announced on April 9, got us Rs.78.93 crore more than last April. This high transaction happened during the busy election period when most of our staff were not actually going to field for collections,” said an official.
Since most of them were drafted for poll related duties during the last month, bill collectors could only net Rs.2.46 crore but interestingly, most property owners queued up at Citizen Service Centres of the civic body to pay taxes to the tune of Rs.60.39 crore and visited Mee Seva Centres to pay another Rs.32.43 crore.

When you already know it
","Imagine yourself travelling to a new country on a vacation and while you’re touring a famous monument, the feeling of having been there before thrills you.
Or, while you’re discussing a football match with friends over dinner and suddenly you experience that you’ve already gone through this very thing — same friends, same dinner, the same topic.
This very feeling is déjà vu — a French term which literally means, ‘already seen’.
Elaborating such experiences of déjà vu from his life comes bestselling author Arpit Dugar. His his new book “Not Yet to Be Disclosed” — launched in the Capital recently — revolves around the character Avnish who, from time to time, experiences déjà vu. The urge to discover the reason behind such experiences compel him to travel across the world to places unobserved, only to meet a girl after which his life changes dramatically.
Dugar, a native of Jaipur, has written a prequel to the book titled Nothing For You My Dear, Still I Love You. He admits that the character in the latest book is a reflection of his own-self. “The incidences that happened with me inspired me to write as they were never believed by people when told verbally because they were so weird and surprising. The concept of déjà vu is somewhat scientific in content and many people don’t know much about the topic. Before penning it down, I discussed it with psychologists and psychiatrists,” he says.
Dugar believes in the philosophy of “busy is a person who has time for everything!”
Bearing resemblance to its prequel, the book has an attractive bright red cover with a couple trying hard not to show what’s happening under the cover of their umbrella. The 270-pager holds much more beyond what the cover page conveys though.

Experts to inspect injured wild elephant
","The Forest Department will submit a formal reply to the Kerala High Court on Tuesday on the health condition of the injured female wild elephant that is staying put in waters of the Idamalayar reservoir for the past 25 days.
The department will also inform the court on the action taken during the past 25 days to treat and feed the elephant and also the action planned to save the elephant from its agony. In this connection an expert team comprising veterinarians, wildlife experts and forest officials will diagnose the condition of the elephant on Sunday.
The High Court intervened in the issue following a petition from Daya, an NGO. The animal is being tended to on daily basis by Forest Department officials attached to the Idamalayar Forest Range office. The elephant which is unable to forage is being fed with fruits and palm fronds which it readily accepts from the forest officials.
Chief Wildlife Warden, G. Harikumar, told The Hindu that preliminary diagnosis of the elephant showed that it has a serious injury in its left foreleg. The leg is badly swollen and it is limping heavily. He said that it is not clear why the elephant chose to take refuge in the waters of the reservoir.
But the animal keeps standing in the water most of the time and occasionally comes out of it for short breaks. Mr. Harikumar said that the health condition of the animal has appreciably improved compared to the condition in which it was first found. It has now got used to the forest officials who arrive there regularly to provide food.
The officials have to travel more than one km in a boat from the dam site to reach the location where the elephant stands. Initially on prescription from a veterinary official, some oral medication was administered by concealing it in pineapples given as food to the elephant.
But it was later withdrawn since it was suspected that the animal was allergic to the medicines.
Animal rescue experts said that the elephant standing continuously in water can create other health problems. But rescuing and relocating the elephant from the site where it presently stands will be a herculean task.
The location is such that it will be difficult to bring in cranes or other such equipment. But the Forest Department is doing its best to ensure the well-being of the injured animal, Mr. Harikumar said.
The course of action to be taken will be based on the report to be submitted by the expert committee after its visit on Sunday, he said.
It was Adivasis of the area who first found the elephant in the reservoir.
On noticing that it was injured, they informed the Edamalayar Range Forest officials about it. Adivasis told The Hindu that as they did not see any external injuries, they suspect dislocation or fracture of the affected forelimb.

No bar to consider IPS officer’s bail plea
","The Madras High Court, on Friday, set aside the order of a Judge who directed the XI Metropolitan Magistrate not to proceed with the bail application filed by IPS officer R.V. Varun Kumar
Justice C.S. Karnan, who heard the criminal revision case filed by Mr. Varun Kumar, in his order said: “If any order is passed suo motu which is out of prayer by invoking Court’s inherent power, those orders should not be prejudicial to the interest of the opposite party. In this case, this court did not give an opportunity to the accused and stayed his bail application. As such it is unjustifiable.”
The order also states that after an intervening period of two years, the act of the police in seeking custodial interrogation of the accused can only be viewed as an afterthought.
The Judge further said the Apex Court had given an opportunity to Mr. Varun Kumar to move a regular bail application before the appropriate court after surrender. He had surrendered on April 28, 2014, and was remanded in judicial custody. Subsequently, a bail application had been filed. The same is to be disposed of with high priority, the Judge said.
He further said that Mr. Varun Kumar had sought bail before the trial and conviction and, as such, need not be incarcerated as he had received anticipatory bail.
Meanwhile, the bail application of Mr. Varun Kumar filed at the Saidapet court was dismissed on Friday evening.

For art’s sake
","Madrasters (Mad-rastres or Madras-ters) is Chennai’s very own Photoshop User Group, an Adobe-authorised community for designers and art enthusiasts. Started by Jack Anto and Prabhagaran, it helps bring together likeminded people who are keen to share their love and knowledge for art and design. Explaining the idea behind the name, Prabhagaran says, “Photoshop is a Raster-based software and also a design-connected word. For us, Madras denotes emotions. We put the two together and that’s how Madrasters came up.” NXg talks to the duo to find out what drives this online community for creative souls.

What triggered the idea to start this community?

We are Visual Communication students whose only vision and dream is design. As freshers, when we started our careers, we came across people who were very critical of our work; they were rude! So we thought it was time for us to start Chennai’s PUG (Photoshop Users Group). As a first step, we got in touch with Adobe and got our community authorised. We wanted to show others the right way to go about designing. We wanted our work to be both criticised and appreciated by fellow designers. After we started, the number of members grew rapidly! From 28 to 74 to 120… suddenly we were a 1000-member group. That’s when Jack and I knew we had done the right thing!

What do you guys do?

Our community meets are for members of Madrasters. We also have open workshops for everyone. Our meets happen every Saturday and we discuss industry updates, have fun activities like Sand Art, Picture Perceptions etc. We have the Founding Team, Level 2 and 3 Contributors. Everybody pitches in and the quality of these discussions has been very good! We also plan for our upcoming workshops.

Why Madrasters?

Photoshop is a Raster-based software and also a design connected word. For us Madras denotes emotions. We put the two together and that’s how Madrasters came up.

Why move from PUG to Madrasters?

Photoshop is the glamour word for designers and non-users alike. People joined PUG because it focussed on Photoshop users. We wanted to broaden our horizon. Design is not just about Photoshop, so we decided to open this community to all art enthusiasts. We went from being PUG to Madrasters; however, we are still a group powered by PUG.

How has the response been?

The response has been phenomenal! Every day we have enquiries about our next meet.

Are there other such communities in Chennai?

We are the only ones. This has also raised our expectation bar from members and others really high.

What are your plans for the community?

We want to start an academy. We are looking for sponsors. Our dream is to be “THE” voice for all designers. Design rights are missing, prior credits need to be given — there is a difference between copying and deriving inspiration. Most designers have low incomes and little freedom; they are not given the freedom to think and execute; ideas are pushed down our throats. We want to be the place they can bring their problems to; we want to be able to help them get a lasting solution.

What are your upcoming projects?

We have two workshops lined up for May on Web UI Design and Typography at IIT Research Park.

Salman Khan case: Witness identifies articles presented by prosecution
","Sambha Gouda, the police witness, continued with his deposition on the second day in the Bollywood actor Salman Khan’s hit-and-run case of September 2002.
Mr. Gouda is the first witness to depose in the >re-trial of the case that began last week at a Mumbai sessions court. A piece of the shutter of the American bakery, mud guard of the actor’s car that came off during the accident and glass shards that were presented by the prosecution in the court on Friday were identified by Mr. Gouda.
Mr. Gouda, a tea vendor by profession told the court that he lives on the footpath which is five minutes away from the accident spot. On September 28, 2002 night, at 3 a.m., three constables came to inquire him. He then reached the spot in an auto and saw a huge crowd gathered there. He told the court that he had never visited the crime spot before the accident and that the spot was at Hill Road in Bandra. The defence however claimed that Mr. Gouda never visited the spot.
In September 2002, one person was killed and four injured after the actor’s SUV allegedly jumped over a footpath where the victims were sleeping. Mr. Khan was earlier booked for rash and negligent driving. But later, the court observed that he could be charged with culpable homicide not amounting to murder.
He then moved an application for fresh examination of witnesses on the grounds that the witnesses were previously examined for lesser charges against him. His application was granted by the court and a re-trial was ordered.
The matter was adjourned to 6th May and the actor is likely to be present in the court as the witnesses need to identify the actor. During the identification parade in the court, the accused is required to be present

Hit-and-run case: Salman Khan was in driver’s seat, say eyewitnesses
","Three key eyewitnesses on Tuesday told a sessions court that they saw actor Salman Khan getting down from the driver’s seat of an SUV, 12 years after it ran over a group of people in Bandra. One person was killed and four others were injured in the >accident on the night of September 28, 2002.
The eyewitnesses — Mannu Khan, Mohammed Kalim Iqbal Pathan and Muslim Shaikh — were among those injured. They were all workers of the American Bakery outside which the accident took place.
Khan was present in court. Even while the actor’s lawyers have argued for more than a decade that he was not at the wheel, the witnesses said they saw Khan getting out from the driver’s side of the Toyota Land Cruiser a little after 2 a.m. on September 28.
While one witness said he saw the actor getting down from the front door on the right hand side, the other said he had seen Salman getting down from the driver's seat. Another witness said the actor had got down from the vehicle but did not remember from which side he got down.
At the end of the proceedings, the Bandra police moved an application to the court saying that Shaikh had received a threat calI. Inspector Rajendra Kane of the Bandra police station said that a case had been registered and the investigation was underway.
“Shaikh told us that he had received two anonymous calls asking him to back away from deposing. The court has directed us to investigate the complaint and submit a report by May 19. We are tracing the caller,” he said.
“We were sleeping and there was a huge noise and a car came over us. Kalim, Muslim, Nurullah and I were beneath the car. I started screaming for help. Many people came there. Somehow they pushed the car and rescued us. I had an injury on my right hand. People were saying ‘Salman come out’. Salman Khan got down from the driver's side…The bakery people caught Salman. Salman was so drunk that he fell down, then he got up and ran away,” said Mannu Khan.
Through the day-long proceedings, Khan dressed in a white shirt and jeans sporting a French beard, sat in the accused box at the end of the court room following the trial.
Flanked by his sisters Alvira and Arpita, Salman was seen dozing off.
A 22-year-old fan from Pune who said she has been attending all the proceedings made the journey to Mumbai.
If convicted, the actor faces imprisonment of up to 10 years in jail. In 1998, Khan spent a few days in prison for killing blackbuck deer, an endangered species, in Rajasthan.
In the accident, the actor’s SUV allegedly jumped over a footpath where the victims were sleeping. Khan was earlier booked for rash and negligent driving. But later, the court observed that he could be charged with culpable homicide not amounting to murder.
He then moved an application for fresh examination of witnesses on the grounds that the witnesses were previously examined for lesser charges against him. His application was granted by the court and a re-trial was ordered.
So far, four witnesses have deposed in the >re-trial. One among them is a panch witness and the other three are eye witnesses. The prosecution led by Jagannath Kenjralkar will examine other three witnesses on May 19.

Master plan drawn up to upgrade Adumalleshwar mini-zoo
","Based on the instructions of the Central Zoo Authority of India (CZAI), district Forest Department officials submitted a master plan to upgrade the Adumalleshwar mini-zoo in Chitradurga district.
The plans, estimated to cost Rs. 2 crore, include expanding the cages, creating walking paths as well as a separate play area for children.
The master plan was submitted two months ago and work will begin once the CZAI gives approval.
The sources said that every year, the department received a revenue of Rs. 4 lakh owing to the large number of visitors. After the zoo was upgraded, the entry fee would also be revised and the department would start getting more revenue, they added.
According to official sources, CZAI officials visited the Adumalleshwar mini-zoo in May 2012 and expressed their dissatisfaction over the facilities. They also criticised the lack of play area and walking space. They instructed the Forest Department officials to prepare a master plan to upgrade the zoo by utilising 25 acres of land. At present, the zoo is located on 10 acres of land. The officials had also set certain norms pertaining to the size of the cages, separate space for canteen, walking path and play area. As per their directions, a team of officials, led by the District Forest Conservator Kumarswamy , visited the Mysore zoo to conduct a detailed study of the facilities there.
According to sources, the officials interacted with the Mysore zoo authorities to prepare a master plan that would ensure that the animals in the mini-zoo were provided with better facilities.

Thousands throng Simhachalam
","Traditional fervour and gaiety marked the annual ‘Chandanotsavam’ of Lord Varaha Lakshmi Nrusimha Swamy, the presiding deity of Simhachalam, here on Friday.
Thousands of devotees converged on the hill to have darshan of the Lord in His original form, which can be seen only once in a year.
Hereditary trustee of the temple Poosapati Anand Gajapathi Raju and his family members were the first to offer prayers in accordance with the age-old tradition at the temple.
Principal Secretary (Endowments) Venkateswara Rao submitted ‘pattu vastrams’ to the Lord on behalf of the State government. TTD priest ‘Dollar’ Seshadri presented ‘pattu vastrams’ on behalf of the TTD.
RTC operated special buses for the convenience of devotees.
“The arrangements were excellent. It took around 45 minutes for me in the queue. Though our car was stopped at the foothill as I did not have a car pass, I have no complaint as free buses were available every few minutes to go up the hill,” said G.V.S.N. Srinivas, a medical practitioner from the U.S., who came home on a holiday to the city.
“I came out in less than half-an-hour,” said neurologist S. Gopi of KGH, who had darshan at around 11.45 a.m.

Art for all
","My hand is trying to arrest the wobble,” says 12-year-old Surabhi. She is shaping a small clay pot on a potter’s wheel at Rainbow Fish Studio in Kotturpuram. She, along with Suchit, Adia, and friends, are learning pottery from Potrarasan, as part of a summer course at the newly-launched visual art school. The art studio is filled with clay masterpieces the children made — they have sculpted crocodiles, fish, penguins…Another batch of students is learning graphic designing — they are making posters to promote Paris.
Rainbow Fish Studio is an art school with a difference — they have art and design courses tailored specifically to develop an eye for art in children. Be it a session on ‘Shapes, Figures, & Strange Machines’, ‘Jungle art’, or ‘Maps and Info Design’, their courses aim to urge a child to appreciate art that surrounds him/her.
Sara Vetteth, who started the school, wishes that children open their eyes “to the incredible beauty around them.” For instance, in India, almost every street corner has a temple — but do children really stop to admire them? Art should go beyond being just a hobby, feels Sara.
At Rainbow Fish, children learn about portraits, self- portraits; hear of Van Gogh, Picasso, and Munch; explore folk art styles; understand the components that make up building architecture…the courses are tailored for kids aged from five to seven, seven to 10, and 10 to 14.
Sara, who holds a Masters degree from Parsons School of Design in New York, says that Rainbow Fish will not stop with their summer programmes. She hopes to develop “after school design courses” that children can enrol for. She is backed by a qualified team of instructors to help her do so. Actor and photographer Sunder, for instance, will teach the kids photography, architect Kalpana Balaji who runs her own design firm with her husband in the city, will hold sessions on the principles of architecture. In the long run, Rainbow Fish will become a place where “schools outsource their weekly art classes,” says Sara. She feels that even one art class per week during the course of the year will make children “enjoy and appreciate the world around them much more.”

Tamil Nadu comes under security blanket
","Soon after the bomb explosion in the Bangalore-Guwahati Express at the Central station here on Thursday, Tamil Nadu came under a security blanket, with additional police deployment, more checks at public places and special protection provided at places of worship and vital infrastructural installations.
In the temple city of Madurai, security was intensified in the Meenakshi Sundareswarar Temple.
The surveillance cameras at several points in that city “are being monitored round the clock,” though there was no specific threat to the shrine, said Madurai City Commissioner of Police, Sanjay Mathur.
Security was also enhanced at the other historic temples in the south including those at Tiruchendur, Palani and Rameswaram.
An extra eye is kept on key infrastructure in the southern districts, in particular the Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant (KNPP), the Indian Space Research Organisation’s Liquid Propulsion Systems Centre at Mahendragiri and VOC Port in Tuticorin. The KNPP site director, R. S. Sundar told The Hindu that adequate security was put in place in and around the Kudankulam plant in Tirunelveli district.
Tighter vigil was mounted at the historically famous Padmanabhapuram palace known as the ‘wooden palace’ in Kanyakumari district, after the Central intelligence agencies had alerted about a possible threat to the 18 century structure.
Many security personnel were on duty at counting centres where the EVMs’ have been kept and also in Kodaikanal hill station to guide tourists, police said.
In Nagapattinam district, security has been beefed up at all vital installations and places of worship with the police administration deploying close to 400 personnel for surveillance.
Special surveillance is on at Vaitheeswaran temple, the Thirukadayur Abhirami temple, the famous temple for Lord Saturn at Thirunallar, the Vedaranyeshwarar temple, the Velankanni Basilica and at Nagore Dargah.
In Karaikal, all police stations have been put on high alert, said Monica Bhardwaj, Superintendent of Police, Karaikal.

A man of wits
","“I’m more interested in what is happening today than something that happened in the past,” he says. Pitted against stalwarts such as Tha. Ku. Subramanian, Gandhimathi, Rajaram, Ramachandran and Sol Vilangum Perumal, Raja had to and did exhibit his oratorical prowess.
From a quiet child in Keezhamathur village near Thuvariman, Raja reached the American College for under-graduation and ended up with a job in United Bank of India. But he went through a rough phase during his growing up years and that, he says, taught him quite a few important lessons in life, most important being how to fight challenges confidently.
Even in the wildest of his dreams, Raja had never thought that he would become a speaker one day. But he rose to celebrity status in debate programmes!
Raja travelled extensively with the team of Tamil scholar Solomon Papiah. “For more than 15 years I only listened to ayya’s (read Solomon Papiah) programmes. I still remember the days when I travelled on the lap of star speaker Rajaram to attend a programme in Keezhakuilkudi because there was no space in the car. I followed the team like crazy.”
Perseverance pays and he got a chance to speak at a debate programme as a substitute since the original speaker failed to turn up. “Ayya asked me to speak. I knew it was a make or break situation. I was neither prepared nor equipped to speak. But, I grabbed the opportunity and spoke confidently. The humour in my speech caught the attention of the audience. The first words of appreciation -- ‘Super...’ -- came from the person operating the public address system. He was my first fan,” he recalls.
Today, he is famous as Pattimandram Raja. “It is a result of the impact ayya has created on me over the years,” he says.

Pattimandram, the art of debating, flourished in Madurai with the help of literary associations but now with the continuous projection on television channels, the pattimandram speakers have catapulted to a star status.
Raja gained popularity with his logical arguments and he soon became the peoples’ representative on stage. “I credit this success to the members of ayya’s team. Even as a novice, I was given a free hand to speak,” says Raja, who many times had to take on much more experienced and established speakers. “Had they objected to my counter arguments, I would not have reached this far,” he adds, acknowledging their magnanimity in accepting him as a part of their team. “Their whole-hearted support and encouragement helped me to climb up the ladder,” he says.
Blessed with the gift of the gab, Raja strikes an instant chord with the audience. “I don’t have a literary background. My strength is my knowledge about the common man and his struggles. My daily dose of news from papers provides me with ample information about real life incidents,” he says, not forgetting the influence of ayya’s speech on him.
Raja believes in constantly updating himself because he feels if you are away from news, you become an island.
“I try to link the day’s news to the topic of the programme as public acceptance is more if the incidents are the most recent,” says Raja.
He also believes in speaking extempore. “We never discuss a topic. Everything is done on-the-spot. Many times, we are given the topic only after reaching the venue,” he says.
His witty arguments on television also fetched him an opportunity to act in films. Ever since popular filmmaker Shankar offered him the maiden chance, Raja has done 15 films. Raja also anchors Vaanga Pesalam on a popular satellite channel with co-presenter Bharathi Bhaskar discussing every topic under the sun, from science and technology to art and architecture. “It has attracted all sections. We try to share a lot of information and when we hear that it is useful for the students, we feel great. In fact, I have spent more time preparing for this show than for the pattimandram programmes,” he says.
Fully aware of his strengths and weaknesses, Raja is careful about the choice of his words on stage. “I always think from the audience’s perspective,” he says and adds, “I don’t advice, I only try to keep public in good humour.”

Train blasts shatter Chennai calm
","In a May Day shocker, >two blasts in a train as it arrived at the Chennai Central railway station on Thursday morning claimed the life of >a woman passenger and injured 14, raising concern about the peaceful conduct of the two remaining phases of the Lok Sabha election in neighbouring Andhra Pradesh and other States.
Shortly after the Bangalore-Guwahati Express pulled into platform nine, two low-intensity bombs went off, one in the S-4 coach and the other in S-5, at 7.08 a.m. Parchuri Swathi, an information technology professional bound for Guntur, was killed on the spot.
Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Jayalalithaa >transferred the case to the Crime Branch CID for investigation, as the State was not keen on an investigation by the >National Investigation Agency.
Eyewitnesses said they heard two explosions in quick succession. Shocked passengers ran out of the train to safety. Several others escaped the blast as they had stepped out to have breakfast during the 40-minute halt. The three affected coaches were detached after which the train left for Guwahati five hours late.
“Some injured persons were in a state of shock and could not move. We shifted them to safety with the help of some porters. The damage would have been devastating had the blast occurred when the train was moving,” Vijay Kumar, travelling ticket examiner, said.
Parrying queries on whether the >explosions were targeted at Andhra Pradesh where the BJP’s prime ministerial candidate, Narendra Modi, addressed election rallies on Thursday, a senior police official said the focus now was on nabbing the culprits. The train would have probably entered Andhra Pradesh had it been running on time. DGP (in-charge of elections), Tamil Nadu, Anoop Jaiswal said investigators were perusing CCTV footage obtained from the Chennai and the Bangalore stations. “It appears to be an
> IED triggered by a timer device.”

Snag delayed train


Sruthisagar Yamunan reports
A snag in the braking system that delayed the Bangalore-Guwahati Express by 45 minutes between Krishnarajapuram and Bangarapet on Thursday morning perhaps prevented the blast occurring on a speeding train with possibly graver consequences.
According to a Southern Railway official, had the train run on schedule, it would have been between Tada and Sullurpetta in Andhra Pradesh at the time of the blast (around 7.15 am).
Significantly, BJP prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi was scheduled to attend a public meeting in Nellore on Thursday evening.

Girls take to veena-making
","A group of nine girls from different age groups have successfully completed the crucial stages of Nuzvid veena making under the watchful eyes of Sheik Meera Saheb, 63, one of the first generation veena makers from Nuzvid in Krishna district.
At a time when the industry is facing a dearth of technical workforce to produce the jack-fruit-wood traditional musical instrument - veena - the All India Handicraft Board has provided a six-month training to these girls. “Except crafting of the instrument, we have learnt every stage of the veena-making, from giving a final touch of colours to bringing the shine to the instrument,” says B. Rajani, a student.
Officially, the training will be completed on May 5. The students are given a stipend of Rs. 2,500 a month. “The traditional designs on veena reveal the identity of the artisans and the place where it is made. These girls have mastered the art of making and they are carving the exact veena designs,” says Mr. Meera Saheb, who recently quit the art.
The girls, waiting in the wings to make a name for themselves in the industry, include Sheik Shafi Munnisa Abi, N. Nagalaxmi, G. Saranya, Sk. Nurzahan, V. Durga and Anjali Devi. “We have a handful of orders for designing veenas. It is a nice feeling to be called an artisan as the pursuit is helping us earn a livelihood,” said G.

Twin blasts occurred on coaches not manned by TTE
","In a stunning revelation, it is now known that the twin blasts on the Bangalore-Guwahati Express here on Thursday occurred in coaches unmanned by any Travelling Ticket Examiner (TTE) between Jolarpet and Chennai Central.
Hence, investigators are trying hard to identify the unauthorised persons who had boarded the train, sources in the Crime Branch CID said on Saturday.
Police probes revealed that six TTEs boarded the train in Bangalore on the night of April 30, and three of them had got down at Jolarpet.
Sleeper-Class coaches S-3, S-4 and S-5 were left with no TTE till the train reached Chennai Central the next morning. “We have information that many unauthorised persons boarded the train without a confirmed or reserved ticket. They slept along the aisle or near the toilet of these coaches. Since their names or addresses were not available, we are finding it difficult to identify them,” a CB-CID official told 
The Hindu.
Random enquiry
It was during a random enquiry with some of the passengers who travelled in the affected coaches that the police came to know of unauthorised persons on the train.
Two bombs later exploded in quick succession, killing a woman and injuring 14 others.
Portraits developedInvestigators have developed two portraits of persons who were found to be moving in a suspicious manner at the Chennai Central and Bangalore railway stations.
While one man was seen running out of the coach soon after the train arrived in Chennai on May 1, the other was seen walking towards the train before it left Bangalore.
“The man in Bangalore is seen carrying a baggage and he consciously covers his face to avoid being caught by the CCTV…,” the official said.

The bureau’s regional deputy director (south), S.R.V. Murthy, said the four-member gang poached the tiger and the leopard cat skins in Kodaikanal forests. 
Palpandi (29) is the leader of the gang and Karpagavinayagam (30) is his aide. Both hailed from Kukkal in Kodaikanal. The two transported the skins by bus from Kodaikanal to Coimbatore.   
An officer from the bureau approached the poachers as a prospective buyer and asked them to come to Coimbatore. The gang asked for Rs. 70 lakh for the skins and demanded an advance of Rs 1 lakh. The official agreed and met them in Coimbatore and paid the advance.
Mr. Murthy said preliminary investigation revealed that Palpandi was a habitual offender and Karpagavinayagam assisted him during poaching operations. Arumugam, the mastermind, is at large. Soon he would be arrested.
Cases have been registered under various Sections of the Wildlife Protection Act of 1972, which included Section 3 (Prevention of Hunting), Section 27 (Restriction on entry into Sanctuaries) and Section 39 (Wild animals to be treated as government property), Mr Murthy said.

Enchanted woods
","
‘I sit silent and alone from morning till eve in the deeper silence of the enchanted old forests… the hours go on neither short nor long, glorious for imagination.’

Naturalist John Muir (1838-1914) on the Petrified Forest, Arizona.
After a trip to a tiger sanctuary, it is usual to hear an excited ‘Did you see a tiger?’ As if tigers had nothing else to do but come and be seen. Or ecstatic accounts of how the sighting of some bird/mammal was the culminating point of the trip. Do foresters feel pressurised into making sightings happen to attract more people? So that the chosen few can pat themselves on being ‘nature lovers’ who have sighted the tiger ‘in the wild’?
Most people don’t realise that seriously marvellous things happen in forests over time. To be with the forests is to feel the cool wind in the trees; to hear the swish of leaves spiralling down, the sudden cackle of the giant squirrel or the hoot of the langur, the chirping of the cicadas; to see and feel the play of light on giant trees and seemingly frail lianas that bear remarkable weights, the myriad lives inside tree trunks, the immaculate straightness of a dead tree or the silvery lines of spiders’ webs. Art is seldom so multi-sensory; every minute is a living landscape in process.
A forest is a phenomenon so diverse and widespread that it needs to be understood in totality. But seldom is there any front page news from the forest apart from the occasional fire or storm. Do we understand that the good of a tree is only half over at its death, when it provides nesting cavities, perches, food for birds too? Being in a forest can mean absolute stillness, yet continual dynamic change. Historic past is encountered in the present.
But many city dwellers actually want to experience the city everywhere they go, even inside wildlife sanctuaries. I realised this after an exhilarating trek in the Parambikulam Wildlife Sanctuary in Kerala. When we reached a forest guesthouse, I saw the following entries in the guest book: “We need TV facility, otherwise it is boring after we reach”, “Provide room service”, “Allow other mobile operators to install towers”.
We need to respect forests and sanctuaries for the wonders that they encompass, to accept the blessing of a sighting when it happens. Not rush around disturbing the peace because you ‘have to sight’ what you thought you should before you leave. What we need are individuals who can appreciate the roughness of the forest floor and the smoothness of the mulch as much as the coolness of the river or the gentle heat of the sun through the canopy; who revere the smallest insect or frog or bird along with the largest mammal; who are as grateful to sight only a black-naped hare amid the dry deciduous Melghat Reserve in Maharashtra or a jungle cat in the moist deciduous forests of Uttarakhand’s Corbett Reserve! Can we just be, and experience our forests?

Social activist Suraiya Bose presented Yudhvir award
","Noted social activist Suraiya Hassan Bose, who worked for the revival of the Deccan handloom industry and the welfare of weavers, was presented the 23 Yudhvir Memorial Award by The Yudhvir Foundation.
At a function organised in this regard on Thursday, where she was felicitated, distinguished guests recollected Ms. Bose’s rich contribution to the handloom industry. Accepting the award, the activist said she intended to revive the khadi industry in various parts of the State.
On the occasion, a lecture was delivered by Padma Shri award winner and social activist Bilkees Latif on Our People...Tragedy and Triumph. She expressed concern that there were no values in today’s politics as a large amount of money was being used to bribe voters. Something had to be done to bring about a change in the present form of politics, she said.
Focusing on various issues plaguing the country, she said, “16 lakh children died of starvation last year in the country and about three lakh newborns die annually due to malnutrition. These figures are decreasing when compared to previous years but even then the issue is serious.”
Talking about her work in Dharavi slums and other tribal and Dalit areas in Maharashtra, she said the role of NGOs was very crucial in creating awareness and also in keeping a check on the irregularities in government schemes.

An adventure sport that children love
","This summer, let your child have loads of fun by experiencing something different at LEPL Icon Multiplex on Ring Road. Imagine the joy of the child when he walks, crawls or even rolls down in a transparent colourful ball floating on water.
Zorbing, the adventurous sport which originated in New Zealand, is a reality in city now. Since the water sport concept is new here, a large number of schoolchildren, with their parents in tow, throng this multiplex in the evening hours to facilitate their wards to play inside the ball.
Even while the kids are making the best of the opportunity, their parents capture their ecstatic moments inside the zorbing ball by clicking pictures.
“There is an overwhelming response to the new addition. Close to 400 children play and enjoy the sport every month,” says K. Mohan Murali, Manager of the SVM Gaming Centre at Icon. He says the turnout increases in the weekends when families visit the multiplex either for shopping or for watching a movie.
“The game involves rolling down in a large plastic ball known as ‘Zorb’ made up of transparent plastic. The rider is “trapped” inside the transparent inflatable ball, which rolls down. It floats on water while the rider uses ball’s momentum to direct it,” he says, pointing to the ball placed in a 16X16 feet tub filled with 3-feet-deep water to enable the zorb float easily.
“We are taking necessary precautions before a child can get inside the ball,” Mr. Murali says, adding that children aged between five and 15 years are allowed to play. A fee of Rs. 50 is charged per head. “My kids enjoy it thoroughly as it is a new game introduced recently,” says a happy parent.

Six-laning of Bangalore-Mysore highway not the solution: MGP
",": The Mysore Grahakara Parishat (MGP) has said the State government’s decision to convert the Bangalore-Mysore highway into a six-lane road may not be a solution to reduce the commuting time, and the need of the hour was flyovers at critical junctions.
It also called for straightening the existing highway which has too many curves. In a release, R. Chandra Prakash, president, MGP, said the proposed move to upgrade the Bangalore-Mysore highway to a six-lane road reflects its “typical ostrich-like approach to important issues”.
“But it is obvious from this proposal that the government is oblivious to the problems of this highway. How will the public benefit by such upgrades when the problems have not been understood?” Mr. Prakash said. He said the road was widened from two to four lane a few years ago, but that has not decreased the travel time between the two cities and on occasions the time taken is longer than what it used to be prior to four-laning of the road.
The MGP has said that every bypass along the highway has been encroached by commercial establishments which forces vehicles to slow down.
“The examples are Maddur, Channapatana, Ramnagaram, Bidadi, and Kengeri. There are more than 70 speed bumps between the two cities. If the bumps are necessary, they should have been at junctions of cross roads to prevent sudden entry of vehicles onto the highway. Congestion at the entry points of Bangalore, starting from Nayandanahalli and at BHEL factory, adds to the delay,” said the release. Mr. Prakash said inadequacy of trains on the Bangalore-Mysore route compared to the demand has increased the number of buses plying between the two cities, which has added to the problem.
Further, Mr. Prakash said, instances of blocking the highway adds to the delay. Hence, widening the road will not resolve any of the problems.
Hence, the MGP has suggested flyovers at all those bypass roads. It has cited the examples of flyovers enroute to the Bangalore airport and said this has helped in smooth flow of traffic.

Student who stabbed teacher sent to home
","A student, who stabbed his teacher in a classroom of a school in Parry’s Corner in February 2012, was ordered to be sent to a special home in Chengalpattu by the Juvenile Justice Board on Wednesday.
The family of the victim, R. Uma Maheswari (39), which was in the Juvenile court premises, said their intention was not to have the child punished, but wanted him to change. The boy, who was then 15 years old, had stabbed his teacher because she had reportedly reprimanded him for not doing well in studies.
Uma Maheswari was teaching science and Hindi for close to a decade at the school. On February 9, around 10.50 a.m., she was sitting in the first floor room for the class IXA Hindi class, when the boy attacked her. She was taken to a nearby private hospital, which referred her to Government General Hospital. But she died on the way. The boy was sent to the juvenile home where he was held for 40 days. After that, he was let out on bail.
On Wednesday, he along with his parents arrived at the Juvenile Justice Board in Kellys around 11 p.m. A three-member board, comprising Judge Lakshmi Ramesh, and members Girija Kumarababu and Selvi Isabel, heard the case. The board’s order read: “Therefore, having regard to the nature of offence committed and the circumstances of the case, this board feels it expedient to make an order directing him to be sent to the special home for the period of two years.” Further, it said that allowing him to participate in group counselling, perform community service, or imposing a fine on the parents would not serve his interest, or change his attitude, nature or behavioural patterns.
The board said that, considering his age and conduct, the juvenile be housed in a special security government special home. However, as there is no such home, the board addressed the government to establish such a facility with adequate infrastructure and staff.
It also directed the authorities to ensure that he received necessary psychological support and completed his class XII studies with French as a subject. He is also entitled to go on leave and will be engaged in yoga, meditation and repeated counselling.
Later, the Judge and members told the boy that it was a rehabilitation measure. “You cannot change what has happened, but you can direct your future. Hence, use the time to reflect and decide what to do in the future,” said one of the members.
C.V. Ravishankar, the victim’s husband, said he was not keen on seeing the boy punished. “He has to realise his mistake and change,” he said.
Amritham, Uma Maheshwari’s mother, said that the boy would have committed the crime unknowingly. “I wish and pray for his welfare too,” she said.
Assistant public prosecutor S. Dhiraviaraj, who appeared for the government, said the boy had been sent to the special home in Chengalpattu on Wednesday.

Smooth out rough edges
","She was crowned Miss India in 1972, walked the ramp with the likes of Meher Castellino, Persis Khambatta and Phyllis Mendes before she went on to create a successful career for herself as a fashion choreographer and then a grooming expert. Today as her three sons – Siddharth, Aditya and Kunal Roy Kapoor – take over tinsel town, Salome Roy Kapoor continues to be a force to reckon with. What else could explain the demand for her skills as a grooming expert at finishing and fashion institutes across the country.
In the city for the launch of designer James Ferreira’s fashion institute, Salome Roy Kapoor is looking forward to lending her expertise as faculty member at the design school.
Incidentally, Salome is the one who gave James his first assignment as a designer in the fashion industry over 40 years ago.

 An ill groomed individual can wear the most expensive outfit and make it look like a rag. How one carries oneself matters 
Ever since, the two have shared a wonderful professional rapport and it was only natural for James to ask her to come on board when he launched his own institute. “When James asked me to come on board as the grooming expert, there was no way I could refuse. When he called up and told me about what he had planned, it sounded very exciting and here I am,” she says.
Salome, who conducts grooming and etiquette workshops across the country, will have her hands full with teaching at the Deccan Institute of Design. “I’m slated to come to the city four times a year to conduct my classes. That is our initial plan. So it should be quite doable,” says the expert whose course module is usually a mix of dance, drama, personalised grooming and fitness tips.
“It is important to groom oneself from the inside as well as from the outside. For instance, an ill groomed individual can wear the most expensive outfit and make it look like a rag. How one carries oneself matters. Another thing that I will cover during my course here will be etiquette. Things like conversations dos and don’ts, voice modulation, diet and exercise as well,” she explains.
Ask her why it is so important to groom oneself and she says, “It is important because it makes the over all character of a person. It smoothes out the rough edges and makes one more prepared to face a career and society in general.”
The trend of going to a grooming school has always been there but the awareness levels have increased of late, says Salome.
She adds that grooming is for everybody and not just folks in the fashion industry. “I have everyone from teenagers to housewives and working professionals come to me for grooming tips. It deals with different aspects like diet, exercise, conversation skills and analysing one’s positives and negatives. It is important to be able to judge oneself and highlight one’s positives and play down the negatives.”

Yoga on wheels
","In the wee hours of the day, a group of nine differently-abled people, including seven wheelchair-bound boys and two hearing-impaired girls, visit Jagriti Park in Delhi, to practise yoga. Having gone to school and performing Indian classical dance for more than 17 years together, the group decided to form We Are One a year ago. This trust reaches out to other people by teaching dance and yoga to anyone with a disability, whether it is autism or speech impairment. “We try to encourage people with disability to go beyond their limits. Our aim is to break stereotypes and to promote inclusion in society,” says Gulshan Kumar, the lead choreographer of the group.They’ve picked up yoga on their own, while dance was a part of daily life in Amar Jyoti School that they went to. The group has had to combat more than just disability though. They have also been able to leave behind them the shadow of harassment and exploitation from a past mentor. “Togetherness has given us enough strength to start afresh and our love for dance and yoga has made us who we are today,” says Husnain, the founder.

Flavours of its own
","Rosang Café is a journey of the passion and hard work of a woman who came to Delhi from Mizoram a decade ago with her baby in her lap. She always wanted to give her daughter a good education and exposure to grow in life. Mary Lalboi opted to serve people with food of all the Northeastern States.
New to Delhi, she first started at Safdarjung with a small eatery. Mary recalls, “When a customer asked for water, I used to say ‘Fridge is on the left, go get it’, as my baby used to be in my lap all the time.” That’s a glimpse of the homely environment which Rosang is famous for. Then she shifted to Hauz Khas village market, which made Mary quite popular amongst youngsters. Mary, who was very active on Facebook, started uploading pictures of prominent people who used to visit the café quite often. But as sealing issues cropped up, Mary had to shut Rosang for the second time. But nothing could dent her passion and zeal and now she is back with a much bigger outlet next to the Green Park metro station.
As soon as I entered, I saw Mary sitting in a corner wearing a traditional North Eastern costume. Simple wooden furniture and pictures of the North East make up the ambience. The menu has all the major dishes from the eight States. Chicken dry, fried and stuffed with sesame seeds was my first bite and it impressed me with its flavours and crunchy yet juicy texture. Maroi bora, Manipuri style fritters, with chives from Manipur, also had a very distinct flavour. Tokhan, a chicken curry from Tripura, aksa meh with seasonal herbs, was redolent with flavours and went well with wild rice, a specialty of Rosang. Worth a mention is iromba chutney made out of fish paste which goes well with everything. There are no lamb or mutton dishes on the menu.
Two points to keep in mind: Rosang’s flavours are for people with an evolved palate. Secondly, end your meal with a wild rice kheer whenever you visit Rosang.

Meal for two – Rs.600

A meat feast "," Think Ramadan and the first thing that comes to mind is food. Observed by Muslims by fasting from sunrise to sunset, the period most loved by people from other communities is the Iftar, where the fast is broken and the feast begins. What makes this season significant is how it unites people from all religions, backgrounds and languages with one single aspect – food. 




That’s why we’ve chalked out some of the lesser known haunts for Bengaluru’s foodies to embark on a culinary venture and taste some of the treats that can be eaten during this month.
MM Road




Top of the list is always Frazer Town. While the classic hotspot of Mosque Road has lost its shine owing to a ban, except for a few joints extending their doors to host food stalls and the irresistible bheja puff at Albert Bakery, the new food haunt in Frazer Town is the road perpendicular to Mosque Road at the junction of Haji Sir Ismail Sait Mosque – MM Road. Short for Madhavraya Mudaliar Road, what makes this already busy road with its row of restaurants and eateries is the array of food stalls that pop up during Ramadan. From kheema samosas, meat grills and skewers to patthar ghost (meat cooked on a granite slab on top of red hot coals), phaal, sheekh and veal kabab, and the traditional haleem, you can find everything here. Finding place to park may be your only issue, otherwise, this is the place to be if you’re in East Bengaluru.
Shivajinagar Chowk
 


If you can’t find it in Shivajinagar, you can’t find it anywhere else. The main transport hub and commercial shopping area adds one more item on what all you can find here during Ramadan – incredible food. What makes this hotspot even more significant that even if it is 3 am in the morning, you will find food here. Christened the Chowk locally, the area in front of the vintage Russell Market lights up during Ramadan and offers, easily, the best food in town. Almost always packed, take a walk down this road for the tastiest Iftar treats, sweets, soups, savouries and hot tea. A favourite here is the exotic camel meat. Go down from there to the Old Poor House Road junction near Taj Hotel and you will experience the true spirit of the season with crowds milling over food stalls and absolutely no place to walk.
Tilak Nagar




The hustle and bustle of this rather busy locality will not distract you from the aroma of food that fills that air. A drive down Tilak Nagar Main Road is almost impossible without stopping at the range of eateries that line up the roadside, almost threatening to create traffic snarls with the crowds thronging them. The exotic treats here are the roasted ox tongue and quail fry. For the less adventurous, dabble in the kebabs, curries, phirnis and paani kum chai.
Rahamat Nagar, RT Nagar




This one you may miss if you drive by too fast. So the moment you enter RT Nagar, keep your eyes peeled for this street food cuisine hotspot near Jamia Masjid. Head over in the evenings and taste the best grilled meats and yummiest sheek kebabs and samosas. Also look out for the murgh pahadi kebab, a herb-based tender chicken dish that’s available only here.
Koramangala




Going by many names – the popular eat street on Koramangala’s First Cross Road is a foodies paradise. Already packed with way too many restaurants and eateries, the jam-packed road becomes almost impossible to go through on evenings now. Take a stroll and you will go home few pounds heavier as the wafting smell of food is undeniable. Often, you will find Ramadan food blending with other cuisines thanks to the wall-to-wall restaurants flourishing here. A classic example is the chicken nihari – a yummy chicken spicy stew that goes best with fresh idiyappams here.
Other Big hitters




Johnson Market is a major crowd-drawer each year. Try the street behind the mosque if you want to avoid the crowd. Madiwala, Bannerghatta and Yelehanka also have their share of Ramadan treats as well as most other neighbourhoods which have a mosque. If, by now, you’re hungry, head over to your nearest food stall and feast away.

Who put ‘malai’ in my tea?
"," The first sip of the tea tastes like basundi. Unbelievable? We think so too and take our second sip. This time, we pay more attention — no, that’s plain old cream with sugar crystals sprinkled on top. But who would’ve thought that a glass of tea would be topped with this? It takes around four sips for us to reach the actual tea at Devi Thaeneer Vidudhi near Begum Street in Triplicane. Around 20% of the glass is filled with their famous malai. At Devi, you order tea, and you get the malai variety. If you want the regular, unadventurous stuff, you have to inform tea ‘master’ M Anand.
The 28-year-old keeps the stove with the milk vessel on through the day. As a result, the milk is thick; Anand dutifully lets the cream that forms sit undisturbed. “So more malai keeps getting formed,” he tells us, ‘cutting’ tea in one swift motion for an auto driver, his regular customer.




Anand has been making tea at the shop for eight years. “Malai tea is my owner’s idea,” he says, adding that he knows only a handful of teashops in the city making this kind. “They are Golden Tea Stall and MAP on Ellis Road,” he explains, “And our other branch at Zam Bazaar.”
Priced at ₹ 8, a glass of tea at Devi is made under a minute. It’s an experience seeing Anand make it: he grabs one of the just washed tea glasses from the counter and rinses the insides with steaming hot water from a kettle. The glass tinkles as he spoons in sugar, followed by thick milk. The decoction comes next, which Anand lets spill into the glass like a tiny waterfall. One gigantic ‘cutting’ later, the tea is served with a topping of gleaming malai and sugar.




The amiable tea ‘master’ could be leaving for his hometown to get married in a year or two. “My family is looking for a suitable bride for me,” he says, smiling into the kettle. “Oru tea, without malai,” a customer walks in and tells him, and Anand grabs his next glass.
Anand makes around 300 cups of tea every day. How many does he have? “Three,” he says, when the auto driver, who’s been listening to our conversation, cuts in: “Five, admit it,” he laughs. Anand grins, saying, “Believe me, I don’t have more than three cups a day.” He doesn’t have the malai tea though. “Too much of malai can cause colds,” he explains.

Samrat Reddy has a ‘Drunken Monkey’
"," Samrat Reddy is yet to get his profile photos shot as founder and managing director of Hyderabad-based Drunken Monkey. The product and expansion plans have kept him so busy that the need for a photoshoot never occurred to him. And we’ll have you know, Samrat is just as cool and quirky as the packaging of his famous drinks.
An outdoor sports junkie and the owner of the very popular smoothie company, Drunken Monkey, Samrat is usually very methodical with his life and work unless he is on a holiday or is on a Sunday binge at home relishing his mom’s garelu and Andhra mutton curry. Also no matter where he is, “I have to be in Hyderabad for my corporate team cricket practise,” he adds. 




Samrat has worn many caps all under which he has nurtured different dreams. Choosing to take one step at a time, after acquiring an engineering degree, he worked in Australia for a while before heading off to Scotland to do an MBA. He love for smoothie is a result of his is habit of staying away from caffeine. “During my stay in Australia and UK, I observed that the sheer number of places or cafes offering coffee are far greater than the outlets which serve smoothies. It was in Scotland when I actually thought of setting up a smoothie business. I felt if given a chance to experience smoothies, a huge number of people would incorporate them into their lifestyle as it is a healthier. I was very clear from the beginning about what I eventually wanted to do. I had my plans chalked out, but didn’t impose any deadline for myself. The reason: I didnt want to rush to meet a deadline; I totally believe that haste makes waste. Also I am not the one to sit and wait for things to happen. While my dream of a smoothie place was incubating, I worked to gain more knowledge of the market and to manage a team. I worked for a while to manage our family steel production. That was a lot of learning,” says Samrat.
His learnings included being involved in a variety of businesses including a 3D animation and visualisation firm, which was way ahead of what was happening in India in terms of design and visual representation. He has also managed his family’s steel plant for over 4 years, after which he was a part of an oil drilling company in the US, also a Water Treatment Plant in Cameroon.
All this while, he equipped himself with another knowledge about smoothies and the equipment that would be required for it. His travels took care of most of his learning. “Smoothies in India are a sorry mix of cream, artificial flavours, topped with sugar. Whereas I wanted something absolutely pure. Through my travels, I understood what makes smoothies abroad so unique and satisfying. Almost like a meal,”adds Samrat.
He also decided to let it grow like a baby; one step at a time, “I wanted a slow and steady growth. I wasn't ready to push it before it was able to crawl or walk. That is why I chose not to take family money. That would have made me answerable and works against a deadline for the company to flourish,” smiles Samrat as he orders himself a detox drink.
After letting it grow organically in Hyderabad, Samrat has extended his business to Bengaluru, Mumbai, Pune and a few other cities.

A whiff of Goa in Green Park "," There is nothing quite like nostalgia, as I often say. I felt the magic of old memories one evening a couple of weeks ago when I went to meet two old friends, in a restaurant that I had first visited long years ago. I ate food that I always associate with leisure and fun. The amps belted out the unlikely combination of the Doors and Boney M. All put together, it turned the evening into a memorable one.
Okay, let’s start at the beginning. The friends in question are two great food lovers and chefs — Crescentia Scolt Fernandes and Chrysologus. I met them long years ago when I was going past Meharchand Market one day, and suddenly spotted a restaurant that served Goan food.
On the ground floor was a tent house, and on the first floor was Bernardo’s. I met the two owners, struck a chord, ate a grand meal, and followed them with great interest as they moved from Meharchand to Chittaranjan Park to Gurugram.
I always wanted to visit them again, but Gurugram was much too far for me. Then, recently, they got in touch with me and said that they were collaborating with this happening restaurant called Turquoise Cottage (TC).
I remember TC because many years ago, when restaurants were still opening up in Delhi, it had made a name for itself for its food, music and media nights. The restaurant was in Adchini those days, and is now in Green Park, And every weekend, on Saturdays and Sundays, Crescentia and Chrysologus are there with their special Goan dishes.
They know about my fondness for pork, so there was this delicious smoked Goan sausage dish with pao to begin with. Cres and Chrys make their own sausages (which they also sell), and this was spicy and smoky – and simply superb. One pork dish is never enough, so there was a plate of pork chilli fry, too — strips of succulent pork stir fried with onions, potatoes, chillies and spices. The pork was melt-in-the-mouth soft, with just the right amount of fat dripping from it, and I had a great time mopping up the fat with a bit of the pao, and listening to what they now call retro music. 
You cannot have Goan food and not have seafood. So we had something called Rissois de camarao – which is essentially a Portuguese dish of gujiya-like pastries stuffed with shrimp and other seafood, deep fried. With a casing of flour and bread crumbs and a minced shrimp stuffing, it was a delicious starter. The cammarao recheado was a dish of prawns stuffed with spicy tangy masala made with red chillies and toddy vinegar.
I thought I couldn’t eat another crumb by then, but decided I had to try out something that wasn’t pork or seafood. So we zeroed in on the chicken cafreal, a dish that had surprised me no end during my Goa visits – because I didn’t think I would get wowed by chicken. But the cafreal appeals to me because of the spices and the subtle flavours of coriander. Shallow fried, it allows the meat to trap the juices and the flavours well.
Sweet ending 
I ended the meal with some bebinca – a Goan-Portuguese dish prepared with coconut milk, flour and eggs – and some vanilla ice cream, and thought what a lovely evening it was. I was with old friends who were passionate about food. My kind of music was playing – well, blaring out would be more appropriate – on the terrace where we sat. Cres and Chrys, who were far away from me, had come closer. What else could one ask for?

The very many avatars of fries "," No longer are fries served as a sidekick to your burger or sandwich. Of late, this comfort food has undergone a makeover, and in its new avatar, finds a place of its own on restaurant menus — sometimes with an entire dedicated section running into pages.




“Fries are one of the most loved and relished comfort foods. Be it an accompaniment to other dishes or something to just munch on with drinks, fries are an all-time favourite. We wanted to expand the offerings by bringing an innovative touch to the classic fries,” says Sanju Arora, General Manager, The Irish House. He adds, “Initially, we just had the classic salted fries, which were extremely popular. Over the years, we introduced more options like garlic fries, sweet potato fries and then, a dedicated section of fries with toppings like Mac n cheese, chicken Bolognese, fried eggs, amongst others.”
Sahil Sabhlok, executive chef, Westin Pune Koregaon Park, opines, “With the advent of ‘progressive’ or ‘avant-garde’ cuisines, cafés and bars have also upped the ante. Potato, that too fried, is an all-time favourite to munch on and soaks up the alcohol well too. To add to it, it is hassle-free and cheap.”
Another reason is exposure to newer cuisines, says Sabhlok, “A few years ago, the dish poutine was unheard of in our menus, but now it is a part of bar menus across the country.”
Creative spree
The array of fries that restaurants today offer is endless — spicy, fiery, dry, loaded with sauces or gravies. Chili’s across India offers Texas cheese fries, which are home-cooked style fries, coated with Texas chilli, melted cheese and jalapeños. The crispy seasoned skin on the fries, tossed in truffle oil and served with truffle aioli sauce, smeared with garlic and freshly sourced herbs, is equally sought after.
Hard Rock Café has hot chilli fries, which are Cajun-spiced and crisp, topped with cheese sauce, sweet chilli drizzle and tangy masala. At The Bombay Fries, the XXXL Fries are served in a pizza box with jalapeños, olives, nachos and sauces. They also offer a Jain option.
Right on top




Chef Sabhlok points out the sheer scope for experimentation. “Chefs can choose to serve waffle fries, curly fries, steak fries, wedges, crinkle cut and potato tornado. The next step is to offer a variety of toppings. While the most popular toppings remain cheese and spice mix, many chefs are offering innovative toppings and dips like wasabi mayo, Indian spices, caramelised onions, sriracha mayo, sour cream and onion, chimichurri... The options are endless.”
Most cities in India, including Tier 2 towns, are now jumping on to the innovative fries bandwagon. While Tall Blonde French in Bengaluru serves Bollywood fries and peri peri fries that perk up your taste buds, The J in Nashik has two pages on their menu dedicated to fries. Popular ones include cheese mayo fries and Thai sweet chilli fries. 
The Independence Brewing Company in Pune, on the other hand, is known for its hand-cut, double-fried, crispy home fries.
Such is the popularity of fries that Sanket Agarwal, Founder, The Bombay Fries, decided to set up a chain of quick-service restaurants (QSRs) serving only fries. With outlets in Mumbai, Pune and Chennai, The Bombay Fries is wowing the palate of the younger crowd. “During my visits to USA, I saw these and was curious about how someone can just sell a side product and be so successful.”
F for Fries in Byculla, Mumbai, again is a small QSR, offering fries of all shapes and types. Their signature, dessert fries white plus dark — topped with chocolate — is a huge hit.
Non-vegetarian toppings range from shredded chicken to bacon and ham. Butter chicken fries and double-decker chicken fries are among the top sellers at Tall Blonde French. 
Sausage fries with smoked sausages at The J, Nashik are extremely popular, as are caramelised onion and grilled sausage fries and bacon and cheese fries at Chennai’s Double Roti. The pulled pork, bacon and cheese-loaded fries at Kolkata’s Macazzo sell at a whopping ₹330 per portion, with many takers. 
Basic shift
If the common potato isn’t your thing, an alternative is sweet potato, a typical choice for fries popularised by Chef Paul Kinny at 212 All Day Café & Bar.
Chef Sabhlok uses various root vegetables, and vegetables like sweet potato, yam, purple yam, beet, carrot, rutabaga, colocasia. At Indigo Deli, the sweet potato fries are served with thecha mayonnaise, giving them a local Maharashtrian twist. 
The Bombay Fries uses a variety of bananas, to create their own special healthy fries, whereas Gateway Taproom does buckwheat fries. So whether you’re a health nut or just looking to gorge, indulging in fries just got way more fun.

Who is afraid of red rice?
","“Try it,” I urge my friend, who is sceptical of making idlis with red rice. She is of the school that believes that rice leads to weight gain and causes diabetes. I send her some ponmani red rice and ask her to make idlis. “Three is to one, if you are using a mixer; four is to one if it is a grinder,” I advise. 




She grumbles a bit saying no one at home likes it and that the grain is too bold and it takes too long to cook... the list of complaints is interminable. But she makes the idlis and I have a convert.
She is not alone in her misconceptions about rice. Many people think rice is the fount of lifestyle diseases. But it is not. The culprit is not the rice, but the kind we eat. We polish it and strip it of its bran and process it so much that most of its minerals and vitamins are lost. 
Red rice had sort of disappeared from my table too. It made its second appearance into my life in my mid 30s. As a young child, I ate red rice grown by my great-grandmother. She sent us freshly milled rice once every two months. 
Once I moved out of Kerala, red rice became a memory and polished slender-grained white rice the norm. But when I began re-examining my food choices, I decided to bring red rice back. As part of the Save Our Rice Campaign, I learnt that most of the South Indian traditional varieties are red rice varieties. 
Since the revival of paddy seed work began in the Cauvery Delta region in Tamil Nadu, farmer families have reintroduced red rice into their own diet. While they began eating red rice as it was easily available to them, today these farmer families are well aware of the health benefits and cooking properties of the kattuyanam, sigappu kauni or kullakar grains and recommend it to visitors too.
“What pretty pink rice!,” exclaimed a little girl to whom I served some red rice and she promptly polished off her plate. The red-coloured kernel is due to the presence of anthocyanins and bran. Even when fully polished, the grain have a reddish tinge, and unpolished grains look like shiny maroon pebbles. 
Traditionally in Kerala, hand-pounded raw red rice (called onakkal-ari, meaning dried rice) is offered to temples. This is then cooked and served to the devotees. Many have this as part of their main midday meal. 
Flakes (aval) made from red rice retains almost all the bran. Full-bran red rice can be turned into red rice flour to be used in dishes like idiyappam, kolukattai, modakam, adai, kinnathappam and various snacks. The broken red rice is great for kanji (one of the tastiest dishes in my lexicon); nothing to match it with a dash of pickle. 
I have found innovative food bloggers also making rice cakes and puddings with red rice. I am waiting to cook a red rice risotto. We take pride in our ability to try foreign cuisines and be adventurous. So why be afraid of red rice?




My name is Red!
Tradtional red rice is grown widely in Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Karnataka (Sigappu kauni, Kattuyanam, Mappilai samba, Kuruva, Thondi and Thavalakannan are a few of them)
Red rice, minimally processed, has more micro nutrients and B complex vitamins than the polished rice
Ayurvedic physicians in ancient times used these varieties as medicine and for therapies
Rice is polished to increase its shelf life, but its nutrition is largely lost in the proccess
Parboiled red rice keeps longer, gives better recovery rate during paddy milling, retains more nutrition, is firmer, less sticky and more digestible but takes longer to cook
Medicinal red rice varieties are consumed unpolished to get maximum benefit
The more bran there is in the rice, the lower is its glycemic index (compared to its polished counterpart)
We also tend to eat less of red rice
What is parboiled rice?
When paddy is parboiled and dried and then milled, the resultant rice is called par boiled rice. This is a combination of the words partial and boiled. The process involves soaking the grain and cooking the paddy within the husk. It is then sun-dried to remove the moisture. It also leads to the transfer of nutrients in the bran to the rice kernel. The parboiling leads to the starches within the grain becoming gelatinised and hardened and the rice attains a translucent appearance. It also makes the cooked rice firmer and results in grains being distinct and separate

More breast cancer patients can skip chemo, says study
","Some 70% of women with early-stage breast cancer and an intermediate risk of cancer recurrence can safely skip chemotherapy after their tumours have been removed, U.S. researchers said on Sunday.
“This is a major finding,” said Dr. Larry Norton, a breast cancer expert at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York, who helped organise the government-funded study more than a decade ago.
“It means that maybe 100,000 women in the U.S. alone do not require chemotherapy,” Mr. Norton said.
The research, presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) meeting in Chicago, studied how to treat women with early-stage breast cancer that responds to hormone therapy.
Women were deemed to have a medium level risk of the cancer coming back based on a 21-gene panel known as Oncotype DX from Genomic Health. The test predicts the likelihood of cancer recurrence within 10 years. Those who score low on the test — from zero to 10 —are already told to skip chemotherapy after their tumours are removed and they receive hormone therapy. Those who score high — 26 to 100 — receive both hormone therapy and chemotherapy.
The study, dubbed TAILORx, was also published in the New England Journal of Medicine. It involved more than 10,000 women with breast cancer that had not spread to nearby lymph nodes and whose tumours respond to hormone therapy and test negative for the HER2 gene. Of those, 6,711 scored in the intermediate range of 11-25, and were randomly assigned hormone therapy alone or hormone therapy plus chemotherapy.
The study found that all women over 50 with this type of breast cancer could skip chemotherapy, a group that represented 85% of the study’s population. In addition, women 50 and younger who scored between zero and 15 could be spared chemotherapy and its toxic side effects.
Some benefits
However, chemotherapy did offer some benefit to women aged 50 and younger who had a cancer recurrence score of 16-25, researchers found. Dr. Steven Shak, chief scientific officer at Genomic Health, said about four in 10 women in the U.S. with early stage breast cancers are not tested for recurrence risk. He expects the study’s results will change that practice.
“This is going to provide the highest level of evidence now for our test being indispensable in clinical practice,” Dr. Shak said.
The company currently provides tests to more than 900,000 patients in more than 90 countries, Dr. Shak said. In the United States, the test costs $4,000 and is covered by Medicare and all major private insurers.

I am... Shilpa C. – Yoga instructor
","“My association with yoga was a coincidence. My mother had some health issues and I began to attend yoga classes at the Satyananda Yoga Research Centre to give her company. It was a one month course, but I soon realised the virtues of yoga. It opened me to a world I had never known. That was way back in 1999 and after practising yoga for 4-5 years regularly, I did the Yoga Teachers Training Course at Satyananda and became an instructor here. Since I held a teaching job for a while, I taught yoga at the centre in the evenings.
Yoga, for me, was a life-changing experience. I had weight problems which were kept in control with yoga and strict diet. Lot of other health niggles I had reduced considerably once I started yoga. It made my body more flexible. The biggest takeaway though was what yoga did to my mind; it relaxes the mind completely. My personal yoga sessions are for an hour in the morning.
I believe there are many misconceptions about yoga among people. When they think yoga, they think acrobatic postures. Yoga is about doing in a slow, relaxed way postures your body is comfortable with. But it is important to do it regularly to bring about change. Even simple asanas can relax you tremendously.
Here I do not teach very advanced courses. If people have health problems like high blood pressure or back pain, asanas that suit them are prescribed. In yoga, the mind is given as much significance as the body. It is through the mind that one can control the body. So here I teach meditation, yoga nidra (a relaxation technique done in shavasana) and pranayam too.
Most of the students who join for the month-long course are those around 40 and more. I don’t see many youngsters may be because they prefer something more active like being in a gym. Most sign in for a course when life-style related diseases have begun to raise their head. Not many are taking up yoga just to remain fit. But of course people are more fitness conscious now. In fact, people should not wait till they have some kind of illness to begin yoga. As they say, prevention is what one must be looking at. Of late, we have had many senior citizens too learning yoga. They are dedicated and they also have time on their hands. I tend to see that women are much more committed once they start out on something like this.”

Joe Bastianich gets personal
"," I am a bit nervous before my call with Joe Bastianich, the no-nonsense television judge known for binning a bad dish without blinking an eye. In May, the celebrity chef and winemaker returned to Season 9 of MasterChef US along with co-hosts Gordon Ramsay and Aarón Sanchez. 
Yet, contrary to his television avatar, he is chipper on the phone. We start with his early days as a bond trader on Wall Street. “Imagine, if I had stuck to that, I would have been retired, super rich and living on a yacht,” Bastianich, now 49, says. He was no stranger to the restaurant industry; born in Astoria, he practically grew up in a restaurant run by his parents. 
The first in his family to go to college, he was determined to make it big. “I had humble beginnings. I didn’t want to be poor like my family,” admits the chef, adding, “I worked on Wall Street and hated it. My mother suggested I quit and spend some time in Italy for a few years and develop my already existing passion for food and wine. I travelled around the country and returned to New York in 1991 to open my first restaurant.”
Hard talk
Today, Batali & Bastianich Hospitality Group — which the chef founded along with his mother, and celebrity chef Mario Batali — owns 30 restaurants worldwide, including the Michelin-starred Babbo and Del Posto in New York.
In May, his company released a statement saying it would end all ties with Batali in the wake of multiple sexual harassment claims made by women, many of whom had worked in the B&B Group’s kitchens. Earlier this year, the MasterChef judge also apologised for racist and sexist comments he had made in Italy. When I bring up Batali and three of the group’s restaurant closures in Las Vegas, Bastianich chooses not to comment. We talk about the show instead.




Constructive critic
Bastianich agrees that the MasterChef franchise has had a huge impact on our palates and culinary travel aspirations. “The show opened horizons and changed perspectives. People feel it can change their lives,” he says. What about his brusque manner and sometimes harsh criticism onscreen? “Reprimanding them is part of giving them genuine feedback,” he responds. “My main role as a judge is to steer a contestant’s journey. We become vested in them and we put effort into their food journeys.”
Glocal is the way 
 With appearances on MasterChef Italia, Bastianich’s fame extends to his country of origin. “Similar to India, where family and food are the two most important things in life, Italian families too are close-knit. Food is a way to relive our culture, especially for immigrants living away from home,” he says. Part of his inherited culinary heritage is an emphasis on local, sustainable food. “The essence of Italian cuisine is hyper-regional, and a cook in Milan will always use seasonal produce. It is part of our cuisine culture,” he explains, finding parallels in the contemporary culinary world. “Campaigns like #unwaste are great, and heirloom food is finding its place across the globe. We should eat responsibly and adopt sustainable practices.”
Feel the pressure
Our conversation steers towards the recent suicide of Anthony Bourdain, a friend and mentor. “I didn’t say much about his death because I had no words to express my feelings. He was a great legacy. I even did a chapter in his book, Kitchen Confidential,” he says, describing how he turned to the late chef when he decided to write his own memoir, Restaurant Man. “I was trying to write something really honest and personal. He showed me the way to ensure each page had an impact on the reader.”
Depression in kitchens has become a talking point, with more media attention being given to the harsh working conditions at many elite restaurants. “We work in an environment of high pressure and long hours,” agrees Bastianich. “The problem of alcoholism is a reality of the industry. This is a good time to alter people’s mindset about mental health issues, and let them know there is help available.”
A recent trend finds the culinary world’s renegade citizens eschewing accolades and ratings. Last year, legendary French chef Sébastien Bras was one of many to return the Michelin stars awarded to his restaurant, Le Suquet à Laguiole, citing anonymous reviews and pressure to perform as a reason. “Yes, there is a lot of pressure to maintain standards,” Bastianich agrees, “but I think people who are drawn to that kind of restaurant want to be judged, they want a name, by customers and journalists and they do the hard work they do,” he concludes.
MasterChef Junior US, also hosted by Bastianich, airs every Saturday at 8 pm on Star World and Star World HD in India

The sound of sizzlers
","The weather, in more ways than one, is beginning to be unkind. The nights are short, the days long and challenging. The heart though longs once more for days of leisure, nights of pleasure. As a poet said in similarly political volatile climate many summers ago, “Dil dhoondta hai phir wohi fursat ke raat din…” Those days are still to be hugged, those nights yet to be embraced.
The other day though I stole an evening of pleasure. The occasion, nay, the excuse was provided by the ongoing sizzlers’ food festival at The Claridges. It was to be my Pickwickian moment. For a man who swears by Dhaba cuisine, it takes more than a few sizzlers to turn up at any other restaurant in a hotel I have grown up loving, admiring. It was provided by some delectable company — a man who has been my friend through many a prayer and three charming ladies, each of whom added to the mood of the moment with their political insight, literary flourishes. And of course, their take on the food which, honestly, needed little recommendation.
However, as most people would appreciate, conversion, even partial, is not an easy process. Yes, I had momentarily kept aside my love for Dhaba, but the heart is difficult to please. So there, sitting at Pickwicks, I requested the chef if I could get to taste that delectable kabab platter from Dhaba. I was in luck. Soon, there were four kinds of steaming hot kababs on our table, each more tempting than the other. The best was the seekh, hot, soft and succulent.
It was a delicious, if politically incorrect way to begin our food journey. But didn’t I say I was in luck? Soon, I got a chance to make amends for my indiscretion thanks a Surf platter. It had Norwegian salmon, lobster, Chilean sea bass and the rest. With smoke and that gently sizzling sound emerging from the dish, it begged to be polished off in a hurry. Even potato wedges found happy takers. I didn’t linger over the platter; nor did my co-diners.
After Surf, it was time for Turf, not necessarily a case of classic alliteration but the platters with chicken, lamb chops and Cajun potatoes was not a bad follow-up. The downside was the tenderloin steak. It was a challenge for my fork and knife first, then my teeth.
What Pickwicks lost with tenderloin was more than adequately made up with the classic sizzler with stuffed chicken and slow roasted vegetables. Not one to even think of trying out any sausages, I piloted my friends across the table to skip over to the veggie platter which offered us cheddar stuffed eggplant, cottage cheese steak and chickpea patty. My years as a journalist with the attendant travelling had prepared me well to appreciate the offer. I took a helping, smiled, took another bite, smiled some more. The erudite women from the hotel were obviously loving it.
But, hey I had started the session on a note of political incorrectness by tasting a Dhaba platter. I decided to end the same way too. Once again I gave in to temptation. Once again, it was delectable. As for the journey, well, it had several enchanting moments, some tasty ones too.
Saying my good byes to the lovely ladies, I stepped out of the hotel with Aslam, my pious friend. As he got down from the car a few kilometres down the road, I switched on FM radio. A song, “Kitna Haseen Hai Mausam, Kitna Haseen Safar Hai” wafted across. I slunk into my seat. An evening of leisure continued with some more pleasure.

‘I was 19 when I first travelled by myself’
","It was a year after the psychiatrist had decided that I had bipolar disorder. When I asked him about it, he merely wrote out a prescription and rang the bell for the next patient.
After a year of self-imposed house arrest and a dozen half-hearted attempts at ending my life, I was fed up. I couldn’t bear to see my family suffer as well. With the little money I had earned from tuition classes, I booked tickets, left a farewell note and boarded the train to Kolkata with the hope of joining the Missionaries of Charity.
However, no matter how much I pleaded, the sisters gently said that I was just running away. And that I hadn’t received my calling from God. That I should be going back home. But for a week, they provided me shelter, food and lots of love. After much contemplation by the mother’s tomb, I realised it wasn’t really a calling. It was an escape.
Which is what travel is. An escape from the mundaneness of a life filled with weeks of hour-long commutes to the office, mind-numbing meetings, meaningless small talk, and mindless weekend visits to the cinema. An escape that clears up the clutter in your head, gives you time to think, to see, and to bring back belief into a life that’s running out of hope.
Most of my bipolar episodes have been triggered by people telling me how to live my life, what to do, what not to. And very often, ‘That’s impossible. You won’t be able to do it.’ Oh, but how do you explain to them that you won’t know if you haven’t tried?So, when you do travel by yourself, when you share a hotel room with a match-fixer and couch-surf into houses of strangers, when you meet Naxals in the dilapidated estates of Odisha and travel by public transport through Bastar and Dantewada, when you board the unreserved compartment in UP and Bihar, when you trek solo in a new country, when you find yourself at a remote waterfalls with just two other men — both contract killers discussing a recent kill — you know. You know that if you trust the world, it protects you.
Like every other girl, I was taught to fear the world. Clothes weren’t meant to protect me from the weather but from men. Every man was a crook until proven otherwise. Every maid and helper was a thief in disguise. If you did something different, if you called a male friend home or invited the delivery person in and offered him juice — oh what sin. I didn’t understand why people were this way. Why this fear and distrust?
In her book You Can Heal Your Life, Louise Hay writes about the four causes for every illness — guilt, anger, fear and resentment. I have been saying her positive affirmations and realised that love conquers all . I have realised that bipolar disorder is just a term coined to run clinics and sell drugs. To tell us that we suffer from craziness. That if we choose to sing and dance for nothing at all — it is a disorder and the drugs will fix it. At NIMHANS though, a psychiatrist said something that gave me hope. She said that I have been blessed with bipolar. She even said that if I tried really hard, I could someday get off the meds completely.
When I was asked to write this article — it got me thinking about the label that I have been stuck with for the last 10 years. I never hid it because I wanted to break the taboo.
Now, it’s time to get rid of the label. If there’s one thing I have realised, it’s that there is bipolarity in all of us — in varying degrees. So it’s okay if you feel confused and lost. You are not alone.When the blues come knocking, travel. Pack your bags and board the bus to anywhere. Rough it out. Live on ₹500 a day. Share a room with a stranger. Trust the universe. It will keep you safe. Even if harm comes your way, look for the silver lining. There always is one, often much thicker than we make it out to be.
And, if you really want to travel, leave your smartphones behind. Remember, you are smarter than your phone.

Three in five HIV-carriers now have access to drugs: UN ","Almost three in five people infected with HIV, or 21.7 million globally, took antiretroviral therapy in 2017 — a new record for anti-AIDS drug access, the UNAIDS said on Wednesday.
There were 36.9 million people living with the immune system-attacking virus in 2017, of whom 15.2 million were not getting the drugs they need — the lowest number since the epidemic exploded, the joint UN programme on HIV/AIDS reported.
Hailing progress in curbing new infections and deaths, the agency nevertheless lamented the mounting human toll: almost 80 million infections and 35.4 million lives lost since the first cases became known in the early 1980s.
Progress made to date risks being halted, even reversed, if funding and world attention is allowed to dwindle, the agency warned.
Mission 2020
“We are short by $7 billion per year to maintain our results and to achieve our objectives for 2020,” UNAIDS executive director Michel Sidibe said. “Without these resources, there is a big risk of the epidemic rebounding, of an increase in mortality due to AIDS,” he said.
In 2017, about $20.6 billion was available for AIDS programmes in low-and middle-income countries which funded about 56% from their own budgets, said the report.
Under Donald Trump, the U.S. administration — a major funder of AIDS programmes historically, has threatened to cut spending.
The UN goal is for 90% of all HIV-positive people to know their status by 2020. Of these, at least 90% must receive ART, and the HIV virus be suppressed in 90% of those.
Assessing progress towards the target, UNAIDS said 1.8 million people became newly infected with HIV in 2017.
This was down from about 1.9 million the year before, and 3.4 million at the peak of the epidemic in 1996. 
Deaths declined from 9,90,000 to 9,40,000 year-on-year, compared to 1.9 million in 2005 and 1.4 million in 2010.
Antiretroviral therapy
The number of people on antiretroviral therapy (ART) grew from 19.4 million in 2016 to 21.7 million last year — up from a mere 6,11,000 in the year 2000 and 2.1 million in 2005, said the report released in the run-up to the International AIDS Conference in Amsterdam next week.
This helped boost the number of people living with the virus from 36.3 million in 2016 to 36.9 million last year.
Despite more than three decades of research, there is no cure or vaccine and HIV-positive people have to take lifelong treatment that can be expensive and have nasty side-effects.
ART inhibits the virus and can limit its spread between people — mainly through sex — but does not kill it.
UNAIDS reported large variation between world regions in the battle against the killer virus.
In the West Asia and north Africa, for example, less than a third of people with HIV have access to ARV, only 36% of those in eastern Europe and central Asia, and 40% in west and central Africa. For west and central Europe and North America, the number is 78%, with about 1.7 million out of 2.2 million infected people on ARV, said UNAIDS. In east and southern Africa — home to 53% of people living with HIV in the world — deaths declined by 42% from 2010 to 2017, thanks largely to the widespread rollout of treatment.
However, “there has been no reduction in AIDS-related mortality in eastern Europe and central Asia since 2010, and deaths from AIDS-related illness increased by 11% in the West Asia and North Africa,” it cautioned.

In a pickle ","Parul Bhatt was probably the only person in Chennai who was upset when it drizzled recently. “I had just placed all my pickles on the terrace to dry,” she says, adding, “March to June is my favourite season as I get the best quality mangoes then and can make many batches.”
Bhatt launched her traditional Gujarati pickles three years ago. “I grew up in Ahmedabad and came to Chennai after marriage. My mom would send me a variety of Gujarati pickles, as we Gujaratis are passionate about our pickles. After some years I started pickling, having learnt all the tricks and nuances from my mom.”
 
Four years ago, Bhatt began bottling chunda, methia keri and gor keri pickles and distributing it to friends. Based on their feedback, she modified the recipes and by the next year, she was selling her pickles under the brand Parul’s Magic.
Having lived in Chennai, Bhatt says she has developed a taste for vadu manga of Tamil Nadu and aavakai of Andhra. “But for me and many from my community, traditional Gujarati pickles are a must have. I decided to sell my pickles as there were not many options in the city,”




Chunda, a sweet, spicy and slightly sour pickle, is her best seller, courtesey handpicked mangoes from Andhra that are grated, sun dried and allowed to ferment naturally. Another popular one is the sweet and sour methia keri, a mango pickle wherein fenugreek is powdered with mustard and coriander seeds, and to which chilli powder is added. Gor keri pickle, yet another mango jaggery combination, tastes better when it is allowed to mature for a few months.
Once Bhatt standardised her Gujarati pickles, she started experimenting with other vegetables. She uses tamarind and tomato paste for pickling capsicum. She also attempted a Punjabi pickle with channa methi and mango. “Recently I made ginger and garlic pickle, with a hint of mango. Some of my customers told me that they used this pickle to marinate paneer, vegetables and meat,” says Bhatt.




“When it comes to pickling, I always go by seasonal vegetables. I make carrot and cauliflower pickles during September to December. Similarly, I source green chilli from Bhavnagar in Gujarat during November and December. For amla, the best time is from November to January. Needless to say, April to June is when you get best quality mangoes,” Bhatt says.
Parul’s Magic is available at the Nilgiris outlet in Neelangarai and at her office in CIT Colony, Mylapore. For details, call 9841014925.

South Indian tiffin amidst Delhi's food streets ","What are the first few things that come to mind when we talk about the street food in Delhi? Golgappe? Chole-Bhature? or Bread Pakode? What if we tell you there is a place hidden in Delhi’s streets that serves scrumptious dosas and parottas, idli and upma?
Mathew Café stands inconspicuously among other food shacks on a busy street in the capital. Most of these specialise in a variety of Delhi staples — aloo parathas, kadhi-rice, chole-kulche, paneer–naan... From a distance, the café seems like just any other. It is only when you get closer that the difference unfolds.
I arrive at the café early on a breezy Sunday morning. The place is abuzz, the air heavy with the aroma of sambhar and clouds of steam rising from the dosa griddle. The tables are already occupied by families and about a dozen men and women await their orders. Half a dozen more wait for refills. But none of the men behind the counters seem perturbed.
“To me, Mathew Café is synonymous with South Indian tiffin in Delhi. Whatever be the time of day, you will always get fresh food here. That it is also authentic South Indian fare is an added benefit,” says Simi Nair, a regular. The menu is extensive — dosas, idlis, vadas, pongal, utthapam, parrotta, upma, pulav, coffee, tea — and the pricing inviting. I want to sample everything, but make do with just masala dosa, idli, and kurma parotta.
The dosas come after a long wait. Wrapped around a generous filling of potatoes, they are crisp and golden. They also happen to be the hottest selling item. The sambhar is a perfect blend of spicy and tangy. The parotta, meanwhile, is fluffy, crisp and tender:Served in a portion of three with a coconut-based vegetable kurma, it stand apart in bread pakora-dominated Delhi.
“I first spotted Matthew Café in 1999, while walking home after work. I had just come from Chennai and was missing the food here, and suddenly the aroma of pongal wafted through the air. I was pulled to it like a bee to nectar. It has been almost 20 years since, and I still come here for breakfast,” says D Kar, who works in Gurugram. Looking at him gushing over his pongal, I cannot help but order one too. One mouthful of the ghee-laden dish, and I know why the cafe is a hit.

Bye Bye Burgerman!
","In 2006, when McDonalds was nothing more than an urban legend, Burgerman was a brand that brought us double patty burgers and sausages on a stick, which only Americans on Star Movies and HBO ate during meal times. Burgerman was the result of a college project that went rogue and took over Chennai. Sunil Cherian, the owner of the brand, decided to serve fast food even faster when he found a way to make and dispense delicious burgers out of 25 sq. feet kiosks around the city.
Burgerman burgers had a unique taste, were easy on the pocket and made available to everyone through the 50 kiosks that opened in the city. Once we got hooked, we let ourselves get reeled right in! Soon, veteran customers took to being a part of the burger making process and asking for extra sauce, knowing full well that it would drip down their faces as they bit into their juicy burgers. Their delicious mayonnaise was for those who liked their burgers to be rich and creamy, the barbeque sauce was for people who liked their burgers to have a slightly sweet flavor and their fiery Mexican sauce was to appease the taste buds of those who liked Andhra food. Whatever combination of sauces we liked, the men who worked in the burgerman kiosks were always very understanding of our preferences and generous in their servings.
Those of us who were paying attention realized, starting from around 2009, a lot of the Burgerman kiosks in the city were beginning to be replaced by random burger brands. We found ourselves travelling all the way from Anna Nagar to Nungambakkam to eat our favorite brand of burgers. At a time when autos in Chennai did not run on meters and getting anywhere to anywhere required a good ten minutes of heated haggling, this was quite a level of commitment to feel towards a brand.
In 2014, the only kiosk standing is the one on Cathedral road and that too, just till the end of the month. Come May, the brand that fed Chennai burgers before McDonald’s found its way here will shut shop. “Burgerman started in my garage and the brand was built out of passion, I do not want to give it out to franchisees.”, says Sunil Cherian as he bids adieu to his burger brand, to take over his family business, after opening the 100 burgerman kiosks that he hoped to. “I still own the brand, I’m not giving that up. So the day Chennai needs a good burger place, we’ll come back”, says Mr. Cherian, laughing as he realizes that he sounds like quite the Dark Knight!

Amritsari delights
","Dipped in oodles of ghee and butter,Amritsari cuisine never fails to delight. Hotel Grand Bay presents flavours of Amritsar at its restaurant The Welcomecafe Oceanic.
At the end of a particularly hot and sultry day as I step into the hotel’s café, a glassful of chilled makhani lassi welcomes me. Be warned, this traditional Amritsari cuisine is not for weight-watchers as I realise the moment I take a sip. The other options include pudina sherbet and wood apple sherbet. 
The hotel’s executive chef Sridhar Kare and his team have curated a buffet menu that comes straight from the kitchens of Amritsar. 
The flavourful gosht adraki shorba, clear soup served with chunks of meat, is just right to work up my appetite. On the chef’s recommendation, I try the kasturi murgh tikka. 
The well marinated meat is tender. It has a hint of kasturi methi, with a bit of pineapple juice lending it a slightly tangy taste. 
One of the main specialities of the feast was the maa ki  dal with a layer of butter on top. 
Made with lentils, red kidney beans, cream and butter, this dish is rich and has a flavourful taste.The creamy dal is best relished with stuffed kulche and paratha from the live counters. Next to come in the main course is the rahra gosht, thick, rich gravy made of mutton and keema and pairs well with butter naan. 
The deep fried macchhi Amritsari isn’t for people who prefer the fish without the maida coating. 
 To cater to the local palate, the chef has introduced a special biryani called bhatti murg biryani. “Punjab is not known for biryanis. But I have tried to bring about some improvisation with a biryani using tandoori chicken,” says Kare. 
For dessert, I taste the mango rabri, which was a sure winner for its mild sweetness and small pieces of juicy mangoes. 
The moong dal halwa, phirni, garjar ka halwa and stuffed Kesari pista gulab jamun jostle for brownie points too.

In search of peas and manga
","With all the juicy ripe mango varieties that make their way to our home, this year there were generous amounts of killimukku manga too from my sister-in-law’s farm. No matter how old one is, this variety brings out the child in any mango-obsessed person. I love to buy killimukku off the roadside vendor especially when the manga is cut to resemble an open flower and is coated from the tip all the way to the end in salt and red chilli powder. And if the manga has a tinge of yellow in it, it means there will also be a bit of sweetness that makes the otherwise tart treat even more delicious. 
However too much of killimukku manga and chilli can spell disaster, so what else can one make with it? 
But of course, the thenga manga pattani sundal !
A few decades ago before street food became so fashionable, we would rush out of our homes on hearing the ‘thenga manga pattani sundal man’. He came promptly at 4 pm around the Race Course circle, and if memory serves me right he was an elderly person always in a white dhoti and shirt. He had a rectangular tin in which the tasty sundal lay and on the sides were paper cones to hold that sundal when we bought it off him. I so regret not asking that thatha his name, because he stopped coming and we did not know where to find him. But in those happy days when he still showed up, he would dip the steel ladle deep into the hollow of the tin as we waited patiently. 
The cones made from old newspapers were filled to the brim and then folded over for us to carry back home without spilling. By the time we crossed the road and opened our individual parcels, the paper would be soggy but heavily infused with the aroma of this unique evening snack.
It is also healthy 
This humble dish ticks all the right boxes. It is gluten free, vegan, high protein, sugar-free, low-carb, etc. It’s a snack that is so typical of Tamil Nadu that Wild Planet Resort makes a mention of it as a must-try when visiting this part of the country. It’s also popular as ‘beach sundal’ on Marina beach, Chennai. 
I love the traditional way of making this sundal, without the modern additions of carrots, tomatoes, and so on. The pattani  used is always the dried white pea which needs to be soaked overnight or at least for eight hours before cooking. The manga is either cubed or grated according to preference but do choose a variety that isn’t too sour. The coconut is ground along with green chillies and ginger.
 A light tempering of mustard seeds and curry leaves in a fragrant oil of choice is followed by adding the ground coconut, chillies and ginger, and finally the cooked peas. Add salt, toss well and take off the fire. Add the raw mango bits and mix well. And just to complete the perfect snack, finish off with a squeeze of lime and you are good to go.

Chai is still chai, but with AI
"," Chai Point fans would be delighted to know that the tea retail chain recently-launched its 100th store in India. Located in Indiranagar, the store is loaded with tech, high on design and of course, has more tea, accompanied by a new tea-centric menu.
“Apart from the fact that this is our 100th store, this is also kind of a 2.0 Chai Point entry from a design philosophy standpoint,” says its co-founder and CEO Amuleek Singh Bijral.
“We are an omni-channel platform and the store is one of them. The design philosophy is of warmth, authenticity and progressiveness. Those are the characteristics we want to show.”
Progressiveness, explains Bijral, also includes environmental responsibility. “That means brands that are ‘green’, which is why you will find a lot of those elements in our store. We have selected indoor plants, we are showcasing our ‘Garden to Glass’ programme where we select tea and coffee gardens on a monthly basis to bring single origin teas for our customers. This is important also because customers want to know where their tea is coming from.”
The chain is also continuing its eco-friendly philosophy with its bagasse plates, corn-starch based cutlery, and wooden stirrers, though Bijral acknowledges, they are not yet 100 per cent plastic-free.
“We track this efficiently in our supply-chain. We are also particular about waste-segregation at the store level. We are looking for innovative ways of waste management. Some of the waste we generate is valuable, such as used tea leaves, coffee powder and lemon rinds. We are looking for partners with high supply chain and logistical capability to pass it onto organic farming plants or farms.”
Among the highlights in the new 1,200 sq ft store, which includes al-fresco seating and wood furniture with white exposed brick walls, is their tech-heavy AI-based facial recognition feature that is located at the billing counter.
“The facial recognition feature will engage customers on our loyalty programme. We want to reduce the friction for customers, of identifying themselves as they walk into the store. With this feature, there will be no need for customers to give their numbers each time.”
Along with the feature, they are also launching a new rewards programme, that has more product-centric benefits rather than cashback or financial incentives.
The feature, which will soon be launched in phases across Chai Point stores, is integrated into their core technology platform Shark, which runs all their retail channels including their Android-based BoxC dispensers.
“It is important for an omni-channel brand that is into delivery, dispensing and stores, to have a common technological backbone. That is why we are aggressively investing in this, it is part of our philosophy. And our customers expect it,” Bijral explains.
“If the brand has to be relevant and remain close to customers, even if the product category, chai, is 3,000 years old, you have to take this up. And that is what we are doing.”
At the same time, Bijral reassures, the chain still maintains its focus on its product, chai.
“This time, we are introducing three more variants of chai, including lemongrass, Sulemani and cold brew ice chais.”
The menu now offers new interpretations of Indian classics such as Nawabi Chicken Croissant or Mathri with three beans masala - an Indian take on Mexican nachos. It also includes desi snacks such as Rajdhani cutlets and Tutti Frutti Bun Maska.

New clue to Huntington’s disease
"," 
A study by researchers at the Department of Genetics, Delhi University, South Campus, has shown that it is possible to restrict the progression of Huntington’s disease by increasing insulin signalling in the brain’s neuronal cells. 
The study, which was conducted in fruit flies (Drosophila), found that increasing the level of insulin signalling enriches the cellular pool of proteins that are essential for cellular functioning and survival. This in turn restores the cellular transcription machinery, which typically collapses due to the disease, and thus stops the disease from progressing.
Dr. Surajit Sarkar, who led the study, said “The study was a follow up to investigations which had revealed that the insulin signalling pathway, which is a critical controller of cellular metabolism and energy homeostasis, was severely compromised in Huntington’s and other polyglutamine disorders like SCA3.”
Still without a cure
There is no treatment or cure for Huntington’s at present. Afflicted individuals lose their ability to walk, talk, think and reason. This disease begins between ages 30 and 45, and every individual with the gene for the disease will eventually develop the disease. It is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder, which means that even if one parent carries the defective Huntington’s gene, their offspring has a 50:50 chance of inheriting the disease.
When experiments were conducted to check whether it would help if the level of insulin signalling was increased by up-regulating the insulin receptor in the disease affected neuronal cells, researchers found that it worked.
They then tried to unravel the molecular mechanism. They found that improving the insulin signalling pathway resulted in a significant reduction in the cellular level of neurotoxic protein aggregates or inclusion bodies, with a remarkable decrease in the neuronal cell death. 
“It appears that enhanced level of insulin signalling rejuvenates the neuronal cells which are otherwise stressed during disease condition. Our findings strongly suggest that anti-diabetic drugs could be efficiently utilised to restrict the pathogenesis of polyglutamine disorders,” the study says.
Commenting on the work, Dr. Krishnananda Chattopadhyay, Head of the Structural Biology and Bioinformatics Division at the Indian Institute of Chemical Biology, Kolkata, who was not involved in the study, said, “The study has immense potential application. Subsequent investigations by including higher organisms and anti-diabetic drugs would provide a novel approach to combat the devastating human polyglutamine disorders.” 
The study by Dr. Sarkar and Dr. Kritika Raj has been published in the journal, Molecular Neurobiology. The work was supported by research grants from the Department of Biotechnology. — India Science Wire

A touch of Swiss
","Stepping into the cool confines of Ottimo Cucina Italiana at ITC Grand Chola is a blessed relief from the searing Chennai heat.
Through the open kitchen one can see Peter Wyss, who has been part of the luxurious Gstaad Palace in Switzerland for 41 years now. Chef Wyss is in India as part of a four-city tour organised by Four Seasons Wines to promote the pairing of Indian wines with international food. Ironically, Four Seasons Wines is not registered in Tamil Nadu due to state government regulations, and so the restaurant is not permitted to serve the home-grown wine.
Nevertheless, we sit down to lunch with Abhay Kewadkar, chief winemaker and director of Four Seasons Wines and Ajit Bangera, senior executive chef, ITC Grand Chola. Our meal begins with a refreshingly pink cocktail of re-carbonated white wine blended with lychee juice, pomegranate seeds and crushed ice. The cute little tartlets filled with Gruyère cheese, served as starters, are quite delicious. The salad that follows is pretty basic, greens and pine nuts, with tomato marmalade adding an interesting element.
Chef Wyss says, “What I liked about cooking here in India is that everything on the menu is seasonal. Back at Gstaad, we source ingredients like strawberries and mangoes from all around the world.” Hence, his Swiss version of risotto, which is thicker than its Italian counterpart, comes with a generous smattering of fresh, diced vegetables, topped with mountain cheese. It turns out to be a tad too salty and quite heavy. One can imagine savouring such a dish in a chalet on the Swiss Alps, but for Chennai’s muggy weather, it doesn’t do much.
A potato röschti topped with succulent grilled chicken and mushroom sauce follows. It’s excellent paired with a glass of red wine. Dessert, as they say, was truly the icing on the cake. A tart composed (there’s no better way to describe this creation) of melt-in-your-mouth puff pastry topped with sliced apples, caramel sauce and a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream is the highlight of the meal.
Chef Wyss says, “India could be making better wine than France in 20 to 50 years. There is a lot of competition and it takes time, but I believe it will happen.”
He then passes us some freshly-made macrons and delightful Lindt chocolate: what better way to end a feast.

Morning socials
","Tucked away in a corner of Anna Nagar, the Gandhi Park is abuzz with activity well before the crack of dawn. From walking to jogging, most people find their own pace to move around the park, while some others play a game of badminton and a few more take part in a group yoga session. The children keep themselves occupied on the swings and the monkey bars or walk along side their parents, looking at the morning sunlight dripping in through the canopy of trees. As the summer sun signals everyone that it is time to wrap up their morning workout session, Palanichamy and his wife, Lalithabai, who are practitioners of Siddha, walk in with a home-brewed Siddha drink to kick start everyone’s morning. A concoction made of many Indian herbs such as betel leaves, neem, omam and pepper, the drink proves to be a socialising agent for all the fitness enthusiasts around.
People from all walks of life gather around to chat over their morning health drink which has become an indispensible part of their workout sessions. Retirees, advocates, bank managers, railway officers and people from different professional disciplines sip their drink and voice their concerns about the social and political issues of the day. Over a cup of health drink, the early risers of Anna Nagar have found a place to meet and make friends, often discussing problems from work and life, to clear their mind before they start their day. “We have too many personal and social responsibilities during the day, so we only get to do this in the mornings”, says Nallaperumal and complains that without the drink he feels sluggish throughout the day.
The brewers of this famous concoction, Dr. Palanichamy and Dr. Lalithabai, are retired Siddha doctors who fell in love while they were qualifying themselves in Indian medicine. After travelling through South India, educating people about various Indian herbs and medicines, the couple moved to Chennai to enjoy their retirement. For 11 years they frequented the park before they came upon the idea of providing their home-brewed drink to their old friends and now, many new ones. “It’s all about sharing what you know,” says Dr. Palanichamy, who smiles generously at everyone and holds the same views about happiness. “When we’re happy in life, it is important to spread the happiness to those we come across.”
Married for the last 40 years, the retired doctor couple still seem very much in love with each other and with life. Dr. Lalithabai’s love for variety makes sure that the morning drink she makes has different ingredients and flavour every day. To mark the beginning of the summer vacation, a health drink that tasted deceptively similar to lemon juice was made for the children who’ve begun to visit the park in the mornings. This just goes to show that whatever your age, your profession or preferred morning exercise routine, the morning socials in Gandhi Park will be more than happy to have you join them.

When in Rome, eat like a Roman ","I arrived in Rome all set to take on wood-fired pizzas, hand-made pasta and vibrant gelato. And while I ate them all in the one week I spent there, I also learnt a lot about regional Roman cuisine and other Italian delicacies. in particular while devouring my way through the Roman dishes and other regional Italian delicacies from near and far.
On our first day in Rome, based on our tour guides advice we found a table at Taverna Romana for lunch. It was Roman cuisine at its best with specialised in Roman cuisine and had on offer local specialities like saltimbocca, biscetta, oxtail stew, roasted leg of lamb, tripe and Guinea fowl among other local specialities on the menu.
Later, we went hunting It was pasta time and we went on a hunt for signature pasta dishes of Roma — carbonara, amatriciana, cacio e pepe and gricia, all It was an introduction to a simple yet flavoursome fare. After a couple of days in Rome, I learnt about its signature pasta dishes - which were simple yet packed with loads of flavour.The key ingredients in these pasta sauces were guanciale and pecorino Romano cheese. At Salumeria Roscioli restaurant, crispy and salty bits of guanciale (salt-cured pork cheek), in the pasta sauces were sinfully delicious. The key ingredients in these pasta sauces were guanciale and pecorino Romano cheese. we had the opportunity to try out these fine Roman pastas.
Restaurants specialising in other regional Italian cuisines were also scattered around Rome. We also said hello to the regional produce of Sicily at A Maidda in the Trastevere neighbourhood. introduced us to the gave us an insight into the food culture and regional produce of Sicily. A wide variety of seafood, along with pistachios and capers, featured heavily on the Sicilian menu. We had Sicilian cannoli are also not to be missed for breakfast. The tubular pastry was filled with creamy ricotta, then to order and then garnished with pistachios, chocolate chips, almonds, orange rind or cherries, based on personal preference.




After eating a fair share of pizza-guzzling through the week, We discovered Bonci Pizzarium only towards the end of our stay in Rome. Pizzas here were priced by based on their weight, and the toppings were mind-blowing. The in-house chef was famous for makinges over a 100 different topping combinations in a day. There is no menu, and at any given time there are about a dozen different kinds of pizzas to choose from. Their pizza base is was very light and the toppings were creative: with options like slices of rare steak, eggs with truffle, red wine-cured meats, mortadella and crushed hazelnuts to name a few.

Irani cafes make a millenial comeback
","It is a busy day at the café, bearers flit between tables balancing trays of tea cups and saucers of bun-maska. Waiters, meanwhile, scribble orders in a jiffy — poro, akuri, French toast, keema pav, rasta sandwich, mawa cake. The place is abuzz with a steady drone of guests; the air is fragrant with the aroma of fresh food. This scene might look like it is straight out of an Irani café in South Mumbai, except it is happening in the heart of Punjabi Delhi.
The situation is similar at Irani Café, Pune, Café Regal, Jamshedpur, The Bawa, Pune, and Kayani & Co, Mumbai. On the verge of extinction until a few years ago, the Irani café culture is making a comeback, and its effect can be seen everywhere. The only difference? In the new scheme of things, the Irani café culture comes together with Parsi food traditions to create an electric combination, which is winning over patrons across demographics. Looking at their popularity, it is hard to tell that these cafés and their recipes were dying until just a few years ago.
“The credit for revival of the Irani café culture and Parsi food goes entirely to SodaBottleOpenerWala; they came at a time when the Irani cafés were dying but the interest in regional cuisines was growing,” Vernika Awal, an award-winning food blogger and journalist from Mumbai, tells us over the phone. “Thanks to them, the cafés have had a new lease of life,” she goes on to add.
Movers and shakers
Since opening its first outlet in Gurugram, a few years ago, SodaBottleOpenerWala continues to lead the way for smaller Parsi and Irani establishments around the country. The place not only helped people open up to quirky décor, aluminium plates, and cutting chai glasses, but also to experimenting with new flavours, textures and combinations. “At SodaBottleOpenerWala, we pay a tribute to the dying legacy of a Bombay Irani café, bringing with it typical Parsi cuisine and some Irani specialities too,” chef and manager Anahita Dhondy, who manages the Gurugram, Delhi, and Bengaluru outlets, tells us. “The food we serve is a mix of recipes from Iran, Persia, Goa and Mumbai,” she adds.
“Parsis are known for eating meat for breakfast. The practice began with having the leftover meat dishes with pav in the morning and soon became a tradition. Then there are the eggs, which no Parsi can do without.” 
“We have our own bakery, so we can ensure the pav, cakes, kharis, and buns that accompany our food are completely authentic,” informs Dhondy.




Authenticity is at the heart of the new wave of Irani cafés across cities. Most of them are set up like a typical Irani café in Mumbai with checkered floors, large mirrors, fuss-free furniture, and high ceilings. “Functionality was the only thing on the café owner’s mind back then. The mirrors were put up to keep an eye on the staff and customers, the floor was made of sturdy kota and kadappa stone, so that it did not get damaged easily, high ceilings ensured the place stayed cool. They were just being economical and practical,” Mokhtar Yaveri, who runs Irani Café in Pune, explains the logic behind the design. “Today, of course, it is more about décor,” he adds.
Mokhtar comes from an Irani family and has brought back not only the authentic vibe to his café, but also the real Irani food. So you have brun maska, keema pav, bun maska, and the special Irani chai, whose recipe remains a family secret. “There is a sense of nostalgia attached to Irani cafés, especially in Mumbai and Pune. A majority of my customers are senior citizens, who used to frequent Irani cafés as kids, and are elated to find a place like this in an upmarket neighbourhood; of course, there are youngsters too, fascinated by the ambience and food,” adds Mokhtar.
Jamshedpur calling
Nostalgia is what brought Varun Gazder back to Jamshedpur to set up his café — Café Regal — in a hundred-year-old building. The town, home to a sizeable population of Parsis, never had the Irani café culture, but there was always an intimate circle of Parsi food aficionados, which had started to die. So Varun quit his job at Taj Mahal Palace Hotel, Mumbai, to set up Café Regal in an abandoned cinema hall in a Parsi bastion. “Whenever I ate Parsi food outside of my home, I felt something was amiss. It did not have that aroma or flavour. So I decided to bring out my family recipes to my café,” he tells us.




Not only did Gazder clear up the second floor of a decrepit theatre to set up Café Regal (named after the cinema), but he also recreated the Parsi bhonu from his family recipe. The special Sunday lunch takes between four and five hours to prepare and remains very popular with the patrons — both Parsis and non-Parsis. 
“I’ve been lucky because the people have really taken to the food here. We get youngsters and seniors in equal numbers and my Sunday lunch is completely booked by Friday evening,” says Gazder cheerfully. His vision is to slowly and steadily introduce more Irani and Parsi specialities, while maintaining the authenticity and quality of the place.
But not everyone seems to be happy with the trend. Some feel that the new-age adaptation of Irani cafés is taking away the authenticity of the recipes.
“They feel the mawa cake at the newer places is not as good as the ones at Kayani, or the akuri is too dry,” reveals Awal, who also hosts many Irani food-walks. “But for now, it is just great that we have an entire breed of young people working to revive a dying tradition.” We cannot help but agree.

Fasting test not required for gestational diabetes screening
","Diagnosing gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) in pregnant women in low- and middle-income countries with high diabetes burden, like India, has become easy thanks to the revised 2013 WHO guidelines. Any intervention that can prevent many more becoming diabetic therefore becomes important. The revised guidelines address the concerns faced by pregnant women with gestational diabetes in developing countries with a non-Caucasian population.
The revision comes 15 years after the world health body came up with its guidelines for diagnosing GDM. Meeting the requirements laid out in the 1999 guidelines was particularly challenging for pregnant women.
Diabetes that develops during pregnancy is called gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Though GDM most often resolves after delivery, the effects of elevated glucose levels in a pregnant woman tend to affect the foetus. Foetuses exposed to elevated maternal glucose tend to become big babies before birth (macrosomia). Such babies are at higher risk of becoming diabetic later in life much like the women who had GDM.
A simple solution to prevent this is to go in for universal screening of pregnant women for gestational diabetes and to keep the glucose level within desired levels — fasting plasma glucose 90 mg/dl and two hours after meal — 120 mg/dl. “But it was difficult to follow the 1999 WHO guidelines to diagnose GDM,” said Dr. V. Seshiah, Chairman of the Diabetes in Pregnancy Study Group India (DIPSI) and WHO expert committee member on GDM. He is also the Chairman of Dr. V. Seshiah Diabetes Research Institute and Dr. Balaji Diabetes care Centre, Chennai.
The 1999 WHO guidelines required a pregnant woman to come fasting for testing. The plasma glucose level was tested two hours after 75 mg of glucose was given to a woman. If the value was between 140 mg/dl and 199 mg/dl, the pregnant woman was diagnosed as having gestational diabetes. “The revised WHO guidelines retain the same value but the biggest difference is [that] women need not come fasting for testing,” Dr. Seshiah underlined. “A pregnant woman can come for testing irrespective of her last meal timing.”
The rest of the procedure remains the same. The non-fasting plasma glucose level is tested two hours after 75 gm of glucose is given to the woman. “If the two-hour plasma glucose measurement is between 140 [mg/dl] and 199 [mg/dl], she is diagnosed as GDM,” he said. “The 140-199 range for diagnosing GDM in pregnant women is the same as the one used for diagnosing impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) in non-pregnant adults.”
WHO’s non-fasting plasma glucose testing recommendation makes testing easy for pregnant women. The non-fasting test is patient-friendly and causes the least inconvenience to pregnant woman. The single-step procedure is easy to follow, economical, simple and evidence-based. “Women develop nausea or tend to vomit if they are given 75 gm glucose in a fasting stage,” Dr. Seshiah said.
Several studies done by a team led by Dr. Seshiah have found that the non-fasting test two hours after 75 gm glucose challenge had no statistically significant difference from the fasting test. The single-step procedure is followed in India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh.
Screening for gestational diabetes should be done in the first trimester (at least by 12-16 weeks). Earlier, the screening was done at 24-28 weeks. The reason why WHO does not recommend the late screening (24-28 weeks) is because by the 12 week, the beta cells develop in the foetal pancreas. And these foetal cells respond to the elevated maternal glucose levels. As a result, when the foetus gets more than the required amount of nutrition (glucose), it gets converted into foetal fat; the foetus thereby gains weight and becomes big. So, the earlier the screening of pregnant women, the better the foetal outcome.
Often, a modified meal plan (staggered, small portion meals) is sufficient to control the elevated maternal glucose level. “In our study, over 90 per cent of GDM women responded to a meal plan. Only 10 per cent required a very low dose of insulin,” he said.

Sugar and Spice: It is the sweetest thing
","Annie Koshy spreads a thick layer of her home-made Java Plum jam on a piece of toast and proffers it to me. “This is our latest flavour. I hope you like it”, she says. Annie founded Sugar and Spice with her daughter Sapna Koshy in October 2017 and now sells seven flavours of jams, marmalades, preserves and fruit butters. I admire the bright purple jam on the crisp toast before biting into it. It is sweet with a fresh flavour of ripe jamuns. 
While Annie makes the products, Sapna markets them. “My father passed away last year and my mother had a hard time coping with the loss. I wanted to engage her in something to help her move on. She used to make banana jam when I was a child so I asked her to make some for me. She did and it was an instant hit with my friends,” recalls Sapna. Soon, they started to receive more orders and requests for other flavours.




About the products Sapna says that they experiment and scour the net for recipes. Now their menu boasts of flavours such as Banana Rum, Orange Cinnamon, Pineapple Ginger, Strawberry, Apple Cinnamon, Mango Jalapeno and Java Plum.
They agree that not all experiments went right.“One of our customers wanted a bottle of Pineapple Ginger jam with palm sugar as a substitute to white sugar. The jam turned was a dirty brown and tasted weird. We had no other choice but to dispose it”, says Sapna. She says that the combination of two different flavours (sweet and spice) in most of their products makes them popular. 




They make their products in small batches on order and buy their raw materials from local stores. It is two days of work to make a batch. The first day is for cleaning and cutting the fruits and the second is for preparation and packaging. Annie says that it takes her up to six hours to get the required consistency. She uses 250 ml glass bottles for packaging and they are sterilised before being filled. “Orange Cinnamon Marmalade is the most difficult to make. The white inner lining of the fruit peel has to be scraped off before cutting it into fine pieces. Even though it is hard to make, that is our favourite”, smiles Annie.
She makes Banana Rum fruit butter with Palayankodan bananas sourced from her farm in Kerala. “It gives a rich reddish-brown colour to the fruit butter. It goes well as a spread over your toast or with roti. There are a number of possibilities for our products. Apple Cinnamon can go as a filling for pies while Java Plum can either be used as a spread or be made into juice by mixing it with water. Mango Jalapeno tastes best as a dip for your chips, as a salad dressing or even as a marinade for meat,” explains Annie. 
“Our products contain no added colours, artificial preservatives, flavours or thickening agents. The only preservatives that go into our products are sugar and lime”, Sapna claims. Her products have a shelf life of three months if refrigerated and 10 days if not. 




On request they also customise their products using sugar substitutes. “It is for people with diabetes and these jams must be consumed within three days of it’s making.”
The mother and daughter are also working on a range of non-vegetarian pickles that they will introduce soon. Says Sapna, “We will soon do a quality and nutrition assessment test for our products and are in the process of setting up a Sugar and Spice website and will also launch the products online.”

Dal, as you like it
"," It’s fair to say, finding a plate of pocket-friendly dal-roti in Visakhapatnam is still like finding needle in a haystack. Especially if you like your rotis served warm. But luckily for us, we found Shree Shyam, a homely eating place, where one can enjoy a meal in peace. 
Rajesh Sharma, the owner says, “My father started this place 20 years ago, after handing over the family business of sweets to his brothers. Since then we have been serving north Indian meals because there hasn’t been much demand for Rajasthani cuisine. However, we take orders if someone requests us to make dal baati or kichadi kadhi for 10 or more people.” According to him, the restaurant is most busy during lunch hours.
I order the largest thali on the menu with a glass of lassi. It looks legit. In many places a portion of sambar finds itself included in the thali, but not here. Instead, its got all the favourites from up North. 
I am served matar paneer, the classic aloo ki sabji, mixed vegetable, yellow dal, jeera rice, dahi boondi, chopped onions, aloo paratha, missi roti, chapati and gulab jamun. 
I start with aloo paratha and curd, and what a delightful combination this is.. The paratha goes just as well with yellow dal and matar paneer. 
The crunchy top layers of the paratha conceal within a piping hot filing of mashed potato redolent with a dash of red chilli powder. I finish the paratha in a matter of seconds.
The mixed vegetable has more gravy than vegetables and is a bit too watery. After tasting the mixed vegetable, to undo its after-taste I reach out for the lassi and stop with just one sip as it’s too sour.
Next, I try the missi roti and chapati. But they fade in comparison to the paratha. The matar paneer and dal are just right. For anyone who has a soft corner for home-style dal rice, the jeera dal here is sure to flood you with memories of a lazy afternoon meal at home. 
My dinner ends with the delicious gulab jamun. It’s got the perfect texture — it’s not too soft or hard and thankfully isn’t over powered by the sugar syrup either.

Whipping up a variety
","I am distracted by the peanut cookies. Conducting an interview in the kitchen throws up unique problems. Wanting to snack mid-way through your subject’s story is just one of them. Then there was the time I inadvertently sat on a hot stove while watching a chef demo his signature pasta. And let’s not even get started on the hair-nets, compulsory head gear in five-star kitchens, and guaranteed to make even Angelina Jolie look like a frumpy old lunch lady.
Nevertheless, appearances must be maintained. Even with a hair net on. (Though fortunately this particular interview, conducted in a guerrilla makeshift kitchen doesn’t require one.) So I ask my questions, and try to ignore the three trays of still warm cookies, lined up with regimental precision, which have evidently just been taken out of the oven. “Try a cookie,” urges baker Suresh Babu, finally pushing a tray towards me.
Yes! I lean over, carefully select the brownest cookie in the batch and bite in. It’s delightfully crumbly, packed with crushed, roasted peanuts. I then resume studying Suresh, languid in a beat up old T-shirt and jeans. Take another look at his tiny kitchen, meticulously stacked with pans, trays and jars. And then I glance around his little ‘café’ — a room haphazardly furnished with three tables, a business-like fridge and oversized wind chimes — with renewed curiosity. There’s got to be a story here.
A few weeks ago ‘Warm Brown’ hoisted its sign on a tree-lined street in CIT colony. I follow my nose to find the space, like a well-trained golden retriever. The scent of cookies makes its way out of the café’s open doors, snaking out of the compound and onto the street. Walking in, I’m startled by the space — it’s less café, more college canteen, with three big tables pushed together and mismatched chairs.
The décor is absent minded: yellow tea pots here, an over-sized mirror there, and above it all an unblinking model of a rather flashy gecko, reminiscent of Spanish artist-architect Gaudi. Suresh Babu comes out of the kitchen to say hello, before taking me back in to show me his miniature oven, an OTG, and those cookies. When we settle down at the main table, where a chocolate and orange chiffon cake are cooling, he cuts me a slice of each, then pushes over a cup of sweet filter coffee.
A former creative director with O&M, he left the firm in 2012 to start working on ad films. “But that didn’t really keep me busy. I was freelancing, and suddenly found I had a lot of free time,” he says, adding that he gradually began baking. He began with cookies, moved on to quiches, and then learnt how to make bread. “I started practising at home, and found my kids were enjoying what I baked — and it was much better than what was commercially available. I realised the difference was ingredients; I use only butter — no margarine. No preservatives. And as far as possible, no artificial flavouring,” he says, pointing at the last few crumbs of orange chiffon cake on my plate. “That cake, for example, it’s flavoured with nothing but orange juice and orange zest.”
The cake is spongy and fragrant, an ideal ambassador. While his chocolate cake is less striking (“but it’ll change character with ganache”), he also makes a vanilla-flavoured teacake. This is not fancy baking. It’s not even unusual. It’s just basic cakes, cookies and tarts done right. Where Warm Brown scores is in its ability to offer home-baked flavours in a professional setting. Additionally, since one man does all the work, and he’s meticulous about measurements, the products are standardised.
Besides, it’s undeniably fascinating to see a one-man show run with this kind of single-minded determination. “I found this space. I climbed on a stool and painted the walls. See those lamps — I made them with crushed paper. Look at the table — I made it with reclaimed wood.” As my jaw drops, he continues, “The sign outside? I made it — bending the cane myself.” He adds, “I painted signboards in Kerala in my teens. I took a carpentry class in my 20s. I learnt cooking in my 30s and baking in my 40s. Now I use all those skills.”
As I leave, after buying packets of arrowroot biscuits, which are surprisingly good despite their faintly chalky texture, crisp raisin-oats cookies and a chicken sandwich (which turns out to be overwhelmed by rather average bread), he takes down a roll of brown paper and a pair of scissors. “You like the labels? I do them too.”

War of the decoctions
","It’s tough for establishments in Mylapore to compete with some of the best home-brewed coffee in the area. It sets the expectation meter soaring among regulars who are not easy to please. Mami Tiffin stall serves an invigorating tumbler of coffee but Mylai Karpagambal Mess is our pick. The restaurant sources coffee seeds, roasts, grinds and brews its own trademark coffee.
The interiors have been refreshed slightly but given the constant flow of diners you can’t linger over your tumbler of coffee. If you are not counting calories sample the restaurant’s legendary Keerai vadai and sinful Badam halwa.
Address: 20, East Mada street, Mylapore, Chennai: 600 004 (opposite Rasi silks)
Iconic Udupi restaurants have been an integral part of the Chennai filter coffee landscape with their legion of die-hard fans. New Woodlands hotel that grinds and blends its own secret recipe with chicory is a natural favourite. If you want a piping hot cup of freshly brewed filter coffee at 1 am then there’s no better place than Mathsya at Egmore. The restaurant has been sourcing its Arabica beans from a single estate in Chikmagalur for decades. No tumbler and davara here but it is authentic Udupi-style filter.
Address: No: 1 Halls road, Egmore, Chennai: 600 008
Phone: (044) 2819-1900
Chennai wakes up earlier than any other metro, if there’s one restaurant that’s geared for the city’s early birds it is Saravana Bhavan. It’s the restaurant’s proximity to Marina beach where walkers start milling about even before daybreak. Some of those walkers are joined by late night revellers in search of their ‘pick-me-up’ on a Sunday morning. The restaurant starts buzzing with activity at 5:30 am as regulars and curious onlookers line up for one of Chennai’s most refreshing tumblers of filter coffee.
Address: No: 101, Dr Radhakrishnan Salai, Mylapore, Chennai: 600 004
Phone: (044) 2811-5977
This is tricky territory for five star hotels – they need to please local diners and adventurous travellers armed with local information and experiences. It’s tough to choose between two top class brews at Dakshin at Sheraton Park and Southern Spice at the Taj Coromandel. The Southern Spice coffee follows a rigorous manual and is crafted with full cream milk. It’s not just the coffee but it’s the showmanship that adds the X factor at the end of your meal. The ‘coffee pulling’ drill by their service staff almost never fails to wow international guests.
Address: No: 37, MG Road, Nungambakkam, Chennai: 600 034
Phone: (044) 6600-2827
It might be your shopping weary heels or that sudden urge for your caffeine fix. While the city’s malls have a plethora of ‘instant’ coffee options it’s not easy to find a cup of filter coffee that hits the spot; Madras Coffee house is a welcome exception. The chicory-free coffee here is spot on and probably the best coffee served in a disposable paper cup in Chennai.

Let’s talk vadais
","  Vadais need no introduction, for they can safely be called the numero uno evening indulgence across Tamil Nadu. And Madurai surely loves its vadais that come in a variety of shapes, sizes, textures and flavours. From the spongy medhuvadai to the hard-to-crack thattu vadai, there’s no dearth of options. 




Come evening time, vadai kadais spring up across the city’s roadsides. The shops serve up some of the best vadais ever. Among the varieties served, there’s something unique called thavala vadai and it’s not just the name that intrigues. With a crunchy outer coating and a spongy core, thavala vadai is a typical Chettinad snack and its popularity has spilled over to the rest of Southern Tamil Nadu.
In Madurai, there are only a few select shops where you can get the delicacy. At the 100-year-old Gopu Iyengar Tiffin Home on North Chitrai Street, head cook S Jayaraj has been dishing out batches of vadais every evening for decades. What does ‘thavala’ mean, we ask Jayaraj, as many wonder if it has something to do with frog (thavalai is the Tamil word for the reptile).
“Thavala also refers to a type of vessel. Also called thavi by some, it is flat at the bottom and is commonly used to make this type of vadai. It retains the heat so that the snack is evenly cooked and is crispy,” he explains. “The snack has to be fried under medium heat. One should know when to drop the batter in oil.”




The thavala vadai consists oftoor dal, moong dal, Bengal gram dal, parboiled rice, raw rice, coconut gratings, dry red chilli, mustard and asafoetida. It tastes similar to another south Indian delicacy, the adai dosa; thavala vadai’s speciality though, is its overtly spicy taste, that the dry red chillies lend.
It is a widely prepared at Chettinad weddings. “The thavala vadai can also be prepared by incorporating yellow peas,” says KN Visalakshi, who has been making the snack for more than two decades.
In Madurai, the price of a vadai ranges from ₹10 to 15. The mix of dals in equal proportions is the key to getting the vadai it right. Also, since the batter dal and rice mixture is coarsely ground, the vadai takes a long time to cook. “In the past, copper or brass vessels were used for the purpose,” says Jayaraj. 
Recipe 
Ingredients: 
100gm toor dal
100gm Bengal
100gm moong dal
50gm urad dal
100gm parboiled rice
20gm raw rice
 4 dry red chillies 
 Salt
Oil for deep frying
50gm grated coconut
1/2 tsp asafoetida powder 
1/2 tsp mustard seeds
 1 tbsp finely chopped curry leaves 
 1 Onion (finely chopped)
 Method:
Soak the dal and rice separately in water for four hours along with dry red chillies. Drain out the water and grind coarsely along with salt, asafoetida. Add the grated coconut, onion, curry leaves and seasoned mustard seeds to the batter. Mix well. Pinch some batter and flatten over the palm and deep fry in hot oil.

Deciphering the cause of viral joint pain
","The chikungunya virus often leaves those it infects with severe joint pains. This could be the result of arthritic changes brought about by the virus getting into certain cells in the bone, suggests research that was recently published.
Suresh Mahalingam at the Griffith University in Australia and colleagues studied such changes using a closely related virus, the Ross River virus (RRV). This virus infected bone-forming cells, known as osteoblasts. The infected cells began secreting molecules that attracted certain immune cells (monocytes) and turned them into bone-devouring cells called osteoclasts. These osteoclasts produced arthritic bone loss, they reported in a paper in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
The work, along with other recent studies, suggested that infection by RRV and related viruses “may directly lead to arthritis” and could be amenable to forms of treatment for that ailment, write Kate D. Ryman and William B. Klimstra of the University of Pittsburgh in the U.S. in a commentary on the paper published in the same journal.
The authors showed that when the RRV infected human osteoblasts grown in culture, those cells began to produce various molecules, including some that served to bring monocytes to infected bone sites
The infected osteoblasts also began churning out interleukin-6 (IL-6), a molecule that induced those same cells to produce more of a protein, RANKL (receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappaB ligand). The binding of RANKL to a molecule on the surface of monocytes, which had been attracted to the infection sites, coaxed them to turn into osteoclasts, the cells that can break down bone.
Such differentiation into osteoclasts could be held in check by yet another molecule secreted by osteoblasts, osteoprotegerin (OPG), which locks on to the RANKL. However, IL-6 not only causes osteoblasts to ramp up RANKL secretion but reduces the amount of OPG they put out. This “disruption of the RANKL/OPG system can tilt the balance toward bone resorption,” noted Prof. Mahalingam and colleagues in their PNAS paper.
They found that the fluid drawn from the joints of RRV patients had elevated levels of the protein and lowered amounts of OPG. These patients also had higher levels of a protein marking the formation of osteoclasts. A previously published study carried out by a different group has shown that the chikungunya virus too could infect osteoblasts, leading those cells to secrete more IL-6 and RANKL as well as less OPG.
The scientists infected laboratory mice with RRV, and found that the virus could be detected in osteoblasts embedded in a membrane that surrounds bones. By about two weeks after infection, the mice showed “clear bone loss” at several places. They gave some infected mice an antibody that blocked IL-6, a technique similar to an antibody treatment for rheumatoid arthritis that is currently going through clinical trials. The mice that received the antibodies not only showed greatly reduced bone loss, but their RANKL-OPG levels also improved.
The work demonstrated that “IL-6 is a critical mediator of the RRV-induced increase in RANKL/OPG ratio and bone loss,” the scientists said in their PNAS paper.
Many chikungunya patients suffer chronic joint pains that lasted for months and sometimes years, observed Prof. Mahalingam in an email. “What contributes to this is not known. Our findings suggest that virus-induced bone loss might be responsible. Our findings also suggest that using existing drugs that target factors that trigger bone loss might be useful in treating patients.”
It is important to determine whether chikungunya and other viruses closely related to RRV also produced similar responses in laboratory animals as well as in humans, said Dr. Ryman and Dr. Klimstra in their commentary. The study may also shed light on the arthritis produced by a wide range of other viruses, including the one that causes dengue.

The beginning of a great chef’s food journey
","Let’s not think of a depressed Anthony Bourdain. Instead, let us see him as a happy boy who had just had his first oyster.
The family had gone out to sea with Monsieur Saint-Jour, a fisherman, on an oyster boat. Young Tony, all of nine, was hungry. Monsieur Saint-Jour asked if any of them would care to try out an oyster.
“My parents hesitated. I doubt they’d realized they might have actually to eat one of the raw, slimy things we were currently floating over. My little brother recoiled in horror. But I, in the proudest moment of my young life, stood up smartly, grinning with defiance, and volunteered to be the first,” he writes in Kitchen Confidential: Adventures in the Culinary Underbelly.
He took the raw oyster in his hand, tilted the shell back into his mouth as instructed by the now beaming Monsieur Saint-Jour, and with one bite and a slurp, wolfed it down. “It tasted of seawater… of brine and flesh… and somehow… of the future,” he says.
Spoon fed
We now know of the end, but that then was the beginning of a great chef’s food journey. Bourdain, who took his life on June 8, knew as a fourth-grader that there was no turning back: “The genie was out of the bottle. My life as a cook, and as a chef, had begun”.
This passage propelled me to re-read a book called How I Learned To Cook, edited by Kimberly Witherspoon and Peter Meehan. I went back to the piece about Ferran Adrià, the man known the world-over for experiments in molecular gastronomy.
“I was not one of those children, who at the age of six or seven, discovers an enthusiasm for baking cookies. I did not watch, ablaze with curiosity, as my grandmother stirred the family broth,” he says. 
All that he wanted to do was play football and party. It was to collect money to go to Ibiza — which he saw as a mega party place — that he began working as a dishwasher in a restaurant. He went from one restaurant to the other, fed the men in the Spanish Navy and headed the admiral’s kitchen — all by chance. In 1984, he joined the kitchen staff at El Bulli — and went on to become one of its owners.
Sushi story
I like the story of Masaharu Morimoto, who introduced sushi to the world. On the day the father got paid, he took the family out for sushi, he writes.
“While we were at dinner, my parents were relaxed, even enjoyed themselves,” he says. They would resume their fights the morning after, but they were a happy family at the restaurant.
“Is it any wonder that I thought becoming a sushi chef was a noble and worthwhile pursuit,” he asks.
Let’s also recall the story of Heston Blumenthal, of the iconic The Fat Duck. For him, it all began with a meal in L’Oustau de Baumanière restaurant in France.
“I had never seen anything like this before,” he writes. There were perfectly-appointed tables with immaculate linen, silver, china and crystal. The family sat outside as the scent of lavender wafted in.
Young Heston ate red mullet fillets sauced with a light vinaigrette and paired with tomatoes, basil and green beans; meat and kidneys from a baby lamb baked in puffed pastry; gratin of potatoes and aubergines. “There was something about the experience, something so fantastic yet so tangible, that I knew this was what I wanted to do,” he says.
And, indeed, they all did what they wanted to do. As in ‘Author, author’, it’s time we coined a new phrase — ‘Chef, chef!’
The writer likes reading and writing about food as much as he does cooking and eating it. Well, almost.

Health is wealth!
","So what does one eat when one has been asked to go off oil and red meat? Apparently quite a lot, as I have learnt over the last few weeks.
Friends have been dropping by, all carrying baked and roasted namkeen and biscuits. One friend got us a delicious roasted chicken, about which I shall write later, and two other friends came with a hamper of yummy food from Noshi.
Noshi is a delivery outlet of the Yum Yum Cha group and serves sushi, Thai and other Asian delights. They have a wide array of dimsums, soups (pho, tom yum), sushi and sashimi, curries (red, green) and meals in a bowl (rice or noodles with your favoured flavours — spicy garlic, basil and chilli and three-pepper — with your choice of toppings.
I like sushi, but asked for steamed dimsums instead. They brought us various kinds – with edamame and truffle, chicken and chestnut, chicken and chilli oil, basil chicken, prawn cheung fun (with chillies, soy sauce and garlic) and prawn har gao, which consisted of prawns, dill leaves and asparagus. Then there was a lemongrass tofu dish, sliced garlic chicken and Thai lemon fish with basmati rice.
Wholesome meal
This was, obviously, the best meal I’d had after my stint in the hospital (where the food was so bad that it encouraged me to get well soon and get discharged at the earliest). The food from Noshi was light, yet delicious. I did not have the sauces or the prawn (high in cholesterol, alas), but really enjoyed some of the dimsums and the main dishes.
The chicken and chestnut dimsum had just the right crunchy and soft texture that I wanted, and the basil chicken had a nice flavour. I loved my Thai steamed fish, which had a mild lemony sauce, and I thought the lemongrass tofu was excellent. I didn’t much like the edamame and truffle dimsum for I didn’t get the flavour of truffle in it. But I must say it looked good!




I later found out that most of the dimsums are for ₹345 or so for a plate of four, as are the sushis (of various kinds such as tuna nigiri, unagi nigiri, salmon nigiri, spicy salmon, crab salad, cucumber blossom and enoki and truffle) for three or four rolls. The curries or wok stacks are for ₹485. Zomato says a meal for two costs ₹1000.
I loved the food from Noshi. It was light, yet delicious and flavourful. And like all of owner Varun Tuli’s creations, it looks beautiful. My only problem — and this I heard another day when some other Noshi-loving friends came over — is the packaging. It is beautifully packed, but there is too much packaging. The dimsums, for instance, came in small boxes, with smaller boxes of the sauce or the oil, and these were than all placed in a large and beautiful cardboard container. Now that I am a man who believes in safeguarding nature (and health), I thought there was no need for the carton, however elegant.
Noshi, which is in GK 1, delivers to a radius of 10 km from there, but has plans to deliver in Gurugram soon.
I am off sugar (well, mostly off, I should say) but if you order from Noshi, do have some of their mochi ice cream. Like most things Japanese it is beautiful – and healthy.
Readers are going to get to hear more on healthy food from me. After all, health is wealth, as Baba WhatsApp says.

Street-food in a comfortable setting
","If like me, you have lived in and around the same area of a city all your life, the subtle changes tend to pass you by. The narrow road next to the Cosmopolitan Club on Race Course is one such place I have often crossed, but seldom lingered and explored. Imagine my surprise when I heard from some foodie friends that there was an eatery situated on that very road. I couldn’t wait to check it out and the opportunity arose when I had I some house guests.
It seemed the perfect time to check out the highly talked of local fare. So, with friends in tow, off we went. It was a short walk from the main road and in the far distance the faint glow of a tube light suggested the presence of the eatery. As we got closer, we spotted a small illuminated board with Valarmathi Mess written on it. A noisy group of people, who looked quite satiated and happy, exited from an air conditioned room. Just before we entered we saw an open area which happened to the kitchen. Immediately noticeable was the standard of cleanliness which was quite impressive. The staff, attired neatly, seated us right away. In the absence of a menu, they relied on their memory to tell us the items on offer, assuring us that they would not get our order wrong.
Green banana leaves and stainless steel utensils were placed on clean granite topped tables. They served mineral water along with a choice of aerated drinks. The place was comfortable, and had not more than six to eight tables. Their repertoire included huge triangular dosas with a variety of fillings like masala, egg and kheema, veg and non-veg kothu parotas, chilli chicken, chilli paneer and pichhu pota kozhi, along with  many sea-food dishes, plain parotas and gravies. They said their lunch menu was even bigger.
The owner, a charming elderly gentleman, seemed rather surprised that it was my first time at his establishment. They have been around since 1986, serving the same fare. Only recently did they add the a/c dining room. He said they also had a loyal vegetarian clientele.
The food was piping hot, straight from the pan to the plate, and service was quick. The silence as we ate spoke highly of the food. In under an hour, we were done and all set to head back home. It may have been fast food, but by no means junk food.
A meal for five cost around Rs. 1,000. One can take away food as well. I’m glad I heard about Valarmathi Mess. It’s definitely a place to visit again, when you are in the mood for a quick bite loaded with the flavours of street food, served in a comfortable setting.
P.S. The owner Mr.Rajan said the Pallipalayam chicken they served was cooked with a recipe from his hometown.

Where to brunch in Las Vegas ","I am gambling with a fistful of cash, a martini and a Momofuku pork bun. The pork bun is the only winner. The malevolent slot machine spitefully chews dollars, celebrating my losses with self-satisfied beeps. In my rage against the machine I knock over most of my martini. The pork bun, though, straight from Chef David Chang’s little hipster haven Momofuku in trendy Cosmopolitan casino is delicious.
Over five days in Las Vegas, I quickly learn that dining out is infinitely more rewarding than shaking my fist at the roulette table. I am not alone. Sin City has been steadily changing its brand. Now it is a shiny entertainment capital, offering visitors a galaxy of stars to choose from — from artists like Gwen Stefani, Lady Gaga and Calvin Harris to culinary legends such as Joël Robuchon, Nobu Matsuhisa and Wolfgang Puck. Not to mention the TV celebrity chefs: Gordon Ramsay, Guy Fieri, Bobby Flay and Giada de Laurentiis.
Given the pool of talent, Vegas offers an endlessly evolving culinary landscape. With so many options, where do you brunch? Here’s our pick.




At The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas, Level 2, The Chelsea Tower
Cost: $28 (Mon-Thurs), $36 (Fri-Sun)
Let us stick with tradition and begin with a bombastic, extravagant, over-the-top, typically Vegas style buffet. Except, this is a gourmet version. No clunky chafing dishes, reheated spuds and wilted bacon here. Modern and spacious, the Wicked Spoon buffet is vast and inventive. Which could explain why customers patiently wait in long queues to get in.
Styled like a trendy global food hall, the focus is on creative presentation. Most dishes are served in small, individually plated portions. I try dinky bowls of steamy mac and cheese. Then pause to admire the carving stations, and nod hello to an assembly line of chefs who systematically set out little baskets of freshly fried chicken, steamy dim sum and Korean-style kalbi beef ribs. The buttery bone marrow is a favourite here, as are the skilfully made scrambled eggs, which are sunshine yellow and impressively creamy.
Dessert is a Willy Wonka fantasy featuring imaginatively styled puddings, cake and gelato. I am so overwhelmed by the choices I circle it three times, and end up eating a coconut cookie!




At 3595 Las Vegas Blvd S, The Cromwell
Cost: $55 for the tasting menu
Emmy Award-winning celebrity chef Giada De Laurentiis’ smile is as bright as her sunshine-flooded restaurant. Brunch begins with cheery mimosas, but you can posh it up with Veuve Clicquot if you prefer. Set in elegant Cromwell hotel, this is possibly one of the best restaurant views in Vegas: the Bellagio Fountains, theatrical Caesars Palace and all the drama of the strip.
Giada’s around, chatting with guests, posing for fan selfies and signing cookbooks. Between it all, she explains her style — simple Italian home cooking. However, while easy recipes may have made her a star on the Food Network, Vegas’ steak and Champagne audience is more demanding. Hence her food for the restaurant has been carefully tweaked while leaving its easy, breezy core intact. The antipasto, for instance, features ricotta crostini, prosciutto and sweet baby peppers, as well as a powerfully fragrant truffle burrata.
I eye Giada’s fluffy polenta waffles served with sunny side-up eggs, pancetta and maple syrup, then settle on a crisp Romaine salad, dewy with citrus vinaigrette followed by pesto-puddled cavatelli, tossed with roasted mushrooms. And a lobster hash. The vibe is stylish but artfully casual, like a Woody Allen rom com: all perfect lighting, bursts of laughter and beautiful people. To Rome with love, and a lemon ricotta cookie.




At Wynn Las Vegas, 3131 S Las Vegas Blvd
Cost: Approximately $60 (a la carte for two)
This is where I collide with Popeye. I have spent 20 minutes wandering around Wynn’s labyrinth, art-studded corridors, hopelessly lost and desperately in need of a Bloody Mary. Like any good intrepid explorer (well, as intrepid as you can be with GoogleMaps, plush carpeting and shimmering chandeliers) I study my surroundings. The Popeye sculpture, which weighs about 2,000 pounds was reportedly purchased at auction by Steve Wynn for $28 million.
Then there are the flowers. Designer Preston Bailey has used tens of thousands of them to create a carousel in the lobby, complete with its 10 horses, Pegasus and a unicorn.
So not surprisingly, when I finally find Jardin, it is like walking into a movie set, strung with dramatic floral installations. The main dining area is bright with sunlight, making it feel more like a conservatory than a restaurant. I sit by the quietly elegant poolside in the midst of meticulously manicured greenery.
The food is “approachable American”, basically comfort food that has undergone a makeover to emerge lighter, fresher and a lot more stylish. There is a strong focus on seasonal ingredients. I try lobster Benedict served with sautéed spinach, tomato hollandaise and hash browns. There’s buttermilk-soaked, fried chicken set on thick French toast. As well as brown butter crepes topped with Chantilly cream, caramelised banana and Nutella. And yes, a rolling Bloody Mary cart.




At Park MGM, 3770, South Las Vegas Boulevard
Cost: Approximately $60 (a la carte for two)
After a $550-million revamp, the legendary Monte Carlo has become MGM Grand. From flashy casino chic to European elegance, this restaurant is typically ‘new’ Vegas. We sit outside soaking in the ‘South of France’ vibe in a garden dappled with sunlight.
Over multiple cups of darkly aromatic Columbian coffee, Marc Guastella, VP Food and beverage at Park MGM, says they wanted to take the café concept and give it a twist. “It has multiple facets depending on the season, so we can activate the space,” Guastella says, adding that they are deliberately moving away from the typical hustle of neon-lit Vegas.
We eat warm doughnuts served with whipped cream and tart lemon butter followed by sesame bagels topped with smoked salmon. There is French toast streaked with sticky maple syrup and a garden scramble of organic eggs with mushrooms, spinach and gooey Gruyère cheese.
There is more to come. NoMad will open next this year, marking the Vegas debut of Chef Daniel Humm of Eleven Madison Park, currently hailed as one of the world’s best restaurants. Italian chain Eataly will launch. And Korean American Chef Roy Choi, celebrated for his “food that isn’t fancy” style and Korean taco truck, Kogi, will open a Koreatown-inspired concept.




At The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas, Level 2, The Boulevard Tower
Cost: Sandwiches between $7 and $14
When you wake up with bleary, mascara-smudged eyes and last night’s lipstick, be like the hipsters. Just whip on sunglasses, call for a limo (try Bell, which sent us sleek SUVs with friendly chauffeurs and an impressive list of A-lister Hollywood clients) and pick up breakfast from Eggslut.
In the setting of over-the-top Vegas, Eggslut has chosen a small format setting with a short menu. And been extremely successful (they can serve up to 1,500 people every day). This is more of a takeaway counter than a restaurant, ideal when you want to crawl back into bed with a warm brioche and cold brew coffee. Be prepared to wait in line, probably along with a dozen excited, frantically-Instagramming millennials.
A spokesperson from Eggslut calls their short menu “simple, but effective,” stating that when they opened they wanted to offer a product that was missing from the market. The menu, launched by Chef Alvin Cailan, who built his reputation on decadently oozy egg sandwiches served out of a food truck, stays true to its roots. Try the Fairfax, a cage-free soft scrambled eggs and chives, cheddar cheese, caramelised onions and sriracha mayo in a warm brioche bun. On your way out, do not forget to grab a dark chocolate chip cookie, topped with grey salt. It’s baked fresh every morning and sells out quickly.

Sweetmeats for the sweet toothed
"," In the temple town of Kumbakonam, the sticky, syrupy monopoly of the gulab jamun is quietly being challenged by the success of dry jamuns. Its creator, Kumbakonam Murari Sweet, a family-run business, sells 250-300 kilograms of dry jamuns a day. 
“How we make the dry jamuns is a trade secret, but it is rare among sweetmeats in the South,” says D Arun Kumar, the proprietor of Kumbakonam Murari Sweet. The dry jamun, looking like a sugar-dusted brown pearl, is smaller than its original namesake, but its crisp exterior gives way to a squishy centre that has the same delicious taste of the gulab jamun. 




Just the basics
Arun Kumar gives us a rough idea of the process. “We use maida, sugar and milk solids in the jamuns and then soak them in a caramelised syrup. It has a shelf life of a week without refrigeration,” he says.
The small office, on the premises of the Murari Sweet eatery on Sastra College Road, is redolent with the aroma that only lip-smacking food can generate. Whether it is batches of samosas being fried or sweetmeats arriving fresh from the centralised production unit, there is a palpable excitement in the way the food is displayed and served here. “Customers still come to us and reminisce about our founder Murari Lal Sait, who used to personally pack sachets of Ashoka halwa in leaves at our earliest shop,” says Arun Kumar, as he recollects his family’s journey to Kumbakonam over a hundred years ago.




A traditional confectionery and sweet maker (halwai) from the town of Khurja in Uttar Pradesh, Murari Lal Sait travelled to Kumbakonam with his brother (Arun Kumar’s grandfather RB Anantharaman Sait) and a few friends in 1914, in search of livelihood.
While the friends returned after a few months, the Sait brothers stuck it out, determined to make a mark in Kumbakonam. 
“In those days, our grandfather sold sweets from a handcart that he pushed around the town. He was hard-working and made the sweets himself. His ideas and success are what have helped us retain our position in the market today,” says Arun Kumar.
As he did not have children of his own, Murari formally adopted Anantharaman’s son Devidas (Arun Kumar’s father) to ensure his culinary legacy for posterity. “I was 12 when my grandfather passed away. The first store was a small place. We too have had our struggles,” says Arun Kumar.
While the founder made his name as a seller of traditional South Indian staples like Mysore pak, badusha, kaara boondi and pakoda, which were packed in leaves or cane baskets, Devidas diversified the menu by introducing North Indian and Bengali specialities.
Arun Kumar, who started assisting his father at the age of eight, says, “We would try and create something unique in our shop. Ajmeer cake, made with date pulp, dried fruits and milk solids, was created like that,” he says. It is a lighter version of the wheat-based habshi halwa.




Going solo
After working with his father for 40 years, Arun Kumar branched out on his own in 2012. He is assisted by his wife and sons and has opened branches in Sarangapani Kovil Keela Veethi in Kumbakonam, and in the nearby towns of Mayiladuthurai and Tiruvarur. 
Constant experimentation has helped Arun Kumar create a sizeable catalogue of best-selling goodies, that combine the best of North and South vegetarian cuisine, plus the usual foray into global fast food like pizzas.
Today, besides dry jamuns and ajmeer cake, the brand is known for milk peda and soan papdi in sweets, and inji (ginger) pakoda in savouries — a founder’s recipe that combines ginger, mint and gram flour. 
From improved packaging and corporate gift ideas to an online retail portal and computerised delivery systems, the family has upped its merchandising game considerably. 
Currently, the family employs a staff of 200. Cooks start work at 4 am and wind up by 11 am. 
Sweet mix
Arun Kumar is a product of both the South and the North. “I grew up in Kumbakonam,” he says, in fluent Tamil. “But at home, we keep in touch with our Khurja roots. We speak in Hindi and also love phulka, aloo subzi and the gajar halwa that my wife makes,” he says.

Pulses: lentils, chickpeas and beans
","Collectively known as pulses, lentils should be on the farming calendar of every kitchen garden. The leguminous plants are harvested when the pods are dry and the hard lens-like seeds can be stored away for future use. Toor (pigeon peas), moong, masoor and chickpeas are a few of the most favoured lentils that are consumed daily in most regional cuisines. These nutritionally dense pulses come packed with proteins, fibre, calcium, iron, zinc and antioxidants. Like all leguminous plants, most lentils are rabi crops, traditionally cultivated after the Indian monsoons. However, they can be grown through the year in the controlled environment of a kitchen garden, if the soil is kept moist during the dry periods.
Lentils can be grown on terrace gardens with equal success. Use large deep pots or growbags filled with a mix of garden soil and sand. Companion plants like cucumber or potato can be planted alongside: they are beneficial to each other’s growth.
Choose an open sunny spot or sow in between other plants, keeping in mind the plants favourable to its growth. Prepare the soil with a mix of crumbled neem cake, organic leaf matter and clean dry compost. Healthy soil naturally contains rhizobia, a healthy bacteria that fixes nitrogen in the soil. In a small garden space, the soil will have sufficient organic matter to nourish the plants. But, farmers with large areas under cultivation often add an inoculant powder containing rhizobium culture to the soil before sowing.
Source your seeds from a farmer in your region, choosing a tested variety. Sow directly in the prepared beds, leaving a distance of 5-6 inches in between. When the plants are about 6 inches high, train them up poles or over a low trellis. Lentils will also thrive as bushes without support, but will naturally climb up taller companion plants.
Moon phase
Sow during the new moon and the first quarter phase, as the sap flow is drawn up. Harvest with the waning moon, as the sap is drawn down — this phase is beneficial for drying and storage of produce.
Potatoes, cucumbers and corn are good companion plants. Keep garlic and onion at a distance from lentil plants.
Though lentils are relatively drought tolerant, the plants must be kept moist through the growing phase. Feed the plants with a compost tea when they are about six inches high; repeat when they start flowering. Stop watering once the pods start drying.
Lentils are generally not prone to disease, though they may be attacked by aphids and weevils. Strong hosing with water will get rid of aphids, but weevils must be removed by hand.
Lentils are ready for harvest four months from sowing. As they are stored away for long use, pluck the disc-like seeds once the pods are dry and the seeds within are hard. Store for up to a year.
Allow the pods on the healthiest plants to dry on the plant, till the shell becomes papery and shrivelled. Remove from the stalk and dry further. Lightly coat with wood ash and store away for the next planting season.
Like all leguminous plants, lentils enrich the soil by fixing nitrogen. They continue to do so as long as the roots remain in the soil. After the harvest, let the plant dry out completely and decompose into green manure. The roots will continue to nourish the soil. For the next round, rotate crops and watch them thrive in the enriched soil.
Lentils are an ancient Indian crop that originated from the Mediterranean region; India is now the world’s largest producer of lentils.
The seedlings of leguminous plants can be used as nutritious microgreens to be lightly sautéed or used as fresh greens in salads.
Sprouted lentils also provide an additional burst of nutrition.

Hell’s Kitchen in Las Vegas: a quick taste
","Replete with pitchforks, shooting digital flames and cocktails fuming with dry ice, there is nothing subtle about Hell’s Kitchen. 
There’s even a video of a life-sized, suitably annoyed Chef Gordon Ramsay at the entrance, barely welcoming guests. And of course, a flurry of merchandise. But then, this is Las Vegas: Theme park restaurants are part of the package. Helmed by the famously irate celebrity chef, this restaurant — attached to the ostentatious Caesars Palace — Hell’s Kitchen, is based on the popular American TV reality programme by the same name.
Starring Ramsay and his colourful vocabulary, Hell’s Kitchen pits two teams of aspiring chefs against each other.With a kitchen divided into red and blue, just like the show, the restaurant, launched this year, is a magnet for Instagrammers, selfie-hunters and those who live for Facebook Check-Ins.
I bump into Michelle Tribble minutes after entering. A contestant on Seasons 14 and 17 of Hell’s Kitchen, she won the position of head chef at this restaurant (along with a salary of $250,000). She’s with cheery Christina Wilson, who won Season 10 and is now executive chef for the US Division of the Gordon Ramsay Group, which has a total of 35 restaurants globally, out of which five are right here in Vegas.




“I’ve been with the group for about six years now,” says Wilson, discussing how they put the restaurant together. “We began working on this project when filming Michelle’s season, so we were immersed in Hell’s Kitchen: 16 hours on set, 6 days a week.”
She describes the food as “American continental... Heavily inspired by the show.” She adds, “We are a chef-driven restaurant.” As for the kitchen? “Well, there’s a little less shouting,” she smiles, looking at Tribble. “Michelle already has her job, so she’s not fighting. She’s in a better mood...” In contrast to her tough on-screen persona, Tribble seems shy in real life, letting Wilson do most of the talking. “She was this little 22-year-old when we first met her on the set,” chuckles Wilson, adding with a wink, “A young gun. A little too big for her britches.”
At the restaurant, Tribble calls the shots. “It’s the busiest kitchen I have ever worked in,” she says, so softly I have to lean in to hear her over the music and hum of diners. “I am grateful to be here.” The location means she’s cooking for visitors from all over the world, many of whom are celebrities. “So many people come in really excited,” she says, adding, “This is the only restaurant in America based on a TV show.”




A chatty waiter in suspenders leads us to our table across the 8,000 sq ft restaurant, with floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking the lively Vegas Strip. The cooks are in red and blue jackets, accessorised with bandanas, just like in the show. A glance at the menu reveals that Ramsay has played to his strengths. Instead of falling into the celebrity chef trap, the food is simple without unnecessary bells and whistles. Or in culinary terms: spheres, foams and dehydrated powders.
 
A taste of the best
I begin with a golden beet salad, creamy with Greek yoghurt and topped with crunchy pistachio granola. For the main course, I’m torn between the legendary beef Wellington and Ramsay’s classic crispy skin salmon, which the waiter tells me is on the menu of his three Michelin-star restaurants. I settle on salmon, flaky with a deliciously crisp seared crust. It is served on a bed of robust Beluga lentils and a tangle of shaved fennel. Dessert is the universally popular sticky toffee pudding: warm, spongy and familiar, it’s served with creamy speculoos ice cream.
As for the question weighing on all your minds: does Ramsay yell in the kitchen? Both Tribble and Wilson burst into laughter. “Yes, he does sometimes. But for the most part no,” says Wilson, “He’s actually soft-hearted. Also really funny. Really sharp, witty and super engaged.”




Assuming this is just good PR, I ask my chauffeur from Bell Limousine later what she thinks of Ramsay, as she drives him around Vegas occasionally. She unreservedly answers, “He’s the nicest man. He likes to sit in the front seat and play with the radio.” She adds, “I was worried the first time I heard I was driving him: I’ve seen the show. I turned 60 this year and even my children don’t talk to me like that. I thought I may get into an argument with him... But he was so nice.”

A Maha meal at Mahamudra "," Mahamudra, the three-month-old restaurant in the city has nothing to do with the Sanskrit meaning. Apart from being a vegetarian place, the eatery— a part of Isha Life in Hyderabad, isn’t trying to force spirituality down your throat. Once here, the beauty and the calmness of the place and its interiors are sure to do all the magic by itself. This, even before one begins to sip their chia-based welcome drink.




To know more, I met Meena, fondly called ‘Meena akka’ — the mastermind behind every detail — right from the kitchen to the flowers adorning the table. Having tried and been blown over by the veg thali by the warm tones of Mahamudra’s interiors, I was curious to know what more is there to talk about. When dining at a vegetarian place I usually push a few things away from my plate. The rasam, sambar, curd rice is something I always return to avoid food wastage. But here, the swirling aromas of various dishes which pleased my senses made me eagerly look forward to the order. I overlooked the delay in service assuming it is the management’s way to make us practice patience.




Mahamudra has been one of the most recommended places by many food-lovers (all of them being hardcore non-vegetarian eaters) and each of them said, “the food is different.”
To be honest, I had some presumptions — ‘is it all boiled bland food,’ ‘will they serve raw food,’ ‘is it all about millets,’ and upon hearing these, Meena laughed, asking, “What do you think about it now?”




“The restaurant celebrates south-Indian home cooking. The menu is put together with the help of fellow Isha members. Every dish we serve here is probably being cooked in someone’s kitchen now,” she adds, as she offers vadas made of banana flower with some fresh homemade chutney.
As I bit into the crisp vadas my prejudices further started going bust one bite at a time. Meena clarifies, “Since this is a restaurant, we might be different, but we do not serve diet food unless one requests for it.”
Mahamudra is the second eatery Isha Life has opened in 10 years — the first being in Chennai. No matter what one eats, it is a must to try the thali here just for the signature accompaniments. The black sticky rice kheer and the curd rice is enough to win your heart.


Apart from the thalis, the menu also serves a variety of dosas for lunch. In the evening, the menu changes and ‘tiffin’ items like medu vada, kozhukattai, ulundhu paniyaram, parappu kozhukattai, vazhaipu cutlet take over.
In the main course, the starters and the soups are as homely as one can imagine them to be. Thakkali (tomato), methi and kollu (horse gram) soups are a few to try. Kanjee lovers, do try them here and for those whom a good dosa is a reason to celebrate, it is worth trying it here too.
My suggestion? Go for the tables with short wooden chairs. The wrought iron chairs are tall, stiff and uncomfortable enough to spoil your whole meal experience.

Two wheels and some chicken wings "," The smell of soot and sweet barbecue sauce laces the evening air as I near Navalar Nagar 1st Street on Bypass Road. By the side of the road stands a Royal Enfield Classic 350, with its chrome finish exterior, shining under the street lamp. Attached to the bike is a sidecar modified into a stylish cooking station with a grill, a tava and storage for charcoal, spices and meat. On the bike’s fuel tank, a wood-framed menu announces grilled chicken varieties and mounted atop the sidecar is a black umbrella branded in bold white letters ‘Bullet Bbq Ride’.




Chef Abbas Ali is busy tossing marinated chicken pieces on the grill. He gently smears some sauce on to the meat chunks with a brush and a small ball of fire erupts from the fiery red charcoal pieces underneath the hot grill, sending puffy clouds of fresh smoke into the air. Soon, piping-hot and perfectly grilled chicken wings and strips are dished out on paper plates with mayonnaise to the eagerly waiting crowd. My plate of drumsticks arrives and I bite into succulent chunks of chicken with a spicy and crispy outer-coat. With a flavoursome after-taste, the grilled chicken surely floors me and many others alike, for a lot of us order a second plate.




Bbq Ride India, the Bangalore-based food chain on a bike has set foot in the city and has received good response in just over 45 days. Apart from the food, the idea of a mobile kitchen on a bike and the entire set-up are the crowd pullers. “Since Madurai people are meat lovers, we have introduced some interesting combos that are priced between ₹150 and ₹200. Of late, barbecue has caught on as a popular street food in the city and we wanted to tap into its potential. But we also wanted to stand out in the growing number of barbecue restaurants and felt the Bullet Bbq Ride with its unique look, presence and taste is a good option. It’s working out pretty well,” says biker M Ashraf Sulthan, who, along with his friends has taken up the franchise.




“We experiment and add innovative items but the taste is maintained with a set of standardised masalas provided by the company. There are three varieties of spice mixtures with different flavours,” says Ali, who took a two-day training in Bengaluru. “The cooking method is pretty simple. We source around 15kilos of chicken every morning, marinate it for five hours before setting up shop in the evening. Grilling is a healthier method than frying in oil and people lap it up; we have been able to sell out all of the procured meat for the day, so far.”
“The boneless whole chicken breast, shawarma, kebabs and lollipops are fast moving items. We plan to introduce prawns, fish and mutton in the future, apart from more options for vegetarians. Right now, we only have grilled paneer, capsicum and pineapple. We have also increased the quantity and kept the price competitive to attract customers,” says Sulthan. “With the mushrooming of many food trucks, Bypass Road is becoming the eat street of Madurai, similar to OMR in Chennai. That’s the reason we plonked ourselves here. We may soon open another one in the north side of the city, around KKNagar.”
Currently, the Bullet Bbq Ride is stationed near Sangeetha Mobiles, from 6 pm to 10 pm. For details, call 9787528399, 8667529015

What is cold brew coffee? Sleepy Owl gives answers
"," What does an investment banker — and a self-proclaimed “hardcore coffee lover” — do, when his occasional visits home from New York leave him craving for the kick and flavour of artisanal brew that he’s grown accustomed to at the Big Apple? 
He begins brewing his own coffee. 
This, pretty much, is what Ajai Thandi’s story boils down to. Co-founded with friends Ashwajeet Singh and Arman Sood, his cold brew outfit Sleepy Owl coffee has been creating ripples for quite a while now, most recently for having raised a seed fund of ₹3.26 crores ($500,000) this April. 
But for all their innovations and ingenuity, it’s only now that the two-year-old startup has managed to design a product that enables them to set their sights beyond the confines of New Delhi. 
Explains Thandi over the phone, “Our original product — a 1.5-litre brew pack — weighed too much to make shipping feasible. Hence, we have come up with a smaller pack, called the Lil Brew, which is only 600 ml. With this, we can look at other markets.” 




So what exactly is cold brew coffee? It’s basically ground coffee beans steeped in room temperature water, instead of being exposed to heat the way it would in a regular brewing process. It takes at least 12 hours for the taste and flavour to percolate through, says Thandi, after which it is brewed — again in cold water — for a further 30 minutes. The result is a black coffee concoction — for lack of a better word — that can be taken as ready-to-drink, or experimented with as per your taste. 
It took the trio about eight months of experimentation to get their first product just right, adds Thandi. “We source our coffee from Chikmagalur,” he adds, “What you get is made from freshly ground, 100% arabica.” That Sleepy Owl has managed to take the middle man out of the picture and sources directly from coffee growers is a source of pride for the three. 
What’s the difference? According to Thandi, everything, from aroma to flavour to the end product, if mixed with milk. “Whenever I came back, I would be dissatisfied with the coffee here,” says Thandi, insisting that this was not for lack of appreciation of quality. “I think there is a huge gap between the coffee producers and the kind of coffee that is produced here,” he adds, leaving it unsaid that the three of them are hoping to bridge just that.

The canvas of health care
"," 
A media report recently highlighted how the supply of a vital, life-saving drug has dried up ever since the Indian drug pricing regulator slashed its price by a tenth. These medicines were meant for babies suffering from heart ailments. 
There is no doubt that when price control is imposed on medicines and other medical technologies, it is done with the best intentions — to make them affordable. However, when framing policy, addressing a problem in its totality rather than in bits and pieces is more likely to yield dividends for the intended beneficiary. In health care, this means having to address not just affordability but also the issues of quality, safety and access.
The shortage of the drug referred to earlier illustrates this. With smaller doses now unavailable, desperate parents are being forced to administer a fraction of the adult dose to their children and not always correctly. In other words, lowering the price of the drug to a point where fair competition has not prevailed has resulted in the choice available to a consumer being compromised. Not only has it denied access but also promoted unsafe practices, in turn affecting patient safety.
Let us take the issue of access next. The prices of heart stents were cut steeply last year. The problem of stenting however is not just about price. It is that not all those who need it know that they do. Nor can they access it easily. According to a study, 70% of cath labs where stenting procedures are performed, are in metros and Tier-1 cities where just 15% of the population resides. There are also issues of access beyond cities, such as the lack of diagnostic facilities and skill sets among primary-care physicians to interpret medical reports. Lowering prices has had no impact on the uneven distribution of interventional cardiologists, cath labs and other infrastructure and health-care resources across urban and non-urban areas. Without equitable access, will all those who require stenting be able to receive them unless they forego their income and come to these cities for treatment? The answer is no. We must examine all such issues, answers to which will improve accessibility rather than price control. 
 
Does the pricing policy reward investment in quality and improve choice? Not really. In the case of stents, for instance, whether a product is the result of patient-centric innovation or plain-vanilla reverse engineering, it is awarded the same price. An innovation that makes it easier to implant a stent and cuts procedure time is still priced as much as any other in its category. This discourages innovators from making such technologies available in India even to those who can afford them.
In short, price control ends up as a short-term measure to bring down costs of only specific consumables, and for the benefit of certain sections of the population who are in a position to access health care.
The government considers some of these price control measures as a stellar achievement. This is understandable in cases where the benefit has been passed on to the patient. However, this is not automatic. A reduction in the overall cost of stenting packages by hospitals does not reflect the steep drop in stent prices as there have been compensatory increases elsewhere in the package. Similarly, hospitals can even replace products that have passed stringent regulatory standards set by regulators with those that are designed to meet lower standards.
The government needs to introspect on what would best serve the interests of a patient in the long term. The answer lies in an approach that looks at all aspects of health care as threads of an interwoven fabric. From a pricing perspective this could mean controlling trade margins instead of capping retail price so that the benefit of any reduction does reach a patient. India boasts of the world’s highest intermediary cost, rather than a lean trade margin, which makes products expensive and scarce. Research by the pricing regulator has shown that profits made by hospitals and distributors on health-care consumables are beyond acceptable levels — and partly responsible for overall pharma/medical price inflation. Capping such profits will ensure affordability without the accompanying compromise on patient safety and an availability of quality products.

Eat rotis made with heirloom flour, thanks to this start-up
","Have bitcoin? Buy atta. In these yeasty days of e-commerce, rotis are the next frontier. At TWF (The Wheat Flour), which revels in its ‘ground-to-order technology’, Internet-connected, specially-designed, dynamic stone mills grind your wheat only after you have placed an order online.
Not surprisingly, Pranjal Y Kumar and Arjun Rungta, the founders of TWF, are ex-investment bankers and technologists, who enjoy dabbling in crypto-currencies almost as much as they enjoy tracking down delicious wheat. 
Today, their company offers three varieties of unadulterated, unbleached and unprocessed wheat flour. There’s organic Indie flour, Highland flour made with sharbati wheat from the Malwa plateau, and an heirloom flour called Relique, made with a 10,000-year-old wheat strain.
But when they began in 2014, all they were trying to solve was an ‘analytics problem’. Says Kumar, “Both of us are computer engineers and we were trying to create a platform that would allow people to automate their consumer purchases.” They began with atta, since it was a common staple, and launched a store in Delhi.




To each his own
“We noticed different profiles. Some people would buy 10 kilograms every 20 days: usually if it was a family of four or five. Customers from the West or South India would consume that much in 45 days. It began as an anthropological project, then spiralled into something very different.” They were soon stocking 104 varieties of wheat. “Products from Bengaluru, Mumbai... every place we could find. All we wanted was data. We needed to make sure we had all possible options, so that even if customers switched their flour, they still bought from us.”
By 2015, they decided to create high-quality flour themselves, so they set up a small home mill. “It took us 20 minutes to process five kilograms then, which is really slow.” Now, each of their machines can process about 20 kilograms in 20 minutes. In response to requests from a growing band of loyal customers, they began to expand.
Last year, Kumar and Rungta finally launched the company with three varieties of flour. A sample pack with all three, weighing about six pounds, costs ₹799. 




“We never really thought about how expensive it was in relative terms,” says Kumar, discussing why they feel it’s priced just right. “We choose the wheat strain, then the region where we get it from. The Highland variety comes from Madhya Pradesh and Indie from Rajasthan.” Highland is a rain-fed crop, while Indie is sustained by irrigation.
“Highland tends to absorb a lot more moisture, so rotis stay soft for longer. Indie absorbs less, but is certified organic.” Then there’s Relique, which resembles spelt, einkorn and farro in its nutrient profile, and has a gluten structure similar to farro. Kumar says, “This is one of the gifts of the feudal system. Every zamindar had a patch of land where he would grow crops for his own family. Where he wouldn’t spray fertilisers. Our Relique ancient wheat comes from one such feudal region in Karnataka. It took us two years to find it: this strain hasn’t been artificially hybridised or altered in 10,000 years. There are other varieties like this around the country: In South India, there’s khapli. And in the Bundelkhands there’s kathiya wheat. But they have their own peculiarities and flavour profiles. We tested about 13, and then chose the wheat that we felt yields the best-tasting flour.”
Matter of life and shelf




TWF’s strength, however, is an obsession with freshness. Kumar says this also means their products are more nutritious, as they have more fibre. “With commercial flours, bran is separated from the germ to extend shelf life from one month to six or nine months. (The germ that sprouts contains minerals that oxidise very quickly.) A longer shelf life is one of the reasons commercial flours are cheaper.” He recommends consuming wheat not later than four weeks after it is milled. “This is why we grind your order only on the day it is being shipped.” 
Meanwhile, sales are steadily picking up. Kumar says, “After a year of hard work, we broke even last month. We serviced 26 States/Union Territories in April. We believe we have reached a product-market fit with our product range and the next goal is to get into hyper growth phase.”
He says Delhi NCR is their biggest client base, followed by Bengaluru, Mumbai and Pune. And then there are the hardcore fans: “A customer on the West Coast of America asked for 15 kilograms of flour recently. And paid about ₹10,000 just for shipping!”

Overcoming the divide "," 
On the eve of Independence, the founding principles of health care for India were established through the Bhore Committee. Here, health care was envisaged as comprehensive, universal and free at the point of delivery, based on a government-led service, and to be paid from tax-funded revenues. These policies, which were adopted from the National Health Service (NHS), a major social reform in the U.K. following the Second World War, have stood the test of time and remain a source of pride for the U.K. But for India, it is an embarrassment that this health model has declined because of chaotic, mismanaged, unregulated and discriminatory policies and the priorities of successive governments.
 
This has created a second system (supposedly more efficient) in the form of the urban private sector, which is responsible for most health care in India. The private sector over-medicalises: over-promises, over-investigates, over-treats and overcharges to meet management targets, creating needless fear and paranoia. There has been a paradigm shift from a ‘service’ to a fee-for-service model of health care. Medicine has changed from ‘doctor-patient-treatment’ to ‘customer-provider-delivery’. All this disorganisation has led to a trust deficit between patient and doctor.
The decline of a universal, social health system has led to the cost of treatment becoming astronomical. Health care in India is changing from a conservative, clinical, affordable, accountable, patient-centric British model to a more investigative, aggressive, expensive, commercial and insurance-driven American system, without the safety mechanisms of either. India still faces many communicable diseases (malaria, dengue and tuberculosis) which require a robust public health system. Along with non-communicable diseases (diabetes, heart disease and cancer) also on the rise, this is a double burden.
This mismatch is further compounded with only 4% of GDP allocated to health. India has one of the highest (86%) out-of-pocket (private) expenditures on health care in the world. With little or no health insurance, this leads to approximately 40 million people falling below the poverty line every year. Let’s draw an analogy with the organised, Western health system (public and private care), taking the example of any international university. There are two kinds of fees — one for national students and usually a slightly higher one for international students, which is akin to treatment costs in a hospital where there are higher private fees. At the end of the course, all students are awarded the same degree much like patients who get the same level of care in a public or private hospital in the West. Private care in the West exists to streamline routine services and possibly reduce waiting times. 
In an ideal world we would want an egalitarian health-care model. However, misuse of private health care at the patient’s expense leads to a breakdown of the whole model. Compare it to transport, where there are buses and taxis, representing public and private health care, respectively. The drivers are akin to doctors. Someone decides to pay a bit more and take a taxi, creating room for more people on the bus. It sounds reasonable. But if more people take taxis than buses (it is like private health care overtaking public health care), then all the roads will become clogged, the bus services will not be looked after, and the whole infrastructure will be destabilisesd. A doctor too decides to pay more attention to private care as it is more rewarding. Everyone is under the perception that private care is better .Then people can only hope to either take a taxi or walk. A balance between the two health systems is required, where there is no compromise made on the quality of care delivered.
This random and shambolic state of health care in India has made the expectations of the patients and relatives, unrealistic and unreasonable. This has created hype, fear, paranoia, a false sense of security and is responsible for breaking the ‘sacred patient- doctor’ relationship. Expensive treatments and interventions with marginal benefits should be realistically considered to treat frail, futile, terminal patients and relatives should be explained the outcomes. It is for the society to decide the ceiling of treatment. We need to strengthen our public health-care system based on the pillars of trust, accountability and efficiency. A balance needs to be made between public and private health care. This balance will only be restored by the mutual respect and belief between a doctor and patient.

Chef Bhakti Arora on playing the diner’s advocate
"," Contrasting with her tiny frame and her elfin features, chef Bhakti Arora sports a pair of flowing leopard-print trousers as well as purple and blue streaks in her hair — a quirky ensemble for someone huge in Indian cuisine. But that’s exactly what she likes, she says as she sits down, adding, “I love breaking barriers and stereotypes!”
Hyderabadis watched the 33 year-old in season four of MasterChef India (where she came up as second runner-up) and the city has long been eager to take a page from her book. 
Much to her delight, her first session of her Wednesdays With Chef Bhakti at The Culinary Lounge featured the king of fruit and was aptly themed ‘Mango magic.’ Dishes that made the menu included mango pani puri, Caribbean mango curry and Thai dual-mango fried rice. Recalling the session, she smiles and comments, “The main thought behind the workshop was the universal love for mango. Now, the first intention with such a fruit is to make a dessert, a cheesecake, or a custard... typically sweet dishes. We do also see them used to make aamras with puri or parathas, and the raw variety is used for cooking. So I wanted to change the way people looked at the ripe mango. So in the workshop, when the students saw me adding onion and garlic, they said ‘eewww!’ But when they smelled the aroma during cooking, they changed their minds.” And so further barriers were broken, just as she intended. 
But she broke her own barriers, as she confides that not everything goes as planned, “I didn’t tell anyone this, but I didn’t try anything at home before the workshop. I didn’t have a lot of time and when I made the recipe list, I had done it based on my understanding of flavours. So next I’m at the workshop, crossing my fingers thinking ‘God, save me’ while confidently doling out these instructions and demos. But it came out very well. There was also a curry powder in one recipe, which was supposed to be the main flavouring agent, and we later found out we couldn’t source it. So I used pav bhaji masala instead and that came out better than the original recipe! I was open about that though and I showed the students that improvisation done wisely helps.”

Her own curiosity helped the students relate to her and be emboldened to try new things. She designed the course in such a way that sourcing ingredients is beyond easy; in fact, it’s all available there already! After all, why underestimate the value of the ingredients and dishes in their own kitchen? So the next workshops planned will be hosting favourite and timeless ingredients in all our kitchens, but used innovatively. Another theme will orient around high tea but in the Indian sense.
Health on her plates
As well as playing mentor, chef Bhakti will be engendering the making of meals that go without harmful additives, preservatives, artificial colourants and overwhelming cholesterol — all while keeping the food hearty and comforting. Chef Bhakti’s nose wrinkles at the mention of margarine, stating, “I’m all about being healthy at heart, and my way of cooking reflects that. When it comes to making sweet things, I really cannot condone the mass use of margarine. A cookie with margarine from, say Karachi Bakery, may taste good, — and no offence to those who make them, that’s their right — but a cookie made with butter tastes far better and is better for your health than margarine any day. I’m not one to turn cookies away entirely, as we all have cravings, but we should be aware of its ingredients. So my workshops can be a way of getting information and showing how we can benefit from knowing more.”

In a first, skin harvested from non-brain dead patient
","Recently, the State saw its first skin harvest from a patient who was not declared brain dead, but had died of a cardiac arrest following liver failure.
The donor, V. Vinod Kumar (47) was admitted to Global Hospitals around three months ago with end-stage liver disease.
“He was in critical condition and was constantly in the ICU. Two months ago, the work up for a liver transplant was begun. However, a liver was not found on time and he fell very sick and passed away due to a cardiac arrest and septic shock on April 20,” said Rathan Kanagavelu, senior consultant anaesthetist and interventionist, of the liver department at the hospital.
“From the time my husband was admitted, he told his doctors that if he died, he wanted all his organs donated. When he passed away, I told the doctors to take whatever they could,” said Sridevi Vinod Kumar, the donor’s wife. “It feels good to know that his organs are helping others,” she added.

Eyes donated, too

Mr. Kumar’s eyes went to Sankara Nethralaya and his skin was harvested by G. Balakrishnan, medical director and consultant plastic microsurgeon of Right Hospitals. Dr. Balakrishnan said 2,700 sq. cm. of the skin was harvested and is currently being stored in the hospital’s skin bank.
When needed, it would be donated to the burns unit of a hospital where it would be used to help treat burn injuries.
The skin, cornea and bones, which are classified as tissues under the Transplantation of Human Organs Act, can be donated even when a person dies of natural causes. For the cadaveric donation of other organs such as the heart, liver and kidneys, the patient needs to be certified as brain dead before harvesting can take place, said a senior official of the State transplant programme.
He added that skin donation was now being encouraged and promoted by the State.

Guess who’s serving us breakfast?
","How does Sunday Breakfast at a stranger’s home sound to you? Peculiar? But B Shanjay, founder of At 641 community, promises that it will be fun. He has recently launched an initiative that he calls Sunday Breakfast at Surprise House. “The participants will not be given any prior information about the host. We will assemble at Saibaba Colony and travel together to the destination.” Shanjay hopes this will lead to people learning more about different cultures, cuisine and people. “I believe that no meal is complete without a good conversation and that is what I offer.”
Shanjay grew up in a village in Udumalaipettai where the Sunday breakfast was given a lot of importance. It involved the joint effort of all the family members and fresh produce from their farm. He says most people these days prefer a brunch on Sundays and hopes his initiative will encourage more people to enjoy a hot home-cooked breakfasts. 




So, every alternate Sunday, Shanjay and his guests set off. There is a brief introduction of the participants who number no more than 15. “Home makers don’t usually cook and serve such large quantities of food,” he explains. 
There have already been two editions of Sunday Breakfast at a Surprise House so far. “The first was in a house of a Chettinad family in Saibaba Colony. VP Ramanathan and Meyyammai Ramanathan had a big garden and we discussed plants and gardening over a breakfast of idli, vada, ragi dosa, rose cooler, sambar, chutney and fruits. Along with food we also got a peep into Chettinadu culture.” The Ramanathans enjoyed the meal too and said it was a chance to interact young guests and learn more about their lifestyle. 
Sumethraa Sreenivasan (21) decided to sign up for this outing when she learnt of Surprise House on Instagram. “Initially I was sceptical but I am glad I signed up, as I made new friends . We even had a magic show by one participant.” 
Shanjay is planning community dinners as well. “Each family will be assigned either a starter, main course or dessert. I will also introduce non-vegetarian options for Sunday Breakfast at Surprise House,” he promises. 
Info you can use
Registration fee is ₹150
The next Sunday Breakfast at a Surprise house is on July 8 from 7.00 am to 11.00 am

Loretta’s Shakes & Screams in Chennai: the burger that was
","In the bevy of cafés in the city, any new enterprise must scream itself hoarse and ensure there’s meat in its matter. Joining the din is Loretta’s Shakes & Screams, in Anna Nagar.
While there are plans to expand the menu at some point, right now, it’s mostly the expected bits, with the odd exception. The restaurant recommends their cheesy fries, and one would imagine a combination of cheese and fries would be tough to get wrong. But the fries are just smeared with cheese and topped off with oregano. Treating French fries like a pizza base may not be the best idea. They end up soggy in no time and are a pinch too salty — a recurring theme across some dishes, we find. It’s a fairly generous serving, though, and will keep two comfortably occupied.
The Chicken or The Egg is a must-have, though. This is an egg wrapped in a chicken patty, deep-fried in cornflour, with a squeeze of mayonnaise. The minced meat jacket is crispy and flavourful, with just the right amounts of spice and zip to it, and the hard-boiled egg is… well, a hard-boiled egg. As the egg and patty come apart, it does get messy, but that’s nothing that a handful of tissues can’t fix.
Texas chicken wings are an interesting take on an overdone starter. While they’re the go-to fare of sweet and spicy wing, brushed with a honey sauce, it’s the texture that really works wonders. The skin is crunchy, almost to the point of crackling; the meat is tender, cooked perfectly, and the honey just pounds a symphony of flavour into this riff.
Entrées are mostly a pick between varieties of burgers and sandwiches, not all of which necessarily work. The Something Fishy burger, for instance. A crispy basa fillet rests between two buns, quite unsure of its place there. The fillet is slightly undercooked, and oilier than necessary. I’ve never been sure of fish in a burger and this isn’t assuaging the sceptic in me.
The Paneer Twister burger, too, is a confused bit on what should have been a simple act. Instead of a paneer patty, it has a minced paneer paste as the lowest in a stack with nachos and lettuce above it. While nachos add some bite to an otherwise sludgy consistency, it plays havoc with the flavours and can’t be reconciled with paneer, sadly. Moreover, the paneer base is bitter and unattractive.
The 4 Loaf Chicken Club Sandwich pretty much has it in the name. There’s one slice too many here, and it really makes for quite a mouthful. And we’re not quite sure why, but despite the restaurant’s claims of using unsalted butter, the sandwich tastes overtly salty.
A Focaccian Fill then, comes as a pleasant surprise. Focaccia, topped with dried herbs, and a delectable centre of sun-dried tomatoes, zucchini, olives, bathed in pesto sauce and mayonnaise, makes for quite an effervescent combination. But this, too, is a smidge too salty.




The thickshakes, milkshakes and ice-creams are also mostly of the standard variety. Nothing’s quite offensive, but not much will really make you sit up and take notice of Loretta’s. Try the mud apple ice-cream, though. There aren’t too many flavours quite as pleasantly curious as cold chikoo.
So, does Loretta’s Shakes & Screams stand out from the crowd? Not quite. A few of their dishes are delicious and may be worth a second visit, but there’s little here to make you a regular. We found ourselves waiting abnormally long whiles between courses — often as long as 40 minutes. This, on a Tuesday evening with a scant crowd.
Someone steal the chef’s salt shaker, fast.

Soothing the spirit
","Scars on the body are apparent. But Mamta Mohandas wants a mind free of battle scars. The actor never concealed her intense fight with lymphoma. Between bouts in the hospital, she has lived memorable roles, a recent top recall being Janet (Celluloid). She hit the theatres again this week as the endearing Noora in Babu Narayanan’s To Noora with Love (TNWL).
Being Noora was therapy, says Mamta over the phone from Chennai. The actor who fought spiritedly when she was first diagnosed with lymphoma admits relapses were tough. “I went mad, I did lose it.” She may have responded to the illness differently each time, but the constant was her succour – cinema. Films drew her out of the abyss first time around, it did so now. When real life was saddled with scans and tests, tubes and needles, films lent her a semblance of the normal. “This profession helps you feel normal as you try to look the same. When you see yourself in the mirror, you look good and fresh. No other job can offer you that,” says Mamta. Films not only took care of her physical self, it cocooned her mind as well. “I took on TNWL when things were not going well. I needed something to latch onto, to work towards, to stay mentally motivated to see through my treatment,” says Mamta.
Mamta realised early it is the mind she had to watch out for amidst strenuous treatment. “At the hospital, they are constantly poking and pulling tubes into you – gore, blood, scan and tests are routine. Your body gets used to it. But what about the mind?” she asks emotionally. Earlier, she had walked into Kadha Tudarunnu and a State Award post her chemotherapy sessions. “I would push myself to be normal. For me my mental state is very important. If I did not do those exciting projects then, I might not have been so happy and my treatment would not have panned out so well,” believes Mamta.
For the actor who sought to nourish and nurture her spirit after an analogous stem cell transplant and subsequent complications, the sets of TNWL proved perfect. “It was nice to be in such a good unit. The idea of the film was put across to me by Krish (Sattar), the hero of the film. I was told my thattam-look in Anwar was widely liked. I heard the material, decided to be positive; get up and get going,” says the actor. Kaniha was an old pal, Archana Kavi became a new one. “We are even on WhatsApp under ‘To everyone with love’. I worked with a producer who was passionate about making a good movie. It was an endearing experience,” she says.
In the film, Mamta turns the do-gooder who sets her eyes on the happy-go-lucky Shahjahan. “Noora is greatly loved, she reaches out and helps ordinary people. The film captures beautifully a husband’s duty to his wife, contemplates on true love and how it breaks the thickest boundaries,” Mamta gets eloquent.
The actor admits physically it was tough to be on a movie set. “Yes, it was taxing. My energy levels were lower. I still have a long road to recovery.” Shooting in Kozhikode gave her the solitude she yearned — comfortably friendly, yet with a space of her own. She lived with her aunt, worked with people she knew from the Telugu film industry and was in a city whose restaurants and hotels she was familiar with. “It was important as I had to start falling in love with myself, keep my mind happy.”
The first time, Mamta plunged into an array of roles after recovery. Now she chooses to keep her mind clean.
“I haven’t planned. I am indecisive,” she says. She may be uncertain on films, but clear-cut about life. “When things are not good at all, you expect the world to treat you well. My friends and family have been through torture. I remember my dad telling mom that she has forgotten to smile. Now their happiness is what matters to me. My life is so different from others. I think of what is good for me right now.”
On Mamta’s immediate plan is a long-desired trip home — Bahrain. “I need that change. Every time I am in India working, all I had to do was go and come back, it was pressing the refresh button.” She wants to try out alternative therapies now that there is finally good news on the health front. Her priority now is dwelling on her inner sphere of calm.
“You just learn to be mature. I want to stay calm during the time of upheaval and watch silently the crazy world around me.”

Opening up to vegan friendliness "," A colleague was meeting a ‘contact’ of his for extra updates on the socio-political front. He decided to do most of the meeting at a coffee shop close to his home. “But I am vegan. I don’t drink black coffee and the other coffees are made with milk,” said the guest. The barista was hell bent upon making his new guest try the coffee at their cafe. So, he went out, got a pack of soy milk and presented a cuppa that brought a smile to his face. The meeting ended and my colleague’s contact pleased with the coffee of his choice too decided work out of the cafe for the day.
Veganism is a comparatively new dining option for many. With restaurants only listing veg, non-veg and Jain food preferences, vegan eaters didn’t stand a chance to dine out without making their hosts worry. Every restaurant might not have a dedicated vegan section as of now, but like this cafe owner, most eateries are ready to custom-make vegan dishes for vegan eaters.
Reason? “It is about respecting one’s dining habits. Vegan eating habits is no more a rarity. So we have to cater to their preferences. Customising food according to one’s choice of ingredients is the least our chefs can do to see a happy customer,” says Jomy Abraham, Operations manager at Marriott Hotels.




What if I say I want a vegan cake or vegan dessert?Cchef Ratheesh of Marriott’s Momo Café says, “Give me a heads up and we can have the guests licking their fingers.”
While some cuisines are remarkably vegan-friendly it is practically difficult to think about vegan options in some south-east Asian cuisines. Most vegans vouch middle-eastern cuisine for most vegan-friendly. Have they not heard about shawarma and lamb roasts? “Avoid the meat, then everything else is mostly animal product free and nutritious,” says a vegan eater.
In Hyderabad there are a handful of eateries that cater to only vegan eaters. These eateries clearly indicate that vegan food is interesting and the choices are not limited. Cafes like Terrasen and Smart Alec are making a strong statement by offering a vegan-only menu. The response is immense and the popularity is going beyond vegan eaters.
Is it possible to be vegan and eating Indian? “Absolutely. Including millets is a good idea. But again millets are tricky. 
It takes a while for some people to get used to eating millet-based food. Vegan is a way of eating that is free from any animal product,” explains Madhu Reddy.
Vegan way of eating is new to Hyderabad hence it requires extra care while making fancy food. If you thought vegan food is void of cakes and shakes, then try the selection of cakes at Terassen. 
They just don’t stop there, their shakes are a hit with most of the patrons irrespective of whether one is vegan or not and their raw jackfruit sandwich can give the ordinary chicken sandwich some serious food complex when it comes to taste.
Being vegan-friendly motivates restaurants to work on their menu and ingredients. Chefs are working on war footing in order to make vegan food more visible on the table. If food like beetroot hummus and turmeric cappuccino are featured on the menu, curiosity will drive non-vegans to expand their palates too. 
Is it really difficult for a chef to dish out vegan food? “Absolutely not. These days most ingredients are easily available. Honestly a wholesome vegan meal can be rustled up at any home with the basic everyday ingredients. If your everyday food doesn’t revolve around meat and animal products, it is hardly a challenge,” says chef Chalapti Rao of Simply South. 
But he says he is not sure if he can make a pure south Indian filter coffee vegan style though.

The restobar at Greams Road
","Expect few surprises as you hit Greams Road looking for Glee restobar: it’s where B-Side was previously, which was where Plan-B was before that. Old wine, new bottle, minus the obligatory ‘B’ in the name? Not quite.
The interiors are, of course, mostly identical to the previous incumbents’, except the linen and livery, so expect the cosy, but collar-down environment you are used to. But once you’re through the quite extensive bar and food menu, you’re in for quite a fiery ride. They offer over 15 cocktails, not including the margaritas and martinis, and 10 varieties of chicken wings. Glee is a drinking non-vegetarian’s paradise, from the word go.




The cosmo is quite par for the course with just the right fruity notes, a strong cranberry flavour throughout, and a mild citric aftertaste. The proportions are spot-on, but this one may be too mild for some. You’ll want to go for multiples of these. The smurf’s revenge is far too light for any of the four liquors it has — vodka, gin, whisky and white rum — with little zip. The dominant blue curaçao makes it appear more cartoon mocktail, and tastes no different. Eschew it in favour of the Moscow mule. Served in the traditional copper mug, this one romps the cocktail contest with its perfect tango of ginger ale and vodka. 
For the only time, this writer recommends vegetarian nachos over the non-vegetarian. While the former gets the small things right, the chicken nachos are bland, with meat bits dry as bone. The chicken dynamite may be more up your alley. Based on a Malayali preparation, this dish of fried chicken topped off with vinegar, soya and tomato sauce could make me consider putting aside my dislike of curry leaves. It doesn’t overpower the sauce or the crispy meat, and adds a suave complimentary note.




If Glee wants to fly on the strength of its chicken wings, they’re guaranteed to soar. The naked peri peri wings are salty, spicy, crunchy, and a little bit of a happy-dance in your mouth — all one can ask a starter for. The mac ’n cheese wings are an interesting lot — deep-fried wings in mac ’n cheese sauce. The sauce itself is what the name promises. Creamy, rich in cheese, and subtle herby flavours: the chicken borders on bland, but the crunch and cream make up for it.
The grilled peri peri glazed fish is quite the deceptive meal. Served with mashed potatoes, it’s unabashedly spicy: all fireworks at first, but with a lingering, subtle sweet whiff, that leaves you curious and hoping for more. If you can live with your tongue ablaze for a brief while, go for this. The sliced pork belly is unavoidable: tender with the perfect balance of fat and meat. The barbeque sauce it’s roasted with just sings in perfect harmony. All things said, there’s a good chance you’ll leave this pub quite gleeful.

Old favourites back on the wedding menu
","On a warm Sunday morning, guests gathered at a ceremony in Kalapatti are taken in by the healthy breakfast. The menu is traditional, but far removed from the regular idli, dosa, pongal and poori. Instead, there are counters offering chola paniyaram, flat yet spongy thattai idli, kuthiraivali (barnyard millet) uthappam, methi poori and wheat halwa, with accompaniments such as peanut and curry leaf chutneys, among other items. As an antidote to the heat, there’s fresh sugarcane juice with a dash of lime or ginger. “It is exciting for us when people are keen to try out something different. In this case, the client requested us to come up with a breakfast menu that’s high on health,” says T. Rangaraj, CEO of Madhampatty Thangavelu Hospitality Pvt. Ltd.
The menu for both weddings and smaller gatherings is witnessing a gradual change, observe caterers in the city.
A small yet growing segment wants something new within the traditional framework for breakfast and lunch, and caterers are bringing back dishes that are nearly forgotten. “We’ve had varied requests, from the regular menu to a French Onion Soup,” says J. Dayalan of Kovai Caterers. The food differs according to the weddings and receptions hosted by different communities that have settled in Coimbatore, making it necessary for caterers to hire specialty chefs. So, Thai, Italian, Chinese and Mexican cuisine are also making their presence felt.
“Some want a mix of South Indian and Continental cuisines. To make this possible, we need to engage two master chefs. The price obviously becomes higher,” says Dayalan. From theplas and Rajasthani-style khichdis to Erode malligai idli, Kancheepuram idli and ragi puttu, choices are plenty.
The dessert section has also gone in for a churn. Think baked rasgullas, shahi tukda, elaneer payasam, Kerala-style ada pradaman with jaggery, pineapple rava payasam and idiappam topped with unrefined sugar on one hand, and trifle puddings and mini pastries on the other. “The regular kheer is considered boring. So we use seasonal fruits like jackfruit to make halwa and payasam,” says Rangaraj, observing that the clientele that wants a new menu is small, but growing. “Some people ask us for alternatives to pongal, which they feel makes a meal heavy. We suggest alternatives using millets such as samai arisi pongal or thinai arisi pongal,” he adds.
The scope is better to offer something unusual is better with smaller gatherings. For large gatherings, caterers and clients play safe and stick to popular choices. “In such cases, they make small changes, like replacing a regular sambar with kozhambu — vathal, ennai kathirikai, mushroom and vada curry kozhumbu varieties,” according to Friends Caterers managed by K.V. Subramaniam. Pidi sevai, idiyappam and kambu thayir sadam have also made their way into menus.
Want something that will appeal to children? Caterers are willing to set up counters for popcorn, cotton candy and sugarcane juice.
Says Mustafa, proprietor of Aasai Foods: “In Muslim weddings, biryani is preferred. We suggest Hyderabadi dum biryani among other varieties.” The salad spread is tweaked according to the profile of the guests expected. “Children may not like salads, so we suggest spring rolls stuffed with vegetables,” says Dhayalan.
The next time you attend a wedding, look out and you might be lucky to find something that reminds you of your grandmother’s recipe.

Go local!


Old favourites: Pidi sevai, paniyaram, Kancheepuram idli, ada pradaman, ennai kathirikai kozhumbu and jackfruit kheer are among the popular choices.

Bring in the new: Dinner menus offer scope to experiment, with counters serving up Italian, Mexican, Thai and Chinese.

Fair and healthy
","Enhancing access to health care is becoming a central component of India’s welfare policy. Central and State governments have now developed a variety of schemes such as better primary health care, health insurance, free or subsidised drugs and mass screening for chronic diseases. However, out-of-pocket health expenditures still remain high. Reasons for this are a widespread preference for ‘quality’ health care provided by the private sector, and the perception that they treat patients with respect in a ‘respectable’ manner. In government settings, either one — or sometimes both — is/are missing. Health care is usually seen as a market failure, and in India, it has, first and foremost, been a government failure. The government has neither provided sufficient care nor the resources to meet the public requirement for health care.
Our life expectancy in 2016 (59 years) was still one year behind what China’s was in 1990. India continues to be a world leader in all levels of premature mortality, with one of the highest levels of out-of-pocket health expenditure and performs poorly on a variety of other health indices.
To counter their failures and be seen as siding with the public, the Central and certain State governments have been expanding the scope of private health-care pricing. It is not as if the private sector is a knight in shining armour. Some argue that the private health sector has connived to keep the public health sector in bad shape so that its own market flourishes. However, given the scale of the government’s failure in health care, either from the perspective of provisioning or financing it, this argument can hardly be true.
Situating the private sector
The private sector emerged and flourished in the first place due to government failure in provisioning health care. As the government has been unable to tackle the issue of financing care, it has tried to shift the blame for high out-of-pocket health expenditures on the private sector. It was able to do so because various segments of the private health sector (doctors, hospitals, pharma and medical equipment companies and diagnostic centres) have colluded in propagating unethical practices to take undue advantage of people in some of their most personal and difficult times, providing an opportunity to the political class to politicise the issue and emerge as guardians in their own right.
However, politicisation is not the solution and will only worsen the already precarious state of health care. Whatever be the evils of the private sector, it has enhanced access to quality care, and by virtue of that, contributed to enhanced productivity and quality of life. Using the instrument of pricing alone to solve the issue of access to quality health care will not work. Government allocation to health care has to increase substantially along with public provisioning of care where the private sector is, and will continue to be, missing. The private sector, on its part, needs to operate rationally and ethically, vis-à-vis pricing as well as in the provisioning of care in neglected areas.
Where the onus lies
The need for regulation of health-care pricing will remain even if the government enhances its allocations. Given the level of demand, no amount of allocation will be sufficient for health care and resources will always be limited. One sustainable way out is for the private sector to self-introspect vis-à-vis pricing and discuss the determinants and challenges of pricing with the government. The government should have a visionary approach. For example, it could revise tariffs and taxes levied on various arms of the private health sector provided it is willing to engage in rational and ethical pricing at its own end. At the end of the day, both sides should think about how best they can improve the health of the citizens.

Masala chai chocolate, anyone? "," Despite the sweltering summer, Janani Kannan is thankful for having on an extra layer in the form of her apron, along with a pair of gloves, hygiene cap and socks. It’s 16° Celsius inside her kitchen. “That’s the temperature I require when I am making my chocolates,” says Kannan, adding, “But given the soaring mercury levels here, it’s sometimes hard to maintain the temperature.”
The founder of chocolate brand Zitter has stacked her working area with large packets of couverture, and sits surrounded by around 70 moulds in 25 different designs. She’s filling the paisley-shaped ones with mango and chilli-flavoured pralines, while the petal-shaped mould is used only for chakkara pongal chocolate, one of her most popular creations. Bite into it and you get the refreshing taste of edible camphor. She’s secretive about what goes into making it, and only reveals, “The recipe includes everything that goes into sweet pongal, except dal and rice.”




She gives an Indian twist to pralines, enrobed chocolates and truffles, with flavours likemasala chai, sheer korma, gajar halwa, lassi, kulfi and paan. Then there are other varieties like lychee rose, salted caramel, salt and cranberry, peanut butter, coffee, passion fruit...40 flavours on the whole.
“I have a diploma in French Patisserie from Cordon Bleu in Kuala Lumpur. I also stayed in Singapore for a while and worked at a pastry store there. When I returned to India last year and took part in a few pop ups, I noticed people are crazy about any flavours they see on MasterChef. They enjoy new flavours. I knew I could create them: it helps that I have access to ingredients as my friends get them for me every time they travel,” says the 31-year-old, who started Zitter in April this year. 
The double door refrigerator occupying one end of the room holds fruit purees, boxes of experimental flavours and 35 trays, each holding 24 pieces of chocolate: all made by her. “Right from ideating and executing to hand or spray-painting them, I prefer doing it myself. When I hire someone I’ll make sure they are well-trained,” she laughs. 
Almost every night by 10 pm, after her little daughter is asleep, Kannan comes into her workspace and makes chocolates till about 4.30 am. “During the day the temperature is too hot for chocolates to be made,” she says.
Kannan plans to introduce her chakka pradhaman chocolates on Onam. Ever heard of chocolate bars in potato chip, matcha or pretzel flavour? Well, expect that next, followed by a Japanese line with yuzu, rasperry and wasabi and sakura and black sesame. 




A former dessert addict, Kannan says that ever since she started Zitter she’s gotten over her love for all things sweet. “I can’t even taste my own chocolates.” And that’s why it’s great to be her friend and family, as they get to try out and give feedback. “Of late, everything comes out well and my friends are disappointed that they aren’t getting to reject flavours, as that’s something they take great joy in,” she laughs. 
(Zitter chocolates can be ordered on Facebook and Instagram. They are available in boxes of five, 12, 18 and 24 and are priced at ₹350, ₹750, ₹1,100 and ₹1,500.)

Singaporean style meets Indian ingenuity ","Fresh but familiar, global but local, Ek Bar is Defence Colony’s neighbourhood cocktail bar that offers carefully-curated cocktails and small plates with a distinctly Indian flavour in a cosy yet stylish setting. Having recently refurbished their space and revamped their menu, the team has injected their ‘Proud To Be Indian’ philosophy into every little detail of this one-of-a-kind bar.
Ek Bar invites you to lean back put your feet up, and relax in its comfortable corners after a hard day’s work; alternatively, you can sit at the buzzing bar, “the best seat in the house”, and watch the bartenders do their magic. The chic minimalist décor of dark wood panelling, deep colours, and soft candle light is complemented by little traces of India in the old-world pre-independence lamps, peacock cushions, and the eye-catching ‘wall of Indian hats’. 
With the FIFA World Cup on in the background, a smoking room labelled ‘Dhumrapaan’, uniquely Indian products casually lying around in the bathrooms, and an extremely warm and friendly team, Ek Bar feels like home.
Chef Manu Chandra’s food menu is inspired by the nation’s regional diversity and its ingredients are locally-sourced. Ek Bar ke Us Paar (clever name!) is their version of the famous Ram Ladoo Chaat from Lajpat Nagar across the road. The Pork Belly Skewers, with a glaze made of ‘ghar ka churan’, and the Baked Malai Mushroom, served with masala kulcha, are scrumptious dishes that have ‘comfort’ written all over them. But the Beef Chilli Ularthiyathu served with Malabar paratha takes the cake- it’s the beauty of Kerala captured in one mouthful! Ek Bar’s experimental menu seeks to bring back India’s lost recipes and Chef Aabhas Mehrotra promises it will remain dynamic.
Similarly, the unconventional cocktails, put together by mixologist Nitin Tewari, fuse nostalgic local flavours and classic combinations for a merry mix that pleases the taste buds and lightens the spirit. While the Coorg Colada infuses Coorg coffee (and banana chips!) in the traditional Pina Colada, the Commissioner Sahab is a brandy-based drink accented by hookah smoke. The Beeda Tonic uses ‘paan ka patta’ to make an authentically Indian gin cocktail. And for those who get bored easily, the Es-sense is a simple vodka drink served with three different scents in perfume bottles; just spray for a new flavour each time!




Pop-up event
“We want to promote a cocktail-drinking culture in the country. Mixology is complicated, it’s chemistry. Elsewhere in the world, people go out for a drink and food is incidental. It’s the opposite here and we want to change that,” says Shaaz Mehmood, Co-Partner at Ek Bar. In that endeavour, Ek Bar is bringing a team from 28 HongKong Street, Singapore, ranked number 25 in the World’s 50 Best Bars 2017 list, to Delhi for a pop-up event. The team, consisting of Co-Bar Captain Lukas Kaufmann and Sous Chef Richie Tam, will take over the bar and restaurant on 21st and 22nd June from 7 pm onwards. 
With an exclusive cocktail menu inspired by the ‘Golden Age’ of cocktails (from the 1860s to Prohibition) as well as legendary bar snacks, including their famous Mac n Cheese balls, on offer, the two evenings promise an exciting change from your regular week-night. “We’re going in with open minds and we’re really excited to be able to share and learn during our time here. Without a doubt, we will deliver our unique brand of hospitality during the takeover so that our guests in Delhi can have a taste of the authentic 28HKS experience,” say Charmaine Thio and Lukas Kaufmann, Co-Bar Captains of 28 HongKong Street.

Bright Raj on bringing flavours of West Africa in the Deccan
"," Donning a black tank top and a vibrant yellow skirt, Thangasurabi ‘Bright’ Raj hurries around her spacious apartment in Banjara Hills which she shares with a friend. The skirt, she says, sports a Dashiki print, also known as the Angelina print; the textile’s rich history dates back to the 19th Century in West Africa, and the fabric is now popularised by street-style. But it’s not Bright’s fashion that’s the focus here, it’s the smell of peppers and roast chicken wafting through the flat.
The 35 year-old, whose mother is from Madurai and father is from Lagos, is fluent in Tamil. She’s lived in the country for most of her life having travelled to Nepal and Singapore and other parts of south east Asia frequently. Bright studied Fashion Design and Information Technology at NIFT Chennai, and went on to complete her Masters in English Literature, and then worked as a content writer for seven years. 
 ‘Plantain is a staple food as well as tapioca roots and colocasia — these are the bases. We have fuffu which is one such dish derived from this,’ says Bright
Bright has prepared maafe, a traditional peanut soup which originated from Mali. On top of the orange soup are a few golden plantain chips and roasted chicken wings. She places the bowl before us and asks us to dig in while she speaks of her love for cooking, “My mother was a working mother, so she didn’t have much time to cook. That’s when I would dabble with cooking and when I moved to Bangalore, I worked at a food website for three and a half years. That’s when I was exposed to countless foods and recipes with which to experiment. Plus living in Singapore, I got a real taste for south east Asian cuisine given I was living with a Chinese family. So my culinary experience has been building up.” Last year, Bright moved to Hyderabad in December, then she decided to pursue food as a professional pursuit fully after quitting her job in April. 
Bright’s cooking studio, Sinfully Delicious, currently hosts Thai and Italian culinary classes. “After quitting my job in April, I was finalising what would be in each curriculum, planning out my budget and other logistics. In the city there are a lot of established cooking classes which primarily offer baking and Indian dishes mostly, but not a lot of other cuisines, and definitely not of the West African variety. I wanted to give something unique where potential students can go home and feel like they have actually learned something very new. I want to open up their minds to these new flavours.” Bright points out that her classes are pocket-friendly and a lot more homely for those who truly enjoy cooking for people. 
On the West African route




According to Bright, many of similarities lie between Indian and West African cuisines. “We use ingredients such as cumin, turmeric, cardamom — but they are obviously used differently. During the colonial times, Europeans took with them a lot of the local plants and ingredients and cultivated them along their exploratory routes. As Indians, we love okra, but okra comes from West Africa and is one of the most readily-available ingredients here. In West Africa, the most important ingredients are onions, tomatoes and peppers.” 
“Plantain is a staple food as well as tapioca roots and colocasia — these are the bases. We have fuffu which is one such dish derived from this,” she observes, “But across West Africa, the cooking itself is so mosaical; with the resources available and the differing climates. What I have learned is there are still similarities such as kasava, yam, potatoes — basically tubers. And of course, you have lots of vegetables. In Niger, you have thick rainforests and a river delta where fresh fruits and vegetables are used commonly. For meats, you have guinea fowl and other indigenous poultry, too.” 
The continual cross-overs in ingredients throughout history is a valuable bi-product and Bright is ready to dole out such nuggets of information throughout her classes. The course also features touches of Cameroon with its Ndolé or bitter leaf casserole, the country’s ultimate surf ‘n’ turf indulgence. Kenkey, the staple answer to sourdough dumplings, is also on the course. In terms of ingredients, Bright has ensured that she is not teaching anything that doesn’t comprise of difficult-to-acquire ingredients, adding that the more culturally specific ingredients can be bought off Amazon in an instant. 
If the home-chef could use just five words to describe the array of cuisines in West Africa, she instantly says, “Warm, comforting, diverse, tasty, and simple. At the end of the day, cooking brings people together; good food can actually stop wars!”
Bright Raj’s West African cooking classes commence June 19 and run until July 28. Check her Facebook page ‘Sinfully Delicious Cooking Studio’ for more information. Call 9242775552 for more information.

Fried and flavourful
","Very few people view Japanese food as comfort food. Many even have a perception that everything served in a Japanese restaurant is raw. But not to forget is the Japanese Teppanyaki cooking style where the food is cooked on a hot iron griddle. And it is one of the most exciting ways of cooking in any cuisine where the chef with all his jugglery skills displays a wonderful theatrical session with food.
A restaurant doing it with ease and finesse in Delhi is Shiro in Samrat Hotel, New Delhi. It is quite popular for its Teppanyaki cuisine and also as a party destination with good music and food to compliment. It is one of my favourite places to dine in as I just love its serene ambience. However, it was my first experience with the teppan chef there recently. It was a Monday and hardly any crowd was there. Out of the three Teppanyaki tables at Shiro, mine was the only one which was occupied. A USP of teppanyaki food is that it is cooked right in front of you and is served directly onto the plate.
I had a good time interacting with the chef whenever he added an ingredient to enhance the flavours of the dishes he was cooking for me. My meal started with a Miso soup which was smoked to perfection and was very flavourful. The chef started making Japanese fried rice with egg in it. Once cooked, he formed a heart out of the fried rice and cut it from the centre and served saying, “Sir, here is a piece of my broken heart.”
He then cooked chicken breast in hoisin sauce. At Shiro, you can choose from 13 sauces or different flavours to go with the choice of meat. Prawns in lemon, scallion and garlic butter sauce was tasty but had a very viscous texture. Scallions lost their flavour as garlic butter overpowered it a little too much. Basa in Thai fresh red chilli and prawns in spicy laksa were good, specially the fish. Though prawns seemed to be bland and lacked the typical aroma and flavour of laksa.
I finished my main course and the bowl of Japanese fried rice which I loved. But how can a dinner be considered complete if it’s not ended with a dessert? Being at Shiro simplifies the task for you can choose from its chocolate lava cake with eyes closed.

Meal for two: Rs.4000 plus taxes

How yoga can help during your peri-menopause phase
","This year, the focus of yoga day is women and menopause, and it really is a time we could do with some help to relieve symptoms that range widely from irregular menstruation and painful periods to irritability and insomnia.
Seetkari Pranayama (cooling breath)
Sit in a comfortable cross-legged position, with the spine straight. Soften the facial muscles and relax the shoulders. 
Gently clench the lower and upper teeth together and separate the lips as much as you can. It should feel comfortable. Keep the jaw relaxed and the teeth exposed to air.
Inhale from between the gaps in the teeth and focus on the hissing sound of the breathe as it moves in. Close the mouth. Exhale from both the nostrils.
Repeat, breathing the same way for 20 to 30 breaths and then relax and breathe naturally.
Repeat for two to three rounds. Then relax.
Benefits
 The most common symptom of peri-menopause is hot flushes, due to hormonal fluctuations. This cooling pranayama that naturally lowers body temperature, reduces hot flushes. It’s also good for summer. It should ideally be practised regularly, sometimes thrice a day. Whenever you feel the hot flush coming on, control it with this pranayama.
Prasarita Padottanasana (wide-leg forward fold)
Separate the legs 4 feet apart, point the toes slightly inwards, both hands on the waist. Tuck the tail bone towards the floor.
Inhale; raise the chest up. Exhale; extend forward and raise the hips up towards the sky.
Place the palms on the floor or on a block.
Place a bolster between the legs, and rest the head on it.
Pull the knees caps up and press the outer and inner ankles towards the ground. Bend the knees if the hamstring feels tight. Staying in the pose will gradually release tension and then you can straighten the legs.
Hold the pose breathing deeply for 60 seconds. and then release by lift the torso back up. To repeat one more time
Benefits
 The anxiety, irritability and lack of sleep will be aided by this, as bending forward helps in reducing external distractions and stimuli. It can soothe the mind and reduce the effects of stress.
Vipareeta Karani (legs up the wall)
Sit facing the wall, with the hips a few inches away from it.
Lie down and raise the legs up on the wall. Make sure that the lower back is touching the floor and if it is not then place a bolster under the hips.
Keep the arms a few inches away from the body and open the palms towards the ceiling.
Relax the entire body and stay in this pose for a few minutes.
To release the pose, bend the knees and drop them down towards the right and then sit up.
Benefits
It increases circulation in the entire body, releasing stress and tension from the body, resulting in a calm mind. If you suffer from insomnia, this asana can help, as it grounds the body's energy and releases excess anxiety. When down against wall it becomes a restorative postures, and this then induces a deep state of rest.
Seema Sondhi discovered yoga when she suffered three lumbar slipped discs and was advised complete bed rest. Over the last 18 years, she has trained and been certified from the International Sivananda Yoga Vedanta Centre and Matthew Sweeney. She has also written six books on the subject

Add a dash of tamarind petals
"," When you walk under tamarind trees during this time of year, the ground beneath your feet will be dusted with yellow. The first flowers of the tamarind trees have begun to put in an appearance and can be spotted in small sprigs tucked between the bright green leaves. A month ago, we had tried out a few recipes at home using the tender tamarind leaves. The recipe was later shared on a blog, and the comments that followed were a wonderful exchange on the edible parts of the tamarind tree. I must confess that until then, I had never heard of tamarind flowers being palatable or even edible at all. 
The tamarind picking season comes to an end by the last week of March. Any leftover fruit dries and falls off the branches by April, and shortly thereafter, the new leaves begin to unfurl. The first flowers that appear get blown away by the winds and form a thin floral carpet by the roadside. Naturally, these do not stay on the tree long enough to mature into fruit, and hence it’s the best time to cook with them. 
The flowers on the topmost branches are hard to reach, so those on the lower ones make it to the kitchen. These tamarind blossoms are small and have an exotic shape, somewhat like petite orchids. There are five petals, two of which are of a pale lemon colour, with the rest in different shades of orange. The buds are brighter and have a rosy tinge at the tip. 




I scoured the Internet and found two recipes that seemed worth trying: a tamarind flower chutney and a rasam. The chutney recipe uses nallennai to sauté a few tablespoons each of urad dal, thuvar dal, along with half a cup of tamarind flowers, dried red chillies, freshly grated coconut and a pinch of asafoetida. The flowers mimic the sour flavour of the fruit, but on a far milder note; it’s fresher and lighter on the taste buds. We also tried roasting the same ingredients together to get it dry enough to powder. Once it cooled, it was pulsed along with a dash of pink Himalayan crystal salt into a coarse powder. The texture was for eating it mixed in rice, like paruppu podi. The sour note came through, in perfect contrast to the gritty nature of the roasted lentils and the spice from dried chillies. 
I also used this podi in the rasam, instead of the usual powder I use. The dry masala accentuated the taste of the fresh tamarind flowers that were dunked into the boiling liquid right at the end. So this was actually the same ingredient, but used in two ways. 
It was delicious, and we were surprised at finding it as enjoyable as we would our own, traditional tamarind rasam.

The chocolate map
"," Bean-to-bar chocolate makers strive to retain the inherent flavours of cacao in their final product, through minimal processing. This is what sets them apart, justifies their charging a premium price, and in turn helps them support cacao farmers by paying a higher price per kilogram. This skill — of retaining the subtle flavours of cacao and unlocking them in a chocolate bar — attracts a lot of attention these days.
It is quite easily possible to lose chocolate’s natural flavour, if the ‘art’ of chocolate-making is not adhered to. So what exactly are these flavours? To understand this, we would have to travel back in time. Mexicans stone-ground their cacao beans to make flavourful ( often fruity) drinks at home. On the arrival of a guest, the lady of the house would freshly roast cacao beans on a pan and deshell them before using a metate (that ammi used to make chutney at home). This was slow-ground and flavours like vanilla, pepper, sugar were added. After 15-20 minutes of grinding, the coarse paste would be mixed with water and served. This process would release all the cocoa butter, but retain the natural fruity flavour. The flavour notes could include red fruits, raisins, citrus. It is believed that cacao and chocolate have more (discovered) flavour notes than wine.
These notes have now been grouped together for better understanding and interpretation, in the recently-introduced flavour-profiling map by the International Institute of Chocolate and Cacao Tasting (IICCT). Wrongly borrowing from wine, coffee and academic fields, the chocolate industry has often used wheels or spider diagrams to describe and market flavour profiles. “A traditional flavour wheel used in wine or coffee is only an infographic. You might as well have a list of flavours. The flavour map actually displays the chemical relationships, as we experience them, between flavours,” explains Alex Rast, a scientist at the School of Computer Science, The University of Manchester. The map combines an interactive list of flavours, placed next to each other by their chemical similarity. Hence, it is both an evaluation tool and a graphical display.
When you go into further detail, flavours of cinnamon, jasmine, honey etc form a part of the herbal/spicy quadrant of the flavour map, while raspberries, cranberries, lychee, melon etc form part of the fruity quadrant. The vegetal quadrant includes grassy notes and the dark sweet quadrant includes flavour notes like raisin, winey, mollasses etc.
 This system has been evolving over several years, with Rast. It is based on research by sensory experts into flavour compounds found in cocoa powder and their aromas. For the chocolate maker, this is an invaluable tool which helps discover more notes in beans from specific origins. It is useful to everyone, from cacao growers to traders, chocolate makers, professional tasters and casual consumers.

‘Beauty is everyone’s concern’
","It is usual to find film stars, sport personalities and politicians surrounded by fans and followers. One did not expect such response for Shahnaz Husain, one of the pioneers of herbal beauty care movement in the country. From the moment she steps into Fire, the multi-cuisine restaurant of The Park for a luncheon interaction, men and women of all age groups douse my cynical mind with their requests for selfies and autographs with the doyenne of cosmetic industry. 
Perceiving my surprise, Shahnaz says, “This is the goodwill that I have earned thanks to my profession. For me, money was never primary. It was to help people look good without adverse effects. I’m always keen to help people including strangers whenever I observe a skin or hair problem. I try to suggest what is good for them. Recently, I noticed the girl doing my cardiogram at the doctor’s clinic had a bad case of skin pigmentation. I advised what was best for her.” 
Chef Abhishek Basu has specially curated organic seasonal menu for the guest. Shahnaz remarks, “Being conscious about my diet, I am glad about this menu.”
Carving her own niche
Considering that Shahnaz comes from a family of legal luminaries — her grandfather Samiullah Beg served as the Chief Justice of Hyderabad High Court, father Nasirullah Beg was the CJ of Allahabad High Court and uncle Mirza Hameedullah Beg was the CJI — many find it surprising that she decided on cosmetic business as a career. “My father wished me become the Chief Justice of the International Court of Justice in Hague while I teased him that my limited schooling was not enough for that. Having been married at 15 and becoming a mother at 16, I wondered what to do with my life. Not keen on interior decoration or fashion, I decided to opt for cosmetic therapy and cosmetology.”
What she decided, she did with style, studying in eight countries and getting trained in globally reputed institutions like Helena Rubinstein, Swarzkopf, Christine Valmy, Lancome and Lean. “Having dropped out of school, I was hungry for knowledge , till they said, there is nothing else to teach,” she quips. Remarkably, Shahnaz paid the fees for these institutions on her own by writing articles on beauty for magazines and weeklies.
Shahnaz took a major decision when after learning Western techniques and methods she decided to create herbal products based on Ayurveda. She says it happened because of a chance incident. “At Rubinstein, my classmate Catherine used to come with a very beautiful woman whom she made wait outside. Unable to control my curiosity, I found out that the lady was her mother. A well known model, she had gone blind by using a famous eye make-up while advertising for the product. I was completely stunned and wondered that if a cosmetic product led to loss of sight, there is something wrong with the beauty business. Pondering over it, I decided to tap India’s more than 3000-year-old Ayurvedic heritage to find alternatives for the chemicals used in beauty products.” After returning to India, she employed several ayurveda practitioners for the job. “You would be surprised to know that for each formulation we discovered 20 alternatives. Such is the richness of this ancient science.”
Meanwhile, the chef fills the table with healthy options. There is sol kadhi, bael pathar ka sharbat and bhutte ka kees taco. Each finds favour with Shahnaz. “This is the strength of natural ingredients. It not only lends taste and flavour but also provides required nutrients.” As we finish the main course of Thanjavur manga curry, mangodi ki subzi and munsiari rajma masala is served. Shahnaz remarks, “The sheer colour, aroma and presentation makes the dishes so tempting. I will try a little of each.” 
As we enjoy the delicacies, Shahnaz observes that while most people think that creams, lotions and treatment makes one look good, it is essentially our food intake that plays a major part. “If possible, people should go vegan, otherwise they must eat lots of fresh fruits and vegetables; go high on protein and less on carbohydrates; eat dal and rice after removing the water. These are the mantras for healthy skin and hair.” One couldn’t help observe the hotel staff, listening in rapt attention as did other guests around us.
Strict diet 
On being asked if she herself practices what she preaches, Shahnaz says. “I follow my diet rigorously. Breakfast is oats, papaya and green tea. Lunch is usually fruit juice, brown bread, cheese and vegetables while dinner is one roti with subzi.” It must be tough to resist the temptation. “Yes it is,” she admits candidly. “I do have cheat days when I eat Hyderabadi biryani, korma, roast potatoes, kakori kababs, sheer mal and kheer.” Her favourite cuisine is of course South Indian. “Being light and healthy, I prefer idli and dosa with sambar. I learnt this from Vyjayanthimala, who told me that a doctor had advised her to eat these when she wanted to be fit for a particular film.” Likewise, she prefers Chinese cuisine, particularly chicken chowmein, Peking duck and sweet corn soup. “Bahut light hota hai!”
Amazingly dealing with chemicals and their formulations, Shahnaz does not lead from the front in kitchen. “I never had a chance to learn since we always had a cook at home. Once venturing to make rice, I was so confused about the quantity of water and the time required to boil it, that I ended up adding milk and sugar to make kheer,” she quips. 
As the doyenne emphasises the need for proper diet for healthy body and mind, one wonders what beauty means to her. “Beauty is what a woman exudes from inside. There are essentially two aspects to it. A woman needs to be intelligent besides being attractive. One without the other never works. Secondly, neither the skin nor hair colour is important, it is the quality that counts.” Then what about this fanatic longing about fairness? “That is really unfortunate. I know several women having underwent chemically induced treatment to look fair. That never helps as the side effects are terrible. We too are entreated by parents to make their daughters fair to help them get a suitable match. All this pains me.” The cosmetic industry too fuels this fascination as evident from ads. “Instead of changing public perception, they are promoting it. Skin colour does not decide the character or nature of a person or how he or she will be as a life partner,” remarks Shahnaz.
Instead of this obsession for fairness, Shahnaz suggests one should take care of oneself. “Looking good is feeling good. People in general and women in particular must take out ‘me time’ to take care of themselves. This need not necessarily mean visiting salons or parlours.” Stating that beauty consciousness is no longer confined to the upper crust of the society, she narrates some interesting anecdotes. “I once met a woman selling Rajasthani cushions in Connaught Place. She recognised me and eagerly shared that she uses one of my products which she picks up in bulk during her visits to Delhi. Likewise, a guard once asked me what cream to buy for his wife. Beauty is everyone’s concern,” she sums up.

Why is curd used as a preservative for pickles? "," The rains are fleeting, but the sun is still out, and many homes in the South of the country are soaking plump green chillies in salt and sour curd, before setting them out to dry. After some hours in the sun, the chillies let out their distinctive aroma, redolent of sour buttermilk. By evening, the semi-dried chillies, partly shorn of their colour, are back in the curd, soaking in more flavour. After four or five such outings, the chillies are dried to a crisp, and stored, till the next summer. The almost-beige treats are fried till brown-black, and are said to be the perfect accompaniment to a bowl of curd rice.




The purple and orange fruits of manathakkali (black nightshade), lady’s finger, sundaikkai (Turkey berry) and tender guar (cluster beans) are similarly pickled. The best part? They don’t need much space to dry; you make as little or as much as you want to.
After a dunking in hot oil, they emerge dark and shiny, with a crisp exterior. The curd would have seeped in thoroughly, and the multiple rounds of soaking ensure the chillies are coated with a generous dose of sourness and creaminess. This also helps take off the sharp edge, and remind you of the goodness of summer.
Traditionally, South India and Maharashtra have always used curd as a pickling agent. Each state adds spices to the basic recipe of sour curd and salt. Mumbai-based food writer and consultant Saee Koranne-Khandekar speaks fondly of Kutachi mirchi and tender guar bursting with the flavours of fenugreek, cumin, carom or coriander seeds. Deeply flavourful, they add value to the simplest of meals.
In Madurai, Tamil Nadu, 68-year-old V Srinivasan, of Vasan Stores, has been pickling vegetables using curd since 1969, and supplying them to customers across the country, and sometimes even abroad. “I learnt to pickle from my parents. Curd adds sourness and also preserves vegetables well. You can use maagalikizhangu (sarasaparilla) for more than a year, provided you store it well,” he says. The root comes from the hills and is harvested after a bout of rain; it has a peculiar aroma and is an acquired taste. 
Curd, he says, is also used to make koozh vadagams and perandai vadagams (fritters) and vathals (sun-dried vegetables) using sundaikkai, manathakkali and, occasionally, lotus stem. 




Why is curd used as a preservative? Ask any old-timer, you’ll be told how curd turns sour, and then some more, but never spoils. Today, we know about its probiotic properties, but those days, they probably just went by common sense — something that did not spoil could also preserve. 
Consultant dietician Dharini Krishnan says that curd was used as a pickling agent for choice vegetables and roots, with reason. “Sarasaparilla is a known preservative; when teamed with curd, the goodness is enhanced,” she adds. Sour curd is also curative. “A home remedy for diarrhoea used to be watered-down sour buttermilk, seasoned with salt and asafoetida,” she says. 
Delhi-based nutritional consultant Sangeeta Khanna speaks of the Rajasthan desert berry ker, that is soaked in sour buttermilk before being washed and processed. “This aids in fermentation and preservation. Curd becomes sour and acidic, almost like vinegar. Once you add salt and mustard, it becomes a preservative. The probiotic benefits remain, but it helps break down the vegetables into absorbable nutrients.” 
Back in Chennai, septuagenarian Chithra Viswanathan, a food writer and a repository of traditional recipes, says that traditionally all vathals have been soaked in curd before being sun-dried. As for pickles, many in the South will remember eating mor nellikkai, a pickle made using cooked amla and sour curd. “This was a seasonal thing and lasted a couple of months if you protected it from moisture,” says Viswanathan, who confesses her eternal favourite is sarasaparilla pickle. 
Rupa Balaji, who works in the software industry and lives in Round Rock near Austin, Texas, sources sarasaparilla pickle and vathals from India. “It’s the taste of childhood. Luckily, some courier companies send it across. I’m holding on to the two bottles that I received this month. A dollop on curd rice brings back the taste of home.”

Man’s death leads to tension at GH
","The death of a 42-year-old man, who had sustained a head injury in a road accident, sparked tension at Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital (GH) on Monday morning. Family members said he had been on ventilator support and claimed it was disrupted after a brief power interruption at the Institute of Neurology’s head injury Intensive Care Unit (ICU).
But, hospital authorities said he was brought to GH in a critical condition with a severe head injury. His death was not related to the power disruption as every ventilator has battery back-up of two hours. A generator facility was also available, they said.
R. Ponmurugan, a resident of Triplicane, was injured after his two-wheeler skidded off the road on April 30. He was treated at a private hospital and shifted to GH on May 2. Doctors said his family members were informed about his critical condition on Sunday.
“He had bilateral temporal bone fracture and blood clot due to the injury. He was put on ventilator at the ICU. His condition was deteriorating and his blood pressure dipped on Sunday. Neurosurgeons tried to revive him but he collapsed on Monday morning. He was declared dead but his family members protested,” said a hospital official.
R. Mohan, a friend of the deceased, claimed the ventilator support snapped as soon as the power supply was interrupted. A doctor said the rains had caused sudden power disruption. “Even if the ventilator turns faulty, we have manual resuscitators (Ambu bags). There is no question of neglect,” he added.
Police sources said there was a brief power disruption around 5.20 a.m. but supply resumed within minutes.

Think before you pop an antacid
","Stress, restaurant food, not enough nutrition, irregular eating hours, no exercise…this is the sad story of most of our school and office-going population. Constipation, indigestion, bloating, flatulence and Irritable Bowel Syndrome are so commonly prevalent that it is now considered “normal” to pop pills and digestive aids. But we need to give our digestive system a lot more credit and attention than that. Second in intelligence only to the brain, the human gut secretes acids and enzymes that can break down the most complex foods for easy absorption. Our bodies and hence our lives are fuelled by the efficiency of this powerful body system and when it malfunctions — even slightly — it is time to sit up and take notice of our lifestyles. Restoring your digestion is not just a matter of eating better food and on time but also stabilising the digestive system through simple exercises to be done on an empty stomach.
Lie on your back.
Bend your right knee. interlock your fingers just below the knee and bring your thigh to your chest.
Keep the left leg straight and on the ground.
Inhale deeply and raise your head and shoulders off the ground and try to touch your nose to the knee.
Exhale and return your head to the ground and stretch your leg out.
Repeat thrice.
Now repeat with the left leg.
Bend both your knees to your chest and clasp your elbows.
Inhale and lift your head and shoulders off the ground and try to bring your nose in between your knees.
Exhale and return your head to the ground and stretch your legs out.
Repeat four times.

Warning: If you are pregnant, have high BP or hernia, avoid this posture. If you have sciatica or cervical issues, do not lift your head up.

Delhi's iconic United Coffee House turns 75 "," “Archiving dishes is a big homework. We have an archival recipe record of nearly 400-500 dishes, which we have served in our restaurant in the last 75 years,” says Akash K Kalra, Managing Director, The United Group. “Of these, around 150-200 dishes are on the menu all the time. We keep going back to these, bringing it back to our customers, adapting it to suit their palate and new trends,” adds Kalra. 
Despite this emphasis on food, when United Coffee House started, food was not its focal point. It was more of a place to meet and chat — an adda of sorts. As Kalra says, “For many, this was a place to walk in on Sundays after listening to the military nand play and watching the fountains at Central Park for a cup of coffee with snacks.” 
Making the right brew
Established in 1942, it was the brain child of Lala Hans Raj Kalra (Akash Kalra’s grandfather), the son of a liquor baron who had a flourishing liquor business in Sialkot in Pakistan. The family moved to Delhi and were based in Chandni Chowk. 
The first foray into hospitality came with the setting up of the Esplanade Restaurant & Bar in 1938-39 to cater to the American GIs who had their barracks at the Red Fort. It proved to be very popular, but since it was meant for the GIs, it wound up with their moving out after the War in the early 40s.




Around that time, Hans Raj Kalra heard of an affluent shopping arcade in Lutyens Delhi called Connaught Place, which had been built in the shape of a horse shoe, for luck. What it lacked was a coffee house. He bought the place and opened United Coffee House. 
In the 40s, the place would be open from 11 am to 8 pm, typically selling street snacks of Old Delhi. Kalra says, “Food then was commercial. No one would eat home food outside, so it was only omelette, chana bhatura, tikka...” 




Post-Independence, the hours extended, and by the 60s it became a full-fledged restaurant. The cuisine initially was a mix of the Old Delhi Kayasth food and Frontier Province Pakistani food. 
The menu expanded, and during their lifetime, the place had served everything from commercial food, bibiyana (homemade) food, Madras club food, Bombay club food, Calcutta club food, Anglo Indian, khansama-cooked memsahib cuisine, to continental food, Asian, Mexican, Lebanese and, of course, Indian. 
Conceived in the British era, it still holds a fondness for the Old Raj cuisine, especially British club food — cheese balls, cutlets, samosas, chops. 
On the menu
 




Kalra says, “We are known for our keema samosa, cheese balls, tomato fish and chicken a la Kiev. These have not been invented by us, but our variation is a huge hit.” There are plenty of other staples — chapli kebabs, Railway mutton curry, dak bungalow chicken curry, chicken Maryland, coq au vin, chicken a la princess. 
Kalra explains, “My grandfather had the acumen to get some of the finest cooks of those times to work for us. With their feedback and my grandfather’s insight, a dish would be perfected after many trials. For example, a chef from Lucknow might add raw mango and bay leaf to a dak bungalow chicken curry, which made the taste entirely different from the usual one.”
To commemorate the 75th year, a new menu was unveiled in May. Classic dishes which had not been on the menu for 20-30 years were revamped.




 Kalra enthusiastically says, “Fuyong, chow chows from Asia, buttermilk burgers were on the list. These dishes are being adjusted to suit today’s palate. So if a baked salmon was served with boiled vegetables, today we would be doing it with braised bok choi.”




What works for UCH is that it still retains the old-world charm of the 1950s — the laid-back era of fine dining, huge chandeliers, unhurried knowledgeable waiters, the attention and care to the patrons with a sense of discreet familiarity.

What makes the Riesling so special?
"," Okay, I admit it: for me, ‘Riesling’ equated to syrupy sweet wine. However, with wine-connoisseurs speaking eloquently about its aromatic delights, I had long wanted to reconsider my palate. The opportunity came during a visit to Rheingau, a designated wine region in Germany, where almost 80% of the grape grown is Riesling.
What I instantly experienced at the Riesling tastings was the aroma — a strong bouquet, ranging from tangy lemon to rich apricot in the late harvests, with lots of fruit notes in-between. That Riesling can only be a sweet wine was a preconception that stood on its head. Rheingau winemakers have responded to the market demand for drier wines, with Rieslings that carry the descriptions trocken and halbtrocken, the German classification for dry and off-dry wines. These Rieslings have a finely balanced acidity, leaving a clean finish on the palate.




It is important to note that ‘sweetness’ in the Riesling context does not mean an inferior wine at all. On the contrary, Riesling is a grape variety that lends itself delightfully to sweeter, fruit-forward wines. Which one prefers is just a matter of taste. However, Rheingau is the perfect place to sample the sweeter range of Rieslings, because this style of wine-making originated here, specifically at the famous Schloss Johannisberg. The 50th parallel — or circle of latitude — that cuts through the area, is marked. It serves as a reminder of Rheingau’s special micro climate and influential terroir, that is perhaps responsible for the term ‘minerality’ applied to many Rieslings here.
At Domdechant Werner’sches Weingut, another Rheingau winery, I had the opportunity to attend the estate’s spring presentation, a tasting of their complete programme of wines. This ranges from the powerful dry wines, Erstes Gewächs (the German equivalent of the French Grand Cru), to the world-famous fruit-driven dessert wines; of the latter, we did a vertical tasting of 10 Auslese wines. “Sweet” is an inadequate description of these opulent brews, whose clean acidity so elegantly balances out the velvety notes of honey and dried fruits.




Dr Franz Werner Michel’s family has harvested Riesling at Domdechant Werner since 1780. He talked of how the wine is already in the grape, their job is to “allow it to realise its full potential”. Painstaking care is lavished on the process, from the harvesting, the steeper slopes of the vineyards necessitating that the grapes are hand-picked. It is said that many man-hours of picking are required to produce a bottle of top-end dessert wine such as Trockenbeerenauslese. Apparently, many easily last 50 to a 100 years; Riesling is a rare white wine that fares well in the bottle over long periods.
Those who like theirs bubbly will be happy with the Riesling Sekt Brut or the fresh German sparkling wine. The Reisling, as it turns out, is a pretty versatile grape — it even worked well in the wine schorle, a refreshing mixture of wine and sparkling water.

What happens when you buy, cook and eat produce found only in your locality
"," Some months ago, I made scarlet-tinted juice with fresh kokum fruit, and sent the photograph to a friend. We got talking, and I told her about the locally-grown vegetables I keep discovering in little markets in Mangaluru, where I live, after many years of shopping in big city grocery stores. “You should do an Indian version of the 100-mile diet,” she texted back. 
That got me started on a five-month experiment where I decided to eat only food grown in and around Mangaluru, thus learning not just about local, seasonal ingredients, but also how to cook, eat and appreciate them. In the influential book, The 100-Mile Diet: A Year of Local Eating, Alisa Smith and JB MacKinnon of Canada elaborate on their experiment from March 2005 to February 2006, eating only food grown within 100 miles of their home.
The diet struck a chord with many. It not only promoted a more responsible living, but also provided an opportunity to sample the bounty of food grown in a set geographical area. When I lived in Delhi and Chennai earlier, though I did make the effort to buy some organic food from farmers’ markets, I didn’t really think about provenance and food miles. 
However, I was forced to confront these issues in Mangaluru, where squash is gnarly, snake gourd ashen and amaranth leaves overly-fibrous, as locals let the plant mature since they prefer the thick stem to tender leaves. Okra — pale, long and slender — is plentiful, as is the region’s signature brinjal, Udupi mattu gulla, given a GI tag in 2011, and available in abundance from May to October. 
But how much okra and brinjal can a person eat? I was soon to find out.




When a friend mentioned a Sunday farmers’ market three kilometres from home, I made my way there and found juicy banana stem, tender greens, jeegujje (breadfruit), and a local sour fruit called bimbli (cucumber tree), all grown within a 60-kilometre radius. Slowly, I started cooking local.
Admittedly, the shift is not easy, but neither is it impossible. I began with vegetables, and some staples. Roundels of fresh turmeric and bimbli turned into a fragrant, colourful pickle. Breadfruit was used in every possible form — steamed, baked, stir-fried and even fried with batter. 
It took some time to get used to the sticky texture of basale soppu (Malabar spinach) and the idea of cooking the plump stem of matured amaranth, instead of its tender leaves. But they quickly replaced stock staples: potato, double beans, carrot, beetroot and capsicum. Onions, garlic and tomatoes were available occasionally, and I learnt to stock up. 




Until the monsoon set, my shopping bag consisted of the following: two bunches of red and green greens, and as many of spinach. A pack of raw jackfruit slices to cook with soaked legumes, a bundle of butter beans, shiny green matti gulla, a brinjal variety intrinsic to the eponymous village near Udupi, scarlet pink alasande (long beans), slender striped ivy gourd, kesuvina gedde (a local variety of taro root), pale green foot-long lady’s fingers, a native variety, and some doddapatre (ajwain leaves). For dessert: papaya, pineapple, gaali baale bananas and egg fruit (canistel). 
For juice, I’d pop two packs of fresh kokum fruit and passion fruit into my basket. A handful of colourful bird’s eye chillies and three lemons completed the list.
I now stock up on native rice varieties and locally grown pulses, native tamarind, kokum and byadgi chillies besides farm-ginned coconut and gingelly oil. The milk comes from a dairy where Gir cattle is raised; I churn butter and extract ghee.
Mundi gedde (alocasia family) partly compensates for potato, and foot-long butter beans (just six for a family of three!) for double beans. I make the monsoon staple thambli, using everything from guava leaves to betel leaves toasted with spices, ground and stirred into curd.




Most importantly, I’ve learnt to eat like a local. Red and brown rice instead of white, except for when my love for dal powder with ghee is too strong to overcome. I’ve learnt to keep my eyes open at the santhe (fair) and ask questions. The farmers pass on recipes even while weighing your produce. You try them out, because next week, he or she wants to know how the curry made using the two purple brinjals you bought, tasted. (I now buy three kilograms of brinjal a week, for sambar, poriyal and bhajjis!)
The best part about this change is that there really are no rules, only choices. A choice is easier to stick to. You adapt to seasons and palates, minus the guilt.

Making the most of a stretch
"," 
Should we stretch before exercise?
A thought-provoking new experiment with athletes suggests that the answer could depend on how we feel about stretching and what kind of exercise — and stretching — we intend to do.
Once, stretching before team sports and other activities was almost ubiquitous, especially so-called static stretching, during which you assume a pose and hold it for anywhere from a few seconds to several long minutes.
Change in strtetch type
 But static stretching has fallen out of favour in recent years, after studies showed that prolonged static stretching might cause reactions in the nervous system that temporarily weaken the stretched muscle. Consequently, athletes would not spring quite as high or sprint quite as fast after lengthy bouts of static stretching.
So, many coaches and organisations, including the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM), began to advise against static stretches and advocate instead for dynamic stretching, during which limbs and joints stay in motion.
During a static stretch of your quadriceps muscles, for example, you might stand up, grasp one foot, ease it up until your heel touches your backside and stay in that position.
A dynamic version of that same stretch would entail tugging your foot a bit farther up your back, then releasing your foot to the floor, and repeating the motion multiple times. It was thought that such dynamic stretching should bypass any negative impacts on performance, while helping muscles and joints to warm up and prepare for intense activity.
But little research has examined the actual performance effects of dynamic stretching.
Testing routines
So for the new study, which was published in June in Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise (an official journal of the ACSM, a group of international scientists, many of whom work with elite, national-team athletes, decided to test different stretching routines.
They began by recruiting 20 young, male athletes who play team sports such as soccer or rugby that involve running, sprinting and sudden shifts in direction — activities that are believed to demand a thorough warm-up.
To control for placebo effects, the researchers asked the athletes what kind of stretching, if any, they each expected would aid their performance. Almost all named dynamic stretching.
Then, on four different days, each athlete warmed up at a human performance lab.
Their warm-ups were lengthy. In some past studies of stretching, volunteers had stretched but not otherwise warmed up. In the real world of sports, though, warm-ups tend to be elaborate.
To better emulate those conditions, the athletes in this study began with a few minutes of easy jogging, followed by stretching, and then an additional 15 minutes of increasingly intense sprinting, jumping, zigzagging and other moves.
During the four days of the experiment, only the stretching changed during these warm-ups.
In one session, the athletes completed nine very brief static stretches of various muscles, with each stretch lasting five seconds.
On another day, the same nine static stretches were held for a total of 30 seconds each.
On a third day, the same stretches were all done dynamically.
And on a fourth day, the athletes did not stretch during their warm-up.
At the end of each warm-up, the athletes completed a battery of tests of their flexibility, jumping, sprinting and agility. 
Then the researchers compared their numbers.
Surprisingly, they found that the men’s performances had not changed, no matter what their warm-up. They were just as swift, agile, powerful and lithe when they had not stretched as when they had, and whether that stretching had been static or dynamic.
“There was no difference in performance on each day,” says Tony Blazevich, a professor with the Center for Exercise and Sports Science Research at Edith Cowan University in Joondalup, Australia, who led the study.
There also was no placebo effect; although the men almost universally had expected dynamic stretching to prepare them best for the coming activities, it had not.
Reading the results
These results have multiple implications, Dr. Blazevich continues.
They suggest, for one thing, that stretching does not bolster athletic performance when it is part of a full warm-up.
But at the same time, they show that stretching does not impede performance, Dr. Blazevich says, even when the stretching is static.
In practical terms, these findings suggest that if you enjoy and trust stretching before a competition or workout, you may as well keep stretching, Dr. Blazevich says.
“Our subjects felt more prepared for the tasks when the stretching was included,” he says, and that psychological expectation might affect their confidence and play during an actual game, he says, a possibility that he and his colleagues did not test but would like to. On the other hand, people who hate to stretch before exercise could probably skip the effort, he says, if they otherwise warm up.
Of course, this was a short-term study and included only fit young men who play team sports. Whether the findings apply equally to older people, women and those of us who participate in activities like distance running or cycling is still up in the air. 
“We need to test all of that in the future,” Dr. Blazevich says. “More to do!” NY TIMES

Handling a threat "," 
The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare is in the process of finalising an Accelerated Plan for Elimination of Lymphatic Filariasis (APELF). Lymphatic Filariasis (LF), a mosquito-borne parasitic disease, has been endemic in India since antiquity. In 1955, the government launched the National Filaria Control Programme to eliminate LF. Of the 256 endemic districts in the country where it is endemic, 99 have successfully tackled filariasis. However, till 2016, 8.7 million cases of LF were reported in India, with 29.4 million recorded as suffering from disability associated with the disease. In addition, 650 million people across 256 districts in 21 States and Union Territories still face a risk. Therefore, India needs to up its game if it is to meet the global LF elimination target of 2020. 
India’s mass drug administration (MDA) strategy has been successful in consistently reaching more than 80% of the population under risk. However, there are still a number of challenges in more than half the number of LF endemic districts in the country despite observing a regimen that involves distributing at least 10 rounds of the two drugs (Diethylcarbamazine citrate and Albendazole, or DA). 
Sri Lanka — which was certified by the World Health Organisation (WHO) as having eliminated LF as a public health problem in 2016 — has shown that coverage and compliance of services during the MDA campaign is boosted if there is strong commitment to the social and communication sciences, including substantial investments in evidence-based social-mobilisation campaigns. A rapid scale-up of MDA that has focus on coverage and compliance is essential to decrease the number of rounds required to attain LF elimination. In future rounds of MDA, high community demand and compliance will be the critical indicators of success.
The WHO’s recent recommendation of adopting the triple drug therapy or IDA (a combination of Ivermectin along with Diethylcarbamazine citrate and Albendazole) has shown encouraging results in clinical trials across the globe and in India. IDA has the potential to rapidly shorten the number of rounds of MDA required in the community, which can be particularly promising for high-burden countries such as India where compliance to treatment has been a challenge.
Like any other vector-borne disease, management of the environment is an important aspect of prevention. While the use of insecticide-treated bed nets or larval control to check the breeding of vectors or mosquitoes that spread the disease can be valuable tools, an integrated approach could be particularly beneficial. Collaborating across government departments to build cross-linkages with other national programmes such as the Swachh Bharat Mission or malaria prevention efforts could help rein in disease transmission.
The presence of high levels of infection and clinical cases even after several rounds of effective MDA is referred to as persistent foci. These hot spots need to be looked into from the point of operational issues and parasite genetic variations. The re-emergence of infection in non-endemic areas due to migration of people from areas with ongoing transmission needs to be tackled. For example, in Surat city (Gujarat), a high microfilaria rate was noticed in the north zone of the city where the migrant population influx is high.
Elimination efforts do not end with achieving the desired results in MDA. The most traumatic impact of the disease is the suffering caused by the full-blown manifestation of filariasis in those who are infected. Morbidity management and disability prevention (MMDP) of lymphedema and hydrocele must assume greater importance so that the quality of life of affected individuals can be improved. Roping in the Indian Medical Association, which has a vast network of private practitioners, to help support awareness drives and participate in MMDP activities in endemic districts has the potential to rapidly increase access to services to those who still cannot access the public health system. It will be important to adopt innovative strategies that can be scaled up for India to create history and achieve another milestone by eliminating LF.

The taste of the Temple Town
"," At 7 a.m. each day, the streets around the Meenakshi Temple bustle with activity. Amidst the cacophony of sounds and colourful sights surrounding the touristy hub of Madurai, it is the unmistakable whiff of ghee dosas and fried vadas that pulls you in. Whether you are a local or a tourist, there is so much to explore around the temple especially for the foodies. Several traditional joints serve their signature recipes and it is not only their tasty food that fills you up. The lofty colourful gopurams of the temple are also a feast for the eyes as you enjoy the food sitting inside these decades-old eateries. 
The inviting aroma on the East Chithirai Street takes you to the 40-year-old restaurant Durga Bhavan, famous for its crispy dosas served with three varieties of chutneys and a thick sambhar made of moong lentils. 
Hunting for the best idlis is not a task in Madurai, because idli is the food that the city swears by. But, for the perfectly round and super-soft idlis, look no beyond the popular Murugan Idli Kadai on Thalavai Agraharam Street. Not to forget that the global food chain had its humble beginnings in the Temple city. The much acclaimed brand of idlis are as fluffy as cotton and so effortlessly melt in the mouth. 




If you want to burn up the calories after a heavy breakfast, take a stroll around the Chithirai Streets before another binge. The shutters of the 110-year-old Nagapattinam Nei Mittai Kadai go up at 10 a.m. but people huddle there long before. Popular for the ghee-dripping halwa and the piquant Urulai Kizhangu masal, the shop is one iconic eatery located right opposite the West Tower. A bite of the blobby halwa served on mantharai leaves coats the palate with sugar and ghee and the best antidote for the sweet indulgence is the Urulai masal. A favourite combination for curd rice, the masal is a hit among spice lovers. People jostle for a parcel of the masal and it gets over in no time.




 If 11 O’ clock is your customary coffee break time, then what better than the traditional filter coffee at the legendary Visalam Coffee Bar on North Chithirai Street. Thick and frothy in consistency, strong and flavoursome, the filter coffee here keeps the town up and running round- the-clock. A recharge with a tumbler of coffee is also not without some quick bites like vadai and bajji. Walk down to the Naveen Bakery at the junction of the East and North Chithirai Street. It is a landmark where people catch up over tea cakes, puffs, vadais, bondas and polis. 
Before your hunger pangs for lunch return, there is enough time for window shopping in the temple area. Tightly placed with the regular shops, you will surely spot the numerous sappadu kadais that dot the area. For instance, the 50-year-old Modern Restaurant on Nethaji Road is known for its typical vegetarian elai sappadu while the Chettinad mess on Thyagi Thayammal Street or Jayavilas Club on East Avani Moola Street are the places for a spicy non-vegetarian lunch. 

 There is scope for post-lunch snacking too with umpteen number of road-side joints serving a wide range of evening snacks. Standing out among them is the 100-year-old Gopu Iyengar Kadai, tucked in a corner on North Chithirai Street that serves signature items like Vellai appam and brinjal bajji from 3 p.m. To 7 p.m. Delhiwala on West Tower Street and Narsingh Sweets on West Avani Moola Street, offer north-Indian snacks like chaats, kachoris and milk sweets. 
After many rounds of mindless eating, if you are still up for it then take a swig of paruthi paal and later the ubiquitous Jigarthanda and wind up your day-long eating expedition and still feel light at the end of it all.

Where to find quinoa beer in India
"," If quinoa puffs and upma can sneak into our supermarket trolleys, and one too many quinoa salads and burgers continue to make an appearance on restaurant menus, can beer be far behind? Microbrewery central — Bengaluru — is now brewing the country’s first quinoa beer and it is happening at Bangalore Brew Works, where it is available on tap as a limited edition option along with a seasonal mango beer. 
Veteran brewer and consultant Subroto Cariapa who has worked with Heineken, Pilsner and Cobra in the past, is behind this quinoa invention. “Quinoa’s high soluble fibres bring down cholesterol levels and its high levels of potassium (usually beers come with a lot of sodium) are good for managing blood pressure too,” he says. 
Quinoa is also gluten free, so hello guilt-free chugging. In fact, Sakshi Sagaraju, co-owner of Bangalore Brew Works, recently found out that she was gluten intolerant and thus started her quest for drinking and serving a gluten-free version. But, according to Cariapa, treating the quinoa grain is tough (because of the same virtues mentioned above), and a special processing and mashing technique (they wouldn’t divulge any of their secrets) is used to make it brewable. 
I tried a glass as a sundowner and found it to be refreshingly light and rather delicious, and I felt like saying, “Bring it on!” The beer was pleasant, sweet with a hint of bitterness. A certain graininess has been maintained in the flavour, shares Cariapa, and a couple of special hops have been added for floral notes, which explains the pleasant aftertaste. And what would pair well with the quinoa beer? Everything from grilled fish to white meat. Quintessential pub food (think chili chicken and chicken wings) is fine too. Sagaraju adds that the quinoa beer itself is not overpowering, making it a perfect counterbalance to that heavy duty grease in your chicken ghee roast. 
And if you are itching to ask how Bangalore Brew Works justifies the carbon footprint of importing quinoa all the way from South America, then the good news is that it does not. The quinoa is sourced from Anantapur district in neighbouring Andhra Pradesh, where this Andes region supergrain is now successfully cultivated. 
Local, homegrown champs like Karnataka’s very own ragi are not left out either. You can try a ragi beer on tap too — also gluten free — a sultrier, heavier, malty and darker brew. 
For those who fear that quinoa, with its superfood status, might not make for a delicious treat, here is a beer to prove you wrong with your favourite kind of buzz.
The quinoa beer, priced at ₹230 for 330 ml, is available at Bangalore Brew Works until August 31.

Sour power: The sourdough bread revolution
","Unfortunately, Sourdough Hotel’s clients don’t have access to TripAdvisor. So we’ll never really know what they thought about the food, water or massages. Nevertheless, they thrive. So if you need boarding for your bread, head to Stockholm. For 300 Swedish krona a week (roughly ₹2,300), this hotel set in the city’s hip SoFo district keeps sourdough thriving while owners go on holiday — because heaven forbid it dies of neglect while you sun yourself in Ibiza.
Rolling your eyes? Well, hold on to your toast: this is just the beginning. Home cooks, food nerds and artisan bread-makers are switching loyalties: brown bread is too pedestrian, muffins too predictable and brioche too pretentious. If you’re looking for bread with personality, sourdough is the way to go.




Consisting of flour, water and live micro-organisms, this fermented bread is made the old-fashioned way, without any help from commercial yeast. Which could explain why, in an age that values provenance, tradition and technique, this style of bread is making a comeback. Loyalists vouch for its taste and overall goodness, stating that once you taste sourdough you cannot eat other breads. Either way, it’s time you learn about it, if you don’t intend to get elbow-deep in flour, for sourdough is the reigning topic at every trendy baker’s table today.
Mystery and origins
The bread dates back to ancient Egypt, if scriptures and cave paintings are to be believed. The technique lost steam and almost dropped off the radar in the Middle Ages, only to be revived in the early 1800s. With the invention of commercial yeast, sourdough almost became obsolete.
Author of Theory of Bakery and Patisserie and a chef specialising in Indian cuisine, Parvinder S Bali, connects bread-making with the cultivation of wheat. “The origins of the first bread are unknown, but wheat has been cultivated for more than 5,000 years. Leavening of the bread must have been purely accidental, as the previous day’s dough would have been left over. The wonderful fermented smell would have urged the baker to bake it. Khameeri roti is a good example.”




Sujit Sumitran, popularly known as ‘the bread whisperer’, is a name synonymous with sourdough in India. Based in Goa, where he spends hours every week baking artisanal bread, he also travels across the country to conduct workshops. He says, “Poi, the quintessential Goan bread, used to be made with natural yeast once upon a time, and like all modern commercial practices, it was quickly replaced by commercial yeast. Based on what I’ve heard from old-timers, the pois of today — and I’ve eaten many — are just a shade of what they really should be. For starters, they’re quick-rise breads, and in most cases, the dough is pure refined flour with just a different shape and some bran dusted on.”
“I think there is a global renaissance of sorts happening on the artisanal front, a move away from soul-less, mass-produced products,” comments Sumitran. “This, to my mind, is largely fuelled by the realisation that speed and convenience come at a price. Consequently, conscious folks are adopting ‘slow’ as a lifestyle change, and food is definitely up there on their radar.
So what are the magic ingredients? “To make your own sourdough bread you need a starter,” says Arundati Rao, Hyderabad-based home baker, popular for her baking classes.
Science behind the art




“A starter is nothing but a blend of water and flour left to ferment in room temperature for a couple of days. This requires daily care by way of feeding with flour and water. Bacteria keeps growing in the dough and it acts like yeast. A portion of starter dough can be used to make a new loaf of bread. Maintaining the shelf life of your sourdough is pretty much a food science and an art; it varies around the world due to climatic conditions.” Rao further breaks it down like a simple science class, “When flour and water are left to ferment, it supports wild yeast and lactobacilli which is easily available in the atmosphere. On being fed properly and kept alive, it acts as yeast, which makes baking possible without factory-made dry yeast.”
The fact that this bread is healthier than conventional bread is not the only reason it’s getting so popular. This renaissance has much to do with social media, especially Instagram. Right now, #sourdough throws up 13,38979 posts.
Wild yeast can be fussy and finicky: it needs cooler temperatures, acidic environments, and works much more slowly. Then why not opt for something easier? “There is a lot of data available these days that indicate that many of the modern lifestyle diseases are food and wellness induced,” says Sumitran. He adds, “Fermented food has been around in India for thousands of years, and sourdough bread is just one manifestation of it. What is available as bread today, mostly works on the paradigm of more output (volume) with less time, while sourdough is about more output (wellness) with enough time.”
 
As I foraged the Internet for an Indian counterpart of sourdough, I found Bijay Thapa, a Delhi-based wedding cake maker and baker. Thapa brought up his days as a Masterchef India participant. “I bemoaned the lack of baking culture in India to my friend Kalpana Talpade. She surprised me with the details of the Pathare Prabhu community, that started a yeast culture using milk, channa dal and potatoes. They bake a bread with it called parvi pav or pathare pav. From her description, I could say the home-grown pav has to be the Indian answer to the English sourdough,” he says. 




Parvi pav is fluffy and soft, with a muffin-like texture. It is best relished with spicy mutton curry, and according to Kalpana Talpade, “Vegetarians love to eat it with aamras.” The starter for the pavis made with channa dal, unpeeled potato, milk and water. Talpade says, “I like to heat my milk and water together for optimal fermentation. On a warm day fermentation should happen within 12 to 15 hours. The fermented liquid is used to leaven the bread batter and made into parvi pav. Weather and climate play a big role in the process.”
The community migrated from Rajasthan and Gujarat many years ago, settling in Mumbai. “It helped them mingle with the British and be influenced by their food habits. This could explain the strong baking culture.”
 
You will need one steel tumbler with a narrow opening and a bigger steel vessel with lid. 
Ingredients
2 fistfuls of chana dal, not washed or soaked
1 potato, washed and cut into pieces with peel left on.
1/3 spoon of eating soda
One cup of milk
One cup of water
Method
Mix water and milk and bring it to a boil. Put the diced potato and chana dal in the tumbler and pour the hot milk and water into the mixture. Close the tumbler with a steel cover or vessel make it air-tight.
Then, place the tumbler with the contents onto another bigger vessel and close the lid. Then place it in a warm and secluded place. Avoid opening it to check, leaving it undisturbed.
It takes over night for the yeast to form. After keeping it aside for 12 to 14 hours, the next day a froth will form on the mouth of the smaller vessel. Use the froth, water and milk contents to knead your dough for the bread.
Note: Strain off the chana dal and potato pieces.
This recipe is ideal to make pathare prabhu pav, but with 3 cups of flour.

Fitness at a click of a button
","Bored of going to the gym? In the long list of issues we face today, ‘lack of exercise’ tops it. The world however, is waking up to a new trend – Virtual Training via Youtube, which is a hit with the online-savvy generation.
With my own gym membership sleeping, and fitness goals lagging, I decide to accept my friend’s invitation to experience this new trend.

How it works

If Madhuri Dixit can conduct dance classes, and top chefs dish out gourmet recipes, online, why cant fitness trainers demonstrate various fitness postures virtually?
Armed with a laptop, we browse through short videos, elaborate ones and even a 10-minute workout routine, which was rather tempting. Be it yoga, Pilates, Zumba or functional training, the choices available are mind-boggling, a reason why it’s a hit in the west.
While I was grunting and gasping, my friend did the workout effortlessly, listening to the narrator and hardly even glancing at the video. You can download free videos where the instructor describes and demonstrates each workout with slow motion samples. The only equipment required with these ‘remote coaches’ is self-motivation.
In no time the instructor’s upbeat energy has me moving. My sweat-drenched self makes a mental note to try this portable fitness option more often. If you opt for the paid workouts which are cost-effective you can interact with a personal trainer.
Besides being economical and private, it saves the worry of dressing up or the ugly traffic to go out. Depending on your mood you can workout for 20 minutes or up to two hours.
Vinod Channa, who has trained John Abraham and Shilpa Shetty, is going to launch an online fitness programme. “The idea is to present multiple exercise techniques in a simple, effective manner. The varied needs of individuals will be catered along with diet consultation and personal training too,” he says.
Whether you want to kick start your fitness journey or use E-fitness, working out online is a great way to break into sweat. If you’re the kind who needs fitness buddies and a trainer around to bond, it’s unlikely you will opt for this.

Choose Wisely

- New to workouts? Choose basic videos depending on your lifestyle.
- Don’t get carried away initially. You need to be in tune with your body and learn when you can push yourself and when you should back off to avoid injuries.
- Scout for videos of certified and famous professionals which will warrant safety . Some options to choose from are - BeFit, Fitness Blender, XHIT, Sadie Nardini which are free while toneitup,
- FitOrbit and Hitchkit are the economical options available.

Ordering a cake is now as easy as pie
","It’s 11.30 p.m., and you are holed up on your couch watching reruns of Lost and it suddenly occurs to you that in less than half an hour it’s your best friend’s birthday. What do you do? Whom do you call? The Ghostbusters aren’t an option. But you could bank on >Caked.in to come to the rescue. Started a few months back by Vineet M. Benny, this 24-hour portal that delivers cakes around the clock, is a saviour for all those absent-minded, scatter-brained or just buried-in-work types.
“We do plenty of last-minute cakes because a lot of people, we’ve noticed, forget anniversaries and other special dates…” laughs Vineet. Their major chunk of business therefore happens between 11.30 p.m. and 2 a.m.
At Caked.in, in addition to the cake, you can also order bouquets, teddy bears, chocolates, or other desserts. And the good news is that delivery anywhere within the city is free. Their most popular feature however is the services of a ‘music man’. Imagine standing on your balcony as a musician strums his guitar and sings for your loved one. “It’s a service much in demand and the reason why we had to hire two musicians,” says Vineet, recalling the day four people had asked for the musician and what a challenge it was for him to race him from one point to another.
Caked.in manages at least 30 orders every day. “We always have extra cakes for emergencies. One of our challenges involved delivering a six-tier cake. Our delivery personnel usually travel by bikes, but in this case the towering cake had to be carefully taken in my SUV. We deconstructed it and then put it together at the venue.” A cake weighing more than 3-kg gets delivered by car, sometimes even in Vineet’s Audi.
While it is a joy to see a smile on surprised faces, the team at Caked.in has also had its share of not-so-nice experiences. “A guy wanted us to deliver a cake to his girlfriend. But the girl’s father opened the door and didn’t look too pleased. My delivery boy had to answer numerous questions till the girl came to his rescue…all the while her boyfriend watched, hidden in his car,” he laughs.
Vineet’s future plans include extending this service to other metropolises, starting with Bangalore. Guess as long as there are people who forget important days there will always be services like Caked.in

Wai Kiki: a Polynesian promise of warm flavours "," When I first got word of Wai Kiki opening in the city, I was sceptical. What would Hyderabad do with a Polynesian place; and we’re not talking about the likes of Tiki Shack, this place promised to be authentic to its core. Naturally, I was prepared for some form of cultural appropriation be it the decor and ambience or the food. 


But I was taken aback upon stepping into Wai Kiki earlier this week. The interiors are set in hues of brown, blue and yellow, with a few pieces of large Tiki-style artwork peppering the walls. There’s a waterfall feature down a glass wall that provides more of an audio experience rather than a gimmicky photo opportunity. And best of all, the servers aren’t dressed in shirts with larger-than-life flowers. Wai Kiki’s interiors aren’t garish or a mockery of a beautiful culture and that was a thumbs up for me. 
According to the team at Wai Kiki, the concept had been in the making and planning for a few years, thanks to the hotel’s general manager who wanted to give Hyderabad a slice of something truly different. He then snagged Chef Manoj Kumar who previously worked at the Polynesian franchise Trader Vic’s in Dubai, so rest assured you’re getting the good stuff.




Drinks and dining galore
Usually, when we think of Hawaii or other Polynesian states, our palates’ memories are geared towards fruity and colourful drinks– but Wai Kiki has way more on offer. I indulged on a Wai Kiki Tuk from their Freshinis segment, a well-balanced blend of whiskey, Triple sec and grenadine served in a blue tiki-style cup and the right amount of ice. Yes, the amount of ice is extremely important; too much and the flavour dies faster than a mayfly. 
For group settings, there are sharer cocktails available all served in glazed Tiki-style cups and bowls of various sizes and starting at ₹1300, how can any party resist?
At first, the menu for Wai Kiki seems small but given the heartily generous portion sizes, there are options. After all, the heart of Polynesian cuisine isn’t just the flavour profile but also the shareable platters for that family connection. 




Served the Island TidBits first, I was pleased by the sight of various textures of the nibbles available, from the glistening pork strips and the crispy and juicy-looking prawns to the succulent chicken satay to the crunch crab rangoon and cheese balls. These went great with the drink on hand, ideal for that pre-dinner chat up. The crab meat within the parcels was silky and delicately seasoned while the pork strips sang a yummy song in my mouth. And just as Chef said, as the food moves through your mouth, while there’s not a lot of spice there will be bursts of flavour. 
What followed was the Kalua Manu, a set of barbecue chicken skewers served with vegetables and mashed potato. The succulence of the chicken is preserved, but be sure to let the culinary team drape the barbecue sauce over the skewers prior to serving, trust me. 
For the coconut aficionados out there, don’t let the signature Polynesian Princess go untried; the dish is an amalgam of shrimp, chicken and vegetables in an indulgent coconut sauce. The coconut, for Polynesian culture, is helmed as the ‘tree of life’ and rightfully so if this dish alone is justification.
 


The Wai Kiki is also worth a try if you’re one for a little spice; a noodle basket that slowly blooms open with the steaming vegetables, shrimp and chicken sitting in it. From first to last bite, this is the perfect sharer dish.
And one dish that’s worth the trip over is the dessert; cinnamon and orange jus crepes prepared before your eyes. I’m not a citrus-lover but this finisher warmed me up on a rainy and gloomy day. 
Ultimately, don’t expect the food at Wai Kiki to satisfy cravings for hot and spicy dishes because that’s not what the cuisine itself offers, and Chef Manoj is adamant about that.

World’s best alcohol products that have an ‘Indian’ element "," There are many alcoholic products in foreign shores that come with a tag “Indian” attached. Here are the world’s best known ones. 
Indian Tonic Water
A friend from New Zealand tells me that almost all tonic water in the market comes with the label “Indian Tonic Water”. Tonic Water is an important additive to gin, to be had straight or in cocktails. 
It was the prevalence of malaria in India that perhaps gave rise to the tonic water. It was originally used as a prophylactic against malaria, and intended for consumption in tropical countries such as South Asia and Africa, where the disease was widespread. 
The tonic water was a carbonated soft drink in which quinine was dissolved. The quinine was so bitter that the British in the early 19th Century began mixing the powder with soda and sugar, and a basic tonic water was created. The first commercial tonic water was produced in 1858. Gin and Tonic also originated in British colonial India, when the British population would mix their medicinal quinine tonic with their favourite gin or to create Vodka Tonic.
India Pale Ale
Way back in the 18th Century, European traders visited India through the East India Company. They brought with them a pale ale brewed by George Hodgson in his Bow Brewery located on the Middlesex-Essex border. It came to be known as India Pale Ale (IPA) and was brewed from pale malt.
The ale became a permanent fixture in English pubs and taverns too. So popular did it become that a brewery was established near the East India docks in East London. IPAs have a long history in Canada and the United States too, and many breweries there produce a version of the beer. 
Some of the most widely seen examples include Brewdog Punk IPA, Thornbridge Jaipur IPA, Oakham Green Devil IPA, and Fuller’s Bengal Lancer IPA. To conform to the style, Modern British IPAs should be in the range 40-60 IBU with alcohol in the range 5% to 8%. 
The modern incarnation is described as a moderately-strong, very well-attenuated pale British ale with a dry finish and a hoppy aroma and flavour.
Indian Single Malt
The Indian whiskey brand, Officer’s Choice, sold an astonishing 400 million bottles all over the globe in 2015. 
In recent years, the very Indian-sounding Amrut has made waves around the globe in the single malt category. Although discerning whiskey aficionados traditionally would choose Scotch and Scottish Single Malts, India’s craft distilling culture has also earned a reputation for the whiskey it is making for international consumption. 
Neelkanth Rao Jagdale produced Amrut Fusion Single Malt, made of 50% Indian barley and 50% peated barley from Scotland, and the world of whiskey took note.
Leading whiskey expert Jim Murray, in his Whisky Bible of 2010, named Amrut Fusion the third best single malt whiskey in the world, and declared it to be “one of the best malts ever made anywhere in the world”.
Indian whiskeys are made primarily out of molasses. Single malt is a new avatar for Indian brewers, but popular brands such as Amrut, Rampur and Paul John are making the Indian presence felt in foreign countries. Such Indian craft whiskeys are described as fruity, toasty, honey-like and cinnamon flavoured.
While the climatic conditions in Scotland and India are very different, the single malt in our country matures faster. But, Indian single malt whisky must be matured for a minimum of three years and a day in oak casks and must be the produce of a single distillery.

Snap, crackle and pop
","If you do not know how to eat a churro, a big instruction on the wall at the Churro 99 which reads ‘Snap, crackle and pop’ will guide you.
A new den for the foodies in the city, Churro 99 claims to be ‘better than a boyfriend’. Located in Siripuram, the brightly lit and vibrantly coloured place is hard to miss. A step inside and you are in the company of loud Hindi Bollywood music and a combination of yellow and green walls. 
Introducing churro to the city, the café serves the delicately made sweet sticks with dips like caramel, blueberry, strawberry, nutella and chocolate fudge. However, for those who prefer the deep-fried dough pastry to be crispy, thin and a little less on sweetness, the café wouldn’t be the right place.
The highlight of the place is the live ice cream roll counter. The loud music and conversations on the tables are occasionally interrupted by the sounds of two metal ice cream spatulas clattering together. 
After a journey of being beaten and flattened on a steel plate, the ice creams arrive at our table — Alphanso treat and extreme dark devil.
While the Alphanso treat wasn’t much of a treat to the taste buds, the extreme dark devil worked its charm. Bitterness of dark chocolate layered with nutella and topped with white choco chips made the rolls a heavenly combination.
For those who cannot handle the overdose of sweetness, the café also has options for you. From burgers and wraps to momos, the café definitely knows how to spice it up. Chicken wings, chicken lollipop and chicken popcorn are the most preferred spicy starters. 
“Earlier when we started off, waffles were the most sold on the menu but over the time people have been preferring momos, especially chicken peri peri momos and mix veg momos,” says K Sunil Kumar, owner of the café.
The café has recently registered itself on Uber Eats and has its whole menu on the app.

Bottle it up: Review of Frozen Bottle
","It was a busy day at work and what I needed was to indulge in something sweet. I decided to check out Frozen Bottle, the newly opened thick shake store. I found it tucked in a by-lane of Race Course, and thankfully, it was not crowded. The place was well lit and framed photographs of the shakes hung on the brown walls.
The menu had an array of milkshakes and ice-cream jars with flavours like Kesar Badam, Kiwi Krush, Oreo Cheesecake and Banana Gulkand. They also offered two sugar-free shakes in: Cold Coffee and Nutty Vanilla. After much deliberation, I went for the classic butterscotch milkshake, while my friend chose a Season’s Special Shortcake ice cream jar. “It is mango in this season,” said the person behind the counter, as he took our order. 




A filled-to-the-brim glass jar and a bottle arrived at our table without much delay. “These bottles are yours. You can take them with you if you want,” we were informed. My milkshake was thick with a thin layer of froth on top. I took a tentative sip; it had the right amount of sweetness. The ice cream jar had three layers: sponge cake, mango ice-cream and mango pulp. I tried it and was reminded of the fresh fruit. We ordered three milkshakes — Loving Litchi, Spicy Guava and Garden Strawberry — as a take away. The packaging was in glass bottles too and we walked out of the store happily holding on to the pretty bottles.
The litchi shake had a strong flavour of the fruit but was overpoweringly sweet. The Strawberry was nice but just standard; nothing special. The spicy guava was the best where the taste of the fruit could be relished with each sip and that the spiciness of the red chilly lingered as an after taste. It was almost like eating a slice of guava sprinkled with red chilli powder. 
As for the empty bottle I took home, a money plant now grows in it; while it graces the kitchen shelf in the home of my friend. 
Suggestions
The only downers were the plastic spoons and straws. Steel spoons are an option for the ice cream jars. For those customers who wish to take their bottles away, it would be nice to have a place to rinse them out.
Info you can use
Their range starts from ₹139. 
Frozen Bottle is at 127, Thiruganasambandam Road, Race Course.

A cauldron, a kettle and a frying pan…
","My journey to West Delhi last week triggered an avalanche of suggestions. Everybody I know seemed to know of an eatery in that area which demanded an immediate visit. But I had decided that I was going to go there only when I was certain that the food was going to be good. So when my friend NK said that he know of a good little food place on Pusa Road, I was intrigued. NK is not much of a foodie, so when he talks about food, I take notice.
Actually, I’d heard about this from a few other friends earlier, but hadn’t given it much thought. Then when NK mentioned it, I thought I should go there. And I did so earlier this week.
This place is essentially known for its kharora broth (goat trotters), though you also get brain curry (Rs.130), chicken and mutton rolls (Rs.130) and chicken soup (Rs.60 for a bowl). The gentleman who runs it is a genial Sardar called Tony Singh. If you move towards Pusa Road from Connaught Place, you’ll see a petrol pump next to Springdales School. Tony Singh is right there, and has been serving food for the last 20 years or so.
He stands on the pavement, with a huge cauldron, a kettle and a frying pan in front of him. A pile of roomali rotis is on the side for the rolls. I asked for some kharorey soup (Rs.100) and brain curry (which I love). He brings with him cooked masala which he mixes with other ingredients in the frying pan and gives you a hot plate of brain curry. I had it later at home with soft hot rotis, and enjoyed it.
The kharorey soup was delicious, with just some mild spices and flavourings. It was very light, and most nourishing, I thought. What I also enjoyed was the chicken soup, which Sardarji very kindly gave me a bowl of when he heard that I was a food writer. He put some chunks of boiled chicken in the bowl, and then topped it with chicken stock. He added a spoonful of ginger-garlic chutney to it, and then ended with a dash of chilli sauce and lemon juice. It was superb.
The place is very busy, and I could see people sitting in their cars, gorging on brain curry and rolls. If it’s this busy in summer, I wonder what it’s going to be like in winter, when it’s the season for trotters and chicken soup.
Tony Singh has his devout clientele, and I can understand why. For one, you don’t get kharorey very easily in Delhi these days. Two, his other dishes are equally good (though I must admit I didn’t have the rolls). And three, his stuff tastes really, really good.
NK, I must say, has demonstrated that he may or may not be a foodie, but he is certainly a foodie’s friend.

A little bit of everything from Odisha "," The confident and triumphant look on chef Amit Dash’s face makes a diner eager and look forward to a satisfying Odia meal. The Odia food fest at Feast — the all day-dining restaurant at Sheraton is not a wishy-washy amalgam of dishes for a food fest. When Amit Dash decided to take up the project, he knew he was going to go all out to make diners taste more than chena podo, jhal muri and dolma.




Being an Odia, Amit didn’t rely or restrict the menu to his knowledge on the cuisine. He is aware of the richness of the cuisine and also about its vastness. “I wanted to go beyond everyday food. I’m aware there’s more to the cuisine than what is spoken about. I was determined to bring it to the menu as much I could and also learn about it in the process,” he says.
Amit was also pleasantly surprised to see the manner in which everything from utensils, spices to chopping of the meats and other ingredients varied as he travelled from one region to another in Odisha. He agrees he was one happy chef on a work visit. “I didn’t feel I was working while travelling across Odisha sampling food. Everyday was a new experience and new taste,” elaborates Amit.




He travelled from Baleshwar in the north east region of Odisha, even though he grew up in Samabalpur, the western belt of the state. He also went around Bhubaneshawar, Puri, Cuttack, Karapur and Mankangiri to discover and learn more.
“Karapur and Sambalpur regions have predominantly tribal food. Food here is mostly made with indigenous ingredients. Dishes like mondo pura, bamboo chicken, ans so on,” he explains as he decides to offer some Pakhal bhaat with a mini buffet for the sides to go with the bowl of fermented rice. Fish fry, shrimp fry, alu makha, shaak bhaja (green leaf stir fry), karela bhaja (bitter gourd fry), bogori achar (Indian jujube pickle), tomato chutney to name a few. The most common everyday side for pakhal bhaat is bhojja and saggo (anything fried and stir fired leafy vegetables). 




If that wasn’t enough for food coma, Amit brought in muri-manghso. The name of the dish almost made me laugh. Muri-ghanto is heard of, what could muri-mangsho be? “Jhaal muri with mutton,” he explains. The dish, a signature item from the Baleshwar region is an absolute stunner and is best enjoyed by itself.
Dishes like these are more common to those regions in Odisha and vary from dishes made in cities like Bhubaneshwar and Puri. “The cuisine of places like Bhubaneshwar and Puri are a result of the settlers’ influence. So kosha mangso etc are common here. The most spoken food about this region is the chenna pora,” explains Amit.
The fest benefits from the extensive travel and research by the chef; every dish is made the way it should be. The only five star touch apart from the fact that it is prepared in a five star kitchen is that the meat is boneless.
Luckily the crabs for the kakda jhol (crab curry) is prepared with the shell on. Owing to the fact that the crabs are sourced from the Chilka region, the meat obtained upon cracking the hard shells is absolutely sweet. The mild gravy in which it is prepared further enhances the taste of the crabs.

'Savya Rasa' comes to Chennai: swipe right on bun parotta ","You know the excitement of finding the perfect match on Tinder? I feel that way when I am introduced to bun parotta at Savya Rasa. 
As the gleaming ball of parotta (yes, it’s round like a ball) arrives at the table, I can smell the ghee from a foot away. 
Restaurateur Nikesh Lamba and Japtej Ahluwalia look on with pride at this superstar on their menu. 
A dish from the Malabar region, it’s got a flaky top layer and is generously doused with butter and ghee. I eat it plain, then I discover it pairs perfectly with silky vegetable stew. And like Jim Carrey in The Mask, I am forced to say, “Somebody stop me”.




Ahluwalia, Lamba and Vikram Mohan’s latest project, Savya Rasa launched last month in Chennai. It first opened in Pune in 2015. After being listed in the Conde Nast Top Restaurant Awards 2017, the team decided to bring it to Chennai “for the real test”. 
More dishes have been added to this menu. The interiors draw influence from the regions featured on the menu, so there are Athangudi tiles, thick tribal anklets from Karnataka, an ornate kuthuvilakku from Kerala, an elaborate wooden chest from Puducherry, Pathamadai mats from Tirunelveli... 
“The idea is to go back in time when everyone else is going modern,” says Lamba.




Given how diverse South Indian cuisine is, it was Mohan’s idea to showcase food from the different Southern states. “He went looking for master cooks in each of these regions. 
Some of them run their own joints. He hired them in the test kitchen in Coimbatore and together worked on their recipes. Initially, we had around 300-400 dishes. But when the final menu was created, we brought it down to 120,” says Lamba. 
In comparison to other delicious heavyweight Moplah, Malabar, Rayalseema, Nellore, Kongunad, Mysuru, Chettinad and Nasrani specialities, the Karavali chicken and spinach soup is a weak contender. It’s a good way to down your greens though. 




We overdose on chutney paniyarams. Partly crunchy, partly soft, each is stuffed with a filling of Kashmiri and South Indian chilli chutney.
If you can handle spice, the Guntur mirpakaya kodi is a delight. It sparkles red like a gem stone and is coated in chilli paste, chilli powder and curry leaves. It’s cooked in coconut oil and that gives it a distinct flavour. The Pallipalayam mutton too is just as fiery. Tender pieces of mutton are coated with turmeric and tossed with red chillies. “Pallipalayam is a major producer of turmeric,” says a waiter helpfully, as he covers every inch of my banana leaf-covered plate with food.
Just as I am about to throw in the towel, napkin, in this case, he doles out a serving of creamy saamai thayir saadham, made with millets instead of rice. 
But everything pales in comparison to the grand finale: elaneer pudding. 
Made purely of coconut water, this crystal clear, jelly-like dessert is refreshing, and with every bite I fall a little bit more in love with it. So much so that I wouldn’t mind wearing a chunk of this on my ring finger.

When Imtiaz Qureshi saved the day...
","Many years ago, in the holy month of Muharram, a frantic-looking Begum Akhtar comes running to Lucknow’s Krishna Hotel in the middle of the day looking desperately for a young cook. The cook’s mentor hasn’t turned up and all the food preparations for the Majlis have gone for a toss. Her only hope now lies with the young protégé who gets summoned as Krishna’s staff and management are at their feet as a gesture of respect for the famous Akhtari Bai of Faizabad. Begum narrates her predicament to the young cook who assures her that he would do his level best to prepare the meal on time. And he lives up to his promise. Begum is elated to see the grand meal prepared just as per her wishes. She blesses the young man, praying for a bright future for him. This was the first of many feasts that the young cook would prepare for the legendary ghazal queen.
Fast forward to the present day, an ebullient Imtiaz Qureshi, now in his eighties, is sitting on a sofa in a Delhi hotel with a radiant smile on his cherubic face as he recounts how pleased Begum Akhtar was when he delivered the meal for the Majlis as per the promise. He rejoices with humility how her blessings and prayers for him have fortunately come true. “Whatever I have achieved in my life is because of the blessings of my elders,” affirms Qureshi. 
The first chef to be conferred a Padma Shri for his contribution to the culinary arts, Imtiaz Qureshi has been instrumental in the creation of the famous Bukhara brand as well as the revival of the Dum Pukht tradition in India. But, perhaps, nothing can beat his contribution to the preservation of the gastronomic taste that we associate with the mouthwatering Kakori kababs, which, as opposed to the traditional seekh kababs, tend to have a glossy exterior and a much finer texture that allows them to melt almost instantly in the mouth. He, however, attributes it to the former chairman of ITC Limited, Ajit Haskar. 




Secret recipes 
“The tradition of Kakori kababs had all but phased out with the nawabs of Lucknow. For over a hundred years no one knew the secret recipe outside of certain well-known households of Lucknow. In those days my forefathers would prepare them for the rich households on special occasions. There were no shops where the kababs could be sold. But, those people were addicted to the taste of the kababs and so it meant good business for my ancestors. The leftovers after making the kababs were enough to serve the family for a couple of weeks. Also, the money made from the kababs provided for the family’s other expenditures. It was a system that in a way was self-sustainable but it was dying a slow death.” 
So, the actual credit for revival of Kakori kababs, he continues, goes to Ajit Haskar who personally brought him to ITC. “Credit must be given where it is due. It was his vision to revive the authentic Awadhi cuisine. He wanted me to put a food line-up in place in the tradition of the walima — the wedding banquet that follows Islamic weddings. He had a big heart and was fully aware of the labour and sacrifice that would go into preparing such a line of cuisine. The cuisine went on to cement ITC’s reputation in the culinary world,” explains Qureshi. 
Change of image
After joining the ITC group in the 1970s, Qureshi came in contact with another doyen of the Indian culinary circuit, Jiggs Kalra, who played an important role in establishing Qureshi as the face of ITC. One of India’s foremost food columnist and author, Kalra was appointed by ITC, which was still seen as a cigarette brand back then, to help market the brand better so that it could compete with the might of the Taj Group of Hotels. “I met Jiggs Kalra at a time when there weren’t many journalists around who wrote about food and had considerable knowledge about different cuisines. The only restaurants that ITC had at the time were Mayur and Bukhara. Kalra interviewed me and the interview created a lot of buzz. It paved the way for our subsequent interactions on food and beverages that culminated in a book that Kalra wrote. While the book did create some differences between us, there is no denying that his penmanship was remarkable and I can only praise him for what he did for me,” reveals Qureshi. 
After ITC hired Qureshi, he received an even better offer from the Taj Group of Hotels which too wanted him dearly. “I got summoned by the chairman of the Taj at the time. He was surrounded by the area general managers who had come from Bombay. He made it obvious that they were quite keen on hiring me. He was willing to pay a salary that was considerably higher than what ITC was offering in addition to other perks. While, out of courtesy, I did ask him to give me some time to consider the proposal, the truth is that I never really considered his offer. Now, had I been greedy, I could have easily renegotiated things with ITC, but, believe me, I didn’t even make a mention about the offer. The only complain that I have today is that when I wanted to resign, the company didn’t let me go. They kept on reiterating that I was ITC’s face. But after I was awarded the Padma Shri, the company suddenly decided to relieve me of my services,” says Qureshi. 
Chef Qureshi has served several official banquets including dinners hosted by the prime ministers as well as the presidents of India including Jawaharlal Nehru, Zakir Hussain, Indira Gandhi, and Atal Bihari Vajpayee. He has also served the likes of Queen Elizabeth II, Bill Clinton, and Tony Blair. “At a very young age, I got an opportunity to prepare food for Queen Elizabeth II. In those days I used to cook food for NCC Cadets stationed in the outskirts of Lucknow. When the Queen came to India, the cadets were invited by Jawaharlal Nehru to greet her. I travelled along with the cadets but when the prime minister learnt that a team of cooks has come from Lucknow he insisted that we served the queen as she was fond of the Indian food. We prepared everything ranging from Kakori kababs to biryani to whatnot,” recollects Qureshi. 
Special vegetarian meal
But it is not merely his non-vegetarian preparations that have given Qureshi his unparalleled reputation as a chef. At the height of the 1962 Sino-Indian War while working at the Krishna Hotel in Lucknow, Qureshi was presented with the challenge of single-handedly preparing all-vegetarian food at the residence of the then Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, Chandra Bhanu Gupta. “I was invited by C.B. Gupta to prepare a vegetarian menu for Jawaharlal Nehru who was to be accompanied by Zakir Hussain, Lal Bahadur Shastri and Indira Gandhi. I was given ten days for the same. I improvised to use an assortment of carefully chosen vegetables for the preparations in place of meat. While everyone enjoyed the food, it was Zakir Sahab who loved it the most,” rejoices Qureshi. 
Pizza with kababs
Having successfully put the Mughlai cuisine on the world’s food map, Qureshi’s attention is now fixed on inventing new ways to Indianise foreign food. “There are palatable ways in which we can indigenise even the burger and the pizza to an extent that even the respective natives would be surprised to see it. Just imagine pizzas stuffed with mouthwatering kababs. What I am trying to say is that we can easily make it happen.” 
Chef Qureshi has also incorporated changes so that the health conscious people don’t have to compromise on their gourmet ways. “In order to make the preparations healthy, we try and remove all the animal fat and replace it with desi ghee, butter, or, even better, vegetable oils, thereby cutting down on the calories.” 
Ever since his retirement from ITC, Chef Qureshi has been busy setting up new menus for various hotels and restaurants across the country. Over the years, Qureshi has mentored several young chefs and till date he continues to play an active role in keeping the great Indian culinary tradition alive. Next, he would be seen as the chief guest at the India Foodex Culinary Challenge in Bangalore that marks the tenth anniversary of India Foodex—the largest Food Business show in the country—to be held alongside Hotels, Restaurants and Catering (HRC) Expo 2018 from 31st Aug - 2nd Sep ‘18 where Chef Qureshi will also be presented with a lifetime achievement award for his immense contribution in making cooking a modern art form.

Roadside rendezvous
","The weather is great and the appetite is sharp and there is a roadside food festival in town. So we head to Fairfield by Marriott that promises some sweet, sour and crisp fare. Step in and two thallu vandis greet you. Fryums in plastic bags hang from it and bottles of goli soda decorate the front.




‘Kovai Kulir Bhaana Kadai,’ announces one. “It means Kovai’s cool drinks shop,” explains Bharath of Marriott. A pyramid of shiny davara-tumblers are a reassuring hint of filter coffee to come. There is rose milk, nannari sherbat and shukku coffee among other ‘cool drinks’. We decide on the goli soda with a dash of refreshing nannari syrup and it is a good choice.
The Chintu aur Mintu Chat Bhandar on wheels offers chaat in various avatars. Dahi chat, kachori chat, bhel puri, paani puri, alu tikki... Sit or stand around it and pick and choose your toppings and garnishes as the chaatwallah obliges. Sundal with manga is there and it is served with a side of sweet potato that is absolutely delicious with a squeeze of lemon on it. Just the chaats could be dinner, but there is more inside with momos (both veg and non-veg), dosa, vadaa pav and paav bhaaji. 
There is nice sizzle and smoke at the live counters as dosas fly off the tavaa with assorted accompaniments. We are persuaded to try egg curry made two ways with the dosa. There is chicken curry to go with it too. Chicken, mutton and fish kebabs are being prepared at a nearby counter.
If you still feel the festival fare is but starters, dig into a main course of Thai curry, mushroom curry, paneer gravy, several non-vegetarian curries to be eaten with steamed rice/rotis, biriyani and pastas. 




The goli soda does its job of washing everything down smoothly and the phirni served in a kulhad (mud pot) completes the experience of eating street food and the Tirunelveli halwa (sourced from there) is the grand conclusion.
The Rottu Kadai Fest is on till July 29 from 7.00 pm to 11.00 pm and costs Rs 699 plus taxes. For reservations, call 7094446622

Aminabad platter
","During a party for a British officer at the Nawab of Awadh’s residence, a particular kebab became the centre of attention. The officer loved the fine mince skewered kebabs and asked to see the chef. Complimenting him, he asked for the name of the kebabs so that he’d know what to ask for. “But the bawarchi had no idea; he’d just made up the recipe. The chef came from Kakori, a small town near Lucknow, and so the kebabs were given a name,” recounts Shahnawaz Qureshi, sous chef, Saffron, JW Marriot, on how the Kakori kebab originated.
Regaling me with Awadhi tales heard from his maternal grandfather, Qureshi plays the perfect host. But instead of serving up the famed Kakori kebab, he insists I try the gilawati kebab, literally meaning melt-in-the-mouth. Rather than skewered and barbequed on charcoal like the Kakori, these round kebabs are fried on the tawa. According to the menu, the lamb is ground to a velvety smooth texture, marinated and cooked in over 18 different spices. “Oh, that’s just what we write on the menu! We use a lot more spices; way too many to count,” says the chef, refusing to reveal his secret recipe.
One of the oldest and best-known eateries to serve gilawati kebabs in Lucknow’s Aminabad bazaar is Tunday Kababi. The restaurant, which has been around for about 100 years, gets its name from its owner. “He had a slightly disfigured arm so everyone called him tunday. The name stuck,” says Qureshi. The restaurant’s reputation is such that gilawati kebabs are often referred to as Tunday kebabs.
“Aminabad is one of the most popular food streets across the world,” says Qureshi, whose first job was at a restaurant in the area about 10 years ago. “I learnt the tricks of the trade at Arabiya restaurant, right opposite Tunday Kababi.” Qureshi has fond memories of eating mewe ki kheer, harey masale ka kheema, nalli nihari, and bhuna gosht in Aminabad.
Though Arabiya was Qureshi’s first stop in a professional kitchen, he had a head start in cooking. “It is a khandaani pesha (family profession),” claims Qureshi, whose paternal grandfather and father were both butchers. “Butchers are always fine cooks as well. They know exactly which section of the animal to use for a particular dish. nalli nihari, for instance, is made best with the meat just above the trotters.”
The first time Qureshi cooked, he ended up replicating the Hyderabadi kacche gosht ki biryani. “I was barely 17 and didn’t even know the dish existed! I made it by accident and my mother recognised what I’d created. That’s when she gave me all the cooking secrets her father had passed on to her, such as using jaiphal (nutmeg) in mutton biryani, or using spices such as khas ki jadh (dried vetiver roots) or the popular Lucknowi spice pipri to add a sourness to the kebabs.”
Food was always an integral part of his life. “I had two sisters and three brothers and all of us have a passion for food. If the handi (dish) of the day didn’t turn out well, it ruined everyone’s mood,” he laughs. Despite having worked at a number of five-star properties across the country, the nalli nihari his mother made is still his favourite. “The nihari was made of either beef or mutton, which was left to cook in a stock in the clay oven all night long. We would wake up with the aroma filling our home. It always made my day,” he says nostalgically. Although he now cooks nihari in refined oil to make it lighter, he admits that the best way is to cook it in mustard oil. “Heat the mustard oil in the pan, then add a little salt and water. That helps to soften the flavour,” is his tip.
We sample the chef’s special koh-e-Awadh instead. The incredible falling-off-the-bone lamb is served in delicious gravy. “The cuisine of Awadh has no use of tomatoes. The fruit was introduced much later,” he says.
During the course of our meal, I’ve sampled some of the best of his Awadhi starters, as well as his signature dal-e-khaas. However, I have a long way to go before I have sampled all of Awadh’s delicacies. So when Qureshi claims that the cuisine uses spices such as ajwain and saunf to aid digestion, making it summer-proof, he has inadvertently encouraged me to call on him again!

Come, tell me how you feast
"," Picture these. 
A few generations ago, Garhwali families would break down entire carcasses from a hunt, for consumption. Then eventually, cuts of meat began to be commercially available, and what was once a regular feature on menus, gradually disappeared from mainstream family tables.
Traditionally, in Kerala, all temple prasadams were coconut-heavy. In Karnataka, sugarcane and jaggery would dominate. If you go further South, you will find rice-based prasadam. Whatever people grew there, based on climatic conditions, was first offered to the temple and then fed to the people. It was a happy ecosystem.




And then there is the food of the Kayasth community: a perfect example of a syncretism, with its Hindu, Muslim and British colonial elements, yet not a cuisine commercially found. 
These are not titbits of information that you will come by with some casual reading. But this may change soon, thanks to a growing band of home chefs and food experts, working on pop-ups across the country to spread word of the food of their people and enlighten us about the bountiful heritage that is Indian food .
“I began to research Garhwali cuisine of Uttarakhand, as a new Gujarati bride married into a Garhwali family, completely enamoured by the food of my new family,” says Rushina Munshaw Ghildiyal, author, food historian and owner, A Perfect Bite Consulting and APB Cook Studio, Mumbai. 
Here, there and everywhere




“My pop-ups were limited to two a year, because my access to ingredients was based on my visits to the Garhwal region,” adds Ghildiyal. “I did small pop-ups at my studio and then did the Garhwali sojourn with the JW Marriott Mussoorie, where we worked together to create a Garhwali menu, and invited food personalities from across the country on a four-day sojourn. I do pop-ups on Garhwali and Kutchi Bhatia of Gujarat now, every two-three months and have even done one on Shravan food. My approach is more to keep different cuisines alive rather than just the one.”
Anoothi Vishal, a Delhi-based author, columnist and curator best known for her over 40 pop-ups of Kayasth Khatirdari, feels it’s all about the narrative. 
“You see the mixing of cultural influences — Hindu, Mughal courtly and British colonial as well — in Kayasth food. So it becomes a part of a larger narrative when I do the pop-ups,” she says. Vishal’s pop-ups are in multiple formats — from small intimate meals where she does all the cooking, to working with larger brands curating tables for 20-25. Vishal stresses that the key is to offer guests a complete experience. “Food is important, but is only one part of it. We’ve always served wine or cocktails with our meals, and there is always one engaging activity for people to interact. I also always talk about food history. So it becomes like an arty salon. In fact, at one of my pop-ups at a resort in the depths of Chattarpur, I had my music teacher come in and sing different holis in various ragas. We served holi food and people travelled for more than an hour to get to the place!” Taking his guests through an experience — the thought process of putting a dish on the table and its back story — is something that Rakesh Raghunathan, a food heirloom curator based in Chennai, likes to do as well. With over 10 varied pop-ups to his credit, Raghunathan focusses on thematic menus that make up the South Indian culinary fabric.
Time and place




“I did a pop-up we called the Pilgrim’s Palate with a premium hotel recently. This was about food from temples and temple towns across South India, and was a vegetarian festival with no garlic and no onion. The idea was to get people to understand the history behind a temple recipe and the reason why certain ingredients are used or not, in them. For example — you will never find dishes with tur dal, chillies or asafoetida, as these are not native to us. Temple recipes are all region-inspired.”
Raghunathan also has stories to share on the cultural relevance of dishes in his menus. For example, kootan choru, a rice-based dish made in Tirunelveli, is made during the harvest season, when people from all over the area bring in various ingredients, cook it and then eat it as a community. 
This love for the rustic, perhaps, is what Ummi Abdulla, a food consultant based in Kozhikode and the doyenne of Mapilla cuisine, credits for the surge in interest in the food of the Malabar region. 




With dozens of pop-ups across premium hotels to her credit, Abdulla says, “People read reviews of my pop-ups and I see a larger number come in to try the food each time I do one. They are interested in understanding more of its history and how it is made. Dishes like pathiri, a rice pancake, or the Thalassery biryani use minimal ingredients but have the most flavour. People are always curious to know about the origin, cooking techniques and ingredients.”
“People love it when we say our Assamese cooking is more ingredient-based than spice-based,” says Kashmiri Nath, a Guwahati-based food consultant, recipe developer, blogger, home chef and baker. Nath has worked on several Assamese pop-ups across the country, and finds that people now have open minds towards cuisines they are unfamiliar with. 
Ghildiyal sums up such food pop-up experiences saying that the wealth of Indian food and cooking is in the kitchens of our homes, it’s in the hands of our women and men, who have been cooking that food for years. You may be a Masterchef, but you will not be able to replicate something that a home chef has made. And it is through these pop-ups that cuisines we have grown up with are kept alive.

It’s the malt of the earth
","Almost everybody who attended the whiskey appreciation event at EEST, Westin Velachery seemed to discern the many complex flavours of whiskey. All this was new to someone like me who followed the general rule of thumb, which is to slowly take the first sip and then gulp down the rest. Sensing my awkwardness, the evening’s host, Sandeep Arora, director of Spiritual Luxury Living, that provides consultancy and services in top-end luxury spirits in India, walked up to the table and gave me my first lesson in whiskey appreciation. “Today, you’re not getting drunk,” he said sternly. This is not the occasion, I told myself.
Through the course of the evening, we were to taste the Glenlivet Single Malt whisky — actually three of them all of which have aged differently. He picked up the glass that contained a 15-year-old Glenlivet and looked at it with awe, just for a moment.
“A little bit of water is enough to release the oils and its many flavours,” he said, adding some water to the whiskey. Holding the glass up, he said, “Look, look. Can you see the whisky opening up?” At this point, I sank into my chair. I had been doing it wrong all this while. My friend clarified her doubt: Is coke the worst thing to add to a glass of whiskey? “It kills the flavour,” replied Sandeep. If you are thinking that ‘on-the-rocks’ is perhaps the best way to drink it, apparently that doesn’t work as well. “Too much ice dilutes the whisky, but I leave it to you,” he said.
What is so special about Glenlivet that it deserves appreciation? “The Glenlivet variants are complex whiskeys. They have different layers of aromas and flavours. For instance, a 12- year-old Glenlivet has pineapple and Indian summer fruit flavours coming through. A 15- year-old whiskey is softer,” he says leaving me to my first drink of the night — a 15-year-old Glenlivet.
On this particular Saturday night, it was paired with pan-fried scallops, dim sums and sushi. To read from the menu, the liquor is supposed give out orange peel and grapefruit aromas and taste incredibly smooth. After making a mental note to crosscheck for facts, I ‘open’-ed up the whiskey as instructed and took my first sip. It was indeed smooth and sweet although it was difficult to understand the logic of why this particular scotch needed to be paired with this specific cuisine. “It is not as though Glenlivet should only be paired with Asian foods. It is difficult to embrace pairing because we all have different palettes,” he offered.
Next up on the menu was the 12-year-old Glenlivet, which was paired with the main course that consists of tenderloin teriyaki (beef), salmon or fried noodles with vegetables. The flavours felt a bit stronger than the previous one.
“Wait until you drink the 18-year-old, which is a lot more complex and has depth,” he assures. After hearing the word ‘complex’ for the hundredth time at the event, it was time to ask the basic question: what does he mean by complex? “Take Fanta, for example,” he graciously tried to answer, “There is only one single flavour – it feels orangey, right? When you are drinking a certain whisky, you should notice how it doesn’t have a single statement. There are different layers of flavours and aromas. That defines the complexity.” I nod in agreement.
We are served the dessert — triple coconut bliss, along with the final drink of the evening, an 18-year-old Glenlivet. The 18-year-old does feel more complex and is harsher on the tongue, just like how Sandeep said it would be. The taste lingers even after you have a spoon of coconut ice cream.
Hearing this, Sandeep replied, “Oh, many felt that the 18-year-old was the smoothest.”
As the informative evening came to a close, I was feeling good about myself — I did not feel high and I was learning to appreciate whiskey the way it needs to be. But, something was wrong. As I tried to get up, my legs refused to untangle themselves and that’s when my friend broke the news: I had had one too many, yet again.

The dabba from home "," Now that the summer vacations have come to an end and the new school year has commenced, it’s time for families to get back to regular school routine and the one of what to pack for lunch. 
When we were growing up our school lunches were a reflection of the kind of food we ate at home and most often we would barter our tiffin with others. A puli saadham for example would be exchanged for a pongal, a payasam, an aloo subzi and so on. 
Somewhere along the way that changed and the packed lunches got fancier but less nutritious so much so that schools are now stepping in to provide nutrition as they see fit. Parents are being urged to send simple, wholesome meals in the right quantities. Some schools are even suggesting weekly meal schedules to help parents.
Why is it this hard to get children to eat simple foods? My father-in-law shared an early childhood memory with us. One day, he refused his idli breakfast and wanted something else. No one berated or reproached him, they just removed his plate from the table and he was free to go. He still remembers the hunger pangs and by the time the noon meal came along, he was ready to eat anything that was served to him! He says he never complained about food thereafter. I sometimes think that a little hunger is good for children. It won’t hurt them. The privileged kids, especially those who live in an urban environment, are plied with an endless supply of food and probably have never felt a hunger pang.
Often love for one’s young is equated with feeding them. Many people hinted that I was a heartless mother just because my children ate a breakfast of either ragi porridge, idli or a nendhram porridge from the age of one till they were almost three. Meal times were kept simple. Lunch consisted of simple poriyal, keerai , paruppu and curd which continues to this day. It is a diet my husband and I were brought up on. And I believe that is why my kids eat vazhaithandu, bitter gourd or sundakkai without a fuss. 
My kids do love their sushi rolls and thin crust pizzas but it’s very clear that those are treats and will always remain so. It’s heartening to see my older teen refuse a heavy meal out because she has already made plans to dine out with friends the following day. Balance is of utmost importance and it can only be achieved by following a daily diet of the kind of food you are born into. It’s claimed that the Indian DNA not only recognises local cuisine but also helps improve the body’s metabolic rate of digestion, absorption and assimilation.
My mom always quoted her elders saying that when children are given high calorific or rich foods, it will lead to mandham (a slump in the digestive organs) and I’ve witnessed that so many times when parents complain about children being listless and not feeling hungry. When children are active and eat the right foods the body demands food by ‘feeling hungry’. So feed that hunger with the right food. You might face some resistance initially to junk being replaced by real food in the lunch boxes, but trust me, your child will thank you in the years to come.
Did you know?
Tempering ingredients like mustard seeds, urad dhal and curry leaves are vital because they add small daily doses of protein, iron and fibre to the diet
Semi polished or un polished rice grains are highly nutritious and make flavoured rice dishes
Dals, lemon, pulses are easy to cook and replenish vital nutrients
Curd and buttermilk are essential pro-biotics which promote gut bacteria
Sauces and condiments are high in preservatives, refined sugar and salt and are best avoided during the week
Childhood obesity is best tackled by offering fresh, seasonal and simple and tasty meals

Burning calories with the pooch
"," 
Walking a dog can be fine exercise. But many people do not have access to a dog, and many of those who do choose not to walk them.
Two small new studies, however, may offer novel ways to promote dog walking and its myriad benefits, even to people without dogs. But the results also indicate that there can be substantial barriers to using a pet to improve your health.
Anyone who owns a dog, which includes me, knows that most of them yearn to go on walks, whatever the time or weather. If I skip our usual morning jog, my dogs flop onto the floor, disconsolate and reproachful.
The walk would be good for all of us. According to recent studies, adults who often walk a dog are more likely than those who do not to meet the standard exercise recommendation of about 150 minutes a week of moderate physical activity. Well-exercised dogs also tend to be leaner and better behaved than sedentary canines.
But nearly 40% of dog owners almost never walk their dogs, other studies show.
Concerned by that statistic, Katie Becofsky, a professor of kinesiology at the University of Massachusetts in Amherst, U.S., and dog owner, began to wonder recently whether it might be possible and worthwhile to essentially trick people into walking their dogs more often.
So for one of the new studies, which was presented in June at the annual meeting of the American College of Sports Medicine in Minneapolis, U.S., she and her colleagues invited a group of about 30 local dog owners who reported rarely walking their dogs to join a special dog obedience class. 
The owners were told that the programme was designed to improve their dogs’ behaviour while leashed, but the surreptitious goal was to see if the classes could also increase the owners’ dog walking and physical activity after the instruction had ended.
To that end, half of the group began six weeks of instruction while others were wait-listed as a control group. The participants attended classes with their dogs several times a week, kept a log about extracurricular dog walks and wore an activity monitor, ostensibly to record those walks. The researchers asked them to continue to record any walks and wear the activity monitor occasionally for an additional six weeks after the classes ended.
The logs and monitors showed that people in the class did start to walk their dogs for a few minutes more each week than the control group, both during and after the six weeks of classes. Surprisingly, though, those minutes did not increase the owners’ overall weekly exercise totals. 
Dr. Becofsky might have been disappointed with the results, she says, but suspects that one factor was that the programme collided with a particularly intractable East Coast obstacle: the weather. The study took place during a prolonged period of rain and cold in the area, she says, so the increase in participants’ dog-walking time, while small, was notable.
More important, she says, most of the class participants reported feeling closer to their dogs and happier with their behaviour afterward.
“We know from other research that the best predictor of dog walking is feeling a strong bond with your dog,” she says.
She plans to conduct a larger study, she says, again featuring obedience classes but this time being open about the programme’s intent to increase owners’ physical activity. She’s also planning separately to study dogs’ self-chosen movement patterns, on a leash and off, using activity monitors made for dogs. 
Much potential
 “Dog walking has so much potential to inspire more physical activity,” she says. 
That possibility extends even to people who do not own dogs, according to the other new study, which looked at dogs and pedestrianism. Also presented at the American College of Sports Medicine’s annual meeting, it involved college students, a group notorious for their inactivity. Many collegians exercise seldom, if ever, studies show, often blaming time constraints and academic demands. 
To bypass those barriers, researchers at East Carolina University in Greenville, N.C., U.S., created a for-credit physical education class centered on dog walking. Students who enrolled in the class visited the local animal shelter twice a week for 50 minutes and walked one of the shelter dogs in a nearby park while wearing a pedometer.
The gadgets’ data showed that the students were averaging around 4,500 steps, or about two and a quarter miles of walking, during each session with a dog.
“Most of them were surprised that they were walking so much,” says Melanie Sartore-Baldwin, a professor at E.C.U. who led the study.
“They said that the time had gone quickly and they hadn’t really felt as if they were exercising,” she says. Many also reported side benefits. “They told us that the dogs had seemed so happy about the walks, which had made them feel better about themselves and the whole experience,” Dr. Sartore-Baldwin says.
There were complaints, of course, she adds. The class began at 9 a.m., which the students considered punishingly early, and were required to continue whatever the weather. But few students skipped any sessions, and the class currently has an enrolment waiting list, she says. She also is working with other universities that are looking to incorporate dog walking into their P.E. programmes.
“There’s something very appealing about spending time with a dog who is so delighted to see you,” she says, “and getting in an easy 4,500 steps before 10 a.m.” NY TIMES

Sunday specials at Sayahna Garden Restaurant "," 
Breakfast at an ‘evening restaurant’ might sound like an irony. But that’s exactly the delicious difference Sayahna Garden Restaurant brings with its stand-alone Sunday Breakfast, which boasts of a compact but inviting, chiefly ethnic Kerala fare. As you walk in after negotiating a particularly snarled-up mid-morning traffic despite it being a Sunday, the place suddenly offers you a semblance of serenity as a touch of the traditional comes garnished with a reposeful ambience.
Ensconced at a lush corner of Kerala Tourism Development Corporation’s sprawling Mascot Hotel in the heart of the city, Sayahna Garden Restaurant’s highlight is, as the name evinces, the green-hugged open-air dining space by the side. The stripped-down furniture adds to the sun-kissed garden’s visual charm by silently foregrounding the emerald vista.




However, opting comfort over aesthetics, we amble towards the AC dining area with artsy, oil-smooth wallpapers and we are welcomed by a courteous usher. The dinky list on the single-page menu proves particularly helpful in whittling down your choices for an economical breakfast. Apart from the few odd-ones-out like the good old bread-butter-jam combo or the improvised beef/chicken omelette or muffin, the rest of the list unequivocally sounds chaste naadan with the likes of kadala curry, beef roast, Kumarakom chicken curry, pidiyum kozhiyum, ari pathiri, chiratta puttu, mutta kuzhalappam... to name a lip-smacking few. The bonus is ‘the week’s special’, not on the list and something that can range from a variety of South India’s evergreen favourite, dosa, to a dose of the quintessentially Maharashtrian pav bhaji masala. The special on a chosen day is announced on the black board outside, and, today, poori bhaji masala it is. Nevertheless, the best part of the entire deal is the ‘small’ and ‘large’ portions available for the dishes on offer, especially curry. A great boon in trying out more while reigning in the final bill.




After a genial dialogue for order-taking and a brief wait, the dishes are borne in one by one. First up is ari pathiri, accompanied by a ‘small’ portion of beef roast and mutton stew. Soft and almost wafer-thin, the snow-white pathiri melts in the mouth, aided by a thick and creamy mutton stew with moderate dollops of potato and carrot. The well-cooked meat pieces seem to be in competition with the rice pancake for which is tenderer. However, the light-brown homely beef roast, unexpectedly with quite a bit of onion-infused gravy and fine green chilly chops, proves a spicy foil to the succulent but mild-tasting stew.




The chef’s recommendation of the day — the Kottayam-style pidiyum kozhiyum — comes calling next. Not a dish you would easily find in the city every day, this scalding gravy-rich delicacy lives up to its reputation with globs of pidi (rice balls equivalent to kozhakkatta) dunked in coconut milk-rich Kumarakom-style chicken curry topped with creamy residual sauce from the pidi. Wheat porotta, often cherry-picked as a healthier alternative to its otherwise unbeatable maida cousin for the Malayali, may be the only item tasted and tested that scored a low, only for its moderately high oil content. Nonetheless, it’s not a deal-breaker.
If the chef insists on trying out the day’s special, you can’t outright say nay, especially if your taste-buds have not demurred yet. Hence arrives the poori bhaji masala set, with three impeccably inflated pooris and a generous bowl of yellow, mellow mashed potato curry. Something simple to write home about. Enough is not enough and you can’t help but want to polish off the remainder of the stew and roast gravy when you scrutinise the menu again and see the spirit-lifting word ‘kallappam’. But blame it on transliteration as a double check with the waiter after the order clarifies any misgivings. Kallu-appam. One should have read ‘stone’ and not ‘toddy’. However, no blame on the chef as the flat dosa-like appam passes muster.




Shyam Lal, the chief chef, says Sunday Breakfast serves as a perfect choice mainly for church-goers on a Sunday morning. “Also, the idea of small and large portions for some of the dishes helps reduce wastage and spices up choices for the customer,” he adds.
Sunday Breakfast may not be the once-in-a-month, spoilt-for-choice meal plan you wouldn’t mind splurging on but it is certainly a toothsome idea for a no-frills but hearty kick-starter with minimal garnishing and maximum satisfaction that saves you the hassle of cooking on a day you would prefer to take it easy.
Cost for two can be as low as ₹200

Comfort food for meat lovers "," Rarely does one come across a place that constantly garners praise. But Food Beez on Bypass Road is grabbing much attention. Some positive reviews on the social media drove me to this small place with an unpretentious vibe. 
I happened to walk in as the first customer of the day on a weekend and the young boy serving at the table was happy to explain the restaurant’s USP. He pulled out a special grilled chicken menu and suggested the different flavors of hot garlic, pepper, glazed butter and butter chicken masala. “Our restaurant serves the common grilled chicken with robust flavours,” he assured.
I ended up ordering that one dish most customers swear by — the signature mutton biryani. It tasted different with subtle flavours and spices unlike what is usually available elsewhere in the city. Here only cardamom, cinnamon and cloves go into the making of the home-style biryani. The portion was adequate and taste of melt-in-the-mouth mutton pieces lingered on. What also set it apart is that the dish was cooked in chekku ennai (cold-pressed oil) instead of refined oil or ghee. In fact, the oil is used for all preparations at Food Beez.
“The idea is to help people distinguish every flavour and also feel light after a meal,” sais M Muthukumar, one of the three partners who set up this 28-seater inside a closed TASMAC shop. “Our first challenge was to make the place brighter, family-friendly, and appealing.”

Next, the core values were set — of not using artificial colours and seasonings, frozen meat, and the maida in the kitchen. 
Gradually as more people walked in, I noticed how fast the service was. I was now tempted to try the butter glazed grilled chicken with wheat naan. It was delicious. 
The well thought out menu had make-to-order gravies, chef’s sea food specials like the prawn thokku, egg manchurian and poriyal, masala omelette, and karandi egg Chettinadu and more, though the eatery’s forte is mutton preparations.
Muthukumar said he and his two friends — Gopalakrishnan and Benito — as engineering students in Madurai often travelled in and around the city and nearby districts to try various dishes. And it was their dream to set up a restaurant selling their own tried-and-tested and improvised healthy recipes. While his friends continue to be in IT jobs, Muthukumar gave up his to focus on the restaurant. “They keep sending their inputs and suggestions.”
Feedback from customers has been encouraging too. The main course was as good as the starters and desserts and each item is competitively priced between ₹20 (for the drinks/omelettes) to ₹180 for the mutton biryani. There were some surprises too like the seasonal Mughal biryani and the Kolkata white chicken, available only on weekends.

‘Lost cuisines of India’ at the Marriott Hyderabad: Dig into some history
"," Have you ever wondered what else you could be having on your plate? Perhaps something the masses know very little about? Well, enter ‘Lost Cuisines of India’, a culinary heritage project which is the result of a collaboration between executive chef Aungshuman Chakraborty of Marriott’s Bidri and the chefs from other Marriott properties in Jaipur and Kolkata.
Meat-lovers will find themselves indulging big time. Come with an empty, and I mean empty, stomach and pace yourselves as one would do in any history lesson.
Memorable appetisers include a succulent murgh zamin doz, a favourite dish of Mughal emperor Akbar. The dish comprises chicken tenderised in yoghurt, cardamom, saffron and almonds and wrapped in a rumali roti. The meat temptingly slides off the bone here and works great with a mustard seed dip.
The pretty appetiser, as I like to call it, is the Bengali fish kabiraji; it’s helmed pretty for its delicate lacy egg net surrounding the fish fillet.
According to the chef, the parindey main parinda is a dish worth the trip over; an egg stuffed into a quail stuffed into a chicken. The assembled mix is placed under a rumali roti in an earthen pot which is cooked in the sand. While this may sound — pardon the pun — filling, it’s a great sharer dish to go with the moti biryani made with chicken and egg whites. 




The railway mutton curry is a classically lip-smacking go-to while the Lady Curzon seafood curry is a light yet satisfying amalgam of all the good things under the sea: prawns, calamari and more. Lady Curzon, for the history novices out there, was the wife of the Viceroy of India, Lord Curzon of Kedleston. 
“We chose to do some dishes encompassed within the British era for their landmark effects on original Indian cuisine and to show how the culinary timeline is stretched out,” points out chef Aunghsuman. “Plus our staff and servers are well-versed in the history behind each dish so do not hesitate to ask for back stories.”
Chef Aunghsuman didn’t forget about the vegetarians; the surprising mewa shahi kebab is a great palate cleanser while the jackfruit pulao is a delightfully flavourful addition to the city’s never-ending rice repertoire.
The curries can be enjoyed with the extensive breads on offer but a stand-out item is the maah choleya de thode, hand-flattened and made with crushed dal makhani. On its own, it was a food for farmers. 
One may have a tough time choosing a dessert; each one has a fascinatingly detailed backstory. Biasedly though, a must-try is the kabhishambardhana sandesh, a Bengali dessert first made in Jorasanko by Rabindranath Tagore’s niece for the writer’s 50th birthday. 
Yes, there are probably hundreds, if not thousands, of dishes lost in time we are yet to revisit, but what’s on the menu at Bidri is definitely an invitation to not only dine but to keep discovering. About 25 dishes will be taking over Bidri’s menu for the duration of the festival, but iconic favourites like their in-house biryanis will continue to be on offer. 
‘Lost Cuisines of India’ starts today at Bidri at Marriott Hotel, Tank Bund Road, and will run up till August 5, for dinner only.

Sunshine on a plate
"," The last time we climbed the staircase inside Grandmama’s Café in Juhu, we found good Goan meat at the end. The now shuttered Porto & Poie, with its azulejo tiles and black and white photographs, won us over with its simple, comforting Goan food and innovative cocktails. Today, climbing the staircase leads us to another Goan place, this time helmed by a couple — Lloyd and Nerissa Braganza — who are as passionate about cooking Goan food as we are about eating it.
Branching out
The interiors haven’t changed much, with the exception of a few embellishments. The photographs on the wall are from Lloyd’s family. There are still plates on the ceiling and the upholstery is the same but the walls are covered in artwork showcasing life in Goa, the colourful caricatures reminding us of the great Mario Miranda and his take on local life. House of Lloyd started off in the Braganzas’ garden in Candolim, where it soon became known for its grilled food. 
Now, this House has made its way to Mumbai where it hopes to introduce the city to authentic Goan food. “No, we don’t serve vegetarian sorpotel here though we have been asked,” says Nerissa, with a smile. There’s no fish vindaloo either. 
Instead, the menu is replete with Goan Catholic food, some of which has been inspired by the Portuguese. There are beef croquettes (packed with meat and crumb fried), rissois, tongue roast and a fiery pork vindaloo, and kismoor. One bite of the gravy soaked Anant Gadho’s Ros Omelette (₹400) and it felt like we were standing outside a stall at the Margao bus stand, chomping down on that filling midnight treat. The omelette – fluffy and stacked with onions and green chillies — was sandwiched between two halves of a chicken gravy soaked poee making for a messy starter. The Agassaim Sausage Chilli Fry (₹400) won us over with its spicy aroma; the sausage cooked with heaps of onions and potatoes to be mopped up with even more poee.
Spiced just right
There was poee (₹60) with everything and we weren’t complaining, starved as we are for a taste of that versatile, pita-like bread. We used it to mop up the Mutton Xacuti (₹550) starring tender pieces of meat engulfed in dry roasted spices and heavy on the coconut, and the Goan Fish Curry (₹500), which had filets of bhetki swimming in a bright orange curry redolent with kokum and tirphal. We aren’t too fond of a fish curry that has boneless fish but luckily, there was other food to distract us from this oversight. Kokum (or sola as the Goans call it) also made its way into a tangy cocktail, Amsol Twist (₹600) and the lightly seasoned Sungta Solache (₹700), prawns cooked in light stew-like gravy. 
As the meal progressed, so did the spice quotient. Our favourite was Nerissa’s Prawns Balchao (₹650), that vinegar and masala-laden prawn pickle. Meant to be eaten as a side dish or a pickle, Nerissa and Lloyd spoke about people often confusing it for a gravy dish. “They expect fresh prawns and this tangy curry but that’s not a proper balchao. We salt and dry our prawns before making the balchao so that they last longer,” says Lloyd. 
Family production
All the masalas used at House of Lloyd are made in-house, using ingredients sourced from Goa. The sorpotel on the menu comes from their home kitchen — his mother Celia cooks it and that’s why the dish is named after her. Poees come in every week, which means it gets a bit dry by the time it reaches the table. In their bid to stay true to Goan food, the couple hasn’t strayed too much on the fusion route. They do have a few experimental vegetarian dishes, which take inspiration from Hindu Goan cuisine. Our pick is the Kelfool Melgor (₹450), a dry dish was a flavourful and crunchy mixture of banana blossom cooked with gherkins, black gram and a dash of coconut.
Dessert here, are Nerissa’s domain. The star was Tender Coconut Souffle (₹350), a dessert made with condensed milk, gelatin, sugar, coconut water and chunks of tender coconut. It’s a soft, creamy but light. The sawdust pudding, Serradurra (₹350), was equally delicious, made with real biscuit crumbs and whipped cream. Her famous Bread Pudding (₹350) reminded us of a Christmas cake — studded as it was with rum and Cointreau soaked dried fruits. The specialty of the restaurant may be the grilled food (which is only available in the evening) but we will return for the desserts.
House of Lloyd, like its predecessor, is expensive. But, the food is good and the D’Souzas are extremely passionate about showcasing real Goan food.

What kills wine
","I am not here to demystify wine. I think it would be disservice to this fine beverage to even attempt it; allow me to explain.
There is something about the word ‘commercial’ that connoisseurs (not just of wine) abhor and corporates love. So strong is this term when used as an adjective, that the same bottle of wine with sediments can be considered indifferently ‘faulty’ in one case and beautifully ‘rustic’ in the other, all depending on whether the product is considered supermarket-scale commercial or boutique and artesian.
This leads us to further explore the question, just what exactly defines a wine as commercial? If success is a measure of commercial viability, then the most expensive Champagnes and Bordeaux clarets are commercial yet they don’t seem to lose consumers (not yet anyway). If the world commercial implies wines that are cheap then that is something rather subjective and one man’s prize will always be someone’s plonk.
In my knowledge, a commercial wine can be considered to be one which is made using grapes that are internationally famous, and in a manner that implies cognizance of taste, i.e. the person who drinks it should be able to identify the grape or style, even if s/he can’t tell much else about it. Such wines are safe fence-sitters, never too edgy or punchy, just safe mama’s good boys, delivering exactly what they promise and not a whiff more.
A lot of winemakers in a lot of countries indulge in this habit: to make ‘commercial’ wines. It almost becomes a problem that threatens the existence of other autochthonous grapes when a vintner decides to uproot a local variety and plant instead a Cabernet or Chardonnay patch.
This may sound like bowing to the ‘system’, but here’s why a winemaker may have to consider going the commercial way.
Say a winemaker makes some superb Nero d’Avola on the sun-kissed slopes of Sicily. He is known in all the nearby villages and there’s seldom a tourist who leaves without buying a bottle or two. Outside of that, the market is non-existent. Lack of knowledge about the region and the grape make international markets difficult to harness. And being a small winemaker, he can’t afford to start a campaign to educate the world about the wines of the region. If he continues like this, soon he shall have to sell and move out and people will only be able to talk about the legendary reds of the regions which alas wouldn’t exist anymore.
Then he hits upon an idea – a small patch of Merlot. The world knows the grapes and it is a fairly hardy type. If he can make a good Nero d’Avola, he can surely make a decent Merlot, one that would be easier to sell internationally. It could also possibly draw attention and consequently a demand, for his other wines. And soon enough he releases not just a Merlot but also a Sauvignon Blanc. These wines are more saleable and find quick acceptance in certain international markets.
In some places, his other wines, including the prized albeit unknown Nero d’Avola, also become popular slowly but in other markets, the demand for the ‘commercial’ styles continues to rise. Soon, the winemaker finds himself uprooting more traditional grape plantings to incorporate the popular varieties. This is how we end up endangering certain wine styles and this is why ‘people in the know’ consider commercialisation of wine a bad thing on the whole.
Let’s face it, when this happens in another artisan fields, like say textiles and tailoring, or cricket, people are quick to respond, vehemently voicing opinions et al. But with wines, it is this general slackness on the part of the people to not make an effort to learn, a numbing complacency to have everything broken down to the simplest possible forms that compels hapless winemakers to cater to dumbed down tastes.
Demystification is for join-the-dot sketches; to understand Picasso or Monet, some background study is necessary. Without curiosities and complexities, life would be but disguised ennui. And so it is with wines: one can tell you things about it but they need to be read, analysed, and memorised, before one can understand this beverage. Here then is the first lesson: there is no best wine, there never will be. The best part about wines is that each sip, no matter how undecipherable, leaves you more prepared and learned for the next.

How World Yoga Day will make us a better nation
"," First it was basmati, then it was yoga. Foreigners are constantly stealing from us. World Yoga Day is our way of reclaiming our heritage, and in schools across the nation, it’s compulsory. It’s also very entertaining. On this day, every year, our TV screens are filled with images of Nitin Gadkari, Amit Shah and Arun Jaitley, trying to do the padmasana. This is a move in the right direction. If anyone needs to do some yoga, it’s them. They promised us a Government of heavyweights, and there is no doubt that they have delivered. Kilo for kilo, this has to be the single heaviest cabinet that India has ever had. Not that the others were pixies, but this group is clearly in a higher weight class. Whenever a minister goes missing for a few days, I worry that his colleagues may have eaten him. It’s always a relief when he reappears. 
When they go to dine with Dalits, specially reinforced tables are brought in to bear the load of the buffet. Each and every one of them has, at some point, been photographed with a plate of puris. It’s an ongoing process. They’re expanding in front of our eyes. Personally, I blame the ghee. Ghee is rich. Ghee is wholesome. Ghee is a blessing. Ghee clarifies and purifies the soul. Our legendary wrestlers drank it like Coca Cola. But they also juggled enormous implements for several hours every day. In the absence of such activity, nothing adds substance to a man like ghee. This is what has happened to our cabinet.
Doing a bit of yoga, even if it requires assistants, is the least that they can do. It also reflects very positively on the fundamental integrity of The Hindu, which started this health feature when the cabinet was at the height of its power. At a time when the entire socio-political milieu was pointing towards ghee, and the air was filled with cries of ‘Have one more aloo paratha!’, this paper launched a supplement that promotes healthy eating and exercise. Despite all the evidence of a direct correlation between deep-fried food and material success, proved beyond doubt by our leaders, and the rapid outburst of paneer, they have refused to compromise on their principles. Inspired by their example, we should support World Yoga Day. We must encourage our elected representatives to spend this day fanning out across the country and demonstrating asanas to their subjects. If they continue to do so, sincerely and well, then one day, quite soon, we will have lighter, nimbler ministers, quickly leaping to our service whenever we need them. 
The writer’s most recent novel, Murder With Bengali Characteristics, contains no paneer.

For a Lebanese Ramadan "," The Saidon (south Lebanon) based Chef Ahmed Ammouri, is back in Bengaluru, a city where he has quite a fan following from his stint at the Taj West End. He will be heading the month-long Lebanese food festival that is being held at Shangri La.
He has worked with royalty and dignitaries such as Najib Mikati (The Prime Minister of Lebanon), the King of Morocco, Sultan of Muscat and Prince of Saudi Arabia. At Bengaluru, Chef Ammouri presents a buffet of traditional Lebanese delicacies.
The festival’s special menu will feature a variety of 15 salads or cold mezze and freshly grilled meats. Quintessential signatures including dips and salads like fattoush (levantine bread salad made with toasted Arabic flat bread), mutabbal (a grilled eggplant and tahini dip), and the famous chickpea hummus start the guests off. Dishes like bazella (a hearty, spiced stew), shawarma, mulukhiyah chicken (leafy green stew), Lebanese lamb chops, moussaka (an eggplant and/or potato based dish with minced meat), and batate harra (spiced potatoes) make up the main course. Speciality desserts like Basboosa (semolina cake soaked in syrup) and baklava (layered filo pastry stuffed with nuts and coated with syrup) complete the meal. Bringing a close on the age-old battle of the origin of baklava, chef Ammouri says “It is originally from Lebanon, but everyone makes his own version of baklava”.




Being one of the first Lebanese chefs to move to India, the chef introduced his customers to dishes beyond hummus and shawarma. He presented new flavours through dishes such as tabbouleh (green salad with parsley and tomatoes), and baba ghanoush (an eggplant dip), and his all-time favourite muhammara (a roasted red pepper and walnut spread), widening the scope for Lebanese cuisine in India. 
“Now Lebanese food culture has grown and everyone knows about it, but there are few occasions where I have to add spices to cater to the Indian palette,” he adds. 
The difference, he explains, is that even though both cuisines use a variety of spices, Indian food has more spice. He enjoys experimenting with new spices and dishes as a way of expanding his skill set and menu. He says “people know more about different cuisines and are more adventurous with food now. I have lived in India for eight years and Lebanese food has become popular over time.”
According to the chef, Lebanese food is light and healthy and is cooked with lots of olive oil, nuts, and spices including anise, sumac, cinnamon, cardamom, sweet spice and seven spice (the Lebanese version of garam masala). Unlike in the Gulf where rice is a staple, the Lebanese prefer bread. Baking and grilling are the central cooking methods, few dishes involve frying. “Lamb and beef are the main meats, and we consume a lot of these red meats,” says the chef. “The meats are not the same and at times you don’t get the exact ingredients like tahini here, so it becomes a challenge for me to bring out the exact flavours.” 




By combining local produce with imported spices he aims at presenting the most authentic Lebanese flavours. “When I was 16 or 17 and studying, I lived alone and had to cook for myself. I learned a little from my mom and that is when I started to enjoy cooking,” says the award-winning chef. Keeping in tune with his birth and heritage the chef choose to specialise in Lebanese food and trained professionally in Cyprus.
In the beginning of his career, he cooked in Cyprus for the Syrian embassy, where he worked as a chef for the ambassador for 12 years. Then he moved to India, where he worked at Taj Mahal Mumbai in 2001 after which he was relocated to the Taj West End Bangalore in 2005.
After spending eight years in India he moved back to his home country and started Bayte Baytak, a restaurant that served local cuisine. Following the closure of his restaurant, the chef visited Chennai in 2015 for The Raintree Food Festival that went on for 17 days. This is his latest visit since the food festival in Chennai. After completing his visit to Bengaluru, he heads back to Lebanon to prepare for his next promotion in Istanbul and for the opening of his new restaurant named Dar–Almer or King’s House.

Defying laws of gravity, 'dondurma' makes its way into Chennai
","When I reach for my ice-cream, it wiggles away like a worm. It sits on the end of a tall ladle held by our server, 25-year old Akash Kashyap, who teasingly flips the cone over and over with a nimble hand. The ice-cream, however, taunts gravity. All we wanted was some Turkish ice-cream. But when the server is Kashyap, you also get dinner and a show.
Turkish ice-cream or dondurma has made its way to Chennai — the second city to serve it after Delhi-NCR — at the newly-opened restaurant BnB Live Grill at OMR Food Street in Navallur and with it, have come the two men partly responsible for bringing it to India: Kashyap and Sonu Kumar.
An ice-cream that doesn’t easily drip or melt; that’s milky thick and chewy instead of soft. The nature of Turkish ice-cream is such that it lends itself to various tricks; ones that the ice-cream vendors of Turkey have perfected over the years. It is this art of ‘trolling’ customers that mesmerised Kashyap and Kumar when they first made their journey to the city of Ankara in Turkey four years ago. “It felt like magic... The vendors had such great sleight of hand, just getting ice-cream was one form of entertainment,” recalls Kashyap. What was supposed to be a short trip turned into a two-year stay, where the duo learned the tricks of ice-cream making and selling from Shahin Uftur. They then convinced him to open shop in Delhi.
The stretchy texture of the ice-cream comes from salep, explains Kashyap. “It is a paste made from orchid flowers,” he says. Both salep and mastic, the aromatic resin that gives it a distinctive flavour are imported from Turkey. The end product is so firm, you could take scoop out an entire bowlful on a ladle — a trick often used to surprise new customers — without any of it falling down; you often need a knife to slice through it.




Kashyap is in his element while serving; dressed in traditional red jacket and a fez. He slyly hands the customer a double cone, and ladles ice-cream on it. Once filled, he slips it out of her hand, leaving her holding just the empty outer cone. He then ups the performance, balancing the ice-cream on four different cones — so quick, the customer doesn’t know where to look. At times, he even puts a cone inside a customer’s pocket.
Sound is another integral part of the ice-cream serving: Kashyap rolls the ladle as if churning butter, hitting against the container to produce quick percussive beats. Hanging on top of the ice-cream containers is a bunch of bells tied together that Kashyap rings as he twirls the ice-cream ladle around. Every so often, he flips the ice-cream over and shrieks, pranking customers into thinking he has dropped it.




Doesn’t the audience ever get tired of his tricks? “We actually do have customers who straight out say ‘No’, when we start performing,” says Kashyap. “So you have to gauge each customer’s temperament before you start pranking them. Sometimes, there are children, even adults, who get scared or put off by our shrieking.” However, the vast majority seems to enjoy it, and that’s what drives the duo. “It is about playing with the customer, there’s a certain masti involved,” says a twinkle-eyed Kashyap. Kumar agrees, “We don’t just serve ice-cream, we serve laughter.”

Scandi Sense diet: a handful of health
"," Danish-born Suzy Wengel’s diet has been hailed as the ‘simplest diet in the world’, for a reason. It takes the stress away from measuring portion sizes and carefully calibrating macronutrients, by employing the ‘handful method’, to plan out your three main meals.
She calls each of these meals, a meal box. A single meal box ideally consists of 4 handfuls of food — 1 of protein, 1 of starch/fruit, 2 of vegetables — with 1-3 tablespoons of fat and a bit of dairy. “Your portion size is controlled by your hand,” says Wengel over a Skype call. This automatically means that someone who has a smaller hand (and needs less calories) eats less than a larger person.




It takes a little time to figure out, she admits: “You have to keep full for 5-6 hours,” but once you do, it becomes a great tool to control portions wherever you are and whatever you eat. If you’re eating a burger, for instance, you can swap the French fries for a salad, reduce the bread to create a perfect meal box. Vegetarians or vegans can eat beans, soy and pulses instead of that handful of meat. If you’d like a glass of wine occasionally, simply drop the handful of starch from your meal box and eat just the protein and vegetable component. And if only ice cream will do, “you can simply fill your meal box with that, and go back to the handful system the next time you eat,” says Wengel.
A Scandi Sense success story
Suzy Wengel walks the talks: she herself lost around 40 kilos in 10 months, following a calorie-controlled, structured eating plan. “After 17 years of yo-yo dieting, I was sick and tired of my situation,” says Wengel, who weighed nearly 100 kilos when she started, soon after the birth of her second child. “I knew I had to do something good for myself. I had children and had to raise them right.”




She had tried every fad diet in the world and knew, “I couldn’t go back to one of those because they don’t work in the long run.” Instead, she decided to do it the old-fashioned way, researching intensely to find a lifestyle that would work for her. 
“Research says that only 5% of people who lose weight keep it off. What they do is very boring; they change their habits and keep that going.” The only way to do that sustainably was, “to adapt everything to the life they are living,” adds Wengel, who did exactly that to lose her weight.
The diet she adapted to lose weight back then evolved into the Scandi Sense Diet. “I realised there was a pattern in my meals. So I took my hand and placed it over my plate and realised that it contained one handful of starch, two of vegetables, one of protein and 1-3 tablespoons of fat. Also, sometimes I have dairy and sometimes I don’t,” she says.
Box it up
A visit to Ikea added another dimension to this way of eating, “They have these boxes and I saw those and told myself, ‘this is my meal box’,” says Wengel, who went on to do a course in nutrition to deepen her understanding of the subject. “I wanted to help other people, which is why I educated myself,” she says, adding that there are now around 65 nutritionists in Denmark using the Scandi Sense Diet with their clients.She went on to write a book — the latest edition of which was released in October last year — and uses social media extensively to drive home her message. “It is a relatively new idea and my big job is trying to communicate it around the world,” she says, pointing out that the meal-box concept is a great mental tool for people with overeating issues.




“A mechanical structured way of eating, over time, allows your body to intuitively know when it is hungry and when it is full. That is what happened to me.”
The nicest thing about the diet is its versatility. You can follow the principles whether you are on IF (intermittent fasting), vegetarian, LCHF (low carb, high fat); you can eat out with your friends on it; you can follow it on a holiday or during the festive season; eat food from all around the world on it.
“It is a multi-system plan,” agrees Wengel. “You just need to get your handfuls right. Weight loss is only induced by a deficit of calories and this tool will help you with that.”

A twist to Indian desserts
"," 
 We are known for our sweet tooth. And more often than naught, it’s dessert that we pile up high on our plates after our meals, right from melt-in-the-mouth bolis to juicy gulab jamuns or creamy ice creams and fudgy brownies. But, just as the world of fashion sees new trends popping up each year, the culinary world too is constantly evolving, as customers seek to expand their tastebuds. While we have witnessed the union of pizzas and dosas, French fries and masala fries, and kathi rolls and frankies, chefs are now experimenting and transforming traditional desi sweetmeats into gourmet desserts by fusing them with Western recipes.
And if you think the spin-offs served are as limited and as unimaginative as gulab jamuns or gajar ka halwa with ice cream, think again; specialist chefs are now pushing the envelope with their sweet concoctions. So there’s the hot favourite gulab jamun cake, the sponge cake soaked in sugary rose petals and cardamom infused syrup and layered with sliced jamuns; the malpua cheesecake, which fuses star anise flavoured cottage cheese with creamy, luscious cheesecake or, that rasmalai filling hidden in rabri icing and more.




 “Since Indians are fond of everything sweet, and almost everyone has a dessert after a meal, pastry chefs are having a field day experimenting with textures and flavours, trying to one-up each other to serve unique desserts,” says Pastry Chef B. Sunil Kumar of Vivanta by Taj, Vazhuthecaud.
Chef Sunil enjoys playing with ingredients. So he has dipped berry-sized gulab jamuns, not in its conventional rose flavoured sugar syrup, but, in thick, rich chocolate and has stuffed profiteroles, not with the standard cream, or custard, but with rasmalai and mango rabri to name a few. 
While his experimentations with desserts feature mostly during “international food fetes,” or “when a guest requests for a chef’s special,” the dessert counter at The Leela Raviz Kovalam, always features a handful of fusion sweets during their weekend buffets.
Sandeep Sukesan, pastry chef at The Leela, says borrowing Western influences is a great way to introduce our desi sweets to foreigners. He says: “While most diners are open to fusion cuisine, when it comes to desserts, most of them stick to things they know. By serving hybrid desserts such as dry fruit stuffed ravioli with saffron rabri and carrot halwa strudel, you are serving guests something familiar, yet different, to cater to their urge to try something new. These sweet treats are a gateway for people from around the world to savour our delectable range of mithais,” says the chef who has also infused local flavours to foreign desserts such as ilaneer payasam mousse with manganosa and aval vilayichathu in baklava.




But the trend of creating fusion desserts is not limited to star hotels. Home bakers are giving traditional sweets massive makeovers too.
Jasmine Sanumon, a homebaker who has roots in the city and runs Jasmine’s Cake Boutique in Mumbai, says the trend for fusion desserts has been going strong for the last two to three years in Mumbai. “In fact, there are courses and workshops offered in Indo-Western dessert making, here.”
Mithais, she points out, play an important role in any festive occasion in North India. “But as tastebuds go cosmopolitan, the more exposed people are to other cultures, the more variety they seek.”
 Hence, spin-offs of popular Indian sweets such as the rasgula cake and eggless ghulkand cakes, which she feels, began in Mumbai, “the culinary hub of India before it started trickling elsewhere.”
Like a scientist in a laboratory, Jasmine concocts recipes for her “desi sweets with a twist” in her head and tries them out through trial and error. Today her Jasmine’s Cake Boutique, which she operates from her Mumbai home, boasts of gulkhand truffles, rose and betal leaf chocolates, rasmalai cake with rabadi, Indian mithai cake with thandai frosting, gulab jamun mix cookies… besides the regular pastry and baked goodies.




In the city, the trend is however, rather recent and the varieties, limited, with just a handful of homebakers like Anjana John, Nasiya Aysha and Parvathy Ravikumar serving unusual combinations of fluffy cakes and traditional mithais.
Anjana, who specialises in gulab jamun cupcakes, points out how conventional Indian mithais from up North and East are not that popular amongst Malayalis as “we have our own traditional sweet dishes like boli, palada payasam and unniappam, which caters to our tastebuds.” 
So, isn’t introducing such desserts a bit of a gamble?




Parvathy who serves decadent kulfi cakes admits she was hesitant to add the cake to her menu, but is all smiles as customers line up for the kulfi flavour of the season – mango. “There is a plethora of homebakers who serve the usual cakes and bakes out there and so one needs to keep innovating and introducing novelty fares to keep the customers coming. As of now, it’s mostly star hotels in the city that serve fusion desserts, so home bakers like myself, have an edge in the bake field.”
Nasiya points out how customers are gradually open to experimenting with flavours. “Also desserts these days, are all about visual appeal, flavour fusion and the oomph factor, all of which such contemporary desserts have.”
But unlike up North where mithais are easily available, the homebakers in the city have to make their own desi sweets from scratch. “It’s fun,” says Nasiya, who apart from the rasmalai cake and the recently introduced thandai cake, plans to add more hybrid goodies to her repertoire.




But fusion can lead to confusion, and the key in blending culinary worlds, lies, in teaming the right ingredients and in the balance of flavours, says Chef Sunil. “Else, you will have a bittersweet ending to your meal.”
So, borrowing a popular advertisement’s catchphrase, “Kuchh meetha ho jaye?”

Bowled over by bamboo
","I have come to the conclusion that the giant pandas are pretty smart. Just because they look cute and cuddly doesn’t mean that they are not sharp. They eat bamboo — shoots, stems and leaves — through the day, and almost nothing else. I had a very nice bamboo meal earlier this week, and now I know why the giant pandas go for bamboo.
It’s because bamboo tastes good. And especially so when it is served with soft pork belly, succulent chicken, flavoursome fish or spicy tenderloin. I ate all this — and some more — at The Claridges’ Chinese restaurant, Jade. I had been invited to try out the food being served at a bamboo festival, which is on till May 18. The dishes had been prepared by the hotel’s Chinese chef, Linlin Yang — and I was bowled over.
The bamboo had been cooked in all kinds of sauces and spices. For instance, our starter was a dish of stir-fried diced bamboo and chicken in spicy black bean sauce. The bamboo with diced tenderloin was flavoured with anise. And the double cooked pork belly was just allowed to simmer with bamboo shoots and Chinese cabbage.
Chef Linlin tells me that bamboo comes in various kinds in China, and is a veritable part of their cuisine. Even baby bamboo leaves are eaten for they are sweeter than the variety that you get in parts of India. In India, bamboo shoots are mostly eaten in the Northeast. I’ve had some excellent fermented bamboo as part of Assamese food. But I understand that it’s bit of an acquired taste — for the strong flavours of fermented bamboo don’t appeal to everybody. I, however, love it.
This meal presented bamboo with all kinds of flavours. I loved the lightly spiced bamboo pork belly as well as the bamboo and beef, and enjoyed the five-spice flavour that had been infused in a dish of fresh bamboo and ginger cooked with scallops. The scallops, soft and sweet, were perfectly cooked.
I also liked the river sole with vegetables and bamboo. The shoots had been cut in such a way that they looked like the sliced fish. I alternated between the mildly flavoured fish and the bamboo, adding some spicy veggies every now and then — and thought it was a nice mix of flavours.
I suppose at a festival like this, the taste is as important as the look. So the food was served in small bamboo containers and on crockery with pretty green images of bamboo trees. Some of the main dishes were steamed in the bamboo containers, too. And I was told Chef Linlin had designed the bamboo utensils especially for the festival.
There are a host of vegetable dishes with bamboo too — but I managed to avoid them all. But those who like their vegetables could try out the stir-fried young bamboo shoots with spring onion and dry chilli, or fresh tofu and fresh bamboo with pok choi and asparagus.
The prices are high, as befit a restaurant in a luxury hotel. But if you order carefully (rice, one appetizer and two entrees), a meal for two, with taxes, can come for less than Rs.4000. If your rich uncle is in town, you can, of course, have a feast. And if you are the rich uncle, there is nothing like it!
The bamboo food fest at Jade in The Claridges is on till May 18

Focus seafood
"," Most restaurateurs would baulk at opening a seafood eatery during Mumbai’s monsoon, but clearly Zorawar Kalra is not one of them. When asked about the launch of his fine dine — Rivers to Oceans (R2O) — during the rains, when fresh seafood is harder to come by, Kalra expresses confidence in a supply chain that delivers imported substitutes. And for those who are keen to sample vegetarian offerings, there are always mushrooms to fall back on. If you visit Kalra’s stable of restaurants, you’ll realise there are favourite ingredients that he keeps revisiting, whether it’s the Indian gucchi at Masala Library or the Italian truffle that can be found at Pa Pa Ya.
R2O has replaced the space formerly occupied by TGI Fridays at Palladium — and while the emphasis is on seafood, there are courses that showcase mushrooms in a way that not many eateries do. The restaurant features a cold dining room (Kalra attributes it to the produce being served at chilled temperatures even once plated), and what the promoters claim is the country’s first champagne and caviar bar. Sure, there’s a lot of marble used inside, and the interiors are done up by Masafumi Sanada who runs the Tokyo-based M-Style, Inc, but Kalra is clear he wants the focus to be on the food. For those looking for a quieter setting, R2O has three private dining rooms, each of which vary in size, with the largest accommodating up to 10 people. The rooms are arrayed around the edges of the eatery, while the bar is what is the showcase of the main dining room. Kalra proudly declares that the total space is equally split between the kitchen and the dining room, a rarity in a city where astronomical rents force restaurants to design cramped kitchens in favour of revenue earning seats. 

Tasting the menu
 When we visited, we sampled a salty spoonful of black lumpfish caviar, that accompanied our briny Gujarat oyster. “In a lot of the courses, we’ve let the ingredients do the talking, though obviously technique is there in a lot of them,” says Kalra about the tasting menu I’m working my way through. 
For those unfamiliar with the flavours of the sea, the oyster is served alongside a lemon, green apple mignonette and umame-rich soy, giving you a range of options to slurp away at.
Fish are the inspiration for a smattering of artworks that can be found on the walls, though we have a feeling that diners will be more interested in the display of fresh catch at the entrance which includes salmon from Norway, scampi from Andhra Pradesh, Alaskan cod and more. In an era when restaurants are increasingly touting the use of local ingredients, it will worthwhile to see whether Kalra's focus on globally-sourced seafood will draw diners. 
R2O’s kitchen has been helmed by chef Varun Kinger, who’s working under the group chef Saurabh Udinia. Kinger has been allowed to develop the menu, but Kalra emphasises that he wanted the kitchen team to show restraint, and allow the seafood to shine. Behind the scenes, the Josper grill (imported from Europe) is something that Kalra is quick to show off, and he plans to have a part of the menu dedicated to Japanese-style robata grilled mains. Plans include an extensive a la carte, a tasting menu (paired with either wine or champagne) and finally a raw sampler. There are plenty of vegetarian options as well, ranging from reconstructed bell pepper and corn quesadilla to green garlic risotto with aubergine fritters.

Food spectrum
 The menu encompasses everything from traditional preparations, like crab and leek soup to the eatery’s take on street food, like white fish steamed in banana leaves to modernist fare like scampi tartare with puffed amaranth, mandarin dressing and delicately shaved pickled cucumbers. Unfortunately, the kitchen’s ideas don’t always translate effectively enough — like the salad Niçoise, which features crystalised tuna (think icy pink crystals) topped with purple potato mash, tomato and jaggery dust, edamame beans, eggs and tomato vinaigrette. While the dish may display a thrilling use of technique, its strong flavour base entirely overpowers other ingredients. A dish that worked splendidly is a sinus-clearing Malabar soft shell crab curry that you’ll want to order again and again. 
Under sommelier Pratik Angre, the champagnes on offer are on offer with glassware that ranges from the traditional flute, to the once popular coupe. Moet and Chandon, G.H. Mumm, Louis Roederer Brut Premier and Bollinger Brut Special Cuvee were the four champagnes that were paired with our 14-course tasting. The bar will also include a range of spirits, some of which are in keeping with the eatery’s emphasis on seafood – for instance, there will be cocktails with nori-infused vodka.
Rivers to Oceans, launches June 25 at Palladium, Lower Parel; open from noon to 3 p.m. and 7 p.m. to 1.30 a.m; A meal for two is priced at ₹3,500 (without alcohol) and ₹4,500 (with alcohol); 49735025.

The labour of our fruits
","Not sparing the rod — in a manner of speaking — does seem to have worked. When they were wee and eating solids, I gave the poor unsuspecting creatures whatever seasonal vegetable was to hand. When the elder was a few months old, I would make her khichri with grated vegetables in it and remember the odd combination of orange English carrots and deep green capsicum. Her delicate little fingers would pick out and eat the vegetable shreds not because she enjoyed eating them but because the colours were attractive. As for enjoying any food, that was rare. I’d distract her with a rattle-cum-whistle and quickly shovel in a spoonful of whatever was on her plate and she’d spit it out with some force just as quickly, spraying my neck with little grains of semolina or rice or whatever was the plât du jour.
The smaller one was easy to feed, apart from the troubles in getting my hand to his mouth fast enough. In the time it took to fashion a morsel and lift it to his open, waiting mouth, he, trembling with lust, would strain against my restraining arm and lunge at the plate. Of course this happened with watery chicken curry and soft phulkas. My mother taught me how to make it in the tiny pressure cooker that had been bought for his sister, by sautéing a large piece of chicken and half a potato with a little turmeric and then cooking it till the first whistle. I know it sounds disgusting but he loved it.
In favour of veg
When it came to the veggies… there wasn’t any lust but they had no option. By the time they grew a little and started eating whatever we ate, my bossiness was well established. They could eat meat — or chicken or fish or whatever — if they ate their vegetables. And second helpings were also defined: as large a helping of greens as of meat. They protested, especially the younger one, but I was mean. And now, a couple of decades later, it appears to have worked. 
I had a weekend visit from my son, who was home after months, been fed biryani and was asked what he wanted the next day, Assamese pork curry, Hamida’s Yakhni Pathan or what. His first response was “golden brown chicken curry”. Then he asked whether cauliflower was in season. It isn’t, but as we all know, everything is available 30/12, so I decided to make an exception. He cancelled the chicken and asked for gobi aloo and yellow moong masoor ki dal.
Amazing, but I should no longer be surprised. For years now, whatever the menu, he’s wanted salad and vegetables as well. He eats them first, to get them out of the way and be able to concentrate on the rest. But cancelling chicken in favour of veggies…! 
Can we have spinach?
My daughter has always — ever since she had the choice — liked her vegetables. When she’s due home, she starts texting with questions: What will I get for lunch when I land? Please can we have spinach? Or tori? And baingan? I remember writing about this, after a long trip: when I asked them what they wanted for their first meal back home, she said “A Large Salad, please”. And now that she’s cooking, she’s learning to play with spices, and loves putting together colourful, balanced meals of whole grains and vegetables. The boy doesn’t cook, but eats things he didn’t love as a child but was forced to: yoghurt, fruit and salad.




This theme, of trying to inculcate healthy eating habits in children, popped up strongly in my mind in the last few weeks because I had my lovely teenage niece visit. Just home from boarding school, she’s easygoing and pleasant, happy to read and chat and hug and wake up and shower at a proper hour, unlike my children… but her eating habits are very different. She will not touch a vegetable, cooked or raw. Kakri had just appeared, green and tender, dripping with juice, but she wouldn’t have it. Watermelon so sweet that I suspect foul play, is cut and served on the table. No. Mangoes? No. A mitigating factor is her love of milk and yoghurt, eggs and toast. 
But all she wants at mealtimes — or in between — is dosa, paratha, the pav of pav bhaji (no bhaji), cheese toast, Bikaneri bhujia and pizza. Bhindi, peas, cauliflower, spinach, lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, any variety of gourds, pumpkin? No, no, no. Now her mother and I are devising a plan to change the regime. Unfortunately, one can’t tempt her with something new, saying “Try it — you might like it”. She won’t try it. Her mother resorts to “hiding” vegetables in dal and kneads them into roti dough. I clearly remember the years of effort, day in and day out, getting the little monsters to eat healthy. I’d say it was worth it. This recipe by Yotam Ottolenghi looks obvious, but I’ve only recently tried it. And I know that they’ll now eat this with a smile.
SPICED CHICKPEA WITH FRESH VEGETABLE SALAD
Serves 4
½ cup dried chickpeas, kabuli chana
2 small cucumbers
2 large tomatoes
1 small red onion, peeled
6 small red radishes, or half a large white one
1 red pepper, seeds and pith removed
2 tbsp coriander leaves and stems, roughly chopped
1 tbsp flat-leaf parsley, picked and roughly chopped
½ cup olive oil
Grated zest of 2 lemons, plus 3 tbsp lemon juice
2 tbsp sherry vinegar (or malt vinegar)
1 clove garlic, crushed
1 tsp sugar
Salt and black pepper
½ tsp ground green cardamom seeds
1 tsp ground cumin
2 tbsp yoghurt (optional)
Soak the chickpeas overnight in a large bowl of cold water. Next day, drain, place in a pressure cooker, add a cup of water and salt, and cook on high heat till full steam is built up (one whistle); lower heat and cook for another 20 minutes. When pressure in cooker naturally reduces, open, take out chickpeas, and drain. 
Cut the cucumber, tomato, onion, radish and pepper into 1cm dice, and mix with the coriander and parsley. In a jar or sealable container, put half the olive oil with the lemon juice and zest, vinegar, garlic and sugar, shake and season to taste. Pour the dressing over the salad and toss lightly. Mix the cardamom, cumin and a quarter-teaspoon of salt, and spread on a plate. 
Toss the cooked chickpeas in the spice mixture in batches, to coat well. Heat the remaining oil in a frying pan and over medium heat, lightly fry the chickpeas for two to three minutes, gently shaking the pan so they cook evenly and don’t stick. Keep warm. In a shallow salad bowl, place the salad vegetables in a large circle with a slight indent in the middle, and spoon the warm chickpeas in the centre. Drizzle some yoghurt on top if you prefer the salad to be a bit more creamy.

From ‘Mudakathan’ juice to ‘sukku malli’ rolls, this Chennai eatery is popularising traditional Tamil food ","J Suresh was contemplating quitting his well-paying IT job to get involved with something more meaningful when he came across ‘Uzhavan Unavagam’. The initiative, started in 2011 by inspiring IAS officer U Sagayam in Madurai, popularised traditional millet based food of Tamil Nadu via the farmers.
An ardent admirer of organic farming scientist G Nammalvar, Suresh had attended workshops conducted by the crusader. Once he began to do ground work and research, he decided to launch a catering business in Chennai. “I decided to use only millets,” he says, adding that he felt it would be an effective way to popularise them. “So, in 2014, I launched ‘Thirukural Unavagam’ in Virugambakkam, Chennai. But, I could not sustain it beyond two months.”




Undeterred, he decided to set up shop on the city’s outskirts, and opened a two-table restaurant at Karayanchavadi, catering predominantly to industrial workers in the vicinity. He was joined by Karthikeyan E, thanks to the happenstance of himcatering Karthikeyan’s wedding. “I was keen on serving millet-based traditional food in my wedding and Suresh pitched in,” says Karthikeyan, adding, “Since then we’ve been travelling together.”
 
Together, they did extensive research local food, determined to find a way to make it appealing to millenial customers. And by 2016 September, they had launched a restaurant in Adyar, banking on its proximity to the IT corridor and the success of pure vegetarian restaurants in the locality.
From a humble beginning with 12 recipes, today they serve close to 45 different dishes, many of which are innovative. “Standard menus don’t work here and therefore we constantly innovate,” says Suresh, adding “Tricolour puris and sukku malli rolls appeal to younger customers. I have even developed pani puri with ragi,served with mudakathan juice. However, the most popular items on our menu are the two traditional set meals: Tholkappiar and Nammalvar Thaali.”
The restaurant also serves millet chapatis stuffed with traditional herbs and vegetables. “Our recipes are built on three things: millets, herbs and heritage rice varieties of Tamil Nadu. Our vision is to build our unique cuisine as an elite brand,” says Suresh, adding that they refuse to compromise on these parameters. “In fact, we do not serve what customers like, but what is good for them,” he adds firmly.
Karthikeyan says most of their customers are “the health conscious population,” adding that includes a lot of younger customers. He says, “We plan to laun



“We are economically stable, thanks to the increased awareness on food safety among the public,” says Karthikeyan, adding that he finally has time to read books, mostly on nature, farming and business. He has enrolled for Masters in Psychology. The next step? “We plan to start farming, as our heart lies there.”
On the menu
--> Vegetarian omelettes, which are thin pancakes made by grinding together sprouted moong with green chillies.
--> The Tholkappiar Virundhu includes 18 traditional dishes, served with heritage rice for just ₹148.
--> The Nammalvar Virundhu replaces rice with millets and has 20 items, for ₹158.
--> End your meal with herbal tea, made with thipili, adhimadhuram, dry ginger, pepper, thulasi, mint and karupatti.

How India is becoming the perfect culinary tourism destination ","India is tough to package. Especially when it comes to food. Break it down State-wise for a broad introduction. Delve into regions within the State, different communities that inhabit these regions and interpretations of local dishes that change every 100 kilometres; and you have a complex, dynamic menu that makes the thrill of discovery, for even the most non-experimental diner, intense.
It’s an ideal setting for food tourism, a genre that is burgeoning as people travel the world inspired by culinary shows, world’s top-restaurant lists, influencers and Instagram. It helps that India’s culinary ambassadors, like Gaggan Anand, Manish Mehrotra and Vikas Khanna, are packaging regional flavours innovatively, resulting in Indian food breaking free from the greasy butter chicken and fiery roghan josh stereotype. Kolkata-born and Bangkok-based chef Gaggan’s restaurant ranked number five on the recently announced ‘World’s 50 Best Restaurants’ list in Bilbao, Spain.




And while India has always been a fixture on the route of writers and travel show hosts, over the past few years, celebrities like Gordon Ramsay, Gary Mehigan, David Rocco, Andrew Zimmern and, of course, the late Anthony Bourdain, began to explore, and celebrate, different facets of the rapidly-changing country, instead of simply hunting for colourful histories and trademark exotica.
On foot
Kaveri Sinhji, Cultural Anthropologist and Historian, Founder, Culture Rings, based in Bengaluru, has been conducting food walks for international tourists for almost a decade now. She says, “About 90% of the people writing in for a booking say that they do not want spicy — spicy meaning chilli hot here. They love our cooking with spices though. They love cinnamon and cardamom and appreciate the various benefits that come from these spices, but chilli hot is not something they want.” She adds that international visitors are extremely worried about things like the Delhi Belly, and some even ask for guarantees on not falling sick. “So I tell them that I can’t give them a guarantee — just like they cannot give me one for their country. If you go to Bangkok, you eat on the street, you are not used to the water — and it is the water that can make you sick.”




“Most Indian diplomats will tell you that there are some brilliant Indian restaurants abroad,” says Shiv Shankar Mukherjee, India’s former High Commissioner to the UK, “However, there are also several Pakistani and Bangladeshi-owned Indian restaurants, and it is these that define Indian food for thousands of international diners. The onus then should ideally be to promote the right concept of Indian food.”
Image makeover
These perceptions are changing, thanks to restaurants like Gymkhana in London (modelled after Indian gymkhana clubs), which got a Michelin in 2014. Or The Cinnamon Club, set in the former Westminster Library, and serving modern Indian food.
Of course, given the build-up, once tourists land in India, they first want to hit the streets for those promised samosas. Street food tends to raise questions on quality, hygiene and provenance of ingredients. Aiming to change that is Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI), which has undertaken numerous projects towards ensuring food safety across sectors. Project Clean Street Food, launched in 2016, aims to train 20,000 roadside vendors in Delhi on health and hygiene, in phase one. Pawan Agarwal, CEO, FSSAI, says, “In consideration is also a campaign on recognising responsible places to eat at. This will be for restaurants as well as packaged food. Metrics to evaluate quality of produce used, hygiene, reduced food wastage etc, are being developed, and those displaying sincere efforts will be recognised, making it easier for visitors to make smart choices.”




As a food tour organiser, Sinhji believes that clear communication is also important. She emphasises to her clients that if you are not sensible, you can get sick. This is why her tours include home-dining experiences. The way India packages food is as important, says AD Singh, Managing Director, Olive Bar & Kitchen. “Look at the work done by Karen Anand with Dishoom in London,” Singh says. “ Indian food in a café format was an eye-opener to a majority of non-Indians who dined there.”
“The marketing of India as a culinary destination lies in the answer of how to brand Indian cuisine,” says Sunil Alagh, Founder, SKA Advisors, and TV commentator. “We should work towards an ideal that reads — Have you tasted food at all if you have not eaten in India?”

‘Cos now I’m living on green power: An ode to the green guava
","At a recent wedding, there was a surprise element on our vazha yellais. A chutney made with green guava by a local caterer. An appetising green in colour, it was smooth, creamy and delicious. It had the sour flavour that one associates with chaat.
It is now a sought-after item at wedding feasts and the credit goes to Madhampatty Rangaraj for not just developing the recipe but for getting me to think about using the green guava as a veggie option. 
The guava may have originated in Central America but after hundreds of years in the Indian subcontinent, it is considered local. When it comes to nutrition, the guava is to Asia what the apple is to the west. Guavas contain possibly the highest amount of Vitamin C present in fruits. They are equally rich in Vitamin A, manganese, which helps the body absorb other essecinal nutrients, and folate, which is necessary for conception and growth of the foetus.
Yet it is not a fruit that is found as often as some others at our homes. This may have something to do with the fact that it isn’t used much in cakes, pies or even salads. While I have heard of guava jellies, squashes and jams, I wonder how much of the actual fruit goes into making these condiments. Also given that these products are pink/peach in colour, they are probably made using the pink strawberry guava rather than the green, which are easier to find here.
The country variety ranges from a small one with dark green flesh to bigger ones that with a paler green exterior. I wasn’t too fond of the guava especially because of the seeds that wouldn’t break, no matter how hard they were bitten. 
With guavas in season now and available everywhere here, the first dish I experimented with was, of course, the chutney. I didn’t want to ask the caterer for his secret recipe but going by the taste, I used onion, green chillies, tamarind, turmeric powder, rock salt and a few coriander leaves. In went the chopped guava, seeds and all, because discarding the latter meant losing so much flesh. Once it was all blended together, we had to strain the chutney. The smooth purée was tempered with dried red chillies, curry leaves and mustard seeds. One taste and I was supremely happy.
With the rainy weather we’re having, a warm green guava soup is next on the agenda. And a koyakkai rasam maybe?

Meat that matters
","“You must try the lobster bisque,” insists Thomas Kurian, food and beverage manager. It’s good advice, for what arrives is light-red creamy-rich goodness. Made from stock of sautéed lobster pulped into puree, with occasional pieces of grilled lobster meat, the soup is a great beginning for a filling meal at the ongoing Steaks and Grills Festival at Regency restaurant in Abad.
The seafood chowder soup that’s up next doesn't quite match up. It is better suited for those with bland preferences. Senior sous chef, Mohan Babu, says the soup is made in typical North-American style, comprising fish, shrimp and squid accompanied by capsicum. The starters bring more American fare with BBQ chicken wings, served with abundant barbeque sauce. For vegetarians, the chef suggests his innovative baby corn lollipop — corn stuffed with cheese and fried — or mushroom remoularde, (crumb fried mushrooms with tartare sauce).
The meat of the matter comes at the main course. Although generously skewed to the non-vegetarian dinner, the menu does offer two vegetarian options: a platter of grilled vegetables marinated in spicy tomato sauce, and the classic cannelloni (a baked breed of pasta stuffed with corn and spinach). Of the 12 other dishes offered, chef Mohan says his seven seas platter has been the hot favourite of the season. It features squid served with an Indian spiced sauce, prawn served with butter-garlic sauce, fish fingers served with a lemon butter sauce and lobster with a Mexican sauce.
His other quick mover is the traditional beef steak, named the Tournedos Opera — a chewy, chunky affair that comes doused in pepper sauce with more pepper sauce on the side. Several of the menu’s offerings are also available on a sizzler platter, given that you like the dance and drama of smoking meat and boiling vegetables. For the quieter sorts, the meal comes primly plated on white dinnerware. The Regency’s steak festival has been an annual staple until the restaurant underwent a recent revamp, explains Thomas. “The menu hence comprises creations that have done well in the past, and some new ones for this season,” he says.
One of the newer entrants is the ranch burger steak, made of grilled beef burger that comes with a cheery fried egg sunny side up. The chef also recommends his Chateaubriand bearnaise, beef again, marinated in oyster sauce, and named so for chateaubriand refers to the particular undercut of meat used, and the bearnaise is an egg-yolk and butter based hollandaise sauce. We’re also served the braised chicken supreme roulade, which was the highlight of the meal: chicken breast stuffed with minced chicken and mushroom. Chicken also comes in Hawaiian style garnished, of course, with pineapple.
To round off the elaborate spread, there’s an assortment of five desserts to choose from. Your best bet is the chocolate truffle mousse.

The festival is on for dinner from 7 p.m. to 11 p.m. till May 11.

Labour that sweetens jaggery!
","Several outlets exclusively selling Andhra sweets here are now offering those made of jaggery as a speciality. But making jaggery itself is a back-breaking work.
The juice obtained by crushing sugarcane will be directed onto a huge crucible set on a pit. After having adequate juice, it will be boiled using the heat produced by burning bagasse. A person will keep stirring it with a ladle until it acquires the right thickness and later pours into vessels solidifying into lumps of 15 kg each.
In the peak season, they work round the clock producing 50 lumps in one round. In 24 hours, seven rounds can be made. The season lasts from November to March and generally, farmers have their own jaggery crucibles, says Karri Sanyasi Naidu, who runs a jaggery making unit at Tallavalasa. Farmers are finding raising casuarinas more profitable nowadays as making pulp is comparatively easy.
“For three years, a farmer gets around Rs. 2 lakh on casuarinas plantation. On sugarcane, if we are investing Rs. 3.5 lakh, we more or less get the same amount,” says a farmer at Tallavalasa. To make jaggery, a farmer also has to employ at least three persons to work at the unit.
For one round, around Rs. 2,700 to Rs. 3,000 is earned and a farmer is left with around Rs. 1,000, he adds.

Climbing mountains, spatula in hand
","“Trekkers just smelled the food and walked up to our tent,” says Vineet Bhatia, on a crackled, broken WhatsApp call from somewhere in Nepal’s Himalayan region. His journey, which began on May 24 at Tribhuvan International Airport, Kathmandu, has been a long one. He is now on his way home, after spending June 3, 4 and 5 cooking at Everest Base Camp.
The celebrity chef and his core team of six were at the camp to serve up some hearty soul food as part of a charity initiative with the Heart for India Foundation, to raise money for the girl child and Nepalese earthquake victims. His pop up restaurant has been months in planning, as has his fitness level, says the chef.
“My son and I did quite a bit of cardio regularly for two months, in preparation. But even then, the real experience was completely different: the rocks, the weather...” says the chef, “It’s a very physically challenging trek. At times, we were on a 60° incline.”




However, Bhatia has no regrets. “We didn’t want to chopper our way to the top, unlike other people who have gone and cooked there in the past. We wanted to experience the place, see the beauty, meet people,” he explains. Needless to say, these encounters and experiences had an impact on the chef’s mind, and further made their way to his ladle and pan. One of the things that struck Bhatia, for instance, was how often they had a simple meal of dal bhaat en route. “We were told that the salt level was deliberately kept low, in order to be careful about the heart rates of people onward.”
In contrast was the slew of German bakeries in Namche Bazar, where they stopped for two days to get acclimatised. “The bakeries and their products were very nice, and of course, the high sugar levels were good for burning energy,” he recounts. And then, there were the juniper berries that they found pretty much everywhere along the route. These found their way into the chef’s recipes at the base camp, as did plenty of potatoes, which, as Bhatia puts it, “are found in abundance in high altitudes”. So while the berries helped flavour his masala rice, the potatoes — sweeter than your regular ones — were sliced as finely as possible before being thrown into the pan, and for good reason. “We keep it thin, so it cooks faster. The cooking time is longer up there, because of the temperature and pressure. This despite the fact that water begins to boil faster here, at 80° Celsius.”




That wasn’t the only challenge to Bhatia’s plan of serving up a mix of Indo-Nepalese cuisine. “We had to make do with just one wok, one pressure cooker and one pan,” he says. A separate team of sherpas had reached the camp earlier, in order to deliver the equipment and ingredients. Needless to say, there where limitations in terms of weight. “Carrying flour would have been way too difficult, so we stuck to rice. But we finished the meal with some nice sooji ka halwa, with saffron and gold leaf.” Besides that, there were simple stir-fried vegetables, including locally grown beans, and plenty of what the chef calls ‘Indo-Chinese’ innovations, with Schezuan sauce, garlic and chillies. “We needed to pack a punch,” he says.
But the thrill of clambering over rocks with platefuls of soul food to serve trekkers from around the world in their tents only came at the end of the road. Before that came blizzards, engine failures, and a terrifying take-off on the world’s shortest air strip. There were also new friends made along the way, an encounter with a sherpa who had scaled Everest several times, a chance meeting with a wandering lama (a Tibetan Buddhist spiritual leader), and what Bhatia describes as “the pure white mountains, clean air, clear skies”.

Mumbai's Bhagat Tarachand: an edge to the veg
"," Every morning at 9 am, traders who head to the wholesale market at Mumbai’s Zaveri Bazaar, congregate at B Bhagat Tarachand, for breakfast.
Aloo paratha with dahi and lassi is their staple, which the staff lovingly serves. This has been the pattern for several decades now. Synonymous with wholesome vegetarian Sindhi and Punjabi food, the restaurant serves meals throughout the day — both thalis and a la carte.
Today, Prakash Chawla, grandson of founder Bhagat Tarachand Chawla, is at the helm and is assisted by his nephews, Hitesh and Rahul, who make up the fourth generation.
The journey




“The restaurant is named after my grandfather, who was a kind and generous man and loved to feed people. He thus earned himself the title ‘Bhagat’ which, in Sindhi, means kind-hearted. The legacy, which began in the 1890s in Karachi, was carried forward by his three sons — my father Khemchand and two uncles, Radhumal and Gopalchand, and today, by my brothers and their families,” says Prakash.
After Partition, at loose ends upon arriving in Mumbai, Tarachand’s three sons, decided to start Bhagat Tarachand restaurant as a tribute to their father and to keep his passion for food alive.




“Over the years, we have grown and the business has expanded, so the family has branched out and there are several outlets all over Mumbai, including smaller ones in the malls. However, this one at Zaveri Bazaar is the oldest one of all. The core philosophy of serving fresh and affordable vegetarian food is something we strictly adhere to even today at each outlet,” informs Prakash with pride.
The evolution




What began as a small eatery on the ground floor with 30 seats, is a three-storied restaurant with a seating capacity of 200 today.
While the ground floor caters to those who want a quick bite or the thalis and do not mind sharing tables when busy, the first and second floors are more spacious and are for leisurely family meals, including an AC section.
Two vegetables, one dal, chappatis and lassi was all that the fixed menu offered for several decades, and yet, had a plethora of loyal patrons. “It is our food quality and hygiene which attracted customers then and does even now,” Prakash affirms.
The first menu variations were brought about as late as 1978 when Prakash joined his father. “Initially, changes were resisted, but when I could justify the difference they were making to the business, my father was immensely proud of me,” he recalls.
Tandoori rotis, parathas, naans, more vegetables and desserts were some of the items added to the menu post 1978. “The menu grew as per the demands of our guests and we gladly added Punjabi items to the otherwise Sindhi menu too,” he informs us. 
More and more




Happy to introduce changes as they grew, modernisation was accepted with grace. Initially, the kitchen was primitive and the food was cooked on charcoal. Sensing the need to expedite the pace in the kitchen in order to cater to larger volumes, modern equipment was introduced. But the food is still cooked in brass and copper vessels.
Uniforms were introduced for the staff to give a better look, refrigeration was done in the kitchen and a menu card was printed. “Earlier, in my father’s time, the menu was hand-written on a black board,” he reveals.
The seating in the restaurant was basic and sans frills. “People merely came here for a hearty and cheap meal. But when families started to throng this place, we were compelled to start an AC section too,” he adds.
“Changes may have been brought about to keep up with the times, but we have never compromised on the quality and freshness of our food. The same raw materials that are used in the restaurant are the ones used at home too,” Prakash states with candour. 
Quality is of utmost importance to them, and so, no food sitting at kitchen counters for hours is acceptable at Bhagat Tarachand. “Food is cooked thrice daily to ensure freshness for our patrons,” he avers.
Dal fry, tawa rotis, papad churi, paneer bhurjee, rabdi, moong dal halwa, chaas or Kutchi beer, are the signature dishes which reign supreme on the menu even today, although the menu has expanded. While most of the recipes have remained unchanged, a streak of innovation to cater to the evolving palates of diners, is not something they are averse to. 
Looking ahead




With the fourth generation stepping in, Prakash is relieved and ready to pass on the baton. “I have enjoyed my innings, but it is their time now. I am always around to guide them, but they have a free hand to run it their way,” he states. He is, in fact, looking forward to his son Vishal, currently in the US, joining the business.
Dining apps and platforms seem to be necessary today, so it is being done. However, B Bhagat Tarachand still does not feel the need to advertise. “We have the goodwill and blessings of our loyal patrons who spread the word,” Prakash sums up.

Mother's recipes from all around
","She carefully adds pieces of fish to a pan and lets them sizzle and brown, before turning them to the other side. Her fingers tremble a little but her concentration is complete. She covers the pan and turns off the gas before turning to smile at me, “I’m making a fish pie for dinner,” she says. “It is one of my favourite dishes.”
Rachel Chacko may be ninety years old but she continues to pursue a passion of a lifetime—cooking. “My mother was a good cook too and I developed an interest in cooking while I was in school,” she says. “I really enjoy seeing other people relishing my food.”
It was her marriage to an army officer however that deepened her knowledge of cooking, “My husband always appreciated my food,” she smiles.

 It is a manual for a novice cook. I’ve tried to relate it in a manner that is easily understandable 
“As he was in the army we travelled all around the country. It gave me an opportunity to mingle with people from different communities at the parties organised by the army. Since we were posted to faraway army posts, other entertainment was difficult to come by and the army ladies would get together, share recipes and have cookery demonstrations. We began to assimilate the culture and food from all parts of the country.”
Over time, her collection of recipes grew, “Each time we moved to a new place, my husband would complain about having to cart the trunks of recipes along,” she fondly remembers.
When he passed away she realised that she had a lot of time on her hands and encouraged by her daughter, Geeta she began to compile a collection of her favourite recipes, “My daughter tells me that these recipes are very easy to follow and make,” she says. “It is a manual for a novice cook. I’ve tried to relate it in a manner that is easily understandable — I want it to feel like the words of an experienced mother telling her daughter what to do.”
Her book titled Mother’s Recipes, published by Notion Press and priced at Rs. 310 is a collection of 300 recipes divided into ten sections which include dips& beverages, soups, salads, rice&rotis, lentils, vegetables, fish/egg& meat, snacks& sweets and pickles and chutneys. “A lot are typical Malayalee recipes but there are recipes from other parts of India too,” she says.
“This is an ideal gift for a newly married bride,” she says. “Most modern young girls don’t know how to cook. The preparation of food is an expression of love and I hope my book will motivate my readers to rediscover the joys of cooking.”

A different experience
","Five years ago, I visited a friend in Mumbai, and chanced upon a Bohri wedding that was taking place in her neighbourhood. Invited for the celebrations, I found myself tasting Bohri food for the first time.The flavour of the food stayed with me, and years later, I got the opportunity in Delhi to revisit the taste when I got an invitation from K3 restaurant at JW Marriott to attend a Bohri Food Festival.
I was introduced to Chef Musakir Khan, in town from Mumbai to organise the festival. Before the meal, the Chef explains Bohri food to me. He says, “A Bohri meal starts with a pinch of salt and is followed by sweet dishes. Traditional Bohri food is eaten by eight people from a large plate. It gives the feeling of community eating.”After the pinch of salt, I startmy meal with Malida. It is a suji dish, mixed with eggs and boiled milk, and then fried with ghee and melted jaggery and dry fruits. Chef Khan has more than 16 years of experience with Bohri food. His knowledge of the cuisine is amazing. Explaining the speciality of the cuisine further, he says, “We use very little spice and oil in our food. We don’t use red chillies.”
The next round of dishes arrives, which includes nargis kabab, meat cutlet, chicken patty and kokum batata. The non-vegetarian starters are succulent and tender. My main course comprises the popular dabba gosht and mutton biryani. In dabba gosht, mutton pieces are marinated in ginger, garlic and chilli, stewed with whole spices in a cashew and onion gravy, topped with an egg and baked. The meat is boiled to make it tender and then cut into small pieces. Then macaroni, egg and cashew are added to the mix before it’s put in the oven. The dish is very different from the usual non-vegetarian fare, and highly enjoyable. The mutton biryani is also quite different from the ones we usually find in restaurants. In this version, the garlic and ginger are added before the Dum is put in. “Only those people can make the perfect Bohri food who have knowledge and understanding of this cuisine. And perfection comes with years of experience, as well as spending time with this Bohra community,” adds Chef Khan.

This fest ends on May 4. Meal for two: 3300 plus taxes

In need of a lifeline: India's battle against TB
","The global battle against tuberculosis (TB) will be won or lost in India because most TB patients live there. Last month, we — at the Delhi Network of Positive People (DNP+) — lost a member of our staff, a fierce HIV activist, to TB.
After decades of activism that made HIV treatment accessible, Anita (name changed) died painfully and gradually, on April 30; there was no help forthcoming from the authorities. Her struggle exemplifies the monumental challenges faced by India’s TB community in accessing treatment. India’s TB community loses around 80 patients every day to drug resistant (DR) tuberculosis, a deadlier form of the disease, where the bacteria is resistant to anti-TB drugs.
India released data from the largest national DR-TB survey ever conducted by any country. The survey found that more than 6% of all TB patients in India have multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB). Based on data in the Global Tuberculosis Report 2017, an estimated 147,000 people have MDR-TB in India, accounting for a fourth of the global burden. Out of them, 30,000 patients need immediate access to better drugs and diagnostic facilities.
Anita, a familiar face among HIV activists in Delhi, was diagnosed with DR-TB in September 2016. It took 15 visits, spread over four months, to the All India Institute of Medical Sciences to get the results of the crucial drug-sensitive test that would help determine the most rational regimen to be followed after establishing what drugs she was resistant to. During this period, she was on presumptive treatment which caused her condition to deteriorate. The toxic cocktail of drugs prescribed to her caused persistent nausea, psychosis and depression — known side-effects of the deadly disease. By April this year, this 49-year-old firebrand activist was reduced to 28 kg; rapid weight loss is a hallmark of TB, giving the disease its historic name ‘consumption’ because it eats away at the person.
In HIV, patients who are put on anti-reterovirals start getting better almost immediately. In DR-TB, much like cancer, the drugs are toxic and a significant portion of the treatment is about managing side-effects. In Anita’s case, the drugs caused extreme nausea, which does not allow patients to develop an appetite, cause rapid weight loss and inevitable death. The disease gradually consumed her will to live.
We have been left devastated.
Anita contracted TB because she worked among TB and HIV patients. In 2005, the government rolled out free generic antiretroviral therapy, or ART, for HIV patients, turning a death sentence into a manageable disease. However, a new problem arose that has not been addressed in decades.
ART centres, where people living with HIV are treated, do not strictly implement infection control measures for TB prevention. TB, being the top opportunistic infection among HIV patients, is not incidental to health-care workers like Anita who are constantly exposed to patients with DR-TB. Yet, people who work with DR-TB patients are not offered Isoniazid preventive therapy and N95 (respirator) masks, that reduce the risk. After years of such work, she was diagnosed with pulmonary DR-TB.
According to recent government data and estimates, there are nearly 1.5 lakh patients with DR-TB in India of whom about 20% succumb to the disease. In the past few years, the government has recognised DR-TB as a public health threat and shown the political will to address the epidemic. Yet, as Anita’s story illustrates, there is still a long way to go.
Globally, a number of efforts are now under way to provide regimens containing new classes of TB drugs such as bedaquiline, pretomanid, and delamanid which offer hope to DR-TB patients. Despite some positive developments such as new drugs, screening tools and medicines, we are losing loved ones every day. India’s TB community is grieving. As affected communities, we want to encourage our government to offer health-care workers like Anita, the most effective regimens at the start of their treatment so that they have a greater chance of a cure in the future.

Giving shape to the TB fight
"," 
Tuberculosis (TB) is one of the world’s biggest global health crises; 1.7 million people died of the disease in 2016. New data suggest that the global scope of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is much larger than previously estimated, in turn requiring concerted international efforts in combating this deadlier form of the disease. BRICS nations (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) together account for over 40% of TB and over 50% of drug-resistant TB cases. 
The disease has started receiving political attention not only domestically but also internationally. To fast-track progress in tackling TB, the United Nations is to hold the first-ever UN high-level meeting, on September 26 in New York. Here. global leaders will decide strategies on how to tackle one of the deadliest infectious diseases. 
Negotiators and missions of member countries in New York are working this month to finalise the text of the political declaration that will be released in September by global leaders and set the direction in which policy and resources on TB and drug-resistant TB will move globally. 
Sticking points
Countries negotiating the final declaration text are coming under significant pressure by the United States to drop all references to protecting the rights of countries to take fully legal actions to access affordable medicines for their people. 
One of the final sticking points remains the language on public health safeguards enshrined in the World Trade Organization’s (WTO) Agreement on Trade-related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS). This allows governments, among other things, to issue ‘compulsory licences’ to override patents in the interest of public health, so that they can allow generic versions of medicines to be produced or imported and more people can receive needed treatment.
The affordability of medicines and use of TRIPS flexibilities has been agreed upon in multiple international fora, including the UN high-level declaration on anti-microbial resistance.
But the U.S., backed by its powerful big pharma lobbies, is pushing to remove any mention of the need for medicines to be affordable. 
The U.S. is exerting extreme pressure on the ‘Group of 77’ bloc — of developing countries — by refusing to sign the declaration at the U.N. General Assembly in September if language such as the paragraph that “recognises the importance of affordable medicines” and “urges countries to enforce intellectual property rules in ways that promote access” is included. 
Countries, including those in the Group of 77, and BRICS that have a high burden of drug-resistant TB, need to urgently stand up right now against the bullying that aims to keep newer oral TB medicines out of the hands of the people in their countries who need treatment. 
The upcoming TB Summit is an important opportunity to address drug-resistant TB. Blocking more affordable generic versions of safer oral medicines that are needed to scale up effective treatment for people with drug-resistant tuberculosis, or DR-TB, will not be the way to do it.

Mango and memories!
","Mangoes and I go back a long way. My grandfather had a mango orchard in his village in Western Uttar Pradesh, and I spent my summers rather fruitfully – literally and otherwise – among the trees there. I recall an incident in New Delhi, too, when we were among a group of families living together in a bungalow in Lutyens’ Delhi, which was – and is – lined with mango trees. I chucked a stone aimed at a ripe mango dangling from a branch of a fruit-laden tree and then ran for my life when I saw the maali approaching. But the stone took a strange arc and instead of hitting the branch, hit the top of my head as I ran.
But despite such misadventures, my love for mangoes stays as strong as ever. I love the chausa, which sadly comes for a very short while. Last week, I also had some nice ratauls, which my friend Sohail bhai brought from Rataul, a village just about 30 km from Delhi.
I have had another nice mango session this summer – and that was at The Imperial. Chef Veena Arora, Chef De Cuisine, The Spice Route, had rolled out her Summer Collection menu, and I had a taste of some of her delicious specialities. The menu spans dishes from Kerala, Sri Lanka, Vietnam and Thailand, and each dish includes either fresh or raw mangoes. The maambalam okra thoren, for instance, is a Kerala dish of wok-fried okra with slivers of raw mango, while the yum mamuang kung krob is a spicy raw mango salad with dry shrimp and battered fried prawns from Thailand. 
I had a Thai dish – tom som mamuang – which was a wonderfully light chicken and raw mango soup flavoured with lemongrass, galangal and kaffir lime leaves. For the soup, the chef had boiled a cup of water and then added a stock cube to it, along with lemongrass, galangal and kaffir lime leaves. When it started to boil, she added some fish sauce and crushed red chillies to it. Cherry tomatoes, onion, chicken and raw mango went into the broth, which was then seasoned and garnished with fresh cilantro. It was heavenly, and rejuvenated me on that hot and humid day in a trice. 
Nice and tart
The amba curry – a Sri Lankan dish of raw mango and assorted vegetables – was nice and tart. But what I loved was the ga xao hot dieu – a Vietnamese style stir fried chicken dish with ripe mango and cashew nuts. The chicken had soaked in the flavours of the mango, and the crunchy cashew nuts added to the texture. The Jasmine rice with ripe mangoes cooked in coconut milk was wonderfully fragrant and was almost like a dish by itself. 




Delightful mix
Chef Arora, who grew up in Thailand, likes to add fruit to her dishes – a delightful mix that is a veritable part of Thai cuisine. “That is the reason the complete menu revolves around mango, the favourite summer fruit,” she says.
The menu has been carefully crafted by the chef, who has also created the dishes. Among them is pla e saan – crispy fillets of sole served with a spicy palm sugar and shredded raw mango sauce and flavoured with mint.
The festival is on till July 31, for both lunch and dinner. A meal for two costs ₹8500 plus taxes. There are several desserts on the menu, too, but I am being a good boy and didn’t venture there. But the food that I did eat was, in one word, superb.
It didn’t just tickle my palate but also opened up a trove of old memories. And it even reminded me of a dent on the top of my head!

Expect a smorgasbord of flavours at Ikea India
"," The Swedes take their ‘Fika break’ or ‘work break’ seriously. There’s at least one Fika break each day, and it’s more than grabbing a coffee and a short eat. It’s a culture that’s deeply ingrained. Employees are encouraged to take that break, move away from their workstations and meet people over a beverage and baked goodies. 
Ikea, headquartered in Almhult, Sweden, celebrates this culture. To call their Fika break area a dining hall or a canteen would be doing it injustice. 
It’s an all-welcoming, spacious section of the office, that speaks of the Scandinavian love for white interiors, with several low-hung lamps adding warmth to the long tables. The signs of change, skewed towards healthier offerings, are visible at the cafeteria in the Almhult Ikea store, and the sprawling restaurant inside Ikea Museum in Smaland village. 
Almhult is often referred to as Ikea town, since it’s here that Ikea’s founder Ingvar Kamprad established the first store in 1958. Almhult municipality has a population of 17,000, and most inhabitants are directly or indirectly employed by the company.




The town houses the Ikea of Sweden offices, test lab, hotel, an Ikea store and a museum.
The Fika breaks were an opportunity to introduce the world media — that had gathered in Almhult for Democratic Design Days 2018 — to several Swedish specials. Quite a few of these, it was heartwarming to know, will make their way to the 1,000-seater Ikea bistro set to open in July in Hyderabad, abutting the first store. This will be the company’s largest bistro in the world, and serve a mix of Swedish and Indian cuisine. 
Less sugar please
There was plenty of good coffee, tea and flavoured drinks to go around during the Fika break. In sync with the global shift towards consuming less sugar, Ikea doesn’t serve sugar-laden aerated drinks and instead offers Nordic fruit waters, with 50% less sugar. 
The lingonberry-flavoured fruit water is a must-try. Lingonberries are partly-tart, partly-sweet and the fruit water has mild notes of the berries. The bistro will also have raspberry, lemon and pear-flavoured waters. 
Swedes have a sweet tooth and love their cinnamon buns, cookies and chocolate balls. Too much sugar? Only if you eat them all at one go. 
The cinnamon buns, a Swedish special, has butter and cinnamon-laced sugar rolled into the swirls of pastry puff. The hint of cinnamon works delicately on the palate. 
These buns will be served in an in-house bakery in Hyderabad’s Ikea bistro, alongside fresh breads, dinner rolls, croissants, chocolate cakes, mango cakes and cheesecakes. Want more? Try their fresh fruit salad and gulab jamun.  Four years of research in different cities in India has helped the company understand the local palate and include a sizeable Indian vegetarian selection, while also staying true to its Scandinavian origin.
Swedish meatballs and hot dogs top the list of iconic specials and are available in most Ikea cafeterias in the world. Now, veggie balls and veggie dogs also feature prominently on the menu. Ikea will steer clear of beef and pork for India, and bring in chicken, salmon and vegetarian variants of the meatballs. The platter of veggie balls, with stir-fried wholegrain rice and vegetables, looks deceptively small, but packs in the right amount of carbs, proteins and healthy fats for a wholesome meal.




Bite-sized helpings of the salmon balls served at a session in Almhult turned out to be a welcome surprise. The balls make use of the often-discarded portions of the salmon head and neck. It’s an exercise towards reducing food wastage, and the firm aims to cut wastage in its cafeterias by 50% by 2020.
This will be a priority in India as well, asserts Henrik Osterstrom, Country Manager-India, Ikea Food, “We are concerned that no food waste should go to landfills. We will have a system in place to measure the daily waste and try to minimise this over time. We will compost organic waste, send it back to farmers, so that it can be used to grow plants, thereby closing the food loop.”
Back to greens
Vegetarian inclusions in the menu is Ikea’s nod to the growing interest in plant-based food. At the design summit, a soy-based soft ice swirl was introduced. The texture is creamy with only a subtle flavour of soy. Dried berries and nuts are used for toppings. 




The company is also toying with fruit-based and oat-based ice creams. Its popular vanilla-flavoured yoghurt ice cream will be available in India and more flavours will be added later.
Four years of research in different cities in India has helped the company understand the local palate and include a sizeable Indian vegetarian selection, while also staying true to its Scandinavian origin and global appeal. 
Osterstrom calls it “the Swedish feel and Indian appeal. There will be a variety of starters, salads and desserts, and the Indian menu will include samosas, dal makhani and biryani,” he emphasises. 
Ikea is tight-lipped about its local food partners at this point. The company has its own kitchens for its cafeterias across the globe and Hyderabad will be no exception. The bistro is eager to serve carnivores, vegetarians, vegans and flexitarians.

Bond over bikes and coffee
"," Just at the K.K.Nagar arch where the Melur Main Road enters Madurai city, you cannot miss the large transparent window façade of Café TN59 now. It stands out for its name and the signboard flashing the district code distinguishes itself from the clutter of established vegetarian and hardcore non-veg eateries on the road facing the District Court building.




Barely a fortnight old, the café has rapidly carved a niche as the only place for short eats and beverages in the area. “It is okay if people eat at nearby places and chill out here with our desserts and shakes,” says M.Iniyaa, a foodie who veered into fashion designing and worked as a banker. “Years of varied experiences are now helping me to run the cafe,” she says, visibly happy with the walk-ins.
The café was accidental and set up in a jiffy, she says. She actually came to check the property for running a ‘bed and breakfast’ and found this platform to be ideal for a chic café. And when 60 orders came off smoothly in the first seven days, Iniyaa knew she would be able to make a mark. Customers doubled in the second week and now the 25-seater goes mostly houseful. 




The menu is quite affordable to enable everybody to enjoy. From among the 133 items categorised under juices, drifts and shakes, fruit-tails, veg and non-veg starters and short eats, one can happily find something of choice too. You can order up a steaming cuppa coffee or replenish with fresh, seasonal juices and a pastry or a brownie, indulge in pizza, sandwich or burger, nuggets and cutlets or any usual café item you can think of.




Guhan K who is the consultant from Erode helped Iniyaa to quickly put together the appealing and cost effective menu that is filled with fancy and funny names and also make the items look beautiful and instagram-worthy pictures!.
“We want to convert it into a thematic destination for bikers, racers, cyclists and those with a passion for driving around,” he says. “We want people and travellers to come here and share their experiences, inspire others and perhaps plan weekend rides randomly.”




He is confident fitness freaks and riders will soon have their voices heard here. As they come by and start imparting information on easy and difficult destinations, pit stops, adventure trails and tips and guidance on how to go about it, more people with similar interests will show up. A big noticeboard and social media page are in the pipeline waiting to be launched within this month to give the new café an even newer look and profile.
And of course all the exciting conversations will happen over the hot and cold beverages and the food available. The menu is not extraordinary but the young entrepreneurs have given a twist to the regular items. To suit the city’s climate, a major part of the menu is filled with summer coolers robust in flavour.

I tried two -- the refreshing elani-nongu (tender coconut and palm) drink and the delightful ‘mango murder’. It came as mango shake in a bowl with a scoop of mango ice cream dipped in it and sprinkled with fresh mango cut into small pieces. Both cost Rs.80 each.
All items are priced between Rs.30 and Rs.160 and new combos are introduced every week. Iniyaa says the kitkat and oreo milkshakes keep the children happy, the young school and college goers indulge in the rich dates and nuts shake named “Fly Emirates” or the dudes and teenz shakes and turbo chargers that are thick, rich and creamy. The health conscious prefer a simple bowl of fresh fruits with naturally flavoured ice creams. Labelled as melting mountains, the ice creams have a dash of green chilly, beeda, pazhapalam, fig, pineapple, guava and more. The hot drinks and soups are called Lava.
There is a colourful variety of fresh fruit-tails offering combinations with pomegranate, watermelon and lime called Healthy Ride, apple, carrot and ginger called Revitaliser, kiwi, pineapple, watermelon and lemon called From Doctor’s Desk or the mambazha magic with mango, strawberry and apple and many more. Iniyaa assures no artificial syrups are used in making the fruit-based drinks.
The veg or non-veg platter with three pieces each of five different items can turn into a light meal too. For example, the non-veg platter has chicken nuggets/popcorn/fingers, fish fry and crab lollypop costing Rs.160.
The café is neat and remains open all days from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m.

Karnataka forced to explore options to procure millets
","The State government is forced to consider other options for procuring millets for distribution under the public distribution system (PDS) as it could not meet the requirements from open market.
It is estimated that 30,000 tonnes of jowar and 25,000 tonnes of ragi are needed for distribution under the PDS along with rice every month. However, only around 14,000 tonnes of ragi and hardly any jowar have been procured by the Department of Food and Civil Supplies from open market.
Officials said the offer price of Rs. 1,500 to Rs. 1,800 per quintal for both jowar and ragi had deterred farmers from selling them. The recent hailstorm damaged jowar crop on large tracts of land in north Karnataka. With reduced supply, the price has shot up beyond Rs. 35 a kg, a senior officer said.
“We are committed to providing the foodgrains. We have succeeded in providing parboiled rice in coastal districts and ragi in some south Karnataka districts at least to a small extent,” Harsh Gupta, Commissioner, Food and Civil Supplies, said.
“We are exploring other options for procurement of jowar and other foodgrains,” he said.
According to him, the options include decentralised procurement and distribution, and working with cooperative institutions and farmers’ organisations.
“The first option is to buy foodgrains from farmers directly at Primary Agriculture Cooperatives (PAC) or Raitha Samparka Kendras (RSK). This will avoid the involvement of intermediary agencies or middlemen. Farmers will get an assured market for what they grow. For us, it will reduce the logistical hassles of centralised procurement from multiple agencies. We could also save on the cost of storage and transport. We also want to experiment with decentralised distribution at the village level, at least in some taluks,” Mr. Gupta said. “We are also inquiring if any cooperatives could help us in this task,” he said.
A pilot project to include minor millets such as bajra and sajje on the list of foodgrains to be supplied is on the cards. “Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha units in some districts have volunteered to work with non-governmental organisations such as the Deccan Development Society to help us procure and distribute minor millets. This will involve creating awareness about the nutritional values of these millets and encouraging farmers to grow them and people to consume them. We want to start the pilot project in Heggadadevanakote and Aurad taulks,” he said.
M.S. Sriram, IIMB fellow and visiting faculty, said decentralisation of procurement and distribution was the “best available method”. “It minimises logistics issue and reduces cash exchange points. It, however, needs to be planned in detail. We need to start with a map of what foodgrains are needed in each district. Then, we need to empower the PACs or RSKs to enable to them procure and distribute the foodgrains. Thirdly, the government should devolve financial powers to gram panchayats and enable officials at the village level to take decisions. Long-range planning and effective implementation will ensure success,” he said.
“The government can also look at gradual reduction of physical distribution of grain and increase use of innovative methods such as direct cash transfer or issuing food stamps. These will reduce costs and increase effectiveness of the delivery mechanisms,” Prof. Sriram said.

A new ally in the cancer fight
","In a first, researchers from India will study the proteins and genes of cancer tumours simultaneously. The aim of the merger between the two promising sciences (proteomics and genomics) is to derive new medications as well as offer personalised cancer therapies.
Last month, India became the 12th country to join the International Cancer Proteogenome Consortium (ICPC) of the National Cancer Institute (NCI), U.S. It is a forum for collaboration among the world’s leading cancer and proteogenomic research centres. In the Indian team, the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IITB) is to study proteomics and the Tata Memorial Hospital (TMH), Mumbai, India’s premier cancer institute, is to study the genomics of three cancers, breast, head and neck, and cervix. As a pilot project, the researchers will be studying 100 samples from each of these cancers.
A first for India
“This is for the first time that proteomics and genomics of the cancer tumours will be looked at by taking the same samples. There are a few such projects in the world but none in India so far,” says Dr. Sanjeeva Shrivastava, Associate Professor, and group leader of the proteomics laboratory, IITB. “The data analysis and interpretation are going to be challenging but worth the effort,” he says.
The field of genomics involves studying all the possible genes in the system or the organism and also analysing their mutations. Through an intricate process, DNA, which is the storehouse of genetic instructions, makes proteins. Tweaking this manufacture can mean influencing the kind of protein products, and consequently, vital molecules for life.
“This is the reason why drug makers target proteins to look at inhibitors or therapeutics. Studying proteins is extremely challenging and any findings therefore become extremely relevant in terms of novel and better treatments,” says Dr. Shrivastava. While there are an estimated 20,000 genes, there are many more proteins. “Proteins are in the millions and thus complicated to study. We don’t have any accurate estimates as they further get modified,” he explains.
According to the NCI, previous studies have shown that genomic changes are not always present at the protein level. This suggests that the additional level of proteomic analysis can lead to an enhanced understanding of tumour resistance and/or toxicity to therapy and can one day offer the ability to predict treatment response by examining drug response or toxicity. The website says: “As a result, the ICPC teams believe that integrating genomic and proteomic data together can provide more information and insight into cancer’s development and growth.”
According to Dr. Shrivastava, given the small sample size in the pilot phase, they will look for answers for extremely focussed questions. “For example, breast cancers have many subtypes. So we may consider looking at one particular subtype like ‘triple negative’. Within them, we will look at the response to a particular therapy,” he says.
Peek at the future
The five-year project will attempt to carry out the pilot phase with funds from the institutes. Eventually, it will look at funds from government and philanthropic organisations. While it will take years for results, Dr. Shrivastava is optimistic and ambitious. “Can we have a robust technology that can help us get protein reports in 24 hours, just like blood reports? Can we offer quick treatment protocols that are unique and personalised instead of simply offering standard chemotherapy for all? This is what we are looking at eventually.”
A study published this month in The New England Journal of Medicine says that 70% of early-stage breast cancer patients who would normally be candidates for chemotherapy based on their clinical features actually do not need the treatment. The study claims that women could skip toxic chemotherapy cycles and only take a drug that blocks the hormone oestrogen. The findings, based on gene tests carried out on tumour samples, are most likely to cause an overhaul of cancer treatment worldwide.
Dr. Sudeep Gupta, medical oncologist, TMH, says that essentially there are two methods of inquiring into tumours — genomics and proteomics. “Till now, there has been no handshake between the two. This new project is looking at an integrated approach by getting researchers in both fields together. This will definitely open new targets in terms of cancer treatment,” he says.

What must go in your child’s lunch box
"," 
Processed junk food has been steadily filling the lunch boxes of many school children in Kerala. Although nutritionists and paediatricians have been warning parents about the ill effects of processed food and why it should not become a habit, indulgent or harried parents reach for that carton or packet as it saves time on manic weekdays. 
Dr. Anita Suresh, general practitioner working at SUT Royale Preventive Clinic, says fast food creates unhealthy obese adults who fall easy prey to diabetes and hypertension. “Most processed food are high in calories with little nutritive value. Fast food is often cooked in oil that is reheated, which can irritate the stomach of children. It can be carcinogenic too. Moreover, the kids might become addicted to artificial flavours,” she explains. 
Although canteens are common in many schools, hot-sellers are fast food such as parathas, burgers and samosas. Not much thought is given to the idea of a balanced diet. While most government schools serve mid-day meals, which are supposed to be cooked according to a chart prepared by dieticians, only one or two in the private sector have a food plan for students.
Trivandrum International School is one of those rare schools in Thiruvananthapuram that makes it a point to serve a balanced diet for the children. “All students eat in the cafeteria. We follow a calorie count for each meal and ensure our meals are healthy with a mix of salads/fruits and proteins, with carbohydrates. Teachers educate children on healthy meals and we have a chef on the rolls of the school management. As such, the principal, teachers and the management take a close look at what is being served for lunch,” says Rupa Sen, Principal of the school. Even short eats are made of wholesome wheat and there are no fried eats. “Variety in choice of food items, methods of preparations, choices of colour, texture, and flavour, makes food appetising and satisfying. A combination of carbohydrates, proteins and fat will give long-lasting energy at breakfast which will help children to concentrate on studies and activities,” say adds.

L'école Chempaka, on the other hand, believes in educating parents and children on the importance of a nutritious diet.
“So, we insist on an orientation course for new parents. There is a chart that shows healthy snacks and we advise parents to send cooked food for both snacks and lunch. Our teachers monitor the lunch boxes of our students in the kindergarten and junior classes and see to it that the students are not eating junk food. We have to catch them young when their tastes are developing,” says Daphne Gomez, Principal of L'école Chempaka.
The School of the Good Shepherd also thinks on the same lines. Parents of children going into class one are advised to send only food cooked at home for their children. “When their aunties in school open the lunch boxes for them, the children get pulled up if they find junk food. They tell us to pack whatever we make at home and not picked up from an outlet,” says Archana Gopinath, mother of an eight-year-old. 
Many schools in the city are beginning to keep a watch on what the students have in their lunch box. Teachers in the primary classes in Christ Nagar Higher Secondary School, for instance, have advised students to bring a wholesome meal for lunch instead of opting for snacks or packaged ready-made food. 
“One of the students in my child’s class was given bread and tomato sauce on a daily basis. The class teacher concerned had to speak to the parents to give the child cooked food for lunch,” says a mother of a student in Christ Nagar School. 
In the case of government schools, the Government’s breakfast and noon meal scheme ensures a wholesome diet for the students. “The Government guidelines insist on a healthy, balanced diet, which includes vegetables, especially leafy vegetables, and pulses,” explains Jaseela A.R., Principal Headmistress of the school. 
However, nutritionist Gayathri Asokan, head of Nutrisolutions, says bread, pasta or noodles is not the problem. “If a child enjoys pasta, give her a healthy pasta filled with vegetables and, if she is a non-vegetarian, eggs, meat and fish too. If she is fond of bread, then give her sandwiches with a filling that is made of fresh veggies, cheese or egg. The trick is to see that the child gets enough of carbs, proteins and vitamins. There is no need to stuff the child but she must be eating healthy,” she says.

Vitamin D armour for cancer
"," 
Higher levels of vitamin D are associated with decreasing risk of breast cancer, says a study led by researchers at University of California San Diego School of Medicine, U.S. The scientists pooled data from two randomised clinical trials with 3,325 combined participants and a prospective study involving 1,713 participants to examine the association between risk of female breast cancer and a broad range of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D —25(OH)D — concentrations, which was chosen as the marker because it is the main form of vitamin D in the blood.
Researchers identified the minimum healthy level of 25(OH)D in blood plasma to be 60 nanograms per millilitre, substantially higher than the previous medically recommended standard of 20 ng/ml.
“We found that participants with blood levels of 25(OH)D that were above 60 ng/ml had one-fifth the risk of breast cancer compared to those with less than 20 ng/ml,” said principal investigator and co-author Cedric F. Garland, DrPH, adjunct professor in the UC San Diego Department of Family Medicine and Public Health, in a press statement. The risk of cancer appeared to decline with greater levels of serum vitamin D.
Dr. Garland, who has previously studied connections between serum vitamin D levels and several types of cancer, said the study builds upon previous epidemiological research linking vitamin D deficiency to a higher risk of breast cancer. Epidemiological studies analyse the distribution and determinants of health and disease, but it has been argued that they do not necessarily prove cause-and-effect.
“This study was limited to postmenopausal breast cancer. Further research is needed on whether high 25(OH)D levels might prevent premenopausal breast cancer,” he said. As the population was also mainly white women, further research is needed on other ethnic groups.
Long-time advocate
Dr. Garland and others have advocated the health benefits of vitamin D for many years. In 1980, he and his late brother, Frank C. Garland, also an epidemiologist, published an influential paper that posited vitamin D (produced by the body through exposure to sunshine) and calcium (which vitamin D helps the body absorb) together reduced the risk of colon cancer. The Garlands and colleagues subsequently found favourable associations of markers of vitamin D with breast, lung and bladder cancers, multiple myeloma and adult leukaemia.
To reach 25(OH)D levels of 60 ng/ml would generally require dietary supplements of 4,000 to 6,000 international units (IU) per day, less with the addition of moderate daily sun exposure wearing very minimal clothing (approximately 10-15 minutes per day outdoors at noon), Dr. Garland said. The success of oral supplementation should be determined using a blood test, preferably during winter months, he added.
According to the National Academy of Medicine, U.S., the current recommended average daily amount of vitamin D3 is 400 IU for children up to one year; 600 IU for ages one to 70 years (including pregnant or breastfeeding women); and 800 IU for persons over the age of 70.
Blood serum levels exceeding 125 ng/ml have been linked to adverse side-effects, such as nausea, constipation, weight loss, heart rhythm problems and kidney damage.

Chennai’s Spice Klub: Fine dining, with a taste of the streets
"," Spice dominates everything at this restaurant, from the food to the line of art work along an upper wall. They look like abstract paintings, but are actually works of chiselled wood: each painted in a basic colour and centred around a spice like cinnamon or chilli. The huge, staid wooden frames set the tone for the entire restaurant: high-ceilinged, narrow-walled, and tall panels aplenty.
The dishes placed on the table, though, are a trifle more funky. A constant is the Mumbai-style rack of eight cutting-chai glasses, each filled with a brightly-hued, delicious dip. 
What’s even funkier is their decision to start with the sweet stuff: popular among the beverages are coconut water with assorted caviar and mango on the rocks. While the former, served in a bubble-like container that spills foam from all sides, is as sweet and delicious as you can expect coconut water to be, the latter transcends the narrow boundaries of entrée, main course and dessert. No, really. Crunchy as ice, with some sponginess of pulp and the taste of, well, pure mango, it is one of those dishes you can spoon mouthfuls of with no regard for course, meal, or time of day. And that’s exactly what we did: mango on the rocks stayed put at the table throughout, and made it to our plates at the end of every course.
There’s much to be said for the inventiveness of Spice Klub’s head chef in Mumbai. 
Take, for instance, the fruit lassi served in six flavours, solidified into a jelly-like consistency through a process called spherification, that lets you tip one serving of unpleasantly saccharine-sweet lassi right into your mouth like an oyster. Or, take the dahi vada, aka vada boondi served with dahi caviar. 




If you have grown up feasting on the middle-class staple, served at every celebration and family get-together, you’ll recognise the core taste of the vada from the boondi you spoon up, and the pleasant familiarity of curd mixed with just the right spices from the bubble of ‘caviar’ that joins the former in your mouth. It’s a party — nay, a homely Indian wedding dance — in your mouth.
The gilavati kebab — unlike most others — doesn’t melt in your mouth. But then, it doesn’t need to. It’s barely softer than a regular tikki, and so rich in flavour that you don’t mind chewing on it for a while. And then there’s the vada pav: plain buns served with potato mousse, with the masala packed in little, edible, plastic-like pouches made of potato starch. Once it’s all in your mouth, it’s like chaat right off the streets. 
But the pouches melt as soon as they touch your tongue, so don’t try this dish if you aren’t willing to race the different components into your mouth. In fact, if you’re the kind of person who doesn’t like playing with your food, don’t come here at all.

Heritage in every grain
","Nel Jayaraman, Tamil Nadu State Coordinator of the Save Our Rice Campaign, stood tall, unmindful of the heat, greeting people and keeping an eye on the preparations. The 12th annual Nel Thiruvizha brought together thousands of paddy farmers from around Tamil Nadu and a few from neighbouring states as well. The wedding hall in Thiruthuraipoondi was a sea of colour with farmers in white veshti and shirt with a bright green thundu thrown over their shoulder, and the women in bright saris. Youth volunteers were everywhere — managing logistics, serving food and water and manning the registration desk. 




There were speakers, microphones, cameras, lights and speeches wherever one turned.
People who came early were witness to the rally that began from the centre of Thiruthiraipoondi town. A handsome Kangeyam calf was led out, followed by a bullock cart with vegetables, fruits and other crops, a basket made of straw, plastered with cow dung and filled with paddy seeds alongside a photo of agricultural scientist and environmental activist Nammalwar. The idea was to create awareness about traditional food and seeds. The seeds were brought in and placed reverently in front of the hall, signalling the beginning of the Nel Thiruvizha, organised by the Save Our Rice Campaign and other groups. 
The thiruvizha has become an integral part of the agriculture calendar of Tamil Nadu farmers. It is no longer an event by Save Our Rice alone. It has become a public event with local people from in and around Thiruthuraipoondi and Thiruvaroor participating in large numbers and paddy farmers coming from all corners of the state. 




An enclosure with 12 tonnes of seed was the focal point of the meeting. The thiruvizha is the high point of the year and sharing these seeds is sacrosanct. Jayaraman reeled off facts and figures, “We were ready with 12 tonnes of seeds across 164 traditional paddy varieties. We multiplied large quantities of Karuppu Kauni, Mappilai Samba, Jeeraga Samba, Thuyamalli, Poongar, Kullakar, Kichadi Samba and Kuzhiyadichan. By the end of the second day, approximately 11.5 tonnes of paddy seeds were distributed to 5742 farmers. Farmers also returned around 3.5 tonnes of seeds. This is a system of barter based on honour. We give each farmer two kilos of seed; they bring double the quantity back the next year. Almost 60 per cent do this. Many share the seeds with their neighbours leading to a multiplier effect. Every farmer signs a pledge that he/she will grow the seeds though organic methods.”
Farmers collect paddy varieties and also return varieties that they had taken earlier and multiplied. The event has become an annual meeting point where farmers growing traditional varieties of paddy using organic techniques meet fellow sojourners, share notes, listen to speakers, visit exhibition stalls with seeds, books, food products and agriculture implements. 
Ponnambalam, one of the pillars of the campaign, reminisced, “The first thiruvizha was inaugurated by Nammalwar in 2007. Adirengam village, eight kilometres from Thiruthuraipoondi town, was the venue and the meeting was held in the paddy fields lying idle post-harvest. We welcomed the 147 farmers with seven traditional varieties (Kattuyanam, Kuzhiyadichan, Kudavalai, Panangkattu kudavalai, Poongar, Sigappu kauni, Garudan samba).” 




Usha Kumari, who has led the Save Our Rice Campaign since its inception, remarks, “Seed saving and conservation is an integral part of agriculture. They lost favour with the introduction of high-yielding seeds and commercialisation of seed production as part of the Green Revolution. In the process our wealth of traditional varieties was lost. The thiruvizha is not only a reminder of what we have lost, but also of what we can recapture. The conservation and revival of traditional paddy varieties has become an imperative with climate change causing havoc in agriculture. We have to revive these resilient traditional varieties and introduce them into the fields.”
These farmers and seed conservers are not rich. They battle adversity every day. They are challenged by climate change, lack of water and a market. Yet they have decided to adopt organic paddy cultivation and to conserve traditional varieties. 
They have found that these traditional varieties, which are our heritage, could be their saviours in these uncertain times. In the process, they have become the saviours of these seeds that, if not cultivated season after season, could cease to exist. 
Saving rice 
In December of 2004, 150 activists working on agriculture and environment came together in the small picturesque village of Kumbalangi near Kochi, in Kerala, to discuss the future of paddy farming. Usha Kumari and Sridhar Radhakrishnan, who led the campaign, travelled around meeting people working on seeds, organic farming and farmers and The Save Our Rice Campaign emerged with the objective of conserving rice ecosystems, sustaining rice culture and diversity. In 2006, the Campaign began work in the three paddy-growing states of Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka and then moved to West Bengal as well. Twelve years later, the seed conservation work has been adopted by tens of thousands of paddy farmers in the four states.

A dragon from Kolkata ","There’s Chinese. And then there’s desi Chinese: Spicy curries, deep fried chicken and prawns in a golden batter. 
A lot of these dishes originated in Kolkata’s Chinatown, where a community of Chinese traders worked in tanneries, and started a number of restaurants.

The month-long promotion is a tribute to the culinary escapades of Kolkata’s Chinatown, famous for Indianised Chinese food. 
I begin with dragon chicken, which is possibly created by the Hakka community that first settled in Kolkata, according to legendso. The chicken, which is deep fried, is a perfect blend of tender chicken covered with crispy rice granules. 




“The main ingredients of Indo-Chinese cuisine include ripened chillies, ginger, garlic, fish sauce, lime, sugar and chilli paste A proper Indo-Chinese meal should consist of a soup, a curry with various accompaniments and a meat dish with vegetables,” said executive chef Sridhar Kare.

Rethinking the risks
"," 
Obesity on its own isn’t a killer. A study by researchers at York University’s Faculty of Health, Canada, has found that patients with metabolic healthy obesity, but no other metabolic risk factors, do not have an increased rate of mortality. The results could force a rethink in how medicine and health consultants view weight management and obesity, according to Jennifer Kuk, associate professor, School of Kinesiology and Health Science, who led the research team.
“This is in contrast with most of the literature and we think this is because most studies have defined metabolic healthy obesity as having up to one metabolic risk factor,” Dr. Kuk told Science Daily. 
“This is clearly problematic, as hypertension alone increases your mortality risk and past literature would have called these patients with obesity and hypertension, ‘healthy’. This is likely why most studies have reported that ‘healthy’ obesity is still related with higher mortality risk.”
Medical literature says that obesity — as a high mortality risk — is in the same league as dyslipidemia, hypertension or diabetes alone. Dr. Kuk and colleagues say this isn’t true.
The categories
In their study, they analysed profiles from 54,089 men and women from five cohort studies who were categorised as having obesity alone or clustered with a metabolic factor; elevated glucose, blood pressure or lipids alone, or clustered with obesity or another metabolic factor. Researchers looked at how many people within each group died as compared to those within the normal weight population with no metabolic risk factors.
Current weight management guidelines suggest that anyone with a body mass index over 30 kg/m2 should lose weight. This implies that if you have obesity (even without any other risk factors) it makes you unhealthy. In their report published in the journal, Clinical Obesity, they found that 1 out of 20 individuals with obesity had no other metabolic abnormalities.
“We’re showing that individuals with metabolically healthy obesity are actually not at an elevated mortality rate. We found that a person of normal weight with no other metabolic risk factors is just as likely to die as the person with obesity and no other risk factors,” says Dr. Kuk. “This means that hundreds of thousands of people with metabolically healthy obesity will be told to lose weight, when it’s questionable how much benefit they’ll actually receive.”
Indian context
 Obesity is major concern in India. The prevalence of obesity is increasing and ranges from 8% to 38% in rural and 13% to 50% in urban areas, according to the Indian Heart Journal. Obesity is a risk factor for development of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), hypertension, dyslipidemia, coronary heart disease and many cancers. In Asian Indians, excess abdominal and hepatic fat is associated with increased risk for T2DM and cardiovascular disease.

The Great Breakfast Buffet Migration
","If you haven’t been to the Masai Mara to witness the so-called Great Migration, fret not.
I’ll let you in on a far more feral and dramatic migration right in our midst. And compared to the wildlife I speak of – that too within touching distance – the wildebeest is about as exotic as a neighbourhood squirrel.
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to The Great Complimentary Breakfast Migration, featuring the buffetbeest (Gutgreedus indica).
Habitat
The buffetbeest can be sighted at any hotel/resort offering a complimentary breakfast buffet.
The coats
The male can be identified by his posterior cleavage. Observers will be treated to UHD views of furry male patootie crannies peeking-a-boo from ill-fitting track pants or shorts more than once during the course of their visit. A distended gut — navel fluff, and all — displayed ever so teasingly in the chasm between a stained tee one size too small and saggy pants, is a regular bonus. The male also sports a stubble, eye-bags, and lets off the subtle odour of yesterday’s garlic naan mixed with the morning’s cigarette.
Females (sighted in their best attire the previous night, perfect hairdos and makeup, preening for their selfies) assert their independence during the feed, and display their equality to their rear-baring spouses via their as-is-where-is dress code. Makeup is minimal. Just a bit of leftover toothpaste on the chin, accessorised with a forgotten plastic comb in the remains of the previous night’s elaborate bouffant. The expression: grrrrrr, don’t judge me, I live with this nasty furball, I need downtime.
The snot-nosed cubs can be seen in various states of undress, weeping, screaming, and head-butting anyone in their way right in the crotch.
Locomotion
The buffetbeest has a peculiar gait. The waddle says ‘leisurely’. But the keen eye and twitchy nose say ‘alert’. Most buffetbeests also wield a smartphone. To update their status on Insta with food pics. Or scream into with, say, elaborate details about the previous day’s bowel movement.
Feed one
The average buffetbeest starts with a large pile of life-affirming fruit. Because fruit is healthy, you see. So healthy that it can be followed by a four-egg cheese-bacon omelette topped with a chicken’s head, accompanied by six slices of French toast dipped in honey. With no consequences. A tempting bowl of sugary breakfast cereal soaked in watery milk sits on the side, just in case. After all, the buffetbeest knows famine could be round the corner.
Soon after this ‘western’ start, an overwhelming wave of nationalism sweeps over the buffetbeest, brought on by the aroma from the puri/batura counter.
Watering hole
Letting out a growl, the buffetbeest heads towards the fluffy, golden-brown balloons of wheaten joy, pushing a sluggish, but equally greedy, elder from the herd out of the way, when, hark — the colourful juice section catches his thirsty eye.
Passion fruit, watermelon and mango. Hmmmm? The buffetbeest scratches himself, thinking. Maybe one small glass each to rehydrate, and make up for the eight whiskies of last night? And it is fruit, after all. And fruit, as the buffetbeest knows, is healthy.
Feed two
Three steaming puri-cum-baturas with a tiny mountain of yellow potato hits the spot. The passion fruit juice tastes dispassionate, but the watermelon does the trick. Abandoning the mango seems like a good idea because, over the din of the herd’s gnashing teeth, the buffetbeest hears his cub say ‘bonda’.
Feed three
Or maybe the fresh sausages that have come in should be the way to go? Well, who said you can’t pair bondas with sausage? ‘Try the pancakes, jaanu,’ purrs the mate. ‘They are to die for.’ Indeed. But not if preceded by that ripe hill banana within picking distance.
After all, the doctor said fruit is healthy.

A matter of refined tastes "," 


Delhi-based pitmaster Harman Singh and mixology consultant Viju Raj were in Hyderabad for a short while and couldn’t have enough of the city’s diverse flavours. They talked with genuine enthusiasm about their gastronomic discoveries in Old City and the plush Banjara and Jubilee Hills neighbourhoods. The two know their food and drink and were here on business, hand-holding the setting up of Hyderabad’s new gastro lounge, Zephyr.In a nod to Greek god Zephyrus and the connotation of ‘a gentle breeze’, Zephyr has a blue and white Greek theme for its interiors and is styled like a few living rooms seamlessly merging into one another. It’s not a typical bar, both in design and ideology. Viju Raj has been the driving force behind new-age bar concepts in Mumbai and Delhi but he admits that he hasn’t really pushed the envelope elsewhere, like he has with Zephyr.




More and more bars in the country now pride themselves in using locally sourced, natural ingredients in their drinks. Here, restaurateur Vikas Passary takes it a step further and says, “We wanted a cocktail bar that stems from the concept of drinking responsibly. The focus is on the craft than volume.”
A spectrum of cold pressed vegetable and fruit juices are made in-house, so are a range of syrups, sauces and garnishes. At one end of the bar counter are two gas tops on which sauces and syrups are cooked. “Nothing is served from a packet and no preservatives are added,” asserts Passary.
Signature infused gins
Viju Raj and Passary have curated a menu that boasts of cocktails made with cold pressed juices and insist that “the vodka tastes much better” this way. Their signature drinks use a range of infused gins, also done in-house. Think of gins infused with hibiscus and vanilla, saffron and ginger, clove and orange peel, star anise and filter coffee and more. “We source a lot locally to keep flavours intact, and some are handpicked from different regions of the country, like kokum from Goa,” says Raj. The infused gins are ready within 15 to 20 days and the experimentation with new flavours is an ongoing process.


The garnishes tick varied sensory notes. Frozen candied orange slices are enhanced with a hint of cinnamon and organic sugar, there are dehydrated slices of oranges and pineapples (thanks to an in-house dehydrator) and the drinks are served in handmade glassware sourced from Ferozabad. “The serving is more courteous; the second drink would never come in a shot glass but be well presented to go with the living room concept. Everything has to appeal to the five senses,” says Raj. Some of the drinks are served enclosed in smoked pine wood, to enhance the presentation.
A centre community table, borrowed from the Mediterranean lifestyle, encourages visitors to greet share conversations with new people.




The food menu is the deft handiwork of Harman Singh who likes to underplay his role as “the man who cooks”. There’s a method to madness in the pairing of flavours and he, along with Passary, has put together a menu that would offers for the global traveller, the local palette, for those who enjoy heightened or subtle spice notes. From a watermelon-mint gazpacho with a kick of chilli to sago punugulu, dahi ke kebab or three bean salad, there’s plenty to savour — you get to sample Mediterranean, Indian, Thai and much more. Desserts get a whiff of subtle fusion too. Try the mango mascaropone rabdi, it has all the good notes of the mango and the creaminess of the mascaropone without an overpowering sweetness.

All smoked up ","All you crave for on a windy afternoon is a cosy place where you can binge on some piping hot food. That is exactly what the American style pub and restaurant —Plan B offers.
The place is on the second floor of the #13 building on Rhenius Street. We occupy a table right beside a huge open window that gives us a pretty view of green branches swaying gracefully to the sound of the wind, creating its own dance.




The speciality of Plan B is that it offers smoked meat in various avatars. The chef, Thashvin Muckatira, mainly “plays around with pork as “that is my favourite meat and it takes beautifully to the smoked flavour.”
We start off with a few mocktails and chilled beer, which looks gorgeous frothing as it gently runs over a tall glass it is served in. Along with it arrive the starters — smoked winged chicken (marinated chicken wings smoked over charcoal), BBQ pork belly (smoked pork spareribs, glazed with a sweet and spicy sauce), smoked meat tacos (crunchy fried tacos stuffed with smoked meat and coleslaw). The perfectly smoked meat with varied flavours creates a beautiful tingling sensation on your palate which is cooled off with every sip you take of the beer —making it a perfect affair with food.
Then we dig into the main course, which is smoked meat lasagne, beef brisket andouille sausage along with corn on cobs, creamed spinach, garlic toast and spicy coleslaw. These come in the BBQ platter section and are served in style on wooden boards.
The dishes are created by the chef Thashvin, a post graduate in Business Management, who actually started off as an engineer.




“The switch to food happened when I couldn’t drive every day to Whitefield,” recalls the chef. That is the genesis behind the name. ""As taking to cooking was indeed my plan b,” says the man who loves experimenting in his kitchen and adds that his passion for smoked meat began when he lived in the US.
“I went for a five-day training in smoked dishes and took it up as a passion. The toughest part about creating smoked meat is getting the timing and the temperature right. If you are careless, the meat just dries up,” explains Thashvin.
As of now, Plan B does not have in-house desserts as Thashvin wants to create them with pork as one of the main ingredients.
“That will happen soon,” beams the young chef.

Feasting Bhojpuri style "," More than a particular dish, it’s the warm, spicy and sinus-clearing vapours of roasted garlic and mustard oil that immediately makes me think of ‘ma ke haath ka khana’. This is not an aroma that is easily found outside of a Bihari home. This fact was true until last weekend. One whiff of the mustard-garlic combination in the roasted tomato chutney at Neel’s (Tote on the Turf) ‘Experience Magadh’ food pop-up and I felt like I was home.
Home-style menu
 Curated by Authenticook and chef Chandana, this was the first time I experienced Bihari food in a Mumbai restaurant. The pop-up, which will be available on this weekend as well, features Bihari favourites like litti (wheat balls stuffed with roasted gram flour, tempered with mustard oil and onions) served with aloo chokha, baigan chokha, tamatar bharta and copious amounts of hot ghee, aloo parwal bhujiya and malpua. But it’s little-known dishes like oal ka chokha (spicy yam mash) bhabhra (peas and kala channa fritters), kathal ki tarkari (jackfruit cooked in mustard oil), besan ki machli (a unique vegetarian dish of fluffy besan cake simmered in a thin gravy) and dehati mutton (a slow-cooked mutton dish) that made the trek to Mahalaxmi on a rain-soaked afternoon worth it.
Very little is known about Bhojpuri cuisine outside the state. The only dedicated Bihari restaurant I have been to is Potbelly in Delhi. While there are a handful of obscure litti-chokha stalls in the city, it’s the in-home dining experience offered by homechefs like Chandana that is familiarising Mumbaikars with the cuisine.
Joy of cooking
 I rediscovered my love for the food of my childhood last year when I chanced upon chef Pallavi Nigam Sahay’s cookbook, The Bhojpuri Kitchen. From the basic dahi choora gud to the more exotic parwal ki mithai, the cookbook has it all. Sahay, who trained at the Grand Hyatt, Mumbai and received her culinary diploma from ICIF, Italy, was introduced to Bhojpuri food after marriage. Her grandmother-in-law’s first piece of advice to Sahay was ‘masala tel choddne tak bhunjna, dulhin’ (sauté the masala till you see the oil at the edges of the pan) and this was something I’ve heard my mother say a million times in the days when she tried to get me interested in cooking. I just never bothered to listen then, but ever since I got my hands on this cookbook, it’s become a mantra of sorts in my kitchen. 
I’ve tried quite a few different recipes from the book. Papra is a basic besan chilla but with a twist that comes from adding sautéed green peas to the batter. Sahay’s chokha (spicy potato mash) to accompany litti is different from how my mother makes it. Tempering the mashed potatoes with mustard seeds and dried red chilli means that the chokha is not as spicy as I like it but it is ‘good’ different. Other outstanding recipes from the book are a fiery halwai-style mutton curry, choora mattar and malpua.
The recipes appear in seven chapters: comfort food, snacks, curries, bhujias, saags, chutneys and sweets. There is also a chapter on the festivals of Bihar and their culinary significance. Chapters differ in length but the spectrum of the recipes is very wide. Most Bihari food is non-fussy — dishes are quick to assemble and pretty much look after themselves once on the stove.
But if you’d like to discover a taste of Bihar in the heart of Mumbai this weekend, without stirring a finger — just head over to Chef Chandana’s pop-up instead
‘Experience Magadh - A Taste of Bihari Cuisine’ at Neel, Tote on Turf today for dinner and on July 21 and 22 for lunch and dinner; Veg ₹1200, non-veg ₹1400; to book: authenticook.com/meal/ experience-magadh-at- neel/400/2089/

Chef David Chang opens up on the trauma of cooking "," Chef David Chang’s first public response to the death of his mentor Anthony Bourdain was a black box on Instagram. It was accompanied by the lyrics from American musician Will Oldham’s ‘I See a Darkness’. “Well, I hope that someday, buddy / We have peace in our lives... And pull the smiles inside...”
His second response was an incisive and searingly honest podcast about his own struggles with depression. Chang is bright, popular and incredibly successful. The 40-year-old restaurateur, author and TV personality is best known for founding Momofuku, a spunky New York noodle bar in 2004, which rapidly grew into a group of restaurants all over the world. He hosts the popular Netflix original series Ugly Delicious, has won countless awards for his food, and has recently launched a media company, Majordomo Media, under which he hosts a podcast, The David Chang Show.
So when he went public about his constant battle with depression on his podcast, it triggered a growing wave of responses from writers, chefs and regular people, comforted by the fact that they were not alone. The half-an-hour podcast titled ‘Mental Health and Holding on to Hope’ begins with Chang apologising in advance to listeners who may find it “too dark or self-indulgent” and saying it “doesn’t feel appropriate to talk about anything but Tony Bourdain... Maybe the best way to honour Tony is to talk about my own struggles. I taped this by myself on a recorder two days after I found out that Tony died...”




Chang continues, “The fact of the matter is we all need help. Even those of us that think that everything is going great. It’s so hard to ask for help. More specifically, it’s really hard to find that help.” He talks about how expensive a good psychiatrist can be, adding that he has been seeing one since 2003, “Everyday... It has been the most regular and the longest relationship I have ever been in.” He adds, “The one thing I’ve ever spent money on — most people would consider me a cheap ass because I don’t really spend money on anything except food — I always spent as much money as I had or could afford on mental health.”
 A bad yelp review just makes me so sad. It makes me so angry 
While it is commonly known that kitchens are high-stress, Chang opens up about the trauma of cooking. “There’s a lot of cooks that have PTSD (Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder). Because that’s how stressful cooking was... Or at least the cooking I experienced.”
He says it took him years to get help, even when he knew he needed it. “In the past, particularly in an Asian household, the idea that you could get help for this was insane... I needed to see a professional because I was in despair. And I had had bouts of despair ever since high school. But I was just told to suck it up...” He adds, “I could never understand why. If I wasn’t gloomy, I was overly happy. Or I was gloomy and I was sad and I was depressed, but there was only smiles on the outside.”
He describes depression “like fighting some kind of invasive artificial intelligence of my psyche... It is constantly observing and getting data on how I am trying to beat this thing... And after a 15-plus-year battle with it, it is an incredibly complex organism. That is smarter than I am half the time...” He continues, “Sometimes I don’t even realise that I am in a state of depression because I don’t even recognise it. It has gotten so clever (at) morphing. It is evolving... I have to fight that every day.”
Sheer resilience




Momofuku was his way of fighting back. “2004 was about getting a restaurant open... A trick of mine is to set sometimes unrealistic goals for myself... before I go down a road of darkness.” He admits that opening a restaurant is one of the “most stressful, most difficult, high-failure things you can do,” but says work helped him battle depression. “Even when I had days (when it was) hard getting out of bed — it was like training for a marathon. It was just something you had to do. And when everything else didn’t make sense and my rational mind was not really working for me... I knew there was a purpose and I had get to work.”
In the podcast, Chang also opened up about his “huge issues with self-confidence. Approval. Self-love. I had a neurosis that I was not smart. That I was incredibly stupid. My paranoia was real. In retrospect, none of that was necessarily true. It’s hard to make sense of it all when you are in it.” He admits that therapy isn’t easy either. “I had some very expensive sessions when I would say nothing.” However, as Momofuku started to do well, he decided to pay for more sessions with his psychiatrist.
“I remember thinking: What’s the point of having money if I’m going to be dead anyway.” Discussing how he struggles with “imposter syndrome,” he talks of how he became so dependent on reviews for validation that he never really enjoyed success. “Work should never give you meaning... while I can tell you this right now, I still seek meaning through approval,” he admits, adding that he’s trying to find balance. “A bad yelp review just makes me so sad. It makes me so angry. I try not to read them any more...” The podcast concludes with Chang urging people to get help, “My heart goes out to anyone that has experienced anything similar. And I know it sounds a cliché, but you are not alone. You are not.”
Those in distress or having suicidal tendencies could seek help and counselling by calling the State Health Department’s helpline on 104 and Sneha suicide prevention helpline on 044-24640060.

New method to ripen mangoes
","A new and legitimate method of ripening mangoes has been introduced.
Food Safety Officers stepped in to guide vendors for ensuring the quality of mangoes.
The vendors were trained to use ethylene to ripen mangoes. Ethylene, secreted from mango trees, was used in liquid form to apply on mangoes, District Designated Officer, Food Safety and Standards Act (FSSA), M. Jagadis Chandrabose told The Hindu here on Friday.
The ethylene liquid should be sprayed on mangoes and it would make mangoes ripen in a day or two thus making them fit for consumption as per FSSA norms.
Ethylene produces natural gas initially but ripens mangoes, kept in a favourable atmosphere.
Ten ml of ethylene liquid needs to be dissolved in ten litres of water for spraying it on considerable number of mangoes. With this, sweetness, nutritional value and palatability of the fruit would remain intact, he said.
Explaining adverse effects of artificially ripened mangoes done with the help of calcium carbide, a harmful chemical compound, he said the latter would emit acetylene gas causing health disorder like ulcer, insomnia, loss of appetite.
Such practices were adopted by vendors to skip warehousing expenditure and make a fast buck. Consumption of such mangoes might lead to cancer, he said.
With such a substance, mangoes could ripe within eight hours.
These mangoes would be colourful and attractive but its pulp would not be sweet, Dr. Chandrabose said. He added that surprise raids would be conducted in stalls to check any illegal method of ripening mangoes.

Jasmine syrup is here!
"," A profusion of images flooded my Instagram feed during the summer holidays. My favourite were the pretty flowers that dot the woods and the countryside abroad in spring. Among the ones that caught my fancy were pictures of the dainty elderflower celebrated throughout Switzerland.
My Swiss friend had picked large quantities of it to make syrup, which would last her through the year and her posts had me wishing that I was in her kitchen at that moment. 
As if that wasn’t enough, a friend from Bengaluru who was holidaying in the Swiss Alps returned with bunches of elderflower and proceeded to make a golden syrup in her cosy Airbnb.




While I loved the process of picking delicate, aromatic local flowers and making an infusion, there was no way I could get elderflower in my neighbourhood. As I gazed at the small, white flowers, it made me think of our very own jasmine. Mallige, mogra, mallipoo, chameli ... the jasmine is known by different names across the country and romanticised on celluloid and used during traditional rituals for its aroma and pristine beauty. Elsewhere, in Asia, it is in demand for the mild flavour it lends to tea and rice grains, but it is not commonly used as a kitchen ingredient here. Ideally I would have liked to pick my own flowers but since my plant was a little low on offerings, that wasn’t possible.
When I asked my local flower seller for loose blossoms to make syrup with, she was amused. “You don’t want any for your hair?” she kept asking. I just filled my basket with a handful of open flowers, and rushed home to begin the immersions.
The method is straightforward. A citrus element is optional, depending on your preference. Given the delicacy of the jasmine aroma, I realised that I didn’t want to dilute it with any other spice or ingredient. Not even my favourite lemon.
We sat down to separate the petals from the short green stalk, and the heady fragrance was an instant mood elevator. While elderflower needed to be steeped for a few days in a simple sugar syrup, jasmine required only a few hours. The colourless liquid took on a slightly creamy hue and captured the fragrance beautifully. The sweet syrup carried the unmistakable flavour of the flowers making this a hugely satisfying foray into the exciting world of floral infusions. There was also a very slight bitter after taste that is commonly felt when tasting most flower petals.
This syrup needs to be stored in the refrigerator and can be used to mix a simple lemon juice or even some stronger clear brews. I am now thinking about making a lemon sour cream cake and glazing it with this delightful jasmine syrup: one helping of this sweet tangy confection might just not be enough.

All for shingara rasa! "," What is it about the samosa that makes my newly repaired heart go a-flutter? I have come to the conclusion that it is my favourite snack among all teatime munchies. I like crumbed cutlets and chops, like any other honest man, and will not say no to some soft dhokla or crisp aloo tikki. But give me a good samosa, and I am at peace with the world.
I like Chittaranjan Park for that very reason. What do you get when you have a residential area brimming over with Bengalis? You get sweet shops. And what do you get in Bengali sweet shops? Bengali shingaras.
New discovery
 


I had asked some friends who live in CR Park if there was any new place that I needed to visit. Try out Tarashankar, I was told. The sweets were good and the shingara was excellent, they said.
So I sent my trusted emissary to C R Park to pick up some sweets and shingaras. For those who came in late, shingaras are Bengali samosas, but have a vastly different taste. I used to go to Annapurna opposite Aurobindo Market for their Bengali samosas once, and really liked eating them with the dry green chutney that they served. But I thought I had to try out Tarashankar’s fare.
The shop is in Market number 4 (Shop no. 13; phone numbers: 011-41601514, 9899572994 and 9810921669). This is a small shopping area near the Kali Mandir. C R Park has a well-known caterer called Shankar (who sets up some great food stalls during the Pujas). Tarashankar is his baby, run by his son.
The friends were right: the sweets and shingaras were truly good. The sweets, mostly prepared with chhaina, were fresh and of various kinds. They have the usual fare (rasogullah, gulab jamun, kancha gollah, kheer kadam) as well as some interesting sandesh varieties such as chocolate sandesh, orange sandesh and kalakand. They have malai chop, orange malai chop and gujiya as well. The sweets are for ₹10-20.
Lasting taste
But the shingara stole my heart. I have to stay away from fried stuff, so I had just a small bite of the crispy casing, which was rather nice. The potato stuffing was excellent. The potatoes were cubed and had been sautéed with some basic masalas, coconut chunks and peanuts. I liked it so much that the next morning I de-constructed one of the samosas, left the casing, heated the potato and ate it with some soft and fluffy chappatis. And with a tall glass of frothy lassi, what a breakfast that was.
The samosas are fried in a huge kadhai in front of the shop. In the evenings, they also fry vegetable chops, another teatime snack that I really enjoy. A Bengali vegetable chop has a filling of grated beetroot, tempered with a few spices and cooked with grated coconut and crushed peanuts. This is then crumbed and fried. Both the samosas and the chops are for ₹10 a piece.
C R Park has several sweet shops, and people will have their favourites. One of them, I am told, sells one of my favourite sweets – shor bhaja. That is a fried sweet which I will have to stay away from – for the time-being. So meanwhile, I shall have my orange sandesh and samosa stuffing – with or without a chappati. Bihar may not have its Laloo, but my samosa will have its Bengali aloo.

Anthony Bourdain, one last time
","In the past two weeks, two public figures from the era of my New York City youth committed suicide. Kate Spade and Anthony Bourdain, certainly not mentioned in the same breath when they were alive, were inexorably linked in death. Kate Spade’s handbags were all the rage when I was a 20-something New Yorker in the 1990s. Although I never quite got the aesthetic nor the appeal, many of my contemporaries did, and Kate became a sensation. Just as we were processing her passing came news of Bourdain’s. The Internet imploded. People were genuinely affected and, unlike Karl Lagerfeld, who famously never thinks of the past, I couldn’t help but feel nostalgic for a time long gone.
In 1996, I moved from Manhattan’s meatpacking district — back when it really was just that, with rivulets of blood running down the streets and grim, grey, nondescript buildings dotting the neighbourhood — to no-man’s land on 28th street on the East side. This new neighbourhood was insipid and drab (but the rents were cheap). One block away was Curry Hill, populated by small, greasy desi restaurants and some dosa joints that were frequented by South Asian taxi drivers, Jews seeking kosher food and students on a budget. On another block was arguably NYC’s most famous Thai restaurant, Jaya Thai, which was adored by Indians because of its insane spice levels.
Where was a young girl supposed to go to unwind with a pal in the ’hood, at the end of a long workday? There was nothing in the area. I constantly escaped to cooler places downtown. And then I discovered Les Halles. A French bistro on Park Avenue South, just two blocks from my apartment. It featured a butcher shop, it was madly dark, and its waiters were sullen. The menu, in quintessential French fashion, was totally overloaded with items like foie gras, steak and pork, which wasn’t ideal for my vegetarian self. But it had charm, a je ne sais quoi. It felt like Paris in New York.
So 411 Park Avenue is where I parked myself on many a night. Les Halles became my go-to joint. It helped that it served superb pommes frites (so much chicer than saying French fries). And since I was in my early 20s, I could eat all the frites in the world. The chef was a guy called Anthony Bourdain. He would sometimes appear from the kitchen and walk around. My friend and I didn’t pay him much attention, engrossed as we were in our own lives and worlds. I wish we had. I wish I hadn’t been so oblivious and had struck up a conversation.
Later, I read The New Yorker piece that shot him to fame and was angry at his outspoken contempt of vegetarians. In it, he described us thus: “Vegetarians, and their Hezbollah-like splinter-faction, the vegans, are a persistent irritant to any chef worth a damn. To me, life without veal stock, pork fat, sausage, organ meat, demi-glace, or even stinky cheese is a life not worth living. Vegetarians are the enemy of everything good and decent in the human spirit, an affront to all I stand for, the pure enjoyment of food.”
I thought to myself that this guy obviously had no idea about the rich vegetarian culinary tradition of India nor, for that matter, of the Buddhist cuisine found across Asia. I was one of those “irritants” at Les Halles about whom he said: “I’ll rummage around for something to feed them, for a ‘vegetarian plate’... fourteen dollars for a few slices of grilled eggplant and zucchini suits my food cost fine.”
Eventually, I stopped going to Les Halles. I didn’t read his bestseller, Kitchen Confidential, because what was the point of reading a guy who was going to berate my ilk? But later, I started watching his show. It was a revelation. He had redeemed himself in my eyes by calling out a man who should’ve been made accountable for his actions and never was. That man was Henry Kissinger and this is what Bourdain wrote about him in his 2001 book, A Cook’s Tour: “Once you’ve been to Cambodia, you’ll never stop wanting to beat Henry Kissinger to death with your bare hands. You will never again be able to open a newspaper and read about that treacherous, prevaricating, murderous scumbag sitting down for a nice chat with Charlie Rose or attending some black-tie affair for a new glossy magazine without choking. Witness what Henry did in Cambodia — the fruits of his genius for statesmanship — and you will never understand why he’s not sitting in the dock at The Hague next to Milošević.” After that, I loved Anthony Bourdain. He will be missed.
This fortnightly column tracks the indulgent pursuits of the one-percenters.

What’s cooking in Jonathan’s kitchen "," When it rained like doomsday here earlier this week, my only prayer was that my drive to Jonathan’s Kitchen (JK) doesn’t make me regret it. After an eternity — a long drive, during which all I could think of was a foot massage, I am was offered a refreshing gin and tonic. A sip later, I feel I was ready for the food, no sooner did I think, out came baked Brie coated with pistachio and almond dust. I was too hungry to care about dying from the Brie overload so I went straight ahead and carved out a generous portion and put it in my mouth. If you love cheese, you will definitely love this one; stringy, soft and warm, with the perfect feel in the mouth. The nut-dust coat adds the crunchy bite allowing a bite to the gooey cheese.




Jonathan’s Kitchen is not a new place. Nor is the chef, nor one of the investors called Jonathan — and Jonathan’s Kitchen doesn’t just serve western food. If you want a selection of Indian and Asian, apart from the steaks and burgers, at Jonathan’s kitchen that too is made.
To set the mood for the fuzzy monsoon evenings, the chef has decided to make changes in the menu. Some of these are better versions of bar food and definitely worth considering for binge eating.




Those who love spicy Indianised Asian, should try the chilli fish. I would recommend it with or without a drink. It is spicy enough to conjure up some sweat on your hairline and still not give up on it. Want to raise the bar? Take a bite of the bird-eye chilli with which the fish is garnished.




Personally, I wasn’t sure what was kept for the tasting session, so I went overboard with the fish and still couldn’t refuse the fried soft-shell crabs which I ate effortlessly and heartily.
Then came sushi and it vanished faster than it appeared from the kitchen. The spacious interiors of the restaurant makes one feel very comfortable inside. The ‘no fuss’ interiors make it even easier to make your way to the lavish buffet if one is opting for such a spread.




Apart from the interiors, JK has menu that will caters to a wide variety of diners. Their steaks are popular for the selection of meat and its quality. The seafood selection at JK is worth the drive and if you are in the mood for a lavish Asian meal, then a must-try is the Masamam curry with sticky rice.
Chef is also very proud to say that their menu lays stress on veg selection and it was a welcome to see paneer wasn’t the focus in the veg section.
What's a meal like without desserts? Can’t really say, because the chocolate mousse wasn't something that could be refused. After one spoon of the sticky-gooey dessert, there was nothing more to think about.

‘Surgery in a pill’ may help treat diabetes: study ","Scientists have developed a less invasive and effective treatment for reversing type 2 diabetes, one that can offer the same benefits as surgery.
In a study published in the journal Nature Materials, researchers administered an oral agent in rats to deliver a substance that could temporarily coat the intestine to prevent nutrient contact with the lining in the proximal bowel and avoid post-meal spikes in blood sugar.
“We envision a pill that a patient can take before a meal that transiently coats the gut to replicate the effects of surgery,” said Jeff Karp from Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH) in the US. “Over the last several years, we have been working with our surgical colleagues on this idea and have developed a material that meets an important clinical need.”
Over the last decade, bariatric surgeons have made strides in performing weight loss surgery that not only reverses obesity but can also reverse type 2 diabetes in patients with both conditions. Despite dramatic improvements in quality of life and diabetes remission, the number of patients who pursue surgery remains relatively low, researchers said.
They searched for a starting material that would have just the right properties to adhere to the small intestine and then dissolve within a matter of hours. The researchers selected a substance known as sucralfate, an approved drug in the US that is used in the treatment of gastrointestinal ulcers. The team further engineered the substance into a novel material that can coat the lining of the intestine without requiring activation by gastric acid.
The engineered compound, referred to as LuCI (Luminal Coating of the Intestine), can be made into a dry powdered form that can be encapsulated as a pill.
“What we have developed here is essentially, ‘surgery in a pill,’” said Yuhan Lee, a materials scientist in the BWH. “We have used a bioengineering approach to formulate a pill that has good adhesion properties and can attach nicely to the gut in a preclinical model. And after a couple of hours, its effects dissipate.”
The team found that once in the intestine of rats, LuCI can coat the gut, forming a thin barrier that alters nutrient contact and lowers blood glucose response after a meal. After a meal, blood sugar levels rise and can stay elevated over time. However, one hour after LuCI was administered to the rats, the response to glucose was lowered by 47 per cent. The team found that this response was temporary, and after three hours, the effect essentially disappeared.
The team is now testing the effect of short- and long-term use of LuCI in diabetic and obese rodent models. They also plan to advance some of their pilot studies showing that LuCI can be used to deliver drugs, including proteins directly to the gastrointestinal tract.

Mommy knows best
"," When Sharmila Ribeiro decided to cut back on work-related travels to focus on her and her family’s health and diet, she was just looking out for her pack. Today, she sees that decision as a positive trigger point, that soon snowballed into her book Everyday Love: A Mother’s Guide to Healthy Cooking for Kids winning the Family Cookbook category at the Gourmand World Cookbook Awards Conference, 2018 in China.
Back in India after the ceremony, Ribeiro is gushing, and not just about the award. “I had written this book primarily for parents. But kids these days are cooking a lot, and many of them are using my recipes, which is wonderful,” she says over phone.

So what is it that sets this book apart? It’s very raison d’etre has been spoken and written about quite a bit, for a publication that is barely six months old, but the author explains it again. “I quit my travels five years ago, and started de-junking my kitchen. All the stuff that you buy — from muesli and peanut butter to things we need for our traditional meals — we started making at home. The health benefits were huge,” she says. The shift in lifestyle wasn’t easy, and Ribeiro took her time with it. She soon began documenting her attempts, because it occurred to her that this cause wasn’t hers alone. “All mothers and all schools struggle with this: how to pack a lunch that is healthy, and that kids will be willing to eat,” she points out. Thus began a long series of testing, tasting and even photography sessions, all with the aim of making these recipes publishable and more accessible.
Ribeiro also insists that this shift in lifestyle isn’t just for families. Single, working people can adopt these just as well, “All it takes is prepping. If you prep on the weekends and plan ahead, it really helps with healthy eating.” The book is a testament to the growing market there is for slow, healthy food options. It is also a testament to the fact that not all self-published books are necessarily below par. Ribeiro says she never approached a publisher with her work; self-publishing was her go-to choice for a reason. “I have a nephew who is a photographer. With him, I could play with the design and bring out the book the way I wanted. The look of the book was very important to me: it had to be appealing.” 
So Ribeiro and her team handled everything from layout to printing. “The book was off the press on November 9, 2017, and the deadline for entries for the contest was November 15,” she says. The team had to dispatch a copy fresh off the press, though the book was formally released only in December 2017. The effort, though, was clearly worth it.

Sitanadi's hotel Srisathyanarayana USP is its 'neer dose'
","Driving from Mangaluru towards Shimoga after the Southwest monsoon sets in is a joy difficult to describe. The entire route has been washed clean by the first spell of rains, and there’s greenery everywhere. It is not without reason that Agumbe is called the Cherrapunji of the South; it rains or drizzles almost through the year. Roll down the windows and take in the sights and sounds of acres of pristine Agumbe rainforest. Less than two kilometres before you begin the ascent to the view point, is a place where many a devotee of food worships.
Soon after crossing the lovely village of Sitanadi, on the left, is Hotel Srisathyanarayana, which can seat about 40. It takes time to spot the board: the calling card being cars and motorbikes parked in front. Behind the hotel flows Sitanadi river, known for its rafting facilities. Monkeys play hide-and-seek in the vast network of trees and friendly dogs wait for a morsel from a generous guest.




Since July 1975, when H Subraya Shenoy started the eatery in the midst of heavy rains, the hotel has been quietly charming visitors with its USP — neer dose, a lacey rice crepe, served with a watery but delicious chutney and Konkani-style sambar. Of course, it serves idli (₹28 for three), idli-uddina vade (₹32) and golibajje (₹20 for 6), avalakki mosaru (₹25), spiced beaten rice served with sugar and curd, and Mangalore buns (₹28 for two), but the neer dose (₹25 for three) wins hands down.
Travellers’ favourite
I first read about the restaurant in a blog where a group of bikers raved about its neer dose. Since then, it’s a regular stop during the four-hour drive to Shimoga.
There was a time when the senior Shenoy saw sales of just ₹75 a day; today, the hotel draws about 300 people on an average every day, and some more during the weekend. Anil Shenoy, who runs it now with help from his wife Amrutha, children Advith and Adithi, and mother Vijayalakshmi, has retained most of the dishes his father began the eatery with. What’s gone out is poori-sagu, regular dose and afternoon meals.




There was a time when this was one of the very few hotels on this stretch. Anil remembers merchants placing orders in advance and knocking on the door at 2 am to eat something before hitting the road again, carrying vegetables to places far away.
The hotel opens its doors at 7.30 am and closes by 9.30 pm. If the food gets over, the family quickly fries up some jackfruit happala and serves it with coffee or tea. On an average, they grind about nine kilograms of rice every day for the dose alone, and, make chutney one coconut at a time. “This place is also humid. You can’t grind in bulk and wonder whether it is fresh or not. Our guests are mostly travellers, and so we prefer grinding small batches, frequently, to ensure the well-being of those who eat here,” says Anil. The sambar is a non-spicy affair, just the kind you make at home. If you get lucky, are hungry and there’s nothing left on the menu, Amrutha sometimes serves you the family’s breakfast. We got to sample pundi (steamed balls of broken rice) served with sprouts gassi.
Backyard treasures
The coconut primarily comes from the garden behind the spacious home, as do the jackfruits they soak in brine or process into papads. The hotel has a section where it sells traditional Malnad and Mangalore delicacies, such as papads made of beaten rice, banana stem or bitter gourd.




Anil permits us entry into the kitchen, and it is a trip back in time. The smoky walls speak of the thousands of breakfasts and lunches cooked here. Many of the vessels still being used have been handed down by the senior Shenoy and his ancestors. As we walk in, a vat of oil sizzles with the air-like golibajje that Amrutha has just spooned in. It emerges a minute later, golden and crisp on the outside.
And then, it is time for evening tiffin. The clock shows 6.45 pm, and all those who stayed back at Agumbe, for the sunset view of the panoramic valley, head down for a snack before taking the highway home.
Amrutha and her mother-in-law send out plate after plate of golibajje, as Adithi serves chutney by the spoonful. In between, a batch of buns, crisp on the outside and sweet and spongy inside, is ordered.
Soon, the parked cars drive out and new ones find their spots. All for a taste of food that’s healthy, and local.
In this weekly column, we take a peek at some of the country’s most iconic restaurants.

Only 12 per cent of city-dwellers breathe safe air, says WHO
","Only 12 per cent of the people living in cities for which air quality data is available, are breathing “safe” air, reveals World Health Organization’s Urban Air Quality database.
About half urban population being monitored is exposed to air pollution that is at least 2.5 times higher than the levels recommended by the WHO, putting those people at additional risk of serious, long-term health problems.
According to the WHO, air quality in most cities worldwide that monitor outdoor (ambient) air pollution fails to meet the organisation’s guidelines for safe levels.
WHO’s Urban Air Quality database that covers 1,600 cities across 91 countries has revealed that more cities worldwide are monitoring outdoor air quality, reflecting growing recognition of air pollution’s health risks. More than 120 Indian cities, including Delhi, Mumbai, Ahmedabad, Agra and Varanasi also figure in the list of cities with high pollution levels.
In most cities where there is enough data to compare the situation today with previous years, air pollution is getting worse. The factors contribute to this increase are reliance on fossil fuels such as coal-fired power plants, private transport motor vehicles, inefficient use of energy in buildings and the use of biomass for cooking and heating.
But some cities are making notable improvements, demonstrating that air quality can be improved by implementing policy measures such as banning the use of coal for “space heating” in buildings, using renewable or “clean” fuel for electricity production and improving efficiency of motor vehicle engines.
The latest available data have prompted WHO to call for greater awareness of health risks caused by air pollution, implementation of effective air pollution mitigation policies and close monitoring of the situation in cities worldwide.
In April 2014, WHO issued new information estimating that outdoor air pollution was responsible for deaths of some 3.7 million people under the age of 60 in 2012. The organization also emphasised that indoor and outdoor air pollution together are among the largest risks to health worldwide.
Measurement of fine particulate matter of 2.5 micrometers or less in diameter (PM2.5) is considered to be the best indicator of the level of health risks from air pollution.
In high-income countries, 816 cities reported on PM2.5 levels with another 544 cities reporting on PM10, from which estimates of PM2.5 can be derived.

Buzz your anxiety away
","Anxiety is a natural response created by your body to deal with situations of stress and tension. Though we don’t need to fight for survival now, the primitive part of our brain still considers life situations like deadlines, insecurity, financial woes, pain as threats to our continued existence and responds accordingly. Your heartbeat increases, breath becomes short and rapid, the adrenalin coursing through your blood diverts circulation from your vital organs to the limbs and your blood pressure increases — thus preparing you to fight or run as required.
Depending on your mental and emotional state, sometimes these natural responses don’t turn off, keeping you in a perpetual state of stress and ill-health. This manifests as nail-biting, teeth-grinding, short temper, breathlessness, high blood pressure, poor sleep and loss of appetite and libido. Yogic practices soothe the nervous system to calm you down and reverse the punishing effects of anxiety. The following is a simple practice where you mimic the buzzing of a bee to release the tension in your system. The action of creating sound also gives you a vocal vent to channel your stress — it is like shouting but in a healthier manner.

Bramhari Pranayama


(Humming Bee Breath)

Sit on a chair with your back straight, relax your shoulders and bring your chin parallel to the floor.
Close your eyes and take a few deep breaths.
Use your index fingers to close your ear flaps.
Part your teeth gently and keep your lips together.
Bring your attention to the center of the forehead.
Inhale deeply and as you exhale create a steady, smooth humming sound — like a bee.
Pay attention to the effect of the sound on your skull and face.
This is one round. Do up to 15 rounds.
Sip on water if your throat gets dry.

Pecking on Peking duck
","A restaurant which is quite popular for its food as well as for its ambience is The China Kitchen at Hyatt Regency New Delhi. I would suggest making reservations in advance as the restaurant is packed even on a Monday. It’s wooden flooring and separate seating arrangements give the feel of a private dining room.
The reason for my visit this time is the launch of the new menu which has changed after a gap of six years. It now has more options for vegetarians though I feel it hardly makes a difference as the patrons at The China Kitchen still visit it to taste the kung paos and the Peking duck on offer.
Nothing better than a bowl of soup to start with when you are at an Asian restaurant. I order my seafood dumpling soup and it comes to my table pretty quickly. The piping hot soup is flavourful, has that perfect aroma of seafood which I just love. Though a pinch more of the seasonings would make it even better.
The hot soup is followed by a refreshing cold buckwheat noodle. Chilli sesame oil and vinegar give the noodles a subtle flavour which I enjoy till the last bit. Worth a mention is its colourful presentation.
The Chinese cucumber salad with some peanuts, however, is unexpectedly not up to the mark to be incorporated in a niche menu. Peking duck, one of the signature dishes, is still done in perfection here and tastes delicious. Honey chicken onion puff, a baked dish, is awesome too. A very tasty and yummy puff with the perfect crispness to complement the stuffing. Seeing the steam wafting from the huge steamer inspires me to have a platter of dim sums. Prawn siew mai to start with is nice but the batter is not at par and even the prawn is a tad dry. The vegetable dumpling with celery and mushroom stuffing is tasty. I miss my favourite har gao in the menu and satisfy the craving with a shrimp dumpling in a spicy vinegar broth.
For the main course, pepper crab, kung pao with some udon noodles and fried rice form a wholesome combination. The crab and noodles are good but the kung pao is disappointing. The sauce lacks the sticky texture and even the combination of sweet and sour flavours. I sign off for the day with a dessert platter containing a mi fresh fruits, crispy rolls, mango pudding and scoops of ice cream.

Meal for two: Rs. 6000 plus taxes

Kudos, chef Massimo
"," Osteria Francescana in Modena has just been declared the world’s best restaurant.
The annual San Pellegrino World’s 50 Best Restaurants, unveiled in Bilbao this week, moved legendary Italian chef Massimo Bottura’s restaurant’s back to No 1 (it topped the list in 2016 as well, before moving to No 2 in 2017), displacing last year’s winner, Daniel Humm’s Eleven Madison Park. Besides his iconic restaurant, Chef Massimo founded the non-profit association Food for Soul in 2016, to take on the challenge of food waste.
Which is why I was determined to find a way to work with him. Following short stints at various hotels in India since I was in Class X, and later as part of my Culinary Arts degree, I made up my mind to stage at Osteria Francescana (a stage is an unpaid internship when you work in a chef’s kitchen to learn new techniques). It took nearly a year’s perseverance of studying, working on my skills and applications. I am not sure what worked, but I finally managed to bag a place at the most coveted kitchen in the world.




I spent the summer of 2017 with Osteria Francescana, learning from Chef Massimo. His style is clean and minimal: his philosophy, to make every dish taste better than your grandmother’s cooking. He understands how to respect the past, even while appreciating the present. At the first chance I got, I asked him the secret to his success. He said, ‘I wake up and then go to bed. And in between I do what I love to do.”
A peek at the pinnacle
Osteria Francescana has 12 tables, which can accommodate 28 to 30 people. There is just one service for lunch and one for dinner. (The 10-course tasting menu is €250, almost ₹20,000 per head.) Reservations are done online and guests wait for up to six months for a place at the table.
At Osteria, everyone is an equal, everyone is family. I worked alongside cooks and kitchen staff from Canada, Mexico, Italy, Japan and Bangladesh. And we all participated when it was time to clean up. 
I worked at the prep kitchen and quickly learnt that no dish on the menu is easy. There are a lot of components to each, hence the dedicated prep kitchen located right across the street. I was put in all the sections, and taught all the dishes on the menu, including Chef Massimo’s celebrated dessert ‘Oops I dropped the lemon tart’, fresh miniature tortellini and his famous ‘Caesar salad in bloom’.
The prep kitchen made the staff meal: pizza on Fridays and pasta everyday. We always had great music playing in the kitchen, from pop to metal to classical Italian, it changed depending on who was in charge of the playlist. On my day, I made them listen to Hindi music: Guru Randhawa’s ‘Tenu suit, suit karda’ (they loved it!). We played soccer on the street between the main kitchen and the prep kitchen in our spare time. It was especially fun when Chef Massimo joined in: he loves playing soccer. Chef taught us that it is important to work at a place that makes you happy. That helps you absorb everything like a sponge. He’s a genius when he gets down to cooking. Like everyone else on the team, he is in the kitchen at 9.30 am. He likes pin-drop silence when plating a dish; and is like an artist when experimenting with a new menu.
The bigger picture
Massimo says chefs have a responsibility not only to the paying guests, but also to the communities to help improve the food systems for everyone, through education and through action.




“I have a curious mind and I have always been a restless child. I have matured but I will never really grow up,” I remember him telling me, when I asked him for advice for a budding chef. He taught me never to be fearful of ideas. He said it’s okay to be confused when you are thinking of choosing a cuisine or marrying ingredients.
Chef Massimo always says that chefs need to live the everyday routine without getting lost in it. 
“That’s the sign of a good chef,” he shared, “Don’t forget to put in your best; your knives should be sharpened at any given time; respect your chef uniform, travel to learn, read, be humble and remember who you are and where you come from, have a sportsman spirit, never forget to help others when you can, and last but not least, be a citizen of the world.”

The resurgence of cognac, a once stuffy drink
"," When Bureau National Interprofessionnel du Cognac’s suggestion of a minimum of 10 years’ ageing for cognacs came into effect, Christophe Valtaud was unfazed. 
“Since 1715, the House of Martell has always crafted the finest cognacs with passion and generosity,” says the cellar master via email, “Martell Cordon Bleu and Martell XO are no exceptions. This new regulation doesn’t affect Martell XO cognacs in any way, as they are already blended with 10YO and above eaux-de-vie.”
Having said that, Valtaud does acknowledge a steady demographic shift in the customer base of this high-end brandy variant. 
“The days of the cliché cognac drinkers are long gone. It is no more reserved to cigar smokers curling up next to a roaring fire while casually swirling a snifter of the amber-coloured liquor. The Indian discerning consumer has started to experiment with their taste buds, and is now trying new drinks beyond the regular beers and whiskies.”
The change, he adds, is a global one, as younger and younger folk are gravitating towards it. Needless to say, the drinkers are causing a shift in drinking style as well. 
“It can be mixed with quality mixers, such as soda or traditional lemonade, to make a long drink, or used to make a cocktail,” points out the cellar master, not particularly disturbed by this reclamation of what was originally a gentleman’s drink with a somewhat stuffy image. “There is a younger audience that does not mind having Martell VS & VSOP with cocktails or on the rocks, while a more mature drinker savours his Martell XO neat.”
“We have seen a clear trend shift in Cognac drinking patterns, and the social drinking patterns in general in India and across the world,” he says, “Globally, we find that consumers are becoming much more knowledgeable about cognac and this trend is being followed by the well-travelled Indian drinker as well.”
How to begin
If Valtaud is to be believed, Cognac manufacturers like Martell are embracing this shift, and are more than happy to aid young experimenters. In fact, he has a slew of suggestions ready.
“The best way to introduce cognac to a novice drinker would be to start with an accessible cognac tasting of three different cognacs — Martell Noblige, Cordon Bleu and Martell XO — leading your guests from the lighter to the more intense tasting cognacs,” he begins.
“Of course, mixology is also a very good way to introduce cognac to youngsters, through exciting cocktails or long drinks, mixing cognac with tonic, ginger ale or green tea for example.” 
“At Martell of course, we prefer our Cognac is tasted in a way that reveals all its authenticity and complexity. But the true richness of our House is the mingling of cultures, and we understand, respect and valorise the diversity of ways to enjoy our cognac.”

Kodaikanal’s Pastry Corner is a snacker’s delight "," A warning first. Bring along a lot of patience to sustain you until it is your turn to order at Pastry Corner in the busy bazaar area of Kodaikanal. 
No matter what time of the day it is, this unassuming shop, on congested Old Post Office Road, brims with people. Just 10x10 sq ft in size, it is perhaps the most visited corner in this touristy hill station. Here, orders for super-delicious bakery items keep buzzing at the counter and the service matches the speed with which items disappear off the shelf. Customers seem to know what they want and it means a majority of them are not first-timers. They also gauge that once inside the shop, there is not an inch of space to turn, twist or even wait. 
In spite of this, proprietor Prasanna Ghosh appears calm. His customers leave smiling after grabbing quick bites of freshly-baked goodies. Ghosh and his small team work to ensure this small haven, filled with aromatic oven products, is the most reliable go-to place. 
The popular bakery remains open between 10 am and 2 pm, and from 3 pm to 6.30 pm, with wholesome loaves of bread, fluffy and buttery fresh-cream pastries and cakes. 




It is impossible to just walk past the alluring aroma of freshly-baked items wafting over the counters or ignore the beckoning of deliciously displayed croissants, cup cakes, cookies and brownies, besides pizza with grated cheese and tomatoes. 
“All our products are without colours, preservatives or additives, and hence are perishable. We tell our customers to consume everything on the same day,” says Ghosh, who takes pride in the fact that only word-of-mouth brings him new customers and returns the old. 
Ghosh and his sister Meenakshi started with baking 30 loaves of open top breads daily. “We had a fixed order from a school and the rest we supplied to individual homes,” recalls Ghosh. The brother-sister duo called their product ‘The Daily Bread’ and sustained themselves for six years from 1985. In 1991, they set up a small shop on Seven Roads and shifted to the present location two years ago and gave it the present name. 
Daily grind 
Fresh batches of the items are prepared twice a day. Ghosh is liberal in offering free samples for tasting to his customers. “It is my small treat to them. Our customers are fond of us,” says Ghosh, who also explains to those interested about the various flavours and tastes of the goodies he offers and what goes into making them.
He is happy with the limited selection he offers at an affordable price. “It is not in my capacity to go big. I don’t want to push myself further. I am happy that people are able to differentiate the taste from what is available in the market and keep coming back to us.” 
At Pastry Corner, a mini jumbo 500 gm loaf of white or wholewheat bread sells for ₹35, and the 400 gm loaf comes for ₹30. All types of pastries come at ₹35, while items like brownie, cream and cinnamon rolls, egg sandwich, veg roll and veg puff, besides tea and filter coffee, are priced at ₹15 each.
Natural ice creams
Eighteen years ago, Ghosh introduced melt-in-your-mouth natural ice creams, made with fresh seasonal fruit. The favourites are plum, mango, pineapple, pear, sapota and butterscotch. He gets raw fruit from Dindigul and ripens them naturally for a month at home, to make organic ice cream. He started by selling a scoop for ₹15 and almost sounds apologetic for raising the price to ₹20 six months ago.
“Nowhere else will you get healthy, organic stuff at such a price,” says Pandiyan, his trusted staffer of 17 years.
Many customers vouch for the quality of the snacks here. “I owe a lot to our local suppliers and celebrate the local produce and the craft of baking,” says Ghosh. You will find him on his toes all day, chatting up with customers, slicing bread with a flair and going around with trays of hot tea and coffee for customers gathered on the platform outside his shop.




The best part about the cakes and ice creams is that they are not overly sweet and allow you to appreciate the ingredients and textures. Despite the rush, it is not easy to resist what arrives freshly baked from the factory.
Ghosh recalls that he was always fond of bread that came out fresh from the oven daily at 3.30 pm, when he was studying in Kodai International School. The fragrance of the long-fermented bread was delicious, and he realised it was not available outside. 
His sister as a Home Economics student learnt to bake from an American teacher, while Ghosh self-trained with the help of local bakers. His sincerity to keep improving and improvising has today earned him a name for his authentic doughnuts, mango spice tarts and mango marmalade. 
“I love to experiment with intriguing flavours,” beams the baker, as his hands deftly change the flavour of his cakes to surprise his customers.

Southern spice "," Chef Ramachandran smiles when we ask him how he became a chef. “I used to spend all my free time learning to cook from my mother, grandmother and neighbours.” The shy, soft-spoken chef, who only speaks when prodded is in the city on a work visit. He’s come to Mumbai on loan from Taj Gateway Bengaluru’s landmark restaurant – Karavalli for a Syrian Christian Kerala pop-up. 
When asked about the pop-up’s speciality food, he explains that Malayali Syriac Christians from Kerala trace their origins to the arrival of Saint Thomas in Kerala circa 52 AD. Thomas’s evangelical activity gradually led to significant number of high class Brahmins taking to Christianity. Syrian Christian food is a confluence of the east and west — while their food is robust with Kerala spices including cardamom, cinnamon, cloves, black pepper and kokum, the cuisine also incorporates western techniques like roasting and steaming.
Spice kitchen
 Our first palate cleanser is the good old rasam, which is spiked with tamarind, black pepper, and tangy tomatoes, the spices hit the throat, clearing every clog instantly.
For starters, we get Vazhapoo cutlet (₹850) patties made of banana flour and sweet potato mash topped with a spicy tomato chutney; Urulai roast (₹850) has marinated baby potatoes tossed in a sweet and spicy onions and tomato mush and Kozhi Roast (₹1,250), a peppery chicken kebab tossed in onion and brown spices. The roast has a touch of cooling saunf. The cuisine uses dry, shredded coconut as well as coconut milk, and a generous dose of curry leaves that beautifully balances the sweet and sour. There’s also a Portuguese influence that can be seen in the use of toddy to ferment dishes. The main course, is Avial (₹950) creamy yogurt and coconut curry, seasonal vegetables like parwal and aubergines, finished in green chillies and cumin. The Taarav Roast (₹2150), a dry preparation of duck with black pepper and onions, has a touch of jaggery gives every dish a sweet relish, to calm the fire of the red chillies. While our appams are too dry, the flaky Malabar parottas and rice and coconut kallapams (pancakes) pair well with the dishes. The mean moilee, a rich creamy milky gravy is perfect for a rainy day.
Sweet notes
 Dessert is homestyle Ila ada (₹600) steamed rice flour cakes stuffed with grated coconut and jaggery. The rice flour coating is too chewy. A kokum sorbet with a topping of coconut cream, turns out to be a lighter and more enjoyable dessert. 
As the two flavours melt, the dessert evolves in taste, the sour and sweet forming a dual rhapsody on our palate. We also appreciate the warmth of Ada pradhaman (₹600), which has fat rice flakes slow-cooked in thick and creamy coconut milk and jaggery. This is that dreamy dessert that makes you crave more. Since it’s made with jaggery, it makes us less guilty when we help ourselves to seconds.
The Karavalli Pop-up – Exploring the Epicurean Legacy of Syrian Christian Cuisine is ongoing until July 27 at Masala Bay, Taj Land’s End, Bandra

Overcoming the blues
","Reports of designer and businesswoman Kate Spade’s suicide and struggle with depression have transformed her from a symbol of polished prep to a blunt reminder that suffering affects all types. A few days later we woke up to the news that another beloved figure, Anthony Bourdain, had taken his life.
These two tragedies have inspired hundreds to tweet some version of the same message: Mental illness is nothing to be ashamed of.
Extending a hand
But deep in the comment threads, some have also been debating a more uncomfortable question: What do you do when a friend is depressed for such a long time that you’ve started to feel that that nothing you can do will make a difference, and your empathy reserves are tapped out? There are no easy answers. But here are some tips from experts.
Don’t underestimate the power of showing up: You may not feel that your presence is wanted. But just being by the side of someone who is depressed, and reminding her that she is special to you, is important to ensuring that she does not feel alone, says Dr. Norman Rosenthal, a clinical professor of psychiatry at Georgetown University School of Medicine, U.S.
If she acknowledges she’s depressed, that’s a good sign, says Dr. Rosenthal. He recalled the story of a patient who stopped feeling suicidal after telling people he was close to how he was feeling.
“When you shine the light on the shame, it gets better,” Dr. Rosenthal says.
Don’t try to cheer him up or offer advice: Your brother has an enviable job and two lovely children. He’s still ridiculously handsome even though he hasn’t gone to the gym for six months. It’s tempting to want to remind him of all these good things.
Not only is that unlikely to boost his mood, it could backfire by reinforcing his sense that you just don’t get it, says Megan Devine, a psychotherapist and the author of It’s O.K. That You’re Not O.K.
“Your job as a support person is not to cheer people up. It’s to acknowledge that it sucks right now, and their pain exists,” she says.
Instead of upbeat rebuttals about why it’s not so bad, she recommends trying something like, “It sounds like life is really overwhelming for you right now.”
If you want to say something positive, focus on highlighting what he means to you, Dr. Rosenthal advises. And though offering suggestions for how to improve his life will be tempting, simply listening is better.
It’s O.K. to ask if she is having suicidal thoughts: Lots of people struggle with depression without ever considering suicide. But depression is often a factor.
Although you may worry that asking, “Are you thinking about killing yourself?” will insult someone you’re trying to help — or worse, encourage her to go in that direction — experts say the opposite is true.
“It’s important to know you can’t trigger suicidal thinking just by asking about it,” says Allen Doederlein, the executive vice president of external affairs at the Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance. If the answer is yes, it’s crucial that you calmly ask when and how; it’s much easier to help prevent a friend from hurting herself if you know the specifics.
Take any mention of death seriously: Even when a person with depression casually mentions death or suicide, it’s important to ask follow-up questions. If the answers don’t leave you feeling confident that a depressed person is safe, experts advise involving a professional as soon as possible. If this person is seeing a psychiatrist or therapist, get him or her on the phone.
If that’s not an option, have the person you’re worried about call a suicide prevention line or take her to the hospital emergency room; say aloud that this is what one does when a loved one’s life is in danger.
In some cases, calling a helpline may be the best option. If you do, ask for a crisis intervention team, Mr. Doederlein urges.
But remember that interactions with law enforcement can vary wildly, depending on race and socio-economic background. In cases where you’re concerned that calling police could put a person in danger, try to come up with an alternate plan in advance.
Make getting to that first appointment as easy as possible: You alone cannot fix this problem, no matter how patient and loving you are. A severely depressed friend needs professional assistance from a psychologist, psychiatrist, social worker or another medical professional.
Yeah, you know. You’ve told your boyfriend this, but it’s been months — or maybe even years — and he still has not set anything up.
“You can’t control someone else’s recovery,” says Kimberly Williams, president and chief executive of the Mental Health Association of New York City. But you can try to make getting to that first appointment as easy as possible.
That might mean sitting next to your friend as he calls to make the appointment, finding counselling that he can afford, or even going with him that first time, if you’re comfortable with it.
What if you’re not sure whether you should start with a therapist or a psychiatrist, or whether you’ve found the perfect person? Ask around for recommendations, and know that one practitioner may ultimately lead to another.
But don’t overthink it. The key initially is just getting a professional involved so you are not the only person managing this situation. (That said, if that first appointment seems really unhelpful, trust your instincts and find someone else.)
Take care of yourself and set boundaries: When the thoughtful and kind people we’ve loved for years are depressed, they may also become uncharacteristically mean and self-centred. It’s exhausting, painful and hard to know how to respond when they pick fights or send nasty texts.
“You don’t have to attend every argument you are invited to,” Ms. Devine says.
Still, just because someone is depressed is not a reason to let their abusive behaviour slide. Set clear boundaries with straightforward language such as, “It sounds like you’re in a lot of pain right now. But you can’t call me names.”
Similarly you may find that your friend’s demands on your time are starting to sabotage other relationships or your job. You’re not going to be able to help if you’re not in a good place yourself.
It’s O.K. not to be available 24x7, but try to be explicit about when you can and cannot help. One way to do this, Ms. Devine advises, is to say: “I know you’ve been really struggling a lot, and I really want to be here for you. There are times that I physically can’t do that.”
Come up with a contingency plan and kindly push her to stick with it. Coming up with a consistent schedule for when you’ll see each other every week can be helpful to you both.
Remember, people do recover from depression
It can be hard when you’re in the middle of the storm with a depressed friend to remember that there was a time before, and hopefully an after, this miserable state. But it’s essential to remind yourself — and the person you’re trying to help — that people do emerge from depression. Because they do.
I have seen it. Every single one of the experts quoted here has seen it, too. But it will take patience and time. NY TIMES

A hearty experience at Diggin
","It was a bright and sunny day and we had a lunch date with a dear friend and a much loved niece. We had to decide where we were going to eat. The friend is adventurous about food but her daughter – the afore-mentioned much loved niece, henceforth to be referred to as MLN – is not. We know she likes pasta and vegetables, so we suggested that we meet at Diggin in the Santushti Complex.
Alert readers will recall that I’d had a great meal some years ago at Diggin in Anand Lok. I loved the place not just for its food but for the funky and cheerful décor. It was humming with joy and was brightly lit.
The new Diggin at Santushti is equally charming. There is an open air sitting area and the restaurant indoors is nice and cosy. You get a warm feeling in Diggin and I suppose that has something to do with the smiling and helpful staff and the very happy bistro-like interiors.
I looked at the menu and found that it had many of the dishes that the old Diggin is known for. I remember I was really happy with my first meal there – which was an all-pork affair.
A leopard doesn’t change its spots and a pork lover sticks to what he loves – in one word, pork. I found what I wanted the moment I opened the menu – an all pork sandwich (₹455). My wife asked for a ham and cheese sandwich (₹425), the friend ordered a pan-seared river sole (₹565) and the MLN wanted fettuccini pesto (415).




Generous helping
The helpings were huge, and the food was delicious. My sandwich was superb, packed as it was with bacon, ham and pork sausages. It came with fries and a side salad. I had a bite from the ham-and-Swiss cheese sandwich, too, and found it cheesy-gooey and filled with ham. The friend enjoyed the fish, which came in a tangy lime sauce with a green salad on the side. And the MLN loved her pine nut-filled pasta so much that she was uncharacteristically quiet while she ate.
We ended the meal with a smooth and chocolaty tiramisu that we shared, and cups of hot cappuccino. We would have liked to have dawdled over our coffee but people were queuing up. We had booked a table in advance and would advise everybody to do so, too.
Diggin has some special dishes of the day, which are mentioned on a blackboard outside the restaurant. I think they had some grilled rosemary chicken the day we were there.
The salad section has quite a few dishes that actually make you want to go off entrées. They have, for instance, a smoked salmon salad, a citrus chicken salad and an artichoke, baby corn and fennel salad. The vegetarian pizza section has toppings of artichoke and mushroom; goat cheese and grilled vegetables and there’s something called a farmer’s fresh veg pizza. But I know what I want – it’s called porky pizza, and consists of mozzarella cheese, pepperoni, ham, bacon and salami.
But that will be after a while. Right now I have to tend to a heart that has been misbehaving and arteries that don’t want to forget the rich food I had been eating all these years. But one day, soon, I shall say oink to the porky pizza.

Increasing cases of chickenpox, measles surface
","The sultry weather has brought with it an increasing number of cases of chickenpox, measles and viral fever among children.
State-run hospitals in the city are receiving at least three cases of viral infection daily. Some private hospitals and clinics have also reported high incidence of such infections. However, it is not an outbreak, and the disease has not reached alarming levels, said doctors.
According to doctors, most cases are going unreported because of the superstitious beliefs followed by some parents who feel that the infection in their child is because of the “blessings of a goddess”.
At the State-run Indira Gandhi Institute of Child Health, at least four cases of chickenpox and two cases of measles are reported daily. According to the institute director R. Premlatha, most of the cases are from orphanages and overcrowded places where summer camps are being conducted in the city.
S. Pushpalatha, head of the Department of Paediatrics in Bowring and Lady Curzon Hospital, said the incidence of chickenpox is usually high between February and April as the weather is conducive for varicella-zoster, the virus that causes the infection, to thrive. “Children aged above two are usually affected. Adults, who have not had chickenpox, are also likely to be affected,” she said.
Dr. Pushpalatha, who is also seeing a considerable number of measles cases, said the infection could be spreading from overcrowded areas and slums where there is a possibility of some children having missed the routine immunisation.
Measles is one of the most contagious viral diseases caused by a virus from the paramyxovirus family. Infected children develop fever with rashes all over the body. The virus depletes Vitamin A in the body, she said.
If the baby has been vaccinated against measles before nine months, there is a possibility of maternal antibodies interfering with the vaccination, making it ineffective. This could be another reason for the spread of the disease, Dr. Pushpalatha said.
Paediatrician H. Paramesh said both chickenpox and measles could affect the brain, if not treated early. Chickenpox symptoms include low fever, running nose, cough and loss of appetite. According to the doctor, most parents do not bathe the infected child, which is wrong. The child should be bathed with an antiseptic soap daily for the infection to subside quickly, he said.

Bakey’s edible cutlery allows you to eat with them, then gobble them up "," Narayana Peesapaty’s phone rings incessantly. Taking a break from the calls he says, “Enquiries about the product and machinery keep me busy all day. Even while I am at the factory, my staff and I get very little time to do any other work. ” Some of these phone calls are to congratulate Peesapaty for the Swachh Bharat Award, which he received on June 23 from Prime Minister Narendra Modi, on the occasion of World Environment Day. 




Apart from the congratulatory messages, some calls are enquiries for a product Peesapaty’s brand, Bakey’s, manufactures — edible cutlery. The unique cutlery is made mixing jowar (sorghum) with rice flour and wheat flour. He uses jowar only because unlike ragi and other millets, which have an overpowering taste, jowar is fairly neutral and allows different flavours to be mixed in. 
One year and many kilograms of millets later, Peesapaty, with the help of his wife, was able to successfully get the right recipe to make the spoons. Finally, in 2016, Bakey’s took shape. Baking the dough at 280° Celsius for 28 minutes makes them tough enough to even spoon up soup with. Peesapaty thought about this cutlery first by accident while he was 5000 metres above sea level. “I was on a business trip and had packed jowar rotis. I forgot all about it. Then, when hunger pangs began, I reached for my food. I don’t like in-flight meals. My jowar roti had hardened. It was brittle, but still edible. I slowly began scooping the curry with the pieces, thus making me aware of what can be done to avoid disposable spoons,” says Peesapaty.




He realised the solution was not simple. His obsession with finding an alternative to disposable cutlery had two angles. “Apart from harming the environment, do we really know how disposable spoons are disposed of in reality? If they are all really being disposed of, then spoon piles should be as big a concern as discarded sanitary napkins. But no one talks about single-use spoon piles. Why? Because, often, they are not disposed of,” asserts Peesapaty. 
To double-check this theory, not only did he wade through garbage, but even started sneaking into catered events to get first-hand information. “I made my way to the ‘service’ section of the function hall. I saw that while food and other things were being discarded, the spoons were separated and put in a bowl of water. When I enquired about it, the staff said ‘the spoon will be washed and reused. It is the supervisor’s instruction’. Still not convinced? Wipe a disposable spoon with your finger or a tissue paper, or drop them in a bowl of water. You will observe a thin film of oil floating in the water,” he says.
Another concern is depleting ground water levels and the presence of chemicals in them. “Millets use less water than rice. The dry belt of Telangana was mainly cultivated for millets. Rice was aspirational because it was consumed by the rich. But once the farmers grew rice, they came into the trap of fertilizer companies, because dry lands do not yield good produce. Everyone wants to make a profit, so the use of fertilizers has become rampant,” says Peesapaty, explaining why he was determined to engineer his product specifically with millets. 




The cutlery also serves the purpose of promoting millets for consumption. As a result, “Farmers get encouraged to cultivate millets, which require very less water,” explains Peesapaty. Bakey’s sources the jowar millet locally from Telangana. 
The crisp spoons taste like thick baked rice crisps. They need a strong bite with the molar to break and chew them. The spoons, if not bitten, do not dilute the taste or flavour of the curry you are having. Bakey’s has sweet and savoury varieties as of now, and a team of 27 people are working on other flavours like chocolate as well, in the factory at Dilsukhnagar in Hyderabad. They are also looking at decreasing the current waiting period of two months.
“The demand and feedback the world over are overwhelming, and the company is taking care of delivery logistics on its own to keep costs down,” he says.

Mahua goes mainstream
"," Long before Manhattans, Cosmos and LITs defined our drinks repertoire, ancient India was known for its extensive, indigenous liquor-making culture. A few centuries ago, we, like the rest of the drinking world, began our affair with alcohol via madhira or wine — the go-to beverage for ancient royalty — made from honey, jaggery or molasses. During the Vedic ages, fermented brews made from rice and cereals, namely kanji and kilala, were a regular order with affluent communities. Commoners and cousins in the South preferred toddy, made from the sap of the palmyra tree, while Northeastern brothers opted for barley, millet or rice-based beers. 
It wasn’t until the British became preoccupied with launching rum distilleries for Army rations, and taxing local spirits like toddy and mahua, that our home-grown drinks were cornered into hooch status. Incredibly, a few olden-style swills silently continued to bloom. Mahua, an indigenous Indian tree, in particular, was nurtured and worshipped by tribal communities under the deep and dry deciduous covers of central Indian forests. 




Seventy years later, India’s most-touted and secretly-consumed Adivasi tipple is set to step out of its illicit, camouflaged abode, straight into the sun-kissed Goan light, thanks to IITian-turned-craft distiller Desmond Nazareth. If you’re a connoisseur of unusual beverages, chances are you’ve already sampled some of Nazareth’s artisanal creations, spanning agave, pure cane, margarita mixes, orange liqueur and blue curaçao.
If not, I recommend you start by trying his latest offerings: DJ Mahua and DJ Mahua Liqueur. “My first mahua encounter dates back to 2001, Gujarat,” reminisces Nazareth, adding that the intrigue and chase of obtaining a bent-out-of-shape, dirty plastic bottle full of cloudy mahua, that smelt of musky cooked rice, only supplemented its allure. In fact, it made it to the very top of his ‘to make’ list when he launched DesmondJi in 2011, but soon decided to shelve it until the time was right. In 2013, Nazareth acquired his first batch of unhygienic-handled mahua flowers from Latur, Maharashtra and began kitchen-scale experiments. “Hygiene, I understood, was the key to delivering an international quality product, but that also meant I needed to oversee the whole process from collection and sorting to producing,” says the 61-year-old, referencing his yearly sourcing trips to Jharkhand and Odisha.
 So while the tribals practise little to no hygiene checks, single-distil and are left with 10% alcohol, which they retail for ₹200, DJ Mahua conducts five levels of hygiene checks, double-distils using pot stills and is left with 40% alcohol, which they will retail for ₹975. 
“This isn’t just a one-way street. I’ve been working with the tribals on sanitation education, which in turn will hopefully have a positive effect on their own distillation,” affirms Nazareth.In the last decade alone, amidst prohibitions, trade and storage restrictions, two states — Assam and Jharkhand — have come out in support of the Gonds’ favoured pick-me-up, to promote local ethnic brews as ‘heritage liquor’. If France has Champagne and Mexico has Tequila, then why should India stop short at Darjeeling tea? Mahua too is just as deserving of GI (Geographical Indication) protection. The former field-to-bottle recently upgraded forest-to-bottle distiller couldn’t agree more. “This year, for the first time ever, many more Indians can participate in the annual, pre-monsoon Mahua Tyohar,” he ends enthusiastically.

A food and drink story "," The Urdu word goyaa, refers to the suspension of disbelief that takes place when fantasy is so realistic that it temporarily becomes real. Usually associated with the good powerful storytelling, restauranteur Siddharth Somaiya has chosen it for his new culinary venture.
In a quiet bylane away from the hustle bustle of monsoon traffic and potholes, the narrative begins with an appropriate setting. Designed by Architecture and Design Studio — STaND, Goyyaa has a minimalist approach with high ceilings, cane chairs, clean grey walls and an open kitchen on the far end, sending a message that you can gather around to watch the food being prepared, just as you would at the bar, situated in the centre corner. Behind it, gradient rises with a flight of steps on the side leading to casual seating options. 
Starting out
 Somaiya, who earlier helmed the Bao Haus Co, has roped in his buddy Mariki Sayles a New York friend from his first job). When Sayles came to India, she realised not every ingredient from the United States was available here. So, she set out to find suitable replacements that were available locally. For example when she couldn’t buy the herb gentian, Sayles replaced it with an interesting Ayurvedaic option — chirayta. 
Sayles begins the first chapter of our meal at Goyaa with the Universal Gravitation (₹550), a gin-based drink with apple and toasted fennel. The creaminess of white beer and cool absinthe in the drink pave the way for our first dish, Carrot Mochi (₹400), a carrot dish which presents the vegetable as a doughy dumpling, pickled and roasted form with a vinaigrette tossed in nutty pistachio dukka. 
We are gripped and we move to the next offering. The Sichuan Shrimp (₹300) is cocooned in a lettuce wrap and comes drenched in a coconut sweet potato cream, which transports us to the seaside, and keeps us hooked with its yummy side of mango chilli salsa. 
Main bites
 The Cast Iron Cauliflower (₹ 350) takes us from France to Chennai in one spoonful of mash with dollops of vadouvan butter. The fresh orange slices and a rather chewy toasted sour dough cuts the creaminess of the brown butter - blended with French masala that contains curry powder among 16 other ingredients. At this point, we are floating in a flavourful stupor. We’re surely coming back for this one.
The Pulled Lamb BBQ (₹500) is served with a jalapeno corn bread, smoked in hickory and topped with fried pickles. The jus is way too salty and promptly kills our taste buds. The Pork Belly Burger (₹400) comes with a punch of sundried tomato ketchup, kimchi mayo, but we find the juicy patty a tad too salty, between a brioche bun that is too dry. The Veggie Burger (₹350) is a mouthful of chickpea patty with tzatziki spread and a side of sweet potato fries and packs in a spicy punch. 
The end of every story should leave an imprint , and Sayle has saved No Sugar Tonight (₹550) for last. A cloudy milk punch of whiskey, coffee bean liqueur, fig and clarified milk is stiff, smooth as every liqueur should be, and leaves us with a subtle sweetness of figs on our palate. To keep up with the mood, Somaiya serves us dessert, ’Smore. It is a chocolate lava, drizzled with miso caramel, and whiskey toasted marshmellows.
Despite the hiccups, Goyaa is a story we’d like to read again, for its no-pretence décor, well-crafted cocktails and a soulful food menu.

Dakshin revamped: Amalgam of the South
"," Stepping into Dakshin, the familiar palatial décor, is like being transported to a time of monarchs and endless riches. The entrance is adorned with the traditional vilakku (lamp) and the urli filled with flower petals floating in water, and the walls dotted with south Indian artefacts. What’s not so familiar is the menu, renewed with flavours of south India with which we may not be so familiar.


Hyderabad-born chef Praveen Anand who works in Chennai’s ITC Grand Chola spearheaded the menu overhaul, bringing with him his forever expanding knowledge of south Indian cuisine — he is after all the creator of Dakshin. He sits before us with a relaxed confidence, humbleness and swagger as he regales us with tales of palates past and beyond. He’s something of an academic with his evolving curiosity and love for history — and this passion has fuelled a new menu. The various hues and textures of the pan-Indian dishes set contrastingly against the copper hues of the plate is worth a couple of photos for the cloud. The menu now features 40 vegetarian dishes and 27 non-vegetarian of which 28 are new dishes specially revived from history.
A small bowl of — take a breath — chinna vengaya patchai milagai mandi is perfect with some rice. I personally love Madras small onions and this dish has just the right amount with other fanciful ingredients like butterbeans and jumbo chillies. Karnataka brings to the fore ananas mensakai, a pineapple curry sporting a vibrant orange tinge, brought to life with byadgi chilli and coconut. 
For the non-vegetarians, Telangana’s kodi gajaala will ring a bell with its rich marinade of green chillies and onion which is quite appetising and will have you beckoning for more with a happy smile. Fish lovers will have a ball with the Kerala’s meen pollichathu, a spicy seasonal fish fillet lovingly wrapped in a banana leaf. And let’s not forget the uragai mamsam, a pickle-inspired mutton curry teeming with tomato and vinegar; while the meat is succulent, the spiciness really takes the cake and I found myself smacking my lips and licking my fingers a little too loudly for such a fancy place. And what is all of this without a delicate wisp of an appam with which to shovel all of this into your mouth?
Overwhelmed? The trick is to start off gently with the adais, banana-flavoured dosais and kuzhipaniyarams, all served with in-house chutneys. Then rest a bit, talk a little... maybe wander around ITC Kakatiya for a bit before really gearing up for the generous servings of the main course.
And of course, the desserts. Fragrant and delicious, these dishes are a home away from home. A warm serving of aadikumayam halwa and a cooling one of kadal patchee will send you home with the dreamiest of food comas.

Maheswary nominated again for Arjuna Awards
","Triple jumper >Renjith Maheswary, who has been stopped from receiving Arjuna Award under controversial circumstances on charges of dope violation last year, has again been recommended by the Athletics Federation of India (AFI) for the coveted honour this year.
A top AFI official told PTI that >Maheswary’s name has again been nominated for this year’s Arjuna Award on the ground that the Sports Ministry’s eligibility rule does not bar him from getting the coveted honour.
“Sports Ministry’s eligibility clause says that any athlete who failed a dope test conducted by a WADA or IOC accredited laboratory will be barred from getting the award.
But Maheswary’s case relates to a test conducted in 2008 while the NDTL got WADA accreditation in 2009 only,” the official said.
“So, we have recommended Maheswary’s name again for this year’s Arjuna Award. Let us see what the new government does this time,” he said.
Interestingly, this same eligibility rule (4.2) of the Sports Ministry for conferring Arjuna Awards was considered when the controversy over Maheswary being barred from receiving the coveted award cropped up in September last year.
The eligibility rule (4.2) for >Arjuna Awards as amended on March 15, 2010 states that “sportspersons found positive for use of drugs banned by the International Olympic Committee in any laboratory accredited by the IOC will not be eligible for Arjuna Award”.
Maheswary also has the performance to show as he won a silver in the Pune Asian Championships in July last, besides winning a silver and a bronze in the Asian Grand Prix last year.
After a detailed investigation, the Ministry had come to a conclusion in September last that Maheswary was found to have used ephedrine during the 46th National Athletic Championships in Kochi in 2008 and hence he would not be conferred with the award.
The Ministry had said then that there was some doubt regarding the acceptability of the test sample from Maheswary.
It had said that the report of National Dope Testing Laboratory might not have been an acceptable ‘Adverse Analytical Finding’, and that the chain of custody of the sample might not have been sufficiently foolproof.
However, the Ministry had noted that Maheswary had never protested against the findings of the inquiry committee or the punishment awarded by the competent authority. His acceptance of the punishment, despite the flaws in collection and analysis of the sample, had made the punishment final.
A Kottayam-based organisation, Navalokam Samskarika Kendram had filed a Public Interest Litigation in the Supreme Court seeking intervention in the Maheswary case and Sports Ministry had given its response after being issued notice by the top court.
Maheswary, on his part, said that he wanted to silence his critics by his performance.
“I am concentrating on my training at NIS, Patiala now. I want to answer my critics by doing well in the upcoming Commonwealth Games and Asian Games,” he said.
“I have been told by my friends that Sports Ministry has admitted before the Supreme Court that the WADA had doubted the dope testing procedure on the ground that the chain of custody of my urine sample was not foolproof. I am told that the Ministry said that even the IAAF did not lend any credence to the findings of my dope results.
“I am sad to hear all these, but I just want to move forward,” he said.

Saqib continues to be on top
","He has been on the professional circuit for a little more than three years but Syed Saqib Ahmed has never felt so good before. During the practice rounds here, the 24-year-old from Bengaluru felt very different, felt that this could be his moment.
Still, Saqib was surprised with his splendid run in the PGTI Cochin Masters at Nedumbassery’s CIAL Golf Club which helped him maintain his overnight lead, with a four-shot lead, after Friday’s penultimate round. 
“I didn’t expect this at all. I’m just playing each shot as it comes, I’m not even expecting to win tomorrow,” said the young man, who has never won a PGTI title before but appears to be a favourite to triumph on Saturday. 
Saqib has been trying out yoga and meditation for the last six months, after a friend asked him to try them out, and now the results are showing. 
“Yes, I’m more focused on living ‘in the moment’,” explained Saqib who was a very impressive junior with many wins in the Indian Golf Union’s amateur circuit a few years ago.
Saqib appeared to be growing stronger with each hole at that stage early in the back nine and once even had a six-shot lead over his nearest rival before bogeys in the 14th and 18th holes pulled him down.
Chandigarh’s Abhijit Singh Chadha was in the second spot while his good friend, Noida’s Amardip, occupied the next rung.
Chandigarh’s Sujjan Singh, with the day’s best score of 68, was joint fourth along with Noida’s Gaurav Pratap Singh and Gurugram-based Ankur Chadha.
The scores (18 holes, par 72, day 3): 
1. Syed Saqib Ahmed (206), 2. Abhijith Singh Chadha (210), 3. Amardip Singh Malik (211), 4. Sujjan Singh, Gaurav Pratap Singh, Ankur Chadha (all 212), 7. Shankar Das (213), 8. Sudhir Sharma, Maniram, Honey Baisoya (all 214).

Anand stops Karjakin, finishes joint second
","Viswanathan Anand signed off in great style when he tamed Sergey Karjakin to finish joint second in the Norway chess tournament here on Thursday. 
Fabiano Caruana, the conqueror of Anand in the previous round, had his share of luck on way to a title-deciding victory over Wesley So. 
Caruana took the winner’s share of 75,000 euros for what was his third title – after Candidates and Grenke – this year. 
For the record, Caruana tallied with five points, half a point better than Magnus Carlsen, Hikaru Nakamura and Anand, who finished in that order after the tie-break was applied. 
Anand prevailed in an eventful game that lasted 32 moves for his second victory with black pieces. 
It must be noted that Anand started this elite 10-player field as the lowest rated player but eventually managed a creditable finish. 
Statistically, Anand won two games with black pieces, drew six others (including the one against Ding Liren who withdrew after three rounds) and lost only the eventual champion. 
The performance helped Anand gain nine rating points which in turn lifted his World ranking from 14th to 11th.
Final-round results: Sergey Karjakin (Rus) lost to Viswanathan Anand; Fabiano Caruana (USA) bt Wesley So (USA); Maxime Vachier-Lagrave (Fra) drew with Magnus Carlsen (Nor); Levon Aronian (Arm) drew with Hikaru Nakamura (USA); Shakhriyar Mamedyarov (Aze) bye. 
Standings: 1. Caruana (5 points); 2-4. Carlsen, Nakamura, Anand (4.5); 5-6. So, Aronian (4), 7. Mamedyarov (3.5), 8-9. Lagrave and Karjakin (3).

Table tennis: Egypt sends India tumbling
","Egypt blanked India 3-0 in the men’s section of the World Team Table Tennis Championships’ Stage 2 of the second division here on Friday.
This means the men’s team, which finished 27th in the last world championship two years ago in Germany, will end up in the 32-36 bracket this time.
In the first rubber, Sharath Kamal rallied to a 2-1 lead over Omar Assar. But, the Egyptian levelled the score and went all out in the fifth for an 11-8, 5-11, 7-11, 11-4, 11-6.
Ghosh too began on a wrong note, but managed to stage a comeback by taking the second game against El-Sayed Lashin.
But that was all he could do as the Egyptian No. 2 won 11-9, 9-11, 13-11, 11-5.
With India trailing 2-0 Harmeet Desai played his usual attacking game.
But there was little he could do against Saleh Ahmed who won 11-5, 11-5, 7-11, 11-7.

It was an amazing experience, says Neha Pardeshi ","NEW DELHI: For Neha Pardeshi and Vahbiz Bharucha, it was a dream come true moment when India played Singapore in its first ever international Test at the Asia rugby women’s championship (Division 1). India lost 30-5 but the result does not convey the fight put by Vahbiz’s team.
Speaking from Singapore, Vahbiz, the skipper of the path-breaking team, said: “I am proud of the girls. They put up a gallant fight. Our defensive line was good. We did not allow Singapore to score for the first 36 minutes and this in our first ever Test. We suffered a few injuries and Singapore dominated once it scored.”
It was the first foreign exposure for the team. “We were regular playing Rugby7s but this was a different experience,” said Neha. “We will have to be aware and anticipate better in the next match (against the Philippines on June 5). Overall, it was an amazing experience and we learnt a lot.”
As Neha analysed, “the difference lay in the fitness level of the sides. They were superior in strength and endurance. Size too mattered. We may not have matched them in strength but we had the heart to fight. It was a history-making moment and that is what motivated us.”
On the difference between Rugby7s and Rugby15s, Neha said: “The 7s is very fast compared to the 15s, which is more contact game, a brain game. It was like playing chess physically. We were new to this format and playing against a team which is ranked 34th in the world. Some of our girls were taken aback at the sight of the opponents but we fought. We won’t take long to adapt to this format.”
After the Singapore experience, the team will prepare for the Asian Games in Jakarta where rugby will be played in the 7s format.

IOC says Pyeongchang is right on track for 2018
","The IOC is convinced that preparations for the >2018 Winter Games in Pyeongchang are on track, in contrast with concerns over the chronic construction delays for the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro
Gunilla Lindberg, who led the International Olympic Committee’s coordination commission on a three-day inspection visit of the 2018 host city, said a large amount of work had been achieved since the panel’s previous visit in June last year.
“The 2018 Games are on the right track but it is clear that much work remains,” Lindberg said Thursday. “With only four years to go until the Pyeongchang 2018 Olympic Winter Games begin, it was important for the commission to be able to survey the progress being made on the different venues. We are pleased to see that work on key sites like the sliding center and coastal Olympic Village has begun.”
Russian organizers were under intense pressure to finish venues and accommodations until right before the Sochi Winter Olympics and Brazilian organizers are lagging well behind schedule for the Rio Games.
Representatives of South Korea’s federal, provincial and city governments attended the three-day meetings in Pyeongchang, along with international and national winter sports federations.
The delegation toured the sites of competition and non-competition venues in the mountain and coastal clusters, including Olympic villages and media facilities.
“The third coordination commission meeting was the first one after Sochi, and it was especially meaningful because we had the high-level representatives of the international winter sports federations with us this time,” local organizing committee president Kim Jin-sun said.
“This year is a big turning point for us. We must establish a solid framework.”
The next coordination commission visit to Pyeongchang is scheduled for November.
The start of the inspection visit to South Korea on Tuesday was overshadowed by IOC vice president John Coates’ blunt warning for Rio during an Olympic forum in Sydney, when he said Brazil’s preparations were “the worst I have experienced.”
Coates later backed down, saying organizers “recently took a number of measures designed to make sure that we can together deliver a great games ... (and) a lasting legacy for the people of Rio and Brazil.”

Another draw for Anand
","Continuing with his sequence of draws, Viswanathan Anand shook hands with Shakhriyar Mamedyarov after 32 moves in the sixth round of Norway chess tournament here on Sunday.
But the talking point of the day was Wesley So’s first-ever victory over World champion Magnus Carlsen in the classical time format. The result ended the Norwegian’s 37-game unbeaten streak this year. 
The 44-move defeat, on the eve of the second rest day, also sliced Carlsen’s lead to half a point and threw open the title-race. 
In the exchange variation of Slav Defence, Carlsen miscalculated in the middle-game and lost a pawn on the 25th move. So, playing white, slowly gained control with an advanced pawn structure that left the black’s castled king with limited options. 
Though Carlsen managed to win back the pawn, So stayed in control. Soon thereafter, Carlsen erred in judgement with a pawn-move on the queenside and lost a pawn. A move later, the top seed gave up. 
Sixth round results: Viswanathan Anand (2.5/5) drew with Shakhriyar Mamedyarov (Aze, 2.5/6), Wesley So (USA, 3/5) bt Magnus Carlsen (Nor, 3.5/6), Levon Aronian (Arm, 3/6) drew with Fabiano Caruana (USA, 2.5/5), Hikaru Nakamura (USA, 2.5/5) drew with Maxime Vachier-Lagrave (Fra, 2/5), Sergey Karjakin (Rus, 2.5/5) bye.

Bowlers are going back to the basics in T20, says Eric Simons
","Eric Simons has spent his life honing the skills of a variety of fast bowlers. As a coach, he has tracked and analysed the changing facets of fast bowling in the Indian Premier League (IPL) to conclude that the trade is returning to its basics in the shortest format of the game.
In an exclusive interaction with The Hindu here on Friday, Simons described how fast bowling had completed a full circle in T20 cricket.
“It has changed in phases. I think originally a lot of fast bowling conversations were around pace and bowling different lengths.
“It went to lots of variations and strategies around batsmen in different situations and how they play.
“I think it has gone so much back again to be a little more simple. The guys are realising that a good Test line or length is good in any form of the game.
“You don’t often find guys bowling six different balls in an over.
“It happened two or three years ago. They are getting back more to the basics of bowling.”
Simons, who has been a key part of Delhi Daredevils over the years, is assisting head coach Gary Kirsten this year and hopes that DD’s bowling unit, which is yet to realise its potential, will prove its worth in forthcoming matches.
“I always judge a bowling performance on three levels — what is your plan, the execution and then the outcome. You can plan to bowl a perfect yorker, then bowl a perfect yorker and an inside edge can go to be a four. You can’t just look at what the outcome is.
“We believe we have got better plans now, we are executing a little better and we are keeping simple game plans. As the tournament goes on, we will be better and better.”
Simons, who worked with Kirsten as a bowling consultant of the Indian team a few years ago, showed a lot of faith in Mohammad Shami and Jaydev Unadkat.
The 52-year-old South African said Shami could be a very useful bowler for DD in various stages of a match.
“It is the execution of the things — getting back to his ability to swing the ball, which is his natural talent, and to execute with confidence the yorkers or the slow bouncers in the final phase. If plans and executions are right, then you win 80 per cent of the battle.”
Unadkat, according to Simons, had learnt from his experience. “He has become intelligent as a bowler and has grown in his decision making. He has got some great slower balls. He has always been a thinking bowler. He has grown in confidence.”
Simons relished his long relationship with Daredevils and hoped that under the leadership of Kirsten DD would turn into a formidable side.
“It is about finding ourselves as a unit. A team like Chennai has its continuity where they have five players for most of the seven tournaments. That’s important.
“That’s where Delhi wants to get to — build up a core of players to carry the essence of what we are as a team. It is great to be with Gary again...We want to empower the players so that they make their decisions,” said Simons.

GFI forms five-member committee
","The mess in Indian gymnastics moved a step closer to temporary resolution with the federation and the IOA agreeing to come together to select the team for the upcoming Asian Games.
More than five hours of meeting with IOA president Narinder Batra saw the Gymnastics Federation of India (GFI) not just agreeing to forming a five-member committee to conduct the selection trials involving all parties concerned but also indicating its willingness to move the trials out of Pune to another venue.
The committee — chaired by IOA vice-president Sunaina Kumari and including SAI officer Rajendra Pathania, GFI joint-secretary Makarand Joshi, Delhi Olympic Association secretary Suresh Sharma and gymnastics coach Ram Milan — will select the team, most likely in Delhi.
“A final decision on the date and venue will be taken by tomorrow [Friday] because it is the Sports Authority of India that has to give the clearance. We would like to hold the trials on June 24 only but the venue is likely to change from Pune to some other centre,” Joshi told The Hindu after the meeting.
Selecting the best team
The GFI has also submitted its acceptance of the committee to the IOA, a copy of which is with The Hindu. “We have to work with the GFI because of the international federation. At the end of the day, it is about selecting the best team for the Asian Games and without any controversy. It’s good that all parties are agreeable to this proposal,” IOA officials said.
A training camp for elite gymnasts is currently on at the Indira Gandhi Stadium here and will be held till June 24, and given that all the top Indian gymnasts are part of it along with national coaches G.S. Bawa and Bisweswar Nandi, sources said selection could be done the same day to ensure seamless movement from one phase of training to the next.
Interestingly, the GFI letter is signed by general-secretary Ranjeet Vasava whose appointment has been the bone of contention between the federation and IOA and one of the reasons for pending recognition.
De-recognised by the IOA and/or the sports ministry, the mess in gymnastics is trickier since it holds recognition from the International Gymnastics Federation (FIG) and hence is the sole authority to recommend teams for international events. A similar situation before the CWG had the FIG direct IOA not to interfere.

Impressed with the talent in Karnataka, says Nisha Millet
","Nisha Millet, 36, Olympian and Arjuna Award winner and the first Indian female swimmer to qualify for the Olympic Games in Sydney 2000, spoke to The Hindu on the sidelines of the Karnataka state sub-junior and junior aquatics championships here on Sunday.
Excerpts:
How do you see the present talent of junior and sub-junior swimmers in Karnataka?
I am very much impressed with the performance of the boys in the State championships. Swimmers in the boys section (Group I to IV) have broken the state and national records, which is a good sign. In the girls section, the performance needs to improve. After a gap of 25 years, Sajini Shetty’s record has been broken by Rachana S.R. Rao (Group II girls section). She also won the 100m backstroke with a new national mark. There are promising swimmers like Nina Venkatesh and Suvana C. Baskar (both from Dolphin Aquatics). They need to work hard to perform well at the national and international level.
What should they do to improve further?
They need to be more professional in their outlook towards swimming. They need to get updated on the sport, do mental training and take part in more events abroad in the Asian and European circuits where competition will be tougher. The SFI and the government needs to get involved and send talented swimmers on exposure tours abroad often. The Khelo India programme is a good concept and they have also started financially supporting talented sportspersons, which is positive. The Karnataka swimming Association has also announced that it will will give cash awards to state and national record breakers, which is good news.
About your academy?
I started the Nisha Millet Swimming Academy in Bengaluru in 2004. We have two main centres, one in Kennigston Pool, Ulsoor and one in Koramangala. We have 10 other centres in city to cater to the needs of the public. It’s satisfying to be into coaching. We are a team of 30 coaches and I head the senior and Sirish Reddy the junior sections. I also support the top swimmers from the academy with sponsorship from Speedo and upcoming juniors with Speedo kits.

Wrestling: Rathi, Punia break gold drought
","India ended its title drought on the final day of the competition with two gold and as many bronze medals to finish second in the freestyle tally at the Junior Asian Wrestling Championships here on Sunday.
The contrast between the two golds, however, couldn’t have been more stark. If Sachin Rathi rode on a vociferous crowd support and mental strength to overturn a huge deficit and win by pinning his Mongolian opponent in the final of the 74kg, Deepak Punia, displaying technical superiority, had an easy 10-0 win in the 86kg category with almost 1.30 minutes left in the bout.
Trailing 2-5 at the end of the first round, Rathi conceded four more to lag 2-9 as the competition seemed all but over. But even as his opponent tried to roll him, the 20-year old from Baghpat in Uttar Pradesh turned it around, exposing twice to reduce the margin to three points. A pin then ended the competition as the Mongolian appeared stunned by the fightback.
Confident
“Crowd support always helps, you don’t want to let down all the people who have travelled to see you fight. But I was always confident even when he was leading. The fact that I had defeated the Iranian in the semifinals only made me more confident since he was a much tougher opponent,” a reticent Rathi said.
Junior national coach Maha Singh Rao explained the change in strategy at half-time. “I told him he was giving too much space to the opponent and allowing him to attack. Closing the space gave Sachin the opening he wanted,” Rao said.
Punia, on the other hand, was favourite to win after returning with bronze from the Georgia Grand Prix in Tbilisi. “That was in the senior category so this was easy. But there is not much difference between seniors and juniors if you are well-prepared,” the student of coach Satpal at the Chhatrasal Stadium said. 
The results: 
Freestyle: 61kg: Abbos Rakhmov (Uzb), Syrbat Talgat (kaz), Suraj Kokate (Ind) and Minso Cho (Kor); 
74kg: Sachin Rathi (Ind), Bat-Erdene Byambasuren (Mgl), Ali Bakhtiar Savadkouhi (Iri) and Taro Umebayashi (Jpn); 
86kg: Deepak Punia (Ind), Azat Gajyyev (Tkm), Dinislambek Taalaibek Uulu (Kgz) and Seyedsajjad Seyedmehdi Seyedi (Iri);

Smashing outing for Manika, Sathiyan at UTT
","Golden girl Manika Batra and giant-killer G. Sathiyan showcased their readiness to take over the mantle of Indian table tennis from veteran A. Sharath Kamal at a packed Shri Shiv Chhatrapati Sports Complex auditorium on the third night of the CEAT Ultimate Table Tennis.
Thanks to Batra and Sathiyan Dabang Smashers cruised to a comfortable 14-7 win over fancied Warriors.
After struggling to find her rhythm, Batra changed tactics effectively to force left-handed Austrian and World No. 18 Sofia Polcanova into committing mistakes.
Batra also raised her game to win the golden point in the opening and the deciding games.
Sharath tried his best to get Warriors back into the match by pocketing the opening game against Japan's Yoshida Masaki. But the World No. 27 was too consistent to handle for Sharath.
Once Sharath and Hana Matelova conceded tamely to Sathiyan and Sakura Mori in the mixed doubles, the result was all but sealed.
Sathiyan then upset Chin-Yuan Chuang of Chinese Taipei in the penultimate rubber. He not only matched the World No. 15 rally for rally, but also won most of the long rallies to register one of the most memorable victories of his career.

Juventus, Valencia denied Europa final by Benfica, Sevilla
","Benfica and Sevilla dramatically edged their way into the final of the Europa League on Thursday, at the expense of Juventus and Sevilla.
Ten-man Benfica battled out a 0-0 draw away to Juventus - and went through on a 2-1 aggregate – while Sevilla lost 3-1 at Valencia but went through on the away goals rule thanks to an injury-time strike from Stephane M'bia.
Juventus had been keen to go through since the final will be played in their own new stadium on May 14.
Nonetheless, they showed little urgency in their bid to overturn the first leg 2-1 deficit, until the final minutes.
In the 68th minute, Benfica had midfielder Enzo Perez sent off for a second yellow card offence, a foul on Arturo Vidal. Juventus tried to lay siege to the visiting goal but - despite the presence of veteran playmaker Andrea Pirlo - lacked the craft and precision to create many clear chances.
Juventus sub Dani Osvaldo had a late goal disallowed for offside, and Benfica managed to play out time despite finishing with nine men due to an injury to defender Ezequiel Garay.
They will be without suspension victims Perez, Lazar Markovic and Eduardo Salvio in the final.
""We deserved to reach the final. We had everything against us tonight but we managed to come through,"" said Benfica midfielder Nico Gaitan.
""We showed true character tonight, to come through in such difficult circumstances.""
Benfica lost the Europa League final last season 2-1 to Chelsea.
The other semi-final was even more dramatic, with M'bia headed in a crucial away goal for Sevilla in the fifth minute of stoppage time after being set up by defender Federico Fazio.
The teams played to a 3-3 aggregate draw, but Sevilla scored more goals away - just one, M'bia's desperate header - and went through.
""To experience this is unique. Tonight what saved us was a lot of heart and faith,"" said delighted Sevilla boss Unai Emery, who was in charge of Valencia from 2008 to 2012.
""We really had to suffer tonight. Now we want to enjoy the final ... We started out in this competition on August 1. It has been a long and hard road.""
Meanwhile, Sevilla hero M'Bia said, ""That is the most important goal of my career so far. I dedicate it to my parents, who are not having an easy time of it back in Cameroon.""
The only Valencia player who would speak afterwards was Jonas, who simply said, ""This is really horrible, dreadful. We have lost in the cruellest possible way.""
Sofiane Feghouli gave Valencia an early lead, then Sevilla keeper Beto made it 2-0 with an own goal when trying to keep out a header from Valencia's Jonas.
Defender Jeremy Mathieu made it 3-0 to the hosts and put Valencia ahead in the tie for the first time. However, Sevilla poured forward desperately for an away goal to save them - and M'bia silenced Mestalla with his last-gasp header.
Sevilla won the old UEFA Cup in 2006 and 2007.

My next target is to become a Super GM: Praggnanandhaa ","CHENNAI: R. Praggnanandhaa’s quest to become a Grandmaster began after he became an International Master in May 2016. After more than 20 tournaments across the globe and quite a few close misses, the 12-year-old from Chennai finally got his final GM norm in the Gredine tournament at Ortiesi, Italy. 
Was it not frustrating or was he under any pressure? “There was little pressure,” said Praggnanandhaa here on Tuesday on his arrival from Italy. 
“Since I have been playing for a while, I was able to focus,’” added Praggnanandhaa.
He rated the victory over GM Roeland Pruijssers at the Gredine Open recently as one of the best in his career. But the 12-year-old added that his wins over a higher-rated Alex Bachman in 18 moves in the Isle of Man tournament in 2016 and the victory over David Howell in the same tournament in 2017 were as good. 
Praggnanandhaa also played against Sergey Karjakin (he is the youngest GM), whose record he couldn’t overtake, in the Aeroflot Open in February. “We played two games in the blitz format, and I drew one and lost the other. We played and shook hands.”
The youngster credited coach R.B. Ramesh for teaching the intricacies involved in openings and calculations — analysing one’s game — and most of all “to enjoy chess”.
Praggnanandhaa said he couldn’t have achieved anything without the support of his school (Velammal MHSS), coach (Ramesh) and parents. 
“My next target is to improve my ratings and become a Super GM,” said Praggnanandhaa, who will next play in a tournament at Leon, Spain beginning July 5.

Lahiri, Jeev, Gangjee shoot five-under in Singapore
","Jeev Milkha Singh, who is on a recovery path from a shoulder injury, seemed headed for a flawless day before a late double bogey blotted the card and he finished with a round of five-under 67 on the first day of The Championship at Laguna National in Singapore on Thursday.
On a day when lightning and thunder delayed the start by over an hour and by the end 18 players were still to complete their first round, no less than three Indians came in with five-under scores.
While Jeev Milkha and the in-form Anirban Lahiri had completed their rounds, Rahil Gangjee after five birdies still had three holes to complete tomorrow. The trio was tied 16th, four shots behind Thailand’s Panuphol Pittayarat who put up a class act when he fired a sparkling nine-under-par 63 as the players were allowed preferred lies at the $1.5 million event sanctioned by the Asian Tour and European Tour.
Digvijay Singh and SSP Chowrasia fired four-under 68 each to be tied 26th on a low-scoring day, Chiragh Kumar (69) was tied 48th. Things were not as good for Rashid Khan (72), Shiv Kapur (74), Himmat Rai (three-over through 15), and Jyoti Randhawa (77).
Lahiri, who is now ranked at a career-best 67th in the world and leads Asian Tour earnings for this year, was happy to see his putter working. “I got off to a wayward start. I didn’t hit the ball very good today but it was nice to have my putter come to my rescue for a change. I am happy with how I am striking the ball. I feel more confident with my game this week (after my win in Indonesia last week) as compared to the last few weeks,” said Lahiri, one of Asia’s top stars at the EurAsia Cup in March.
Jeev, who had a slow start in the Middle East at the start of the year, took almost 10 weeks off after that — though he did make an appearance in domestic Indian circuit with little success — before missing the cuts in Malaysia and China.
“It was a great round for me. I haven’t been doing well in the last few weeks but my game is coming around. I’m happy that I shot 67. This has come after a long time,” said Jeev, who was six—under after 16 holes. But a double bogey on 17th set him back before he recovered some ground with a birdie on 18th.
Jeev added, “My shoulder injury is getting better. I’m taking medication after the surgery so it’s working out. I think what is important for me now is to trust my game. I have got to trust it under pressure so I can put more good numbers out there.”
Singapore’s Quincy Quek kept chase with Panuphol by returning with a 64 to share second place with Scotland’s Scott Jamieson, American-Korean David Lipsky and Korea’s Kim Byung-jun.
After missing the cut in his last three starts on the Asian Tour, Panuphol breathed new life into his season with a flawless 63 that would have been the course record if not for the preferred lie ruling in place this week.
A total of 18 players will have to return at 7.40am (local time) to complete their first round after play was suspended due to fading light.

The Durant-Curry duo: A symbiotic relationship that has blossomed
"," Before last season, fans wondered how well newcomer Kevin Durant and star guard Stephen Curry would work together as new teammates for the Golden State Warriors.
Now halfway to a second consecutive NBA title together, inside force Durant and 3-point sharpshooter Curry have become a lethal combination against Cleveland once again in this year’s NBA Finals.
“Two seasons together, I think we’ve figured out a good balance,” Durant said on Tuesday. “I think being able to play off of each other definitely helps. But not just us two. Everybody else on the court kind of plays off each other well.”
Playing Durant tight inside leaves open space for Curry to utilise. Outmanning Curry outside leaves Durant to outmatch most rivals near the basket.
As a result, Durant averages 28.7 points, 7.3 rebounds and 4.3 assists a game in the playoffs while Curry contributes 25.8 points, 6.2 rebounds and 5.5 assists a night in the post-season. “Every opportunity we get to play more minutes together, we start to figure out a better chemistry,” Curry said.
“It’s nice when we’re both going and have the opportunity to play off each other. We both can be aggressive no matter if I’m getting the shot or he’s getting the shot or anybody else on the team is getting the shot.”
“We just try to do whatever it takes to get the W,” Durant said. “Run the right plays. Run them with force and with pace. When you get your opportunities, be disciplined in your work and trust in your work. That will dictate the outcome. So just try to keep things as simple as possible.”
It became tricky this season when each of them was injured for a span, most recently Curry at the start of the playoffs.
“But it’s not hard to kind of ramp it back up once we’re both out there on the floor. We built up that chemistry again. And it has been fun.”
Greater communication this season has led to more encouragement between the stars, helping lift each other mentally as well as with their skills.
“When we pick our spots offensively and try to find the right matchups, find the right flow, make simple plays, good things usually happen,” Curry said. 
“It’s best when we’re communicating with each other about what we see on the floor consistently. We want to see each other succeed. Got a good chemistry going.”

Visu Palani — a calm and consummate hoopster
","“Visu Palani can beat anyone in ball control, his dribbling skills invariably making him come out trumps in one-on-one situations,” said former Indian basketball captain Hari Krishna Prasad. “Young, but very talented, he’s an accomplished shooter, who goes for a lot of assists,” the three-time Asian Basketball Confederation championship hoopster told The Hindu.
“Visu is the Bjorn Borg of Indian basketball,” observed Norman Isaac. “Not flustered even by the most blatant fouls, he’s calm, stable and mature when switching roles of ball handler and forward. What sets him apart is that he uses one arm to shoot, without a supporting hand, even when targeting the ring from a distance,” said the International Basketball Federation (FIBA) Commissioner.
The Tuticorin-native averaged 20 points for Telangana in the recent senior National championship at Chennai, even logging 33 in one game with as many as eight three-pointers.
“An intelligent schemer, few can stop him. His anticipation in defence is excellent, finding him faster to the ball than players on the offence. A selfless player, its not surprising that he gets along well with his teammates,” added Isaac, chairman, technical commission, Basketball Federation of India (BFI)
“Visu is an athletic player who uses his speed and jumping ability to get to the rim and finish. He also shoots the ball well from the 3-point-line. He is a really good defender on the perimeter as well. What I appreciate most is that he is constantly improving his fitness skill sets and is very ‘coachable,’” noted Jon Kimberlin, United Basketball Alliance (UBA) league Assistant Coach.
“The UBA league came in handy to showcase his abilities,” said Puneeth Suresh, Head Coach of Bangalore Beast and Jain University. “When he joined our university, he had a language problem but soon went on to play for Karnataka,” he said. Jain University clinched the bronze from among 750 varsities at the all India competition at Satyabhama University.
“When we see a rival player scoring, I task Visu to mark him. Sure enough, the opposition’s scoring declines,” said Suresh, who added Visu couldn’t go to the US for further training due to visa issues.
“Visu’s very disciplined and that’s the reason for his consistency in three seasons,” explained Thimmaiah Madanda, Vice President, Operations, UBA.
“After the UBA experience, this time I could score a lot more. I feel that people only got to know me after UBA, when they could see me play on live TV,” said Visu, who acknowledged the support of coaches Sathiya Sankar at SAV Higher Secondary School in Tuticorin and Suresh at Jain University. The teenager led the UBA in steals in season three and shot 54% from three-point range in season four.

Kabaddi Masters: India crushes Pakistan
","India cruised past Pakistan 36-20 in their opening match of the Kabaddi Masters Dubai on Friday. 
Pakistan paid a heavy price for poor defending, which allowed India to march on unchecked. The Pakistan antis frequently broke the chain to attempt silly solo tackles. 
For the Indian raiders, led by skipper Ajay Thakur, it was easy pickings. 
Pakistan stayed competitive in the early minutes, holding India to a manageable 8-10 deficit. An all-out, however, saw India seize the initiative with a 14-8 lead. A second all-out gave India a huge 25-9 advantage. 
Pakistan’s Ibrar Hussain attempted to infuse some life with a low reverse leg-sweep raid, and gained a touch on Surender. His Indian teammates, however, piled on Ibrar to snuff his challenge. 
The energetic crowd, which included actor Abhishek Bachhan and Sports Minister Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore, perhaps would have loved to see a closer encounter. 
The result: India bt Pakistan 36-20.

Surf’s up ","With pale yellow surfboards tucked under their arms, a group of youngsters head to the sea at Rushikonda. They hop on top of the surf boards and fearlessly tame the waves. Amidst the rush of tourists, seafood restaurants and fast-food vendors, a small community of boys from the neighbouring fishing village has transformed this sleepy coastal destination into a popular surfing spot. And training them since 2006 is Melville Smythe, the man who started the Waveriders’ Surf School (WSS) and brought about a change to the lives of 15 kids from the fishing community. 
While the boys of WSS have had their special moments when international cricketers and expert surfers came down to the coast to surf with them, the young surfers are nurturing a different dream today. They aspire to represent their country in the Olympics some day. With surfing set to make its much-anticipated foray into Olympics in 2020 in Toyko, the young wave riders feel that they may finally have their moment in the sun. Like the waves he has braved to conquer, Smythe waded through a sea of challenges to set up the Waveriders’ Surf School — which has hosted names such as Jonty Rhodes, Paddy Upton and Sam Billings from the international cricketing fraternity. “The initial challenge was to bring about a change in the mindset of these kids who would often resort to begging on streets and frequently bunked school. It took a while for me to convince them to pick up the surfboard to make a living out of it. The sport helped discover many hidden talents among the kids,” says the 55-year-old national level surfing and sailing expert, who is currently associated with the Sports Authority of Andhra Pradesh. And now, he is hoping to draw the attention of the State Government to host a surf festival in the city and more importantly, get some financial backing to make the dreams of the young talented surfers come true.

Twenty-year-old Kalyan Rayithi, who hails from the fishing community, would have taken to his family profession had it not been for the surfboard that he discovered as an 11-year-old. Over the past decade, Rayithi has won several national level competitions held in Mahabalipuram (Tamil Nadu), Puri (Odisha) and Puducherry. But his most memorable moment was when Jonty Rhodes came up to him at India’s top surfing competition Covelong Point Surf, and introduced him to the media as a “surfing prodigy”. A first year student of business administration, Rayithi’s heart lies in surfing. But what’s holding him back is the exposure and lack of funds to travel to some of the country’s best surfing locations and participate in competitions. One of his biggest achievements is the surfboard he won while competing with international surfers in Puducherry in 2012. He was ranked No. 1 in his category then. After that incident, Rayithi had accompanied Rhodes and his family on surfing vacations to Kerala. Rhodes knows most of the young surfers of Rushikonda by their names. “He once told me that he loves surfing more than cricket,” says Rayithi. 
From a mix of epic waves to beautiful, small glassy swells, time and again the waters of Rushikonda have been termed as a ‘surfer’s delight’. There are tourists from across India and passionate surfers from countries like France, USA and South Africa who have traced their way to the sands here. India has about two dozen listed surfing spots, mostly clustered around the South of the country. 
Rushikonda beach features on the list of the popular surfing site magicseaweed.com that gives surfers all the required information about the swell consistency and wind overview. 
Promising future
The last time cricketer Paddy Upton came to the city to surf, he was floored by the passion of the small community of surfers at Rushikonda who were trying to popularise the spot. In an earlier interview he had said, “There are five or six places that are known for surfing in India and Visakhapatnam has the potential to be right on top of the list. It has great waves and a fantastic beach,” and added: “If international cricketers come here and get floored by the beauty of the waves in Rushikonda, I can promise you that it will be great for you guys as well. Just give it a try.” While the Tokyo Olympics may be too early for the region’s young surfers, the future certainly seems bright. 
The bigger challenge now plaguing the surfing community is the garbage strewn beaches that are a big blow to the image of this surfing hub. This year, Rhodes and other cricketers gave the coast a miss when they came down to India for the IPL.

Dustin Johnson has history on his side at the US Open
"," Dustin Johnson has history on his side going into the weekend at the U.S. Open golf. 
Johnson became the seventh player to lead by at least four shots after 36 holes in more than a century of this 72-hole championship. Only one player failed to win the trophy, and that was in 1909 when Tom McNamara sputtered on the weekend. 
Johnson was the only player under par 4-under 136 and led by four shots over Scott Piercy and Charley Hoffman. 
Three major champions were within five shots Henrik Stenson, Justin Rose and defending champion Brooks Koepka. The sun was out, and there was just enough wind in the Hamptons for Shinnecock Hills to remain the tough test it has been over the opening two days. 
The scores: 136 - Dustin Johnson 69-67; 140 - Scott Piercy 69-71, Charley Hoffman 71-69. 
141 - Tommy Fleetwood 75-66, Henrik Stenson 71-70, Justin Rose 71-70, Brooks Koepka 75-66, Ian Poulter 69-72; 142 - Russell Henley 69-73, Rickie Fowler 73-69; 143 - Marc Leishman (AUS) 74-69, Matthew Fitzpatrick 73-70, Charles Howell 71-72.

Hamilton wins at Bahrain, China
","The Formula One season continues to go Mercedes’ way as the team dominated both the grand prix - Bahrain and Chinese - held in April. Mercedes’s Lewis Hamilton won both the races with teammate Nico Rosberg finishing a close second. The win in Bahrain, which took place first, was the second one-two finish for Mercedes this season and a close one too - Hamilton finished just one second ahead of Rosberg.
The Chinese GP, held next, was a similar show with Hamilton taking the pole and eventually the race. Force India’s Sergio Perez had his first podium finish in five years in Bahrain - finishing third - while Ferrari’s Alonso came third in China.
As of now, Rosberg heads the drivers’ standings with 79 points, four ahead of Hamilton. Alonso is third at 41 points.

India’s top squash players put on a show
","When the best players take the court the rest watch in awe. This was the scene at the Indian Squash Academy courts on May Day when top three Indian players Saurav Ghosal, Dipika Pallikal and Joshna Chinappa, along with Harinder Pal Sandhu, came on to play doubles as part of a special camp.
The Academy was bustling with activity with a junior tournament on in addition to several junior-level trials. All of the courts were busy before two courts were rearranged for the doubles session. The four stars — Ghosal (the World No.15), Dipika (No.12), Joshna (No.21) and Sandhu (No.82), all part of the Indian team for Commonwealth Games to be held in July in Glasgow — had taken time off from their busy professional circuit commitments.
SRFI consultant coach S. Maniam and National coach Cyrus Poncha were in attendance too as Dipika and Ghosal played Joshna and Sandhu in a gruelling one-hour match, the final session of the short camp.
For the many junior boys and girls this was a spectacle as the pros put on a show of power, precision and poise.
Maj. Maniam seemed sastisfied with the way the players have shaped up; after all, it was he who has been tuning them up from their junior days, along with Poncha. His watchful eyes were glued to the action as the four went through the grind.
“Considering the quality at the Commonwealth Games, India’s best bet for a medal lies in the doubles,” said Poncha.
According to Maj. Maniam, who is also director-coaching with the World Squash Federation, India has a good chance of a medal in Glasgow because each player has risen in ranking and the confidence levels will be high.
Consequently, he said, the stress will be on the doubles.
“This camp, which got over on Thursday, will be followed by another later this month, and possibly another before the team leaves for the Games,” Maj. Maniam said.
From the seriousness on display, the quartet seemed keen to sharpen coordination in doubles play.
“Winning medals for the country is our primary aim,” said Ghosal, the highest ranked Indian male player.
Dipika spoke of the charm of playing for the country and bringing home laurels, though the sport was not exactly high-paying (“We hardly have any savings.”).
Joshna said more academies like the ISA would do a world of good to broadbase the sport, like in Egypt — the top force in squash — where 90 per cent of those who take to the sport end up being professionals.

Sakshi, Vinesh to lead Indian women wrestlers in Asian Games "," 
Olympic bronze medallist Sakshi Malik and Commonwealth Games gold winner Vinesh Phogat will lead a six-member Indian women wrestling team at the Asian Games to be held in Indonesia later this year.
Sakshi, who won bronze medals in this year’s Gold Coast Commonwealth Games as well as 2016 Rio Olympics, and Vinesh were exempted from the trials by the Wrestling Federation of India because of their current form and past performances. 
Sakshi and Vinesh will carry India’s hopes in the 50kg and 62kg freestyle categories. Four other wrestlers—Pinki (53kg), Pooja Dhanda (57kg), Divya Kakran (68kg) and Kiran (72kg)—went through the trials to book their tickets for the Asian Games.
The Asian Games will be held in Jakarta and Palembang from August 18 to September 2.

Bhuvneshwari confident of India’s chances at Asiad ","There is hardly a match that former National squash champion Bhuvneshwari Kumari must have missed in the Asian Games selection trials which are currently on at the Indian Squash Academy courts here. She arrives at the venue on time almost always, watches the matches intently. 
The 16-time [consecutive] National women’s singles champion, who will be coach of the Indian women’s team for the Asiad, is in the city to witness the trials to pick the third and fourth singles players to complete the Indian women’s team.
The 57-year-old from Delhi is confident of the country’s men and women’s teams doing well at the Games. 
“We will get a minimum of four medals. We will do extremely well in the singles and team championships,” she opined.
Her optimism is based on the players’ world rankings and their current form.
“I am confident because they are playing well. [Of course] Joshna [Chinappa] will be the favourite in women’s singles. In the men’s section, we have Saurav [Ghosal]. Actually we have a solid men’s team,”she said.
The big concern in squash circles is the absence of good quality players other than Joshna and Dipika Pallikal. Bhuvneshwari replied that it was only a matter of time before junior players come good at the senior level.
“The thing is that the other girls are not playing international events, even if they are playing they are not playing top of the the line [events]. Give them a few years, I am sure they will come up in world rankings,” she said.
The former Kenyan Open champion picked Sunayna Kuruvilla, Ashitha [Bengra], [Aishwarya] Bhattacharya as the ones to watch out for.
Born into the royal family of Alwar in Rajasthan, Bhuvneshwari said she didn’t expect to hang up her boots after her record 16th title, but for an unfortunate knee injury.
“I never expected the 16th title to be my last. While playing in an inter-club tournament I injured my knee. I had decided to continue for another three years. 
“The doctors said I had damaged my knee, and could not play competitive squash any longer,” she said.

India, the favourite, has won both its group matches thus far, while Kenya slipped in its opening fixture.
Kenya threatened briefly, when in the first half, it had a chance to inflict an all-out. A couple of good raids from Rishank Devadiga, however, muscled India out of harm’s way.
India then recorded an all-out, which gave the side a 24-9 lead. 
By half-time, with India up 27-9, the game was all but over.
Monu Goyat brought the crowd to its feet with a spectacular raid after the restart. Goyat was initially pinned down by a group of defenders, but he managed to squeeze his foot past the mid-line. 
The Services player took out an impressive four Kenyans in that one play.
The results: Iran bt Argentina 54-24; India bt Kenya 48-19.

I will be at my best in All England, says Marin
"," Olympic champion Carolina Marin has sent a warning to her rivals in the badminton world, saying she expects to be at her absolute best during next month’s All England Championships.
 The 24-year-old from Spain clinched two World Championship titles, an All England title beside the Olympic crown — all within three years between 2014 to 2016.
 But she lost motivation because of injuries post the Rio Games. Last year, she won the Japan Open and European Championship besides reaching the finals at India Open, Malaysia Open and Singapore Open.
 However, she suffered a hip injury during the Hong Kong Superseries and missed the Dubai Superseries Finals in December.
Marin feels she still needs to sharpen her skills and vowed to be at her best at the All England Championships.
“I feel my performance is not 100 per cent but it would be there in the All England. I feel motivated because I want to keep improving my game. I will prepare very well for All England,” said the former world no. 1 Marin.
“Last year it was hard because I had injuries after Olympics and my body needed a long break. It is always tough to keep going mentally after you have an injury but I have a good team.
“I had to believe in myself. I had to change my game during that phase and I didn’t get enough time to prepare for tournaments. I want to focus on improving my game after this event,” said Marin, who is playing at the India Open here.
 The All England Championships is schedule to be held from March 14 to 18 at Birmingham.
 Her mentor and chief coach Fernando Rivas will not travel with her for every tournament from now on and Marin said with her coach not around she needs to be more focused on court.
“I have another coach, who knows what I need. Fernando has a baby so he couldn’t come and he can’t be there in all tournaments with me. Now I will have to think more about myself and the game,” said Marin, who guided Hyderabad Hunters to title triumph in PBL 3 last month.
 Talking about competition in women’s singles, Marin said: “Women singles is really tough. Any player in top 10 can win any tournament because they are in the same level.
Every player changes their game. So we have to be really prepared.”

Power-hitting, the stand-out aspect of T20 cricket
","The sixes have been bludgeoned rather than timed in the on-going Indian Premier League. And there has been a flurry of them.
The ball too has travelled long distances; beyond the stadium on occasions. From Glenn Maxwell to Kieron Pollard, big hitters have dented bowling figures and egos.
Yet, with modern bats, batsman-friendly rules, and shrinking grounds, has the concept of six-hitting been actually diluted?

The Hindu caught up with some prominent cricketers to seek answers.
Former India pace ace Javagal Srinath said: “You have 10 wickets to get and there are only 20 overs. The batsmen start with a huge psychological advantage. Everything favours the batsmen, from the bulkiness of the bat. They, consequently, have been emboldened. Now you have a Tillakaratne Dilshan scooping the ball over the ropes. The rate of scoring in cricket, across formats, has become quicker.”
Srinath also indicated that the quality of bowling might have come down too. “(The development of) Batting and bowling are inversely proportional,” he said.
Former India all-rounder Robin Singh, a telling hitter in his time, said: “The batsmen have more licence to play shots these days. It’s a mind-set thing. Batsmen now attempt to hit sixes in practice sessions. In my days, the emphasis was on playing along the ground in the nets.”
Asked about sixes being clobbered off deliveries that were previously considered hard to hit — such as the yorker outside the off-stump — and from different lengths, Robin replied: “There’s a lot more technology being used to study different balls, and come up with responses. There’s a lot more emphasis on execution. The batsmen also undergo gym training to further improve power-hitting.”
Being the batting coach of the Mumbai Indians, Robin has seen the likes of Pollard from rather close quarters. “He (Pollard) backs his ability. Don’t forget that, since there are only 20 overs, the ball remains hard and travels quickly off the bat all through,” he said.
Former Indian off-spinning great Erapalli Prasanna believed the spinners still have a chance. “If the batsman tries to hit you out for a six, as a spinner you have an equal opportunity of getting him out,” he said.
“You need to beat the batsman with either flight or with spin, or a combination of both. Many of the present-day spinners are not imparting sufficient revolutions on the ball,” said Prasanna.
He also spoke of the mind-set of a spinner. “These days, spinners, wrongly, seek to only restrict in Twenty20 cricket. They should attack the batsmen. If you pick wickets, the run-rate goes down automatically. Even if the bats are so good and the boundaries short, you can still fox the batsman with your skill.”
Among the spinners in the present edition, Prasanna said, R. Ashwin and Sunil Narine were performing better than the rest.
Former India paceman Venkatesh Prasad lamented the lack of quality in bowling. “If you are talking about Indian pacemen, the standards have come down, in terms of variation and execution,” he said.
“Many of the Indian pacemen do not send down an effective yorker. And they change their length too soon. I mean, if a good delivery is struck for a six, there is no need to alter length. You need one good stock delivery, one effective variation,” he said.
While much has been said about ‘Super Bats’, former India fitness trainer Ramji Srinivasan threw light on another important factor — bat speed. Power packed willows are not the only reason for even mis-hits clearing the ropes. Bat-speed contributes too.
“There are specific drills for wrists, forearms and shoulder. How the batsmen transfer their body weight to the bat is crucial. The focus for Twenty20 cricket is on high-end explosive speed,” he revealed.
Sixes have the crowd on their feet. These are days though when the odds favour the batsmen; rather overwhelmingly.

India bags two places in the Youth Olympics
","April began with the Sports Ministry of India derecognising the Indian Amateur Boxing Federation (IABF) with immediate effect as the IABF refused to comply with the ministry’s directives.
As International Boxing Association (AIBA), the sport’s governing body, had already withdrawn its recognition of IABF, it meant that the Indian pugilists competing at the World Youth Boxing Championships in Sofia, Bulgaria, had to compete under AIBA’s flag. The results weren’t all that promising either, as only two Indians booked a place in the Youth Olympics.
Shyam Kakara (49 kg) was the lone medallist, bagging a bronze after going down in the semi-finals, thereby gaining direct entry to the Youth Olympics. Gaurav Solanki (52 kg) lost his quarter-final bout, which meant that he did not gain qualification directly. He got two more chances though, and he made it count in his final bout, grabbing a place in the Youth Olympics.

Kuznetsova in her first final in three years
","Svetlana Kuznetsova reached her first final in more than three years on Friday with a 6-3, 6-1 win over fellow Russian Elena Vesnina to set up a clash with Carla Suarez Navarro at the ATP-WTA Portugal Open.
The Russian seventh-seed will take on the Spanish top seed competing in her third straight final here but without a career trophy of any kind.
Suarez Navarro overcame Romanian qualifier Irina Begu 7-6(3), 6-1 in one and three-quarter hours, Kuznetsova has won three of her four meetings with Suarez Navarro, the last in 2013.
Suarez Navarro, who cruised through her early rounds with barely a challenge, was made to work in the semifinal by Begu ranked 117.
The challenger kept the first set competitive before getting discouraged over line calls and fading in the second.
The winner broke five times but lost her own serve on four occasions. Suarez Navarro will become the season singles win leader with 25 victories as a result of her victory.
Kuznetsova struck 27 winners, breaking her good friend on five of 16 opportunities.
But Vesnina, seeded eighth and ranked 33rd, showed resistance at the end, saving four match points on her serve before Kuznetsova finally prevailed. Vesnina fell victim to six double-faults in defeat.
Kuznetsova won the opening set in 42 minutes and was barely under pressure as she moved smoothly to within one victory of her 14th career singles title. Kuznetsova had lost the only other match she had played against Vesnina, in Dubai five years ago.

Divij-Purav out

Meanwhile, India’s challenge ended in the men’s events with Divij Sharan and Purav Raja going down to top seeds Pablo Cuevas and David Marrero in the doubles quarterfinals here.
The unseeded Indian pair lost 2-6, 2-6 to Uruguay-Spanish combination in the €485,760 clay court event.
Meanwhile, Tomas Berdych defeated Somdev Devverman 6-3, 6-2 to reach the quarterfinals.

India wins one silver and two bronze medals
","NEW DELHI: Indian women had a mixed outing on the third day of the junior Asian wrestling championships here on Thursday, managing a silver and two bronze medals.
While all five Indians in action reached medal rounds, their performances failed to impress. 
The biggest hope for the host, Commonwealth Games bronze medallist Divya Kakran — the only one in the competition here who would also be on the flight to Jakarta for the Asian Games — lost 0-11 by technical superiority to Meerim Zhumanazarova of Kyrgyzstan in the final.
Incidentally, she had lost to the same opponent in the bronze-medal playoff at the Asian Championships earlier this year. With a bye in the first round and a walkover in the quarterfinals, Divya managed to win her only other bout of the day in the semifinals before being outclassed in the title clash.
Sangeeta Phogat, however, would consider herself unlucky. The youngest of Phogat sisters fought hard but with a limp and a non-responsive knee due to an injury earlier in the day, she could hardly move and lost 5-10 to China’s Juanjuan Shi. 
“There was a gap in the mat during my quarterfinal bout and I slipped and twisted my knee when I fell then. I tried to fight with painkillers and thought I could manage but then she (Shi) grabbed the same knee and pulled it, after which I just couldn’t do anything,” a disappointed Sangeeta said.
She did come close, going from 0-4 to 4-5 before the above-mentioned move ended her hopes despite managing to get into an advantageous position repeatedly. The fact that she received two cautions for fouls early on did not help either.
Karuna, one of the two bronze medallists, won 10-0 by technical superiority in the medal round, finishing in just over four minutes in the 76kg after Reena opened India’s account with an 8-2 win over Uzbek Khodicha Najimova in the 55kg. 
Shivani Pawar, the other Indian, was pinned to the mat in the first round by her Kazakh opponent and conceded the bout.
The standings (gold, silver and bronze medals): 
Women: 50kg: Miyu Nakamura (Jpn); Yumei Zhong (Chn); Anudari Nandintsetseg (Mgl); Marina Zakhshevskaya (Kaz).
55kg: Sena Nagamoto (Jpn); Jiajing Hou (Chn); Khaliunaa Bayaraa (Mgl); Reena (Ind).
59kg: Yuzuro Kumano (Jpn); Nabira Esenbaeva (Uzb); Purevsuren Ulziisaikhan (Mgl); Juanjuan Shi (Chn).
68kg: Meerim Zhumanzarova (Kgz); Divya Kakran (Ind); Man Zhing (Chn); Hyeonyeong Park (Kor).
76kg: Aiperi Medet Kyzy (Kgz); Yuzhen Ding (Chn); Karuna (Ind).

Soumya Swaminathan, who said no to 'hijab', glad her stand has been noted ","Soumya Swaminathan is overwhelmed by the response she has received following her decision to pull out of the Asian team chess championship to be held in Iran from July 26 because she doesn’t want to wear a hijab.  
“When I posted on my Facebook page that I was withdrawing from the Indian team for the Asian event because I did not wish to be forced to wear a hijab or burkha, as I see it as a violation of my human rights, I never imagined that I would be trending on Twitter,” Soumya, a former World junior champion, told The Hindu over phone from Pune on Wednesday. “I am happy to get so much support for my decision and that people in India have become aware of the issue.”
She said the decision wasn’t difficult at all. “I had written to the organisers in Iran asking them whether any exception could be made about wearing the hijab, but they replied in the negative, very politely,” she said. “When I played in Iran seven years ago, I had felt very uncomfortable playing with a hijab. I had decided then that I would never compete in a tournament in which such dress codes were in place.”
She is not the first chess player to have taken such a stance.
 Some top players, including reigning champion Mariya Muzychuk of Ukraine, had boycotted the Women’s World championship held in Tehran last year. The United States champion Nazi Paikidze-Barnes had even started a petition to relocate the tournament, citing religious and sexual discrimination. 
“I had signed the petition,” said Soumya. “I believe that sports bodies should ensure that major events are held in countries where freedom for the participants is not denied.”

India leg of 24-hour Global Run on June 6
","NEW DELHI: The India leg of the first ever 24-hour Global Run, organised by the International Federation of Athletics Associations (IAAF), will be held here on June 6.
The unique concept, named “Let’s Outrun the Sun”, would be a one-mile (1.6km) run across 24 cities around the world and would begin in Auckland and culminate in Vancouver over a period of 24 hours with live streaming throughout. The relay event would begin at 4.30 p.m. from Raj Ghat and end at Shanti Van.
Olympian and former India quartermiler Paramjit Singh has been named as the city captain by the Athletics Federation of India (AFI) for the event. Registration and entry is free and can be done on the AFI or IAAF website.
AFI secretary C.K. Valson said it was a recognition of India’s growing acceptance in world athletics that the country was chosen as one of the five Asian hosts despite not asking for it.
“It was a proposal from several countries to raise interest in running and fitness and was recently accepted by the IAAF executive board in its meeting. The decision to hold the world-relay event was taken around 20 days back by the international federation,” Valson said, adding it is likely to become an annual event.
Delhi will be preceded by Bangkok and followed by Minsk in Belarus as hosts.

Protesting compulsory hijab rule, Soumya Swaminathan pulls out of Iran chess tournament "," Woman Grandmaster Soumya Swaminathan has withdrawn from the Asian Nations Cup Chess Championship to be held in Iran next month objecting to the country’s compulsory headscarf rule.
In a Facebook post last week, city girl Soumya, who had won the World Junior Girls’ Championship in Argentina in 2009, called the Iranian law of “compulsory headscarf to be in direct violation of my basic human rights, including my right to freedom of expression, thought, conscience and religion.”
“I do not wish to be forced to wear a headscarf or burqa. I find the Iranian law of compulsory headscarf to be in direct violation of my basic human rights, including my right to freedom of expression and right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion. It seems that under the present circumstances, the only way for me to protect my rights is to not go to Iran,” said the 29-year-old in her post which went viral on social media. 
The tournament is to be held in Hamadan from July 26 to August 4. 
 Swaminathan, ranked 97 in the world among women chess players, further remarked that she was “disappointed” to see that player’s rights and welfare being given scant importance while organising official championships.
Rebuking chess authorities for not taking the players’ considerations into account while choosing venues, Swaminathan said: “I understand the organizers expecting us to wear our national team dress or formals or sporting attire for our games during official championships, but surely there is no place for an enforceable religious dress code in Sports.”
She further asserted that despite certain compromises a sportsperson might make, “some things could not be compromised upon.”
In 2016, Indian pistol shooter Heena Sidhu had similarly pulled out of the Asian Airgun Shooting Championship in Iran owing to the compulsory hijab rule for women athletes.
In 2016, Georgian-American chess champion Nazi Paikidze boycotted the world championship in Tehran, taking to Instagram to call the hijab law “oppressive”.
In 2017 the Iranian Chess Federation banned 19-year-old Dorsa Derakhshani – the country’s second woman international chess master - for attending competitions abroad without wearing the headscarf, compelling her to play from the U.S. side.

Wrestling: Tomar qualifies
","The wrestling squad for the Asian Games was finally completed after Sandeep Tomar won the selection trials in the 57kg freestyle category at the Sai Training Centre in Sonepat on Tuesday.
Rio Olympian Tomar got the better of Utkarsh Kale to book his spot following the three-way tie that was necessitated after three main wrestlers — Tomar, Kale and Ravi Kumar — were tied on points during the earlier trials. Tomar fought back from being 2-6 down to level scores and was declared winner by virtue of winning the last scoring point. Kale beat Ravi 10-0 in the other bout. 
CWG gold medallist Rahul Aware, on whose request the trials had been delayed by almost a week to get more time to prepare, withdrew citing injury. Wrestling Federation of India officials said he had submitted a medical certificate claiming a ligament tear in his right knee.
Meanwhile, trials in three of the remaining four freestyle non-Olympic weight categories for the World Championships were also completed with Pankaj Rana (70kg), Sachin Rathi (79kg) and CWG bronze medallist Sombir (92kg) ensuring their spots. 
Trials in the 61kg would be held at a later stage to allow wrestlers from 57kg also to participate if they manage to make the grade.
Also, as reported earlier, trials for World Championships in the 65kg and 74kg would be held after the Asian Games. Bajrang Punia and Sushil Kumar were named directly in the Asiad squad. While Bajrang would face Praveen (lone entry in 65kg), Sushil would take on the winner of preliminary trials in the 74kg, to be held at a later date. 
The preliminary trials were postponed after a request from Praveen Rana, Sushil’s closest competitor, following the passing away of his mother.
In the Greco-Roman trials in non-Olympic weight categories, Gaurav (63kg), Vijay (55kg), Kuldeep Malik (72) and Manjeet (82kg) qualified for the World Championships.

“It feels great to go out there and win a championship with these guys the way we did it. To finish it off with a sweep feels so good,” said Stephen Curry.
LeBron James, playing his eighth consecutive finals, scored 23 points, grabbed seven rebounds and passed off eight assists but fell to 3-6 in the finals for his career.
He revealed after the game he had been playing with a broken right hand for the past three games.

Making a mockery of World rankings, the 108th ranked Sanil upstaged Commonwealth Games silver medallist and World No. 22 Aruna Quadri 2-1, to follow his straight-set victory over the Nigerian last season. 
The left-handed Sanil, who appeared too tentative during the Pune leg, reproduced his aggressive best that helped the side win the title last year. Significantly, Sanil came good on a day when the team needed to lift itself from the bottom of the table, having tallied just 15 points from two encounters. 
Moving up in placings
As things stand, after three rounds, Falcons (30 points) is placed third while Warriors (27) have slipped to fifth. For Warriors, unless World No 15 Chih Yuan Chuang, Quadri and 47th-ranked Sharath Kamal come good in the remaining two rounds, a semifinal spot looks difficult. 
Sanil, even after defeating Quadri was not done with Warriors. He returned to the arena in the company of Bernadette Szocs and stunned Sharath and Sofia Polcanova in mixed doubles. 
The 36th-ranked Szocs, laid low by indisposition, also contributed by shocking 18th-ranked Sofia 2-1 in a match where every set was decided on ‘golden point’. 
England’s Liam Pitchford, ranked 49th, played his part to perfection by upsetting Chih Yuan Chuang 2-1 and then stopped an error-prone Sharath by a similar margin to remain unbeaten in four encounters. 
Warriors’ lone victory came when 51st-ranked Hana Matelova bounced back to stop Sutitha Mukherjee. 
The results: Falcons bt Warriors 15-6 (Matilda Ekholm bt Pooja Saharabuddhe 11-4, 11-3, 11-5; Sanil Shetty bt Aruna Quadri 11-6, 5-11, 11-10; Sanil Shetty & Bernadette Szocs bt Sharath Kamal & Sofia Polcanova 11-4, 11-7, 11-9; Liam Pitchford bt Chih Yuan Chuang 11-10, 5-11, 11-7; Benadette Szocs bt Sofia Polcanova 10-11, 11-10, 11-10; Pitchford bt Sharath 11-9, 11-4, 10-11; Sutirtha Mukherjee lost to Hana Matelova 11-10, 3-11, 5-11).

TN triple jumper Praveen set to go places ","With his father Chithravel and uncle good at kabaddi, it did not take long for little C. Praveen to get hooked to that sport. Chithravel also used to take Praveen frequently to Thanjavur district athletics meets where the youngster did well in the long jump.
Praveen attended the SDAT Sports Hostel trials one day and found himself in Chennai where he began specialising in the long and triple jumps under coach Indira Suresh.
On Saturday, the 17-year-old produced an impressive 16.22m triple jump as he won the Tamil Nadu State senior championship gold in Tirunelveli.
That made Praveen the world’s seventh best jumper in the under-18 category.
“Everything went perfectly on my final jump,” Praveen, who has now moved to Nagercoil after his SDAT coach Indira was transferred there, told The Hindu on Monday.
He bettered his personal best, the 15.66m at the recent junior Federation Cup in Coimbatore that helped him qualify for next month’s under-20 Worlds in Finland, with his third jump (15.67) and also had a 15.99 before the big one.
That saw him getting a call to join the National camp in Thiruvananthapuram and is expected on Tuesday.
“He has good speed, good legs and is very aggressive in his jumps. I know what he is capable of,” said Romanian Bedros Bedrosian, the long and triple jumps National coach. 
Indira and Praveen travel to Tirunelveli’s Anna Stadium, a two-hour bus ride away, thrice a week as there is a synthetic track there.
Praveen is also preparing for the Youth Olympics’ Asia qualification meet which begins in Bangkok on July 4.
“My goal is to do 16.50m this year,” he said. That really sounds good!

Indian junior squash team will win a medal: Mishra ","Three sessions a day for three weeks. The Indian boys have been training hard for the last three days at the ISA courts to make their mark in a tough field at the World junior (under-19) championships to be held here between July 18 and 29.
Deepak Mishra, head coach of the boys’ team, while admitting it would be difficult for India to win a medal, he expected the boys to create an upset or two in the individual section and aim for a fifth-place finish in the team event.
“In the last edition [Bielsko-Biała] in 2016, our boys finished sixth, and we are keen to go one better,” said the 23-year-old Mishra.
Mishra was hopeful of Utkarsh Baheti, Veer Chotrani and Yash Fatde making a impact and creating a few upsets. 
“The boys have been putting in a lot of hard work in training. I hope that they cause a few upsets,” he said. “If any of our boys could reach the quarterfinals, it will be a big thing.”
Tough going, but...
Cyrus Poncha, the National coach, who is also the tournament director for the World juniors, conceded that the boys were very young and hence would find the going difficult. He was optimistic of the same boys doing well at the World juniors two years later. “We will win a medal and [hopefully] a gold then,” said Poncha.
Meanwhile, in the draw released on Tuesday, defending champions Marwan Tarek and Rowan Elaraby of Egypt have been given top billing in the boys’ and girls’ sections respectively.
The top 16 boys seeds comprise six Egyptians, three Englishmen, two Malaysians apart from players from USA, Canada, Mexico, Colombia and Switzerland. On the other hand, the women’s seedings has players from Egyot, Malaysia, England, Hong Kong, USA and Scotland with Egypt looking to capture the team title for the eighth year in a row.

Chinese Taipei too good for India
","The second-seeded Chinese Taipei outclassed India 3-0 in the semifinals of the Asia Oceania World Junior under-14 girls’ tennis tournament at here on Friday.
On a day when China knocked out top seed Australia 2-1, Chinese Taipei was ruthless, especially in the singles.
Shivani Ingle was blanked in 42 minutes by Pei Hsuan Chen. It was a chastening experience for Shivani after she had meted out similar treatment to Darya Detkovskaya of Kazakhstan on Thursday.
Sathwika Sama battled better against the big-serving and sweet-stroking I-Hsuan Cho, but managed to eke out only three games. Sathwika even managed a break once in the first set.
What was clear was the sound basics of the Taipei girls and the inability of the Indian girls to keep pace in the rallies, even though they tried with all the energy that they could muster. The tendency to wait for the ball rather than pounce on it was the major difference.
In running hard for retrievals, the Indian girls invariably played into the hands of their opponents who crisply belted the ball all over the court.
The learning curve may continue when India faces Australia on Saturday, in the match for the third place, on the relatively quicker court No.2.
Having met their match in China, which was well served by the tall Tang Qianhui who won both her singles and doubles rubbers, the Aussie girls will be keen to finish the tournament on a strong note.

The results (semifinals): China bt Australia 2-1 [Tang Qianhui bt Baijing Lin 7-5, 6-3; Nima Zhuoma lost to Destanee Aiava 2-6, 1-6; Guo Meiqi and Tang Qianhui bt Destanee Aiava and Baijing Lin 6-7(4), 6-3, 6-2].
Chinese Taipei bt India 3-0 [Pei-Hsuan Chen bt Shivani Ingle 6-0, 6-0; I-Hsuan Cho bt Sathwika Sama 6-2, 6-1; Pei-Hsuan Chen and Yang Lee bt Aarja Chakraborty and Sathwika Sama 6-4, 6-4].

United puts it past Smashers
","In a dream comeback, Maharashtra United bounced back from 2-7 to shock table-topper Dabang Smashers 12-9 as Romania’s Elizabeta Samara and A. Amalraj provided a late impetus in a thrilling encounter of the Ultimate Table Tennis league here on Saturday. 
United’s late burst, winning the last seven sets, pushed into the background the winning efforts of Japanese Sakura Mori.
For United, Portugal’s Joao Monteiro started the comeback by playing way above his World ranking of 71 to down 27th-ranked Japanese Yoshida Masaki. 
Samara, having recovered from a twisted ankle suffered on Thursday, presented herself to play two singles and showed what grit is all about. 
Ranked 19th in the world, she soaked in the pressure to beat 17-year-old Adriana Diaz, ranked 38th, 2-1 and saved her best against Manika in the final singles. 
In between Samara’s victories, Amalraj shook off his run of disappointments by winning his first singles match, that too, against World No. 52 Cedric Nuytinck who suffered his first loss in three outings. 
Amalraj, having lost three singles matches after blowing away comfortable leads, finally produced his best and blanked the Belgian and then celebrated in his signature style — jumping and roaring in joy!
The results: 
Maharashtra United bt Dabang Smashers 12-9 (Madhurika Patkar lost to Sakura Mori 4-11, 8-11, 9-11; Kristian Karlsson bt G. Sathiyan 6-11, 11-10, 11-8; A. Amalraj & Lily Zhang lost to G.

Sindhu survives a stern test
","It proved to be a truly testing day for the host at the $350,000 India Open on Friday. Moreover, coach P. Gopi Chand could only watch helplessly as a vast majority of his trainees tumbled without stretching their rivals.
One after another, B. Sai Praneeth, Sameer Verma and P. Kashyap lost in straight games and left the men’s singles draw without any home interest. Shockingly, this is the second successive year when the men semifinals is without an Indian.
If that was not disappointing enough for spectators present at the Siri Fort Indoor Complex, the meek surrender of Saina Nehwal came as a shock.
The saving grace was the survival of defending champion P.V. Sindhu and the Pranav Chopra-N. Sikki Reddy combine. Sindhu’s preparedness was severely tested as she needed a decider to stay alive unlike the convincing display from Pranav and Sikki. 
Saina’s first defeat in four meetings to USA’s Beiwen Zhang was followed the exit of Olympic champion Carolina Marin. 
Down 0-6 in the first two minutes meant Saina was never allowed to settle down. She struggled through the 12-minute opening game, hardly finding her feet and the ‘feel’ for the strokes. In the second game, Zhang showed that Saina had very little left in the tank. 
A panting Saina, a finalist last Sunday in the Indonesian Masters, began to err in judgements and sent the shuttles long on the ‘big’ points, including the match-point. 
Zhang, who represented Singapore before falling out with her Chinese coach and moving to the US three years ago, will now take on another surprise semifinalist, Hong Kong’s Cheung Ngan Yi, the conqueror of Marin 21-12, 21-19.
Earlier, Sindhu had to deal with 13-20 deficit in the second game against Marin’s teammate Beatriz Corrales. Sindhu then saved six game points to reach 19-20 before the Spaniard levelled and forced the decider following a ‘lucky point’ off the net-chord. But those six points helped Sindhu regain her self-belief and she raced through the decider. 
In the one-sided men quarterfinals, Iskandar Zulkarnain, the conqueror of K. Srikanth, advanced at the expense of Sameer. Chinese Taipei’s Chou Tien Chen raced past Praneeth after Kashyap began the trend with a straight-game defeat against China’s Qiao Bin.
Quarterfinal results: Men: Qiao Bin (Chn) bt P. Kashyap 21-16, 21-18; Chou Tien Chen (Tpe) bt B. Sai Praneeth 21-15, 21-13; Shi Yuqi (Chn) bt Wang Tzu Wei (Tpe) 21-13, 21-12; Iskandar Zulkarnain (Mal) bt Sameer Verma 21-17, 21-14.
Women: P.V. Sindhu bt Beatriz Corrales (Esp) 21-12, 19-21, 21-11; Ratchanok Intanon (Tha) bt Yip Pui Yin (Hkg) 21-11, 21-11; Beiwen Zhang (USA) bt Saina Nehwal 21-10, 21-13; Cheung Ngan Yi (Hkg) bt Carolina Marin (Esp) 21-12, 21-19.
Doubles (involving Indians): Men: Marcus Fenaldi Gideon & Kevin Sanjaya Sukamuljo (Ina) bt Manu Attri & Sumeeth Reddy 21-11, 21-15. Women: Du Yue & Li Yinhui (Chn) bt Ashwini Ponnappa & Sikki Reddy 21-17, 23-21; Jongkolphan Kititharakul & Rawinda Prajongjai (Tha) bt J. Meghna & Poorvisha Ram 21-10, 21-15.
Mixed doubles: Pranav Chopra & Sikki Reddy bt Han Chengkai & Cao Tong Wei (Chn) 2-8, 21-13; Mathias Christiansen & Christinna Pedersen (Den) bt Satwiksairaj Rankireddy & Ashwini Ponnappa 21-17, 21-11.

Gangjee lies fifth in Singapore; SSP, Lahiri, Jeev make cut
","Rahil Gangjee overcame a double bogey and two other bogeys to bring home a second round card of five-under 67 to move to 11-under and tied fifth place at The Championships at Laguna National in Singapore on Friday.
Gangjee, who completed three holes from his first round in the morning, finished first round at six—under 66.
He was the best among the Indians, while SSP Chowrasia, a city-mate of Gangjee from Kolkata in India, added a second successive 68 to get to eight-under and tied 15th place.
Gangjee is winless since his first and only Asian Tour win 10 years back in his rookie year 2004.
Last week’s winner, Anirban Lahiri showed amazing powers of recovery as he bounced back from two double bogeys and another bogey on front nine to shoot a 70 that included six other birdies and an eagle on par-5 15th.
He had two bogeys and two doubles in a roller-coaster of a round, which brought him to seven-under 137 and tied 34th place. Also making the cut were veteran Jeev Milkha Singh (67-72) and Chiragh Kumar (69-70) in tied 48th place. But Digvijay Singh (68-73), Rashid Khan (72-70), Shiv Kapur (74-68), Himmat Rai (76-68) and Jyoti Randhawa (77-72) missed the cut, which fell four-under.
Meanwhile at the top, Thailand’s Panuphol Pittayarat did not wilt under the tropical heat and continued to take the lead after signing for a four-under-par 68 in the second round.
Panuphol stayed ahead of the chasing pack with his two-day total of 13-under-par 131 even as Australia’s Scott Hend, Korean-American David Lipsky and Chile’s Felipe Aguilar put pressure on him by trailing closely by one shot at the $1.5 million event sanctioned by the Asian Tour and European Tour.
Gangjee, who is seeking to end a decade-long title drought on the Asian Tour, got back into the mix after signing for a 67 to share fifth place with Korea’s Baek Seuk-hyun and Denmark’s Anders Hansen.
Gangjee said, “My putting was very good today. I didn’t hit it as well as I did in the last couple of weeks. The greens are really good here and I’ve been putting well for the last two rounds, especially today. I had a few bad drives on holes 16 and 17 which resulted in a double-bogey and bogey respectively.
“However, I managed to recover with birdies on the next two holes after that. It was a good comeback.”
Talking of low scores, he said, “I would say the course is rather easy because the greens are in good condition. It was easy to read the lines and the speeds are good. I will keep myself hydrated for tomorrow and have a good rest tonight so I can get my energy up for the next two rounds.”
Panuphol said, “The weather is really hot today. The two birdies in my last three holes were nice to end off my round and that cooled me down a bit. I really wanted to make that long putt (on 18) to take the outright lead and I am happy I did it,” said Panuphol.
Panuphol has not featured in the weekend rounds since the start of the season and he is delighted with his new-found position on the leaderboard this week.
Meanwhile Hend, a five-time Asian Tour winner, took advantage of his booming drives to remain in the hunt for another victory on the region’s premier Tour.
The Australian, who topped the Asian Tour driving distance category on four occasions in the last five years, was a figure of consistency as he overcame a four-shot deficit to hit the front in the morning.
A total of 72 players made the cut which was set at four-under.

Junior Davis Cup: Chinese Taipei proves too strong for India
","India’s aspirations of qualification were dashed ruthlessly by second seed Chinese Taipei in the quarterfinals of the Asia-Oceania Junior Davis Cup under-16 tennis tournament in Kuching, Malaysia, on Thursday.
Chinese Taipei proved too strong as it won both the singles and lost the inconsequential doubles. Paramveer Singh Bajwa managed to make a fight of it in three sets, but Alex Solanki was beaten 6-1, 6-0 in the second singles, featuring the No.1 players of the two countries. In the positional matches for the fifth to eighth places, fifth-seeded India will play eighth seed the Philippines.
In other quarterfinals, Hong Kong shocked the third-seeded Australia 2-1, top seed Korea beat Uzbekistan 2-1 and fourth seed Japan got past the Philippines 3-0.

The results (quarterfinals): Chinese Taipei bt India 2-1 (Cing Yang Meng bt Paramveer Singh Bajwa 6-1, 3-6, 6-3; Tung Lin Wu bt Alex Solanki 6-1, 6-0; Chien Hsun Lo & Tung Lin Wu lost to Alex Solanki & B.R. Nikshep 1-6, 2-6).

Kabaddi Masters: India bests Pakistan again
","India shut out Pakistan 41-17 in the Kabaddi Masters Dubai 2018, at Al Wasl SC here on Monday. India’s status as tournament favourite remained unchallenged, as the side recorded a second-straight group stage victory over Pakistan.
A ‘Super Raid’ by Rohit Kumar early in the encounter gave India a 12-3 lead, and there was no looking back from there. A few minutes later, Rohit landed a hard side-kick to Nasir Ali’s stomach, which left the Pakistan skipper down for the count on the mat. 
Nasir was forced to take a medical timeout, which affected Pakistan’s chances of making a comeback.
Earlier, Iran edged out South Korea 31-27 in an exciting outing.
The results: Iran bt South Korea 31-27; India bt Pakistan 41-17.

In praise of the Slim Reaper: How Kevin Durant has changed NBA
","For the second season running, Kevin Durant was the Finals MVP, enabling the Golden State Warriors to repeat as champions. 
The Warriors-Cleveland Cavaliers tussle for glory (the fourth in four years, with the Warriors winning three) featured little competition this time. Durant helped apply the finishing touches, scoring points whenever Cavaliers threatened to keep it close, and playing suffocating defence against the great LeBron James and in the paint.
Few basketball connoisseurs will begrudge Durant his MVP awards. And no one who saw them will forget the dagger three-pointers that settled Game 3, both in 2017 and in 2018, away in Cleveland.
That said, despite his successes, Durant will not be spoken of in the same breath as LeBron, who will be credited with carrying a far inferior team deep into contention four seasons running. Durant, on the other hand, joined the world-beating Warriors that had broken the all-time regular season record in 2015-16 and had narrowly lost the Finals to a LeBron-inspired Cavs. There is merit to the argument that Durant, a former MVP who led the league in individual scoring in four of his first nine seasons at Oklahoma City Thunder, simply bandwagoned onto a team dripping with talent.
A squad that featured superstar Stephen Curry, his “splash-brother” Klay Thompson, Swiss army knife Draymond Green and versatile sixth man Andre Iguodala did not need Durant. His addition only launched the team further into the stratosphere of all-time greatness. For many critics, this diminishes Durant’s achievements; he will forever trail LeBron unless he drags a lesser squad to a title like The King did.
Durant has been discomfited by this argument, and has used the criticism to fuel his ambition. He has taken pay cuts to allow the Warriors to retain its strong talent. More importantly, he has sought to better himself as a player. Durant’s trajectory from scoring freak to all-round lynchpin is worth studying before judging him.
Durant was picked second in the 2007 draft by Seattle Supersonics, who later became Oklahoma City Thunder. Within a few years, Thunder became a powerful contender in the Western Conference — first as an athletic, three-headed scoring monster (forward Durant, point guard Russell Westbrook and shooting guard James Harden) and later as an all-round team. Durant was a key element of both units. He used his freakish length and unusual silkiness in jump-shots and guard-like play (despite being 7ft tall) to overpower perimeter defenders. He could also play one-on-one at the post, run hard and finish in transition.
Glory evaded the Thunder teams for various reasons — Harden was traded after they reached the 2012 Finals due to salary cap issues, and injuries sabotaged their chances. But primarily, Thunder seemed a squad where the sum of the individual talent was greater than the actual output, and Durant was partly responsible. He played in a one-dimensional offensive system that depended upon ‘hero-ball’.
Thunder’s best season, ironically, was Durant’s last. In 2015-16, they came close to upending defending champion Warriors. They led 3-1 in the series and were cruising in Game 6 before a Klay Thompson special put paid to their chances. During the Playoffs, Durant showed dramatic improvement in his defensive game — he played his height, his shot-blocking in the paint was first-rate — and commentators wondered if it was only a matter of time before Thunder caught up with Warriors. It was not to be, as Durant promptly switched to the Bay Area later in the off-season.
Despite the criticism of this decision, Durant has shown that his all-round performance in the 2015-16 Playoffs was no fluke. His shot-blocking has been off the charts as a Warrior, he has retained his efficient scoring (eased as it is in a stellar offensive system), and has adapted to playing both in the perimeter and in the paint. In sum, Durant has achieved what he set out to — develop as player and become the lynchpin of a phenomenal squad, forcing the competition to keep up. He deserves to be appreciated for this, even though not everyone can find it within them to cherish him.

Kamalraj, Ajit strike it rich
","He had planned a big jump here on Sunday. But, shortly after his first jump, a 15.75m, Tamil Nadu triple jumper K. Kamalraj felt a severe pain in his ankle. He attempted a second round, thought it was something like 16.50m but it was flagged down as a foul.
Still, Kamalraj’s first attempt was good enough for gold in the 19th Asian junior championships. India won another gold, through Ajit Kumar in the men’s 5000m, and finished third in the medals table with 17, including five gold, two silver and 10 bronze.
“My body was in top shape here. I was definitely hoping to cross 16.50m and break the National record (Arpinder Singh’s 16.45m), now I feel very bad, very sad. The ankle pain spoiled everything,” he told The Hindu.
The 18-year-old Tirupur triple jumper, who was coached by former international Nizamuddin, is now being trained by National jumps coach Bedros Bedrosian in Thiruvananthapuram. 
“I felt pain right from the first jump. Now, the doctors have told me to take a week’s rest,” he said.
Kamalraj, who has a personal best 16.41m which came last year, has already qualified for the next month’s under-20 Worlds.
There were no such worries for the Allahabad-based Ajit as he clocked a personal best 14:15.24s (previous best 14:38.10s) for the men’s 5000m gold. He had clocked a personal best in the 1500m earlier but it was only good enough for sixth place.
Meanwhile, the Indian women’s 4x400m relay team — the defending champion — was pipped at the post by Japan and had to be content with the silver.
The Indian squad, comprising Jisna Mathew, Subha Venkatesan, Nidhi Yogendra Singh and Rachna, clocked 3:41.11s.
Jisna, clearly one of the big stars of the championship with her 400m gold earlier, also won a bronze in the women’s 200m.
The results (gold medallists and Indians): Men: 200m: 1. Wei Tai-Sheng (Tpe) 21.05s.
5000m (Ind): 1. Ajit Kumar 14:15.24s; 5. Gurpreet 14:28.57.

Edging closer towards titles
","While Bayern Munich might have won the Bundesliga and Borussia Dortmund secured second place and a Champions League spot in Germany, its going down to the wire in the other leagues. While Juventus lead Roma by eight points with three matches left in the Serie A, PSG lead Monaco by the same margin with three games to go.
Closer still is the Premier League and La Liga, both of which continues to be three horse races. With two games to go, Liverpool are the current leaders in England with 80 points, followed by Chelsea, who are two points behind. Manchester City are third with 77 points, but they have a game in hand and a superior goal difference. David Moyes, manager of defending champion Manchester United, was sacked, to be replaced by interim manager Ryan Giggs (picture).
Former Barcelona coach Tito Vilanova died of throat cancer at the age of 45 and an emotional Barca team paid tributes for the late manager. They are now second in the league with 84 points, four behind Atletico Madrid with three matches to go. Real Madrid are third with 82 points, with a game in hand.
If it was an all-German final in the Champions League last year, there is a shift of power towards Spain this time around. There will be a Madrid derby on May 24 at Lisbon, Portugal as Atletico knocked out Chelsea and Real accounted for holders Bayern in the semi-finals.

The Gopi controversy should’ve been avoided: Prakash Padukone
","The allegations of bias and favouritism levelled against National coach P. Gopi Chand following the selection of his daughter Gayathri Gopi Chand in the Asian Games squad was something Indian badminton could have done without, feels legend Prakash Padukone.
“It should have been avoided,” Padukone told The Hindu on the sidelines of the IIMB Alumni Association’s IIMBue Annual Leadership Conclave. 
“It has come after a long time. So many good things have happened for Indian badminton and in the last two to three years there hasn’t been any negativity. It was not required.”
The Indian women’s squad for Jakarta will have six singles players and four doubles specialists. The selection of youngsters Akarshi Kashyap and Gayathri as extra singles players instead of a third doubles pair prompted Aparna Balan, a doubles exponent, to cry foul. While refusing to cast aspersions on the decision makers, Padukone conceded there were no straight answers.
“You can argue both ways. For the youngsters it’s more for exposure. But there is no specialist doubles pair as a standby now. We have to make one of the singles players play doubles [in case of an injury]. This was a question of interpretation. I think they have been fair. There was no conflict of interest as such. There is a selection committee and meetings have been held. Everybody's views have been taken and it’s a majority decision. I don’t think one person has [made the choice].”
The former All-England champion in fact gave a thumbs up to the rejigged selection process. Starting from the Thomas & Uber Cup, the Badminton Association of India (BAI) has introduced selection tournaments to pick players which ensures that along with international ranking, domestic performances count too.
Wise thing
“I am personally in favour of it. People should be selected on present form. They have done the wise thing by excluding top players. Everybody else needs to compete. Earlier, it was more subjective. Only those in the core group would get an opportunity to play. They will never play any domestic tournament. In this, you do well in two selection tournaments, you get to play two events and then the selection tournaments happen again. So nobody is guaranteed a place [forever].”
To what extent the changes will prove right remains to be seen but Padukone was confident of a decent showing at the Asian Games. 
In the 2014 edition, India won a bronze in the women’s team event, the country’s first medal since 1986 Seoul, while Syed Modi remains the only individual medallist (bronze, Delhi 1982).
“We have done well at all the important events. We have done well even at the Olympics. But it will be tough because most of the top badminton-playing nations are from Asia. It is almost like the Olympics or the World Championship.
“You have to beat two good teams to win a medal especially if you are vying for gold or silver. This is more so in a team event. You need to be good in both singles and doubles but below Saina [Nehwal] and [P.V.] Sindhu there is a fairly big gap. So it won’t be easy.""

Woods takes prime position as challengers falter ","A charging Tiger Woods was leading the British Open with nine holes to play on Sunday as defending champion and overnight co-leader Jordan Spieth began to feel the strain.
Woods, the 14-times Major champion began the day four shots adrift of fellow Americans Spieth, Xander Schauffele and Kevin Kisner but was leading as he reached the turn on seven-under.
The 42-year-old, who won the last of his 14 Majors a decade ago, has rolled back the clock at Carnoustie and after a sizzling third-round 66 he was at it again.
Playing in his traditional last-day red shirt, Woods continued to turn the screws. A deafening roar reverberated around the course when he sunk a long birdie putt on the fourth. Then at the sixth he rolled in an eight-footer.
With the strong westerly breeze causing havoc at the top of the leaderboard, Woods played the opening nine holes in 34 strokes.
Spieth and Schauffele had begun steadily but both came to grief with bogeys on the fifth.
When Spieth double-bogeyed the next after needing a penalty drop out of a gorse bush and Schauffele followed suit with a double on the seventh, Woods found himself leading a Major on a Sunday for the first time since 2011.
He was one stoke ahead of playing partner Francesco Molinari who began his final round with 10 straight pars.
The predicted winds materialised on cue to add an extra ingredient to what was already looking like a thrilling climax. Only three of the first 42 players to complete their rounds on Sunday scored in the 60s.
Kisner, who had begun the day on nine-under with Spieth and Schauffele, suffered a dreadful start with a double bogey at the second and a bogey at the third to slip back, although he responded with a chip-in birdie at the fifth.
Two more bogeys followed but a birdie at the 10th kept him in the hunt at six under.
Four-times Major champion Rory McIlroy was another to struggle. He began the day at five-under but dropped two shots in his opening seven holes to slip back to three-under. 
India's promising young golfer Shubhankar Sharma said making the cut was the best possible birthday present he could have wished for.
Shubhankar, who turned 22 on Saturday, carded a final round of two-over-par 73 to finish four-over.
“It's the best birthday present that I could have had. Really happy with whatever happened this week. I would say I felt the pressure on the second day, a little bit, when I was outside the cut line and really wanted to play the weekend,” said the Indian

‘Indian swimmers need top-class facilities’
","S. Pradeep Kumar, 53, the current National swimming coach and a Dronacharaya Award winner, who has trained many who have gone on to represent India in the Olympics, spoke to The Hindu while attending the Karnataka State sub-junior and junior aquatic championships 2018. Excerpts.
What do think is the present scene in Indian swimming?
The scene is not so encouraging. Indian swimmers perform well in Asian age group competitions, but are not up to Olympic standards yet. To come to that standard we require many things. We need better facilities, a lot more financial back-up and support.
Sajan Prakash and Shivani Kataria represented India in 2016 Rio Olympics. We should not compare our swimmers with those who are winning medals in Olympics. We should have a huge talent pool of swimmers from which we can choose the best.
We should also have specialists in stroke technique, physiology, physical fitness, nutrition expert and video analysis to support the system. The coach can work alongside them and improve their skills.
Do you think the system needs a revamp?
Indian swimmers choose academics when they graduate to the senior level. Parents don’t continue to invest more money on swimming, and this is where private funding is necessary.
Top class swimmers need to train under a long-term coach and also need proper exposure by taking part in stiffer competitions abroad often. Then we can see some changes happening.

","Young Adriana Diaz showed nerves of steel to help Dabang Smashers TTC return from throes of defeat and win the first semifinal against Maharashtra United 11-10 in the CEAT Ultimate Table Tennis here on Friday. 
The 17-year-old trailed 1-7 in the final game against Madhurika Patkar before she made a spectacular turnaround to win it 11-9. She then won the next two games to douse the hopes of United, which had led 10-8 before the final match and needing to win just a game to secure a final berth. 
Elizabeta Samara had weathered a troublesome ankle to get the better of Manika Batra 2-1 in the first match to help United gain an early lead. A. Amalraj then stunned World No. 27 Yashida Masaki to give United a 4-2 lead. 
The 32-year-old, who made his intentions clear by taking an 8-1 lead in the first game, dominated his opponent to win 11-4, 11-8, 7-11. 
Smashers turned it around with its unbeaten pair of G. Sathiyan and Sakura Mori winning the mixed doubles against Amalraj and Lily Zhang 2-1. World No. 52 Cedric Nuytinck fetched another success for Smashers by winning the fourth match (men’s singles) against United captain Joao Monteiro before Mori repeated the scoreline of 2-1 against Lily to give Smashers a 8-7 lead after the fifth match. 
The sixth match saw World No. 18 Kristian Karlsson blank Sathiyan 3-0 to give United a sizeable 10-8 lead before Adriana had her own plans in the final match.
The result: Dabang Smashers bt Maharashtra United 11-10 (Manika Batra lost to Elizabeta Samara 11-8, 9-11, 11-10, Yoshida Masaki lost to A. Amalraj 11-4, 11-8, 7-11; G.

Cavaliers will need James to sustain his spectacular play ","Cleveland Cavaliers coach Tyronn Lue has said the 124-114 defeat by the Golden State Warriors in Game One of the NBA Finals on Thursday was painful but provided valuable insights into how to dethrone the champion.
The Cavs led with less than a minute left in regulation and but for an overturned foul call on Warriors’ Kevin Durant and a miscue by Cavs guard J.R. Smith at the end of the fourth quarter, the game could easily have had a different result.
The underdog Cavs used their length to out-rebound the Warriors and were able to slow down the tempo of the game, allowing LeBron James to score 51 points by isolating hapless Warriors defenders and setting the table for a near upset.
“It was a tough game for us. We played well enough to win but we didn’t,” Lue told reporters. “Our guys’ confidence is not shaken. We see what we need to do and how we need to perform to win. So we have the blueprint, now we just need to execute at a higher level.”
Cavs guard George Hill said they feel as confident as ever and are eager to avenge the loss when the teams meet for Game Two on Sunday.
“Everyone in this locker room felt we gave this one away and we missed the opportunity,” he told reporters. “We have a game on Sunday to make up for it and do the best we can to get back on the right track.”
To even the series the Cavs will need James to carry over his spectacular play from Thursday, which included eight rebounds and eight assists along with his monster scoring performance.
“He did everything he could to will our team to win,” Lue said. “He showed his team on the biggest stage how you have to play to beat this team and he did a great job of that.”
Asked if James could play any better than he did on Thursday, Lue laughed. “I hope so,” he said.
“I know it’s asking a lot but we need him to lead by example, being aggressive and attacking the basket. He he’s got to keep it up.”

Badminton: Lakshya wins Asian junior crown ","Lakshya Sen on Sunday became only the third Indian shuttler to secure a gold medal at the Badminton Asia junior championships after defeating World junior champion Kunlavut Vitidsarn of Thailand in straight games in the final.
The sixth-seeded Indian from Uttarakhand, who had won a bronze in the last edition, notched up 21-19, 21-18 upset win over Vitidsarn in the summit clash that clocked 46 minutes.
Late Gautam Thakkar (1965) and Olympic silver medallist P.V. Sindhu (2012) had won the prestigious title earlier. Sindhu had won a bronze as well in 2011, while Sameer Verma won a silver and bronze in 2011 and 2012 and the pair of Pranav Chopra & Prajkta Sawant bagged a bronze in 2009.
The Badminton Association of India has announced a cash reward of ₹10 lakh for Lakshya.
“I am happy to win the tournament. It will boost my confidence. I played in the team event and then in the individual event, so it was a long tournament. The focus was on recovering well after each match and I am happy I could play well and win,” said Lakshya.
“I got a very good support from team members as well. This Asian Junior gold is precious to me. 
“The win against the second-seeded Chinese the other night helped me. I carried my confidence further and beat the fourth-seed in the semifinals. And today, I played my natural game to beat Kunlavut. Since it was our first meeting, I played without any pressure, he added.
“It was very hectic. In fact, ahead of the tournament I had to tweak my training a bit as I had suffered shin splints. During the tournament also I had to take pills sometimes to curb the pain,” he said.

Paddlers left stranded at Delhi airport
"," The Indian table tennis contingent’s performance at the ITTF Australia Open could suffer after seven of the 17 squad members, including Commowealth Games double gold medallist Manika Batra, were disallowed to board a flight at the Indira Gandhi International Airport.
The Indian contingent had to leave for Melbourne for the Australian Open, scheduled to start on Wednesday.
The players were stunned to hear only 10 of them could board the aircraft since the plane had been overbooked. Batra vented her anger out on Twitter, prompting Sports Authority of India (SAI) director general to step and make alternative arrangements.
Seven squad members, including paddlers Batra, Madhurika Patkar, Mouma Das, Harmeet Desai, head coach Massimo Costantini and support staff members Kishore Dey and Amarjeet Singh thus were scheduled to board a Singapore Airline flight late on Sunday night. 
It will mean the players would arrive in Melbourne barely 12 hours before their first match.
“It is extremely unfortunate that the players’ performance would suffer due to Air India’s mismanagement,” M.P. Singh, secretary general of Table Tennis Federation of India, told The Hindu. 
“Thanks to the intervention of other relevant authorities, alternate arrangements are made, which would at least ensure that the players would not miss out on the tournament. ”

Eyeing her first major title, Dipika Pallikal slipped in the final hurdle, losing 7-11, 11-5, 7-11 in the final against Nour El Sherbini in the Texas Open.

Sneha Sivakumar’s best bests Ingy Hammouda
","Sneha Sivakumar couldn’t have chosen a better city, unwittingly so, to showcase her wares. Born to parents from Chennai, the 17-year-old, representing Singapore, produced her career-best performance yet in the WSF-World junior squash championships here.
Sneha snuffed out a stiff challenge from Ingy Hammouda of Egypt, seeded nine, 7-11, 11-6, 13-11, 7-11, 11-9 on Friday in a cliff-hanger of a pre-quarterfinal that lasted 60 minutes at the ISA courts. 
In another upset, Egypt’s Farida Mohamed, younger sister of former world junior champion (2014) Habiba Mohamed, defeated Aifa Azman of Malaysia, the third seed, 15-17, 11-7, 11-7, 4-11, 11-6. 
“I came into the tournament with not the best of draws. I thought I would be seeded. I am really happy with my display,” said Sneha. “I didn’t come here with a hope of reaching the quarterfinals. I hope to bring Singapore squash back to life.” 
True to expectations, 10 Egyptians have reached the quarterfinals. Top seeds Marwan Tarek (boys) and Rowan Reda Araby (girls) cruised to the last eight. 
Like many of Egypt’s players, Hammouda relied on power to outplay Sneha. The Singaporean, though, proved to be clever in her placements as she kept deceiving the ninth seed with immaculate drop shots and double boasts. 
Truth be said, Sneha was lucky in the decider. At 7-7, Hammouda appealed to the referee that Sneha had taken the ball which was ‘double bounce’, a rally that Sneha eventually won. Even the Singapore coaching staff sitting on the sidelines said as much, but the referee insisted that Sneha had indeed taken the ball on the first bounce.
From the quarterfinals onward, the tournament will be held at Express Avenue Mall. 
The results (pre-quarterfinals): Boys: 1-Marwan Tarek (Egy) bt George Crowne (Can) 11-6, 11-6, 9-11, 11-4 ; 5/8-Mostafa Montaser (Egy) bt 9/12-Yehia Elnawasany (Egy ) 9-11, 11-9, 11-7, 8-11, 12-10; 5/8-Nick Wall (Eng) bt 9/12-Matias Knudsen (Col) 11-8, 9-11, 11-5, 11-8; 3/4-Omar El Torkey (Egy) bt 13/16-Julien Gosset (Can) 11-7, 11-3, 9-11, 10-12, 11-9; 3/4-Mostafa El Serty (Egy) bt 13/16-Siow Yee Xian (Mas) 11-7, 11-9, 9-11, 11-9; 5/8-Darren Rahul Pragasam (Mas) bt 9/12-James Wyatt (Eng) 7-11, 11-7, 11-13, 11-1, 11-8; 5/8-Leonel Cardenas (Mex) bt James Flynn (Can) 11-7, 8-11, 11-5, 11-3; 2-Mostafa Asal (Egy) bt 13/16-Yannick Wilhelmi (Sui) 11-9, 11-5, 11-8.

Wrestling: Abdullaev stuns Naveen
","Indian grapplers faltered at the final hurdle on the penultimate day of the junior Asian wrestling championships here on Saturday, settling for silver in three of the five weight categories that saw action on the day and a bronze as the competition moved to the freestyle men’s category.
The biggest upset was Naveen losing to Gulomjon Abdullaev of Uzbekistan in the 57kg 7-1 despite being favourite for the title. The 20-year old Naveen, a trainee at the Chhatrasal Stadium for the past five years, had won bronze in the 2016 edition of the competition and though he managed to improve on that, there was disappointment writ large on his face.
“The gold went out in the beginning itself when the other guy took those four points at the end of the first round. Once I trailed 0-7, the mind went completely blank, there was nothing I could think of or even try to come back into the bout,” Naveen admitted.
It was a weak shoulder grip that let Naveen down as the Uzbek opponent pounced on his weakness to take of successive two-pointers to widen the gap. Naveen had defeated a much-stronger Iranian Reza Mohsen Alijanzadehjouybari 6-5 in the quarterfinals to stamp his authority here but was unable to repeat the performance in the final.
The gold medallist at the Asian Cadet championships in 2015, Naveen announced his potential when he defeated Rio Olympian Sandeep Tomar in the quarterfinals at the National Championships last year before finishing fifth.
It was also heartbreak for Vishal Kaliraman who started with a bang but went out with a whimper in the 70kg final to Iran's Amirhossein Morteza Gholi Kavousi, losing 10-7. Kaliraman back-flipped his opponent for four points but the Iranian kept pushing him out of the mat for points. The Indian did manage to level scores at 7-7 but fumbled with less than a minute left to finish second.
Sachin Giri, in his maiden international competition, was no match for Sajjad Saberali Gholami, surrendering in just 72 seconds in the 97kg while Karan, bronze medallist in the previous edition last year, ended with a bronze again in the 65kg.
The Standings: 57kg: Gulomjon Abdullaev (Uzb), Naveen (Ind), Almaz Smanbekov (Kgz) and Reza Mohsen Alijanzadehjouybari (Iri); 
65kg: Takuma Taniyama (Jpn), Ernazar Akmataliev (Kgz), Karan (Ind) and Amirhossein Azim Maghsoudi (Iri); 
70kg: Amirhossein Morteza Gholi Kavousi (Iri), Vishal Kaliraman (Ind), Kojiro Shiga (Jpn) and Nurkozha Kaipanov (Kaz); 
79kg: Sajjad Saberali Gholami (Iri), Sachin Giri (Ind), Mukhammadrasul Rakhimov (Uzb) and Takato Uchida (Jpn); 
97kg: Sajjad Gholamhossein Azizi (Iri), Serik Bakytkhanov (Kaz), Kunai Nurdavletov (Kgz) and Hynsu Han (Kor).

Gay suspended 1 year, returns Olympic silver medal
","Sprinter Tyson Gay accepted a one-year suspension on Friday after testing positive for a banned substance nearly a year ago and returned the silver medal he won in the men’s 400-meter relay at the 2012 London Olympics.
USADA announced on Friday that Gay’s one-year ban began on June 23, the day his sample was collected at the U.S. championships.
As part of the penalty, Gay, the American record-holder in the 100, also accepted loss of results dating to July 15, 2012, the date of when he first used a product that contained a banned substance. He was a member of the relay team at the London Games that finished second to a Jamaican team led by Usain Bolt. The Americans set a national record with a time of 37.04 seconds. He has given his medal back to the United States Olympic Committee.
USADA said in a statement that upon receiving notification of his positive tests, Gay voluntarily withdrew from all competition prior to the 2013 world championships and has not competed since.
The 31-year-old Gay could’ve been given a penalty twice as long, but received consideration after assisting USADA in the investigation into his positive test. USADA said he tested positive for the presence of an exogenous androgenic anabolic steroid.
“We appreciate Tyson doing the right thing by immediately withdrawing from competition once he was notified, accepting responsibility for his decisions, and fully and truthfully cooperating with us in our ongoing investigation into the circumstances surrounding his case,” USADA CEO Travis Tygart said in a statement.
In a statement released by USA Track and Field, CEO Max Siegel said the organization is “gravely disappointed any time an athlete uses performance-enhancing drugs, and Tyson Gay’s case serves as a lesson about the consequences of making poor decisions. We appreciate that Tyson accepted responsibility and has assisted USADA by providing information to help battle the use of PEDs.”
There are no major international meets in track this summer, but U.S. championships will be held June 26-29 in Sacramento, California. And while Gay could become eligible for that meet, the disqualification of his results dating to 2012 has taken away his qualifying time for the meet. He could petition the track and field committee for consideration, but USATF has said it hasn’t received such a petition yet.
Gay has until June 16 to enter a petition in order to gain entry into the meet.

No equestrian team for Asian Games ","A five-hour meeting between the Equestrian Federation of India (EFI) officials and the Indian Olympic Association (IOA) here on Thursday ended with the IOA deciding not to recommend a team for the Jakarta Asian Games, citing the inability of meeting the qualifying criteria set by the EFI itself.
“As of now, there is no team being fielded at the Asian Games,” EFI secretary-general Col. R.K. Swain told The Hindu adding that re-trials were not possible given the paucity of time. 
The decision, he said, was taken after discussing all factors including the medal-winning prospects of the teams. 
Small door open?
Sources, however, said a small door has been left open for participation depending on whether EFI president Lt. Gen Ashok Ambre is able to convince IOA president Narinder Batra of the team’s chances at a later date but chances are bleak.
There were also murmurs of the selection committee insisting on sending the same team as selected without any changes but Col. Swain refuted any such suggestions.
IOA officials, meanwhile, insisted that there was no point sending a team to make up the numbers. 
“When the teams haven’t been able to fulfil the EFI’s own qualifying criteria, how can they be fielded,” they questioned.
The EFI had on June 4 announced a seven-member team — four in eventing and three in show-jumping — despite only one meeting the 03 qualifying criteria in both events, keeping the “best interest of the sport” in mind.
Decision overtuned
Two days later, the EFI president, also the president of the selection committee, unilaterally overturned the decision of which he had been part with a blunt statement, “in view of the fact that NO rider has met the criteria for any of the team or individual events i.e. in eventing, showjumping and dressage, the selection of the team for eventing and show jumping stands cancelled”.

The Chinese qualification topper Li Xue was pushed to the bronze. There was not much support for Manu from Mahima Turhi Agrawal and Devanshi Rana, and thus the team could only fetch the bronze.

Koepka triumphant in title defence
","American Brooks Koepka putted brilliantly to win the U.S. Open by one stroke at Shinnecock Hills on Sunday, becoming the first player in almost 30 years to successfully defend his title.
England’s Tommy Fleetwood gave him a run for his money with a seven-under 63 that matched the lowest score in tournament history, but Koepka’s closing 68 saw him finish top of the leaderboard on one-over 281.
Dustin Johnson was left to ponder another Major that got away. After starting the day in a four-way tie for the lead with Koepka, Daniel Berger and Tony Finau, 2016 champion Johnson carded a 70 to finish two shots back in third place.
Masters champion Patrick Reed (68) was fourth, three strokes behind Koepka, after his early charge — five birdies on the first seven holes — faltered.
With the win, Koepka became the first player to win back-to-back U.S. Opens since Curtis Strange in 1988 and 1989.
The victory comes less than two months after Koepka returned from a left wrist injury, a partially torn tendon that had kept him out of action since January.
The 28-year-old had his work cut out to beat Fleetwood after everyone else stalled in conditions that were more conducive to good scores than on Saturday.
Fleetwood, playing more than two hours ahead of the overnight leaders and starting the day six shots off the pace, had threatened to steal a stunning victory after reeling off four consecutive birdies from the 12th hole.
He had good chances to birdie the final three holes but missed them all, including an uphill eight-footer at the last with history beckoning.
 Koepka birdied the 10th hole to take a two-shot lead at even par.
But just as it seemed he had grabbed the championship by the throat he misjudged his tee shot on the par-three 11th and watched his ball rocket over the crowned green and hurtle way beyond into the rough.
He did well to salvage bogey, sinking a 12-foot putt to stay ahead.
A hot putter kept him in front as he made clutch pars on the next three holes.
Needing only a bogey on the last to win, Koepka hooked his approach so far left it bounced off the base of a grandstand, but he pitched onto the green and lagged his first putt close before tapping in to earn victory. 
The results: 
281 - Brooks Koepka 75-66-72-68; 282 - Tommy Fleetwood 75-66-78-63; 283 - Dustin Johnson 69-67-77-70.

Ayhika and Manav cause a flutter
","The second day of the CEAT Ultimate Table Tennis belonged to the Indians as Ayhika Mukherjee and Manav Thakkar stunned top paddlers during the RP-SG Mavericks and Empowerji Challengers contest on Friday.
While Ayhika set the tone for Mavericks’ victory by surprising World No. 20 Lee Ho Ching of Hong Kong in the opening rubber, rising star Manav overpowered the China-born Ukrainian Kou Lei, the World No. 33, to pull things level for Challengers.
In the other matches, Harmeet Desai stretched Tiago Apolonia before losing 11-10 in the final game, while local girl Divya Deshpande, making her UTT debut, gave the fans at the Shree Shiv Chhatrapati sports complex plenty to cheer about despite going down to the seasoned Sabine Winter. Mavericks, though, had little trouble in winning the tie, with Winter sealing the deal by winning the opening game. 
Ayhika, after losing the opening game, used her long pimples to upstage Ching. She also minimised her errors, keeping her more fancied opponent under pressure. Manav then registered probably the biggest victory of his career by not letting Lei get into any rhythm. 
The results: RP-SG Mavericks bt Empowerji Challengers 13-8 (Ayhika Mukherjee bt Lee Ho Ching 4-11, 11-2, 11-5; Kou Lei lost to Manav Thakkar 4-11, 7-11, 11-10; Harmeet Desai & Doo Hoi Kem bt Arjun Ghosh & Lee Ho Ching 11-9, 11-8, 10-11; Mattias Karlsson bt Simon Gauzy 8-11, 11-7, 11-7; Doo Hoi Kem bt Georgina Pota 11-1, 11-8, 6-11; Harmeet lost to Tiago Apolonia 11-8, 6-11, 10-11; Sabine Winter bt Divya Deshpande 11-8, 11-9, 11-5.

The Gods were with them
","Kumar Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardene announced that the WT20 that concluded in April would be their last in the format. So when Messrs Duckworth and Lewis awarded the rain curtailed semi-final to Sri Lanka, West Indies captain Darren Sammy said, “I guess the Almighty wants them to leave on high...”.
That was exactly what happened, as India, undefeated till then in the tournament, succumbed to the Lankans in the final. Virat Kohli, player of the tournament and the backbone of India throughout the World Cup, acceded that Sammy was right. It was fitting that it was Sangakkara who led them to the victory in the final, ending a major trophy drought that has been stretching back for years. Australia, meanwhile, completed a hat-trick of WT20 titles in the women’s format.
Ten days after the final, and foes were now friends. The first leg of the IPL took place in the United Arab Emirates, but the crowds thronging the stadium made it look like it is at home. At the end of 20 matches, defending champions Mumbai Indians are still struggling to find a win, while Kings XI Punjab are on the other end of the spectrum, having won all five of their matches so far. The action now shifts to India in May.

World junior squash championships: An all-Egyptian boys’ semifinal ","That Egypt is quite synonymous with squash is a no-brainer. And the World junior squash championships here, as expected, it has turned out to be an exhibition of supremacy of the North African country.
The boys’ semifinals on Sunday of the Worlds at the Express Avenue Mall will be an all-Egyptian affair. In the girls’ category, Lucy Termel of England broke into the semifinal party.
If one has to pick a contest for its intensity, it has to be the one between Jana Shiha and the lower seeded Farida Mohamed, both from Egypt in the girls’ quarterfinals on Saturday. It was Shiha who emerged triumphant 7-11, 11-6, 11-5, 7-11, 15-13 in 51 minutes.
Shiha is a copy-book player with an array of shots while Farida is more of a player who relies on grit and fighting spirit.
The manner in which Shiha blew away Farida in the third game, it appeared that the 16-year-old would pocket the fourth and the match in a jiffy. But Farida fought back taking the match to the decider.
Unleashing winners and drop-shots from all corners, Shiha ran up a handy 9-5 lead and had three match points at 10-7, only to see Farida make a comeback. Shiha, however, finished the contest on her fifth match point while saving one on the way.
Egypt’s Mostafa Asal, seeded two, proved why he is rated as one of the best in the business, when he defeated Leonel Cardenas of Mexico 12-10, 11-7, 11-9.
Whenever he was trailing — be it 8-10 in the first game or 7-9 in the third — he raised his game with some unbelievable retrievals and deception. No wonder, the 17-year-old is spoken about in glowing terms by the squash fraternity.
Semifinal line-up: Boys: Marwan Tarek vs Omar El Torkey, Mostafa Asal vs Mostafa El Sorty; Girls: Rowan Reda Araby vs Jana Shiha, Lucy Termel vs Hania El Hammamy.
The results (Quarterfinals): Boys: 1-Marwan Tarek (Egy) bt 5-8 Mostafa Montaser (Egy) 11-8, 11-1, 11-5; 3-4 Omar El Turkey (Egy) bt 5-8 Nicholas Wall (Eng) 11-6, 11-3, 11-7; 3-4-Mostafa El Sorty (Egy) bt 5-8-Darren Rahul Pragasam (MAS) 4-11, 13-11, 6-11, 12-10, 11-6; 2-Mostafa Asal (Egy) bt 5-8 Leonel Cardenas (Mex) 12-10, 11-7, 11-9.
Girls: 1-Rowan Reda Araby (Egy) bt 5-8 Hana Moataz (Egy) 12-10, 11-6, 11-3; 5-8 Jana Shiha (Egy) bt 13-16-Farida Mohamed (Egy) 7-11, 11-6, 11-5, 7-11, 15-13; 3-4-Lucy Termel (Eng) bt Sneha Sivakumar (Sgp) 11-5, 11-8, 11-8; 2-Hania El Hammamy (Egy) bt 5-8 Marina Stefanoni (USA) 11-2, 11-4, 11-7.

Australian golfing great Peter Thomson dies aged 88
"," Five-time British Open champion Peter Thomson died at his home in Melbourne on Wednesday after a four-year battle with Parkinson's disease, Golf Australia said. He was 88.
Considered one of Australia's greatest golfers, Thomson was the first from the country to win the British Open when he took the title in 1954. He won it again in 1955, 1956 and 1958, and was runner-up in 1957.
Thomson won the fifth of his British Open titles in 1965, a record only since matched by American Tom Watson, who won the last of his five titles in 1983.
Thomson also had 13 other top-10 finishes at the British Open and won 24 other tournaments in Europe. He won events in Asia and South Africa and clinched 11 victories on the U.S. Senior PGA Tour, including nine in 1985 alone.
His only other major victory was the PGA Seniors' Championship in 1984.
A successful golf course designer upon his retirement, Thomson was the Australian PGA President for 32 years and helped establish the Asian Tour.
He was inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame in 1988, the same year as Watson.
Thomson, who spent more than 60 years as a respected golf columnist for newspapers and magazines, is survived by his wife Mary, a son and three daughters, 11 grandchildren and four great-grand children.

Japanese teen upsets Olympic table tennis champion Ma Long
","Japanese teenager Tomokazu Harimoto stunned reigning world and Olympic champion Ma Long 4-2 in the quarter-finals of the ITTF Japan Open on Saturday.
Harimoto, 14, was thrashed 4-0 in the pair's previous meeting two years ago but the world number 10 showed plenty of grit to overcome China's Ma 11-8 11-9 11-7 3-11 2-11 11-6 in front of a packed venue in Kitakyushu, Japan.
“This is a dream come true, Ma Long is my idol, so beating him here in my home country is amazing,” Harimoto said.
After racing to a 3-0 lead, the youngster faced a stern test as Ma pulled two games back. However, Harimoto held his nerve to clinch a memorable victory.
“This is a new stepping stone for me to achieve my goal of becoming Olympic champion at Tokyo 2020,” he added.
World number two Ma, one of the game's top players in recent decades, was gracious in defeat and hailed Harimoto's progress.
“In these last few years, through his hard work he has improved a lot and has developed a great deal while playing against all the world's top players,” the 29-year-old said.
Up next for Harimoto is South Korea's Lee Sangsu.
The second semi-final will see China's Zhang Jike play German former world number one Timo Boll.

Shubhankar assured of making the cut; Zach sets the pace "," Shubhankar Sharma on Friday became the youngest Indian golfer to make the cut in any Major after he capped a wonderful back nine to achieve the feat at the 147th Open Championships here.
Shubhankar gave himself the perfect 22nd birthday present with that final birdie on 18th. It was one of the four he had on the tough back nine.
“I am so, so excited right now. At the 18th I still thought I just needed to make a par because so many players have yet to finish. After the putt dropped I was definitely very happy. I have never played in such wet and cold conditions, changing towels and gloves so often,” said Shubhankar.
Playing on a wet and cold day, Shubhankar warmed the hearts of the Indian fans at the Carnoustie Golf Links with four birdies against one bogey on the tougher back nine to climb out of a hole at five-over through 27 holes. 
With rounds of 73-71, he is now two-over 144 and sure to be inside at the cut line. 
Meanwhile, former winner Zach Johnson continued his love affair with the Open when he charged to the top of the leaderboard on six-under-par 136 early on Friday.
While the 42-year-old American was plotting his way to a four-under 67 in cold, wet conditions at Carnoustie, Tommy Fleetwood (65) and Rory McIlroy (69) were delighting the home fans by moving into title contention. 
But World No. 1 Dustin Johnson looked certain to miss the cut after struggling to a 72 for 148, six over.
Change in weather
The umbrellas were up and the waterproofs out as rain greeted the players at the start, in complete contrast to the blue skies and sunshine that have been in evidence all week.
I am sure my friends will be congratulating. Making the cut at the Major, which has always been my dream, is the best birthday present I could have got. Shubhankar Sharma
Zach, who claimed the coveted Claret Jug at St. Andrews three years ago, recovered from a bogey at the opening hole with birdies at the third, fourth, sixth, 14th and 18th.
He produced a grin as wide as the North Sea that skirts the Carnoustie layout and raised his putter to the heavens when he rammed in a 35-foot putt at the closing hole.
Fleetwood, who shot a course record 63 at last year’s Dunhill Links Championship, flourished again and strung together six birdies to move up the ladder.
McIlroy, playing in Match Eight, was the second player to break 70 on Friday as he mixed four birdies with two bogeys.
However, it is looking a little less likely that this tournament will finally be the one where Tiger Woods ends his decade-long major drought, as he shot a second straight even-par round of 71.
Leading scores (after round one): 66: Kevin Kisner (USA); 67: Tony Finau (USA), Zander Lombard (RSA), Erik Van Rooyen (RSA); 68: Brendan Steele (USA), Brandon Stone (RSA), Ryan Moore (USA); 69: Pat Perez (USA), Zach Johnson (USA), Sung Kang (Kor), Danny Willett, Matthew Southgate, Chez Reavie (USA), Rory McIlroy, Justin Thomas (USA), Jon Rahm (ESP), Russell Henley (USA).
Indians: 73: Shubhankar Sharma; 76: Anirban Lahiri.

Gaayathri shoots gold
","Gaayathri Nithyanandam of Tamil Nadu came up with a strong performance in the final to clinch the gold in women’s rifle 3-position event in the 18th Kumar Surendra Singh shooting championship at the Dr. Karni Singh Range, Tughlakabad, on Saturday.
After a modest 1,152 in qualification, which was the top score but did not compare well with her 1,176 shot in the Munich World Cup this year, Gaayathri shot 453.3 in the final to beat K.C. Hema by 1.4 points for the gold.
Sonika took the bronze ahead of Lajja Gauswami, Shreya Saksena, Jayashree Das and Ankita Gupta.
Gaayathri would be skipping the fifth selection trial on Sunday, as she was second in the overall averages for selection to the Indian team for the Asian Games and World championship.
Gaayathri’s Statemate, G. Varshaa won the junior gold, in a field of four shooters in the final. Yashika Shinde had no chance of catching up with Varshaa and spoilt the margin further with a 5.7 last shot in the gruelling 45-shot final.
In the men’s rifle 3-position, Olympian Chain Singh pipped Gagan Narang by 2.4 points for the gold, even though the qualification scores of 1,164 and 1,149 respectively was far below the best of the two champion shooters.
The results: 50m rifle 3-position: Men: 1. Chain Singh 452.6 (1164); 2. Gagan Narang 450.2 (1149); 3. Surendra Singh Rathod 438.3 (1167).

IOA president Narinder Batra seeks resolution of issues ","The Indian Olympic Association has taken strong exception to the Sports Ministry’s letter to state associations seeking conformation to the National Sports Code and principles of Good Governance. IOA president Narinder Batra, on Friday, shot off a letter to sports secretary Rahul Bhatnagar protesting the contents of the letter and its implications. 
“I am disturbed with the misinformation campaign started by the Ministry and SAI to malign me before IOA members,” Batra wrote.
Making it clear that his involvement in the committee for re-drafting the NSC (formed in early 2017) was only as president of the International Hockey Federation (FIH), Batra said, “My responsibility as president of FIH was limited only to Best International Practices in the committee and during the period of this committee and till its conclusion, I was not the president of IOA. 
“I am disturbed and disappointed to note that the Ministry and SAI are telling NSFs and SOAs that the IOA president was party to drafting of the New Sports Code, which is not true.”
He also found fault with the government of interfering in the workings of sports bodies, reminding it of the IOA’s de-recognition six years ago. “The IOA was de-recognised by IOC in 2012 and one of the reasons was interference by the government in the autonomy of the NOC and NSFs. It was recognised again only in 2014. 
“The revised IOA Statutes in 2014 had the approval of the ministry. We fail to understand what has changed between 2014 and now,” he wrote in his letter.
Further, Batra stated that the ministry had given an affidavit in the Delhi High Court that it would discuss the new draft code with all stakeholders and seek public opinion but nothing had been done so far. He also reminded the ministry of a previous meeting with then sports secretary P.K. Deb in 2013 regarding the Sports Bill which, he said, clearly mentioned that Deb had informed the IOC about the bill and a draft would be sent to the international body for consent.
He, however, ended on a positive note, seeking a meeting with the ministry to discuss concerns. “In a recent meeting on June 2, the IOA EC approved of a committee to initiate discussion with the ministry to understand concerns of Good Governance and resolve the issues,” he said.

Echevarria unleashes a monstrous leap ","Cuban teenage star Juan Miguel Echevarria won the long jump at the Stockholm Diamond League meet on Sunday with a monstrous wind assisted 8.83 metres.
In front of a 15,000 crowd in the Olympic stadium, the World indoor champion produced his stunning leap on his sixth and final effort to come just 12-centimetres short of American Mike Powell’s 8.95m world record.
Despite the excessive tail wind meaning the jump won’t last in the record books, it brought gasps from the crowd and demonstrated the incredible potential of this 19-year-old, who is now reaching distances not seen in international long jump competitions for a decade.
World No.1 Luvo Manyonga of South Africa — beaten by two centimetres in March for the indoor World title — came a distant third with 8.25m. American Jeff Henderson was second with 8.39m.
Already, though, Echevarria has big ambitions on his mind. “I’m not thinking about nine metres. I’ll have to work very hard to achieve that, it’s an enormous barrier.”
Abderrahman Samba continued his stunning form in the 400m hurdles with a run of 47.41s to beat World champion Karsten Warholm of Norway (47.81s) into second.
Samba, a Mauritanian who now runs for Qatar, not only improved his personal best but also set a new Asian record. “I was looking for something special and I got it today,” said Samba, 22, who has four Diamond League wins from four this year.
In the 200m, world champion Ramil Guliyev, the Azerbaijan-born Turk, won in a time of 19.92s. World indoor 60m champion Murielle Ahoure of the Ivory Coast was upset by Briton Dina Asher-Smith (10.93s) in the women’s 100m, though.
The results (winners only): 
Men: 100m: Hassan Taftian (Iri) 10.07s; 200m: Ramil Quliyev (Aze) 19.92; 800m: Peter Bol (Aus) 1:44.56; 5000m: Gaseleon Barega (Eth) 13:04.05; 400m hurdles: Abderrahaman Samba (Qat) 47.41.

Warriors have a romp
","Stephen Curry scored 33 points, sinking an NBA Finals record nine 3-pointers in the process, and the Golden State Warriors moved halfway to it third title in four seasons on Sunday by beating Cleveland 122-103.
The Warriors, who never trailed, seized a 2-0 lead in the best-of-seven series, which shifts to Cleveland for games three and four on Wednesday and Friday.
“We’ve got to get that same focus going to Cleveland,” Curry said.
Curry, the 30-year-old guard, broke the old mark of eight 3-pointers in a finals game set by Ray Allen of Boston in 2010. “To be on top of that 3-point list is pretty special,” Curry said.
Curry scored 16 points in the fourth quarter, including a 4-point play from a corner 3-pointer and the record breaker from the left side with 3:30 remaining.
He finished by shooting 11-of-26 from the floor, 9-of-17 from 3-point range, with seven rebounds and eight assists.
Kevin Durant added 26 points, Klay Thompson had 20 and JaVale McGee added 12 to spark the Warriors.
James nets 29 points
Cavaliers superstar LeBron James netted 29 points with 13 assists and nine rebounds while Kevin Love added 22 points and 10 rebounds, but Cleveland came no closer than five points in the second half.
After an overtime opener loss James called one of the worst defeats of his career, the Cavaliers couldn’t play Golden State as close, Curry and his teammates thwarting every threat.
Cavs guard J.R. Smith, whose late-game blunder in the opener denied Cleveland a potential winning shot, was greeted with a standing ovation by Warriors fans and chants of “MVP” when he went to the free throw line. Smith went 2-of-9 from the floor and scored only five points.
Cleveland pulled within five points three times in the third quarter but the Warriors carried a 90-80 lead after three quarters.
James opened the fourth quarter with a 3-pointer but Curry followed with back-to-back 3-pointers for a 96-83 Warriors edge.
Curry followed soon after with his seventh 3-pointer of the game, a desperation heave with the shot clock expiring, to give the Warriors a 103-89 advantage and the rout was on.
Three 3-pointers by Curry sparked a 19-8 Warriors second-quarter run as Golden State took a 59-46 halftime edge.
Curry had 16 points, five rebounds and six assists in the first half, when the Warriors shot 59% from the floor and passed out 18 assists. James produced 15 first-half points on 5-of-11 shooting with seven rebounds and eight assists.
The result: Warriors 122 (Curry 33, Durant 26, Thompson 20, McGee 12, Livingston 10) bt Cavaliers 103 (James 29, Love 22, Hill 15, Thompson 11). Warriors lead the Finals 2-0.

Asiad more competitive than CWG: Ponappa ","Ashwini Ponnappa is eyeing a podium finish at the upcoming Asian Games but the ace shuttler conceded that the continental games are more competitive than the Commonwealth Games with some top badminton nations in the fray.
Ponappa had played a crucial role in India winning its first ever gold medal in a team event at the Commonwealth Games early this year. 
“At the international level there are no easy games as every team has quality players but yes the Asian Games are more competitive than the Commonwealth as the top badminton nations like China, Japan, Korea, Indonesia and Thailand are a part of it,” the 28-year-old shuttler, who plays doubles, told PTI.
The Asian Games are scheduled to be held in Indonesia from August 18 to September 2 in Jakarta and Palembang.
“It would be a great challenge to compete against these teams as it would test our skills, speed and endurance. We aim to put our best foot forward and look for a podium finish in the Asian Games,” Ponappa said. “We finished on the podium in the last Asian Games in the women’s team event. The ultimate goal is to get gold for the nation. So definitely the team is looking for a podium finish at the Asian Games. 
“It would not be easy but we have to train hard and give our 100 per cent on the court if we are to win a medal. It is important to keep the focus intact and not crumble under pressure,” the Olympian added. 
Ponappa also said that that she would be taking part in the World championships. 
“The next big tournament would be the World championships. It is going to be a busy schedule but my preparations have been going on and things have worked out well. I had a good training block after the Commonwealth Games before taking a tiny break and have some much needed time off before these major events to get back fresh and continue training,” she said.

Malaysia Open badminton: Sindhu, Srikanth enter semifinals "," P V Sindhu and Kidambi Srikanth continued their impressive run at the Malaysia Open, progressing to the semifinals of the women’s and men’s singles competition with a straight-game wins in the USD 700,000 world tour super 750 tournament in Kuala Lumpur on Friday.
 In a clash between Olympic silver and gold medallists, it was Sindhu who emerged victories with a 22-20 21-19 result in a 52-minute quarterfinal match.
 The 22-year-old Sindhu, who won a silver at the Glasgow World Championship, will face world no 1 and top seed Chinese Taipei’s Tai Tzu Ying on Saturday.
 Earlier fourth seed Srikanth, who won a silver medal at the Gold Coast Commonwealth Games, dumped world no 22 France’s Brice Leverdez 21-18 21-14 in a 39-minute clash at the Axiata Arena in Bukit Jalil, a suburb in Kuala Lumpur.
 The Indian had also beaten the French in three games at All England Championship this year.
 The 25-year-old will take on former world no 2 and 2015 world championship bronze medallist Kento Momota, who has been in sensational form ever since making a comeback after serving a one-year ban by Japan Badminton Association for gambling at an illegal casino in 2015.
 Momota clinched the Macau Open and Dutch Open last year besides reaching the finals at Canada Open. He won the 2018 Asia Badminton championship and was also unbeaten at the Thomas Cup.
 Srikanth will have a tough task at hand as Momota will be extra motivated to earn back his respect as it was here two years ago that he had to concede a second round match after the news of him and compatriot Kenichi Tago gambling at an illegal casino broke out.
 In the women’s singles match, Sindhu started the proceedings with a sharp smash and moved to a 3-1 lead early on but Marin clawed back. Sindhu again opened a slender two-point lead which evaporated quickly.
 As has been the norm, Sindhu and Marin continued to fight it out as leads changed hands too frequently. The Indian finally grabbed a miniscule 11-10 lead at the interval after Marin failed to reach for a shot at the backline.
 Marin dictated the pace of the rallies to open up a 13-11 lead, celebrated every point with her usual verbal screams. Sindhu attacked her opponent’s backhand to draw level this time at 14-14 and moved to lead with a smash, which Marin hit wide.
 Lagging 15-18, Marin stepped up the attack and grabbed five straight points to secure two game-point opportunities. A net error and a wide shot by Marin saw Sindhu claw back at 20-20. The Spaniard again hit wide and then found the net as the Indian pocketed the opening game.
 The second game started in a similar fashion as Sindhu and Marin moved to 3-3 before the Indian surged to a 6-3 lead. The left-handed shuttler, however, soon levelled the score with three points as Sindhu committed a few unforced errors.
 At the interval, Sindhu grabbed a 11-6 advantage after reeling off five straight points, which ended with Marin hitting out.
 Marin slipped on the court after the break but managed to narrow the gap to 10-13 before moving to 14-15. However, the Spaniard hit long, netted a shot and failed to reach one at the forecourt as Sindhu moved to 19-15.
 A solid defence saw Sindhu grab three match points. She blew two points before unleashing a cross court smash to seal the contest in 52 minutes.
 Earlier, Srikanth erased a 5-8 deficit to grab a 11-9 lead at the break. Leverdez clawed back at 12-12 but the Indian again marched ahead to grab a 17-14 advantage. The French drew parity at 17-17 before Srikanth surged to pocket the opening game.
 In the second game, Srikanth and Leverdez fought till 5-5 before the Indian first grabbed a 11-5 lead and then kept his nose ahead to comfortably shut the doors on his rival.

Stephen Curry: short-term focus for long-range hero
","Golden State guard Stephen Curry said that while it was “cool” to set an NBA Finals record with nine three-pointers in the Warriors’ 122-103 win over the Cleveland Cavaliers on Sunday, his focus was on keeping the Larry O’Brien Trophy in Oakland.
Curry drained a series of three-pointers, some of them from well beyond the arc, during his stellar Game Two performance to break the back of a Cavs team that had hoped to bounce back from a heartbreaking Game One loss on Thursday.
“That’s a pretty cool deal to accomplish,” Curry told reporters after the win, which puts his team two wins away from their third title in four years. “But at the end of the day, it’s all about trying to get a win and doing whatever you can to make that happen.”
Curry’s performance surpassed Ray Allen’s record of eight three-pointers in a Finals game, which he set with the Celtics in 2010.
“I never woke up and was like, all right, let’s go get nine threes and get the record,” he said. “It was more so about playing the game the right way, having good intentions out there on the court and good things happen.
“So pretty special night, and hopefully some more special things happen and we get two more wins.”
While Curry was humble, Warriors coach Steve Kerr was quick to sing his praises after the win.
“He was tremendous. You know, nine threes and seemed to hit the big shot every time we needed one,” Kerr said. “He was fantastic.”
Warriors forward Kevin Durant was anything but surprised by Curry’s heroics. “At this point, it’s expected,” he said.
Game Three of the best-of-seven series is in Cleveland on Wednesday.

Chennai’s Praggnanandhaa is world’s second youngest Grand Master ","Prodigy R. Praggnanandhaa, who missed out on the chance to become the game’s youngest-ever Grandmaster in March this year, completed the technical formalities to become the world’s youngest GM at present, and the second youngest on the all-time list. 
On Sunday, the Chennai-based youngster made the third and final norm in style by winning the ninth and concluding round of the Fourth International Chess Festival ad Gredine Open at Ortisei, Italy. 
Praggu, as he is fondly called by his coach and mentor GM R.B. Ramesh, defeated Dutch GM Roeland Pruijssers in 40 moves to tie for the title with Croatia’s Ivan Saric at 7.5 points before settling for the second spot. 
After beating Italian Luca Moroni Jr. in the eighth round, Praggnanandhaa had to wait for the final-round pairing to know whether he had already done enough to make the final norm or needed at least a draw on Sunday. 
Had Praggnanandhaa faced a player below the rating of 2485 in the final round, he would have required at least half a point more. As it turned out, the pairing with Pruijssers, rated 2514, meant even a defeat would not have hurt the youngster’s norm prospects. With the pressure off, Praggnanandhaa demolished the Dutchman. 
As things stand, at 12 years, 10 months and 13 days, Praggnanandhaa is now behind record-holder Sergey Karjakin in the all-time list. Karjakin, the only other under-13 GM in the game, accomplished the feat in 2002 — three years before Praggnanandhaa was born! 
Thus, Praggnanandhaa emulated compatriot Parimarjan Negi who achieved a similar distinction on July 1, 2006 at the age of 13 years, four months and 22 days. Interestingly, at that time, Pragnanandhaa was only 318 days old! 
For the record, the world’s youngest International Master Praggnanandhaa made his first GM norm in the World junior championship in Tarvisio (Italy) in November 2017. The second norm took time and eventually came in the Fischer memorial in Heraklion (Greece) in April this year.

IOC adds 7 medal events to 2022 Beijing Winter Games
"," Planning for its next three Olympic Games, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) has added seven medal events to the 2022 Beijing Winter Games, published a 2020 Tokyo Olympics schedule with no agreement on when to race swimming finals, and set a timetable to add new sports to the 2024 Paris Olympics.
The next Winter Olympics will now include: women’s monobob, Big Air freestyle skiing for men and women, plus mixed team events in short track speed skating, ski jumping, ski aerials and snowboardcross.
The addition of gold medals to a 109-event programme was combined with a reduction in how many athletes will compete.
In an attempt to cut organising costs, amid recent failures of potential bidders in Europe for the 2026 Winter Games, there should be no additional venues required and 41 fewer athletes in Beijing than the 2,933 competitors at the Pyeongchang Olympics last February.
IOC sports director Kit McConnell said on July 18 that changes for Beijing were “really sending a strong message about controlling the size of the Olympic Winter Games.” Sports losing athletes from their Olympic quota include 41 in skiing disciplines, 26 from skating, and 20 fewer in biathlon.
Women’s ice hockey will grow by two teams to become a 10-nation lineup instead, adding 46 athletes.
McConnell said an improved gender balance will see 45.4% female athletes in Beijing, rising from 41.1% in Pyeongchang.
A women’s Nordic combined event — mixing cross-country skiing and ski jumping — will not join the Olympic program because the overall quality of competition and variety of countries taking part was not “at a level appropriate to being included,” the IOC official said.
Two years and one week before the Tokyo Olympics open, the IOC published a detailed schedule on July 18 of when competitions will take place.
It lacked any breakdown of events at the Olympic Aquatics Centre, which hosts swimming, diving, and synchronized swimming.
At the 2008 Olympics in Beijing, in a time zone one hour different to Tokyo, swimming finals and semifinals were raced in morning sessions so they could be broadcast live in the United States late evening. U.S. broadcaster NBC is the single biggest contributor to Olympic revenues.
However, swimming is also a core attraction for the host nation’s viewers with Japan winning seven medals, including two gold, at the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics.
McConnell said a swimming sessions schedule should be finalised inside two months, with the IOC, Tokyo organizers and swimming governing body FINA seeking a balance to ensure “each of the key time zones have some of their key sports live.”
Paris organizers have an uncertain wait to discover if new sports they propose next year for inclusion on the 2024 programme will be approved.
The IOC plans to make interim decisions on the Paris preferences at an October 2019 meeting in Milan, then review again after seeing how other sports perform at the Tokyo Olympics.

Drama at wrestling selections ","There is never a dearth of drama in Indian wrestling. After exempting four wrestlers, the men’s selection trials in both Freestyle and Greco-Roman categories on Saturday saw some surprise winners but it was the closely-contested 57kg category that remained the highlight.
While CWG winner Rahul Aware did not participate in the trials at the SAI Training Centre in Sonepat — there were murmurs of him not making the weight — the three-way tie between Sandeep Tomar, Utkarh Kale and Ravi Kumar ended in a stalemate with all three winning a bout each in the second round. While Tomar, who represented India at the Rio Olympics was initially announced as the winner by virtue of winning the final bout, the decision was quickly rescinded. A re-trial between the three is now scheduled for June 13.
Ravi Kumar won the first bout 4-2 against Tomar but then lost to Kale 6-4. It all came down to the bout between Tomar and Kale and even though the latter looked set to take the spot with a 6-2 lead at break, Tomar came back with a massive four-point throw to lead in the last few seconds. Kale challenged the decision but it held and Tomar won 12-8.
While technically the decision should have been on the basis of classification points in case of a tie, in this case both Kale and Tomar had 14 points. The WFI has now rescheduled the trial in the 57kg along with the trials for the Asian Junior Championships on Wednesday.
In the 97 kg, Mausam Khatri came back from being 2-0 down against Satyavrat Kadian to level 2-2 and take the bout and the spot for the Asiad. Bajrang Punia (65kg) and Sushil Kumar (74kg) had been allowed to skip the trials by the federation and are currently training in Georgia. While those winning the selection trials in the four categories here would participate in both the Asian Games and the World Championships in October, WFI is likely to conduct fresh trials in the two exempted categories for the Budapest event. 
Women’s trials would be held in Lucknow on Sunday.
The squads: Freestyle: Bajrang Punia (65kg), Sushil Kumar (74kg), Pawan Kumar (86kg), Mausam Khatri (97kg), Sumit (125kg); Greco-Roman: Gyanendra (60kg), Manish (67 kg), Gurpreet Singh (77 kg), Harpreet Singh (87 kg), Hardeep (97 kg), Naveen (125 kg).

Khade satisfied with his progress
","Virdhawal Khade recorded a personal best timing of 22.52s in 50m freestyle to go under the Asian Games qualification mark of 22.91s set by the Swimming Federation of India. 
During the selection trials for the Asian Games held at the Padukone-Dravid Centre for Sports Excellence here over the weekend, the 26-year-old eclipsed his own performance — the best by an Indian — which came nearly a decade ago (2009, 22.55s).
The team for Jakarta is expected to be announced after the National sub-junior & junior aquatic championships in Pune (June 24 to 29).
“It is definitely satisfying,” Khade told The Hindu on Monday. “I have been working really hard and I expect to get much better in the coming months leading up to the games.”
Khade, a bronze medallist in 50m butterfly at the 2010 Guangzhou Asian Games, is on the comeback trail. After having missed four straight high-profile events — the 2012 and 2016 Olympics and the 2014 Commonwealth and Asian Games — he had to go through an Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) surgery last year.
At the Commonwealth Games in Gold Coast in April, Khade’s timing was only 23.11s as he crashed out in the Heats. But the recent improvement will be greatly encouraging.
“The legs have been much better in the last few months,” he said. “Immediately after the surgery they weren’t really performing as well as I wanted them to. Now they are good.”
Khade also credited the “world-class” facilities at the Padukone-Dravid Centre — which boasts of a state-of-the-art pool built by Myrtha, the official pool designers for the Olympics — for his effort.

Anand stops Karjakin, finishes joint second
"," Viswanathan Anand signed off in great style when he tamed Sergey Karjakin to finish joint second in the Norway chess tournament here on Thursday. 
Fabiano Caruana, the conqueror of Anand in the previous round, had his share of luck on way to a title-deciding victory over Wesley So. Caruana took the winner’s share of 75,000 euros for what was his third title – after Candidates and Grenke – this year. 
For the record, Caruana tallied with five points, half a point better than Magnus Carlsen, Hikaru Nakamura and Anand, who finished in that order after the tie-break was applied. 
Anand prevailed in an eventful game that lasted 32 moves for his second victory with black pieces. 
It must be noted that Anand started this elite 10-player field as the lowest rated player but eventually managed a creditable finish. Statistically, Anand won two games with black pieces, drew six others (including the one against Ding Liren who withdrew after three rounds) and lost only the eventual champion. 
The performance helped Anand gain nine rating points which in turn lifted his World ranking from 14th to 11th.
Final-round results: Sergey Karjakin (Rus) lost to Viswanathan Anand; Fabiano Caruana (USA) bt Wesley So (USA); Maxime Vachier-Lagrave (Fra) drew with Magnus Carlsen (Nor); Levon Aronian (Arm) drew with Hikaru Nakamura (USA); Shakhriyar Mamedyarov (Aze) bye. 
Standings: 1. Caruana (5 points); 2-4. Carlsen, Nakamura, Anand (4.5); 5-6. So, Aronian (4), 7. Mamedyarov (3.5), 8-9. Lagrave and Karjakin (3).

Golf: Johnson falters to be in four-way lead in US Open
","Dustin Johnson three-putted the final hole to fall into a four-way tie for the lead with fellow Americans Brooks Koepka, Daniel Berger and Tony Finau after the third round at the U.S. Open on Saturday.
Johnson carded a seven-over-par 77 but still found himself sharing the lead after surviving brutal conditions as Koepka set himself up for a shot at successfully defending his title.
Johnson steadied himself after squandering a four-shot advantage on the front nine at Shinnecock Hills as the field bunched up like rush hour traffic on the Long Island Expressway.
Tough conditions
The 2016 champion negotiated the back nine in one-over on a day when strong winds and low humidity baked the greens dry and left some on the verge of being unplayable.
Johnson, Koepka (72), Daniel Berger (66) and Tony Finau (66) led Englishman Justin Rose (73) by one stroke, and Swede Henrik Stenson (74) by two.
Though Saturday showed that no lead is safe at the toughest test in golf, nothing was likely to create more discussion than Phil Mickelson’s bizarre decision.
Mickelson insisted he meant no disrespect when he opted to putt a moving ball, swallowing a sextuple bogey at the 13th hole.
His bogey putt skated past the cup and was heading down a slope when he trotted after it and batted it back toward the hole with his putter. 
He needed eight strokes to get the ball in the hole and with a two-stroke penalty walked off with a sextuple bogey 10.
“Look, I don't mean disrespect to anybody,” he said. “I know it’s a two-shot penalty. At that time, I just didn't feel like going back and forth and hitting the same shot over.
Top scores: 
213: Daniel Berger 76-71-66, Tony Finau 75-72-66, Brooks Koepka 75-66-72, Dustin Johnson 69-67-77; 214: Justin Rose 71-70-73; 215: Henrik Stenson 71-70-74.

Irrepressible Wirral stakes its claim to yet another piece of history
","What is the worst thing that can happen to you on a cricket field? Injury apart, for a batsman I would imagine it is being run out without facing a ball. And to be run out thus twice in the same match makes it four times as bad (cricket statistics do not always follow the logic of numbers).
But what if the first 10 players all fail to score and a team is dismissed for three runs, two of them being leg byes, thus ensuring immortality of sorts for Connor Hobson, at least at trivia quizzes in pubs around Wirral in England? Hobson was the only batsman to score in the Cheshire League (Division 3) for Wirral against Haslington, thus ruining the figures of Ben Istead who finished with six for one. Clearly he has made a case for promotion in the batting order.
For those who value detail, the match lasted eight-and-a-half overs and was watched by 40 spectators, which is 10 times the audience at some of the first class matches in India. It is useful to remember that Victoria, which made a world record 1107 in a Sheffield Shield match against New South Wales was dismissed for 35 in the return game a month later. All eyes are now on the return match between Wirral and Haslington slated for July. If more than 40 spectators turn up, it will surprise no one.
But as so often happens to our heroes, the sole run-maker’s name has two versions. Some newspapers have credited the run to “Hobson”, others to “Hodson”. Horatio, you might remember had no such problems after his heroics on the bridge — he was not called “Horato” or “Horashio” depending on whether the newspaper was conservative-religious or liberal-secular.
Ten ducks all in a row have put Wirral on the cricketing map, although to be fair, it had already found a spot there as the birthplace of Ian Botham. It was a son of Wirral, Crapper, who is credited with inventing the modern toilet, and nothing its cricketers can do is likely to send the village’s reputation down its best-known product. The first American president George Washington’s grandparents are reputed to have lived in Wirral.
Such a rich historical and cultural heritage was nothing against the 17-year-old college student Istead who, with that gift for understatement which is nearly famous in Wirral, said, “To get six wickets for one run was pretty good.” In the same vein, the opponent’s manager said: “They didn’t play too badly.” But maybe he was being ironic.
Trained to look at the bright side of life, it is possible that Wirral fans may celebrate not getting to where the Somerset club Langport did in a match nearly a century ago when it was dismissed for zero. Till the ICC invents a way of negative scoring (minus one, for getting a partner run out, for example, or minus two for sledging), that will have to remain the unbeatable record.
Meanwhile, the 
Liverpool Echo informs us that Wirral CC has gone back to the nets. Life moves on. How long before it puts up a statue to Hobson (or Hodson), and sells merchandise connected with the biggest rout on a cricket field since archers lined up at Lord’s for the Olympic competition?

Younis to be Pakistan’s new head coach
","PCB Chairman Najam Sethi has confirmed that former Test captain Waqar Younis would be taking over as head coach of the national team later this month.
Sethi said two-year contracts have been offered to chief selector cum manager, Moin Khan and Younis.
Sethi also said that he felt that the combination of Moin and Waqar would work well for the national team.
“It was never a Moin or Waqar option for us as formulated by Akram (Wasim). The new formula has both former players in a format that we think will produce better results. That’s why I have now given them two-year contracts like (Dav) Whatmore earlier,” Sethi said in an interview to the “Express Tribune”.
Younis, who has also coached the Pakistan in the not too recent past, met Sethi on Wednesday in Lahore where he said he had confirmed his desire and availability to work with the Pakistan team.
Younis, who has also formally applied for the head coach position, insisted that he had no differences with anyone including Moin and was keen to work with the team to produce positive results.
Sethi disclosed the reasons for choosing the new coaching panel that includes Moin Khan and will recommend names for the head coach, fielding coach, batting coach and spin consultant positions to the board by May 6.
He felt that the old committee formed to hunt for a new coach and which functioned under former chairman Zaka Ashraf and included former captain Wasim Akram failed to deliver the desired results.
“I inherited two options [either Moin or Waqar] from Ashraf and Akram and had to select one on the eve of the team’s departure to Dhaka to play the Asia Cup and the WorldTwenty20.
“I put the matter before our managing committee and they chose the option led by Moin Khan which Akram had listed at number one. Not everyone was happy with the decision, but we let it go because there was no time to constitute a new committee and come up with different choices.”
Sethi added that instead of choosing the path of vindictiveness, the board decided on making only a few necessary modifications in the team management after the World Twenty20.

Sathish sets eyes on Asian Games
","Chennai: After successfully defending his Commonwealth Games gold at Gold Coast, weightlifter Sathish Sivalingam has eyes set on the Asian Games in Indonesia. 
Commenting on his chances at the Asiad, the lifter, who won the 77kg gold, said while the level of competition will be higher, he is confident of doing well. 
“Usually, the competition is definitely higher at the Asian Games but with countries like China and Kazakhstan banned for doping, I feel my chances are very good.”
The 26-year old from Vellore carried an injury into the CWG but still managed to secure the top spot. But since his return from Australia, he has been undergoing a rehabilitation programme and feels he is ready for the upcoming challenges.
Speaking on Tuesday on the sidelines of an event in which he was unveiled as ISteel’s brand ambassador, Satish said: “The last one month I was at Invictus Performance Lab in Bengaluru for rehabilitation, which got over recently. Now I will be preparing for next week’s trials at Patiala ahead of the Asiad.”

Mehuli Ghosh is best of the best
"," 
Commonwealth Games silver medallist Mehuli Ghosh continued to make waves as she shot a 632.7 in the qualification stage of women’s air rifle in the 18th Kumar Surendra Singh shooting championship at the Dr. Karni Singh Range, Tughlakabad, on Sunday.
Competing in the second relay that had all the best shooters in the country, the 17-year-old Mehuli, who is coached by Olympian Joydeep Karmakar, stood tall with a near World record score.
It was a better average than 10.5 over 60 shots, with 10.9 as the perfect.
Mehuli who had a series of 105.9, 105.3, 105.7, 106.4, 104.4 and 105.0 was a mere 0.7 points off the World record shot by Zhu Yingjie of China in the World Cup in Fort Benning.
Such a high level of consistency was not a surprise as Mehuli had shot a record 252.8 during the mixed air rifle final on Saturday, a score that was 0.4 points better than the World record by another Chinese Zhao Ruozhu who shot it in the World Cup in Changwon in April.
Meghana Sajjanar (628.0), Anjum Moudgil (627.2) who holds a World record in rifle 3-position, Elavenil Valarivan (627.1), Neha Chaphekar (625.3), Shreya Agrawal (624.3), Barkha Chauhan (623.3) and World Championship finalist Avneet Sidhu (622.7) followed Mehuli in her relay.
Asian champion Pooja Ghatkar (622.4), Elizabeth Susan Koshy (619.2), Olympian Ayonika Paul (619.1), former National champion Mampi Das (618.7) were not in a position to fight for a berth in the eight-shooter final, in a strong field of about 350 shooters.
Even Samrat Chahal who topped the first relay with 623.5, may find it hard to make the cut, as the qualification continues on Monday, culminating in the finals in the afternoon.
Mihika Poore who topped the third relay with 621.6 stood no chance.
Meanwhile, in 25-metre standard pistol, Adarsh Singh won the men’s and junior gold medals, with a score of 576. Anish Bhanwala who had won the junior World Championship gold in the event in Suhl last year, placed fourth among juniors with 561.
The results:
25m standard pistol: Men: 1. Adarsh Singh 576; 2. Rajat Kumar Yadav 572; 3. Shivam Shukla 571.
Junior men: 1. Adarsh Singh 576; 2. Vijayveer Sidhu 565; 3. Sambhaji Patil 563.

Mavericks’ winning run continues
","Sharath Kamal’s best day in Ultimate Table Tennis league proved insufficient for Warriors as Harmeet Desai pulled off a stunning 2-1 victory over Aruna Quadri and paved the way for Mavericks’ narrow 11-10 victory here on Monday.
With the teams locked at 9-9, Sabine Winter provided the winning margin when she expectedly defeated Pooja Sahasrabudhe 2-1 in the final singles.
“We would have loved to win the tie and take that confidence into our final encounter against Maharashtra United,” said Sharath, who won his first singles match, following a 2-1 win over World No. 20 Mattias Karlsson. In the following match, he partnered Hana Matelova to emerge victorious against Harmeet and Doo Hoi Kem.
Again the higher-ranked men singles players let Warriors down. World No. 15 Chih Yuan Chuang lost to Mattias Karlsson before the 81st ranked Harmeet got the better of a struggling Quadri, ranked 22nd.
When the caravan moves to Kolkata on Wednesday for the final leg, Warriors (37 points) and Maharashtra United (38) will clash to decide the fourth semi-finalist.
On a day when every match was decided by 2-1 score-line, the first three ties went Warriors’ way with Sofia Polcanova narrowly winning against Ayika Mukherjee and Sharath playing his part in the next two.
Thereafter, Mavericks won four singles matches, with Karlsson, Doo, Harmeet and Winter taking turns to maintain Mavericks’ all-win record after four rounds.
The results: Mavericks bt Warriors 11-10 (Ayhika Mukherjee lost to Sofia Polcanova 9-11, 11-6, 11-10; Mattias Karlsson lost to Sharath Kamal 11-7, 10-11, 7-11; Harmeet Desai & Doo Hoi Kem lost to Sharath Kamal & Hana Matelova 11-8, 9-11, 8-11; Mattias Karlsson bt Chih Yuan Chuang 11-6, 11-7, 7-11; Doo bt Sofia Polcanova 11-7, 9-11, 11-4; Harmeet bt Aruna Quadri 11-8, 4-11, 11-6; Sabine Winter bt Pooja Saharabuddhe 9-11, 11-8, 11-11-7).

Don’t take dietary supplements: Moses
","American track legend Edwin Moses feels athletes should stay away from all dietary supplements to escape possible doping bans in the future instead of claiming ignorance on testing positive for banned substances.
“I think athletes are making a mistake if they are trying to be aware of what is in every single substance. It is easier just to say ‘no’. You just have to say ‘no’ instead of taking the ‘I didn’t know’ approach. You cannot have it both ways,” Moses told World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA)’s official publication Play True.
This was in reply to a query whether the sheer number of supplements available today makes it more difficult for an athlete (to stay drug free).
In the Indian context, his advice has come a bit late as six athletes, including double Asiad gold medallist Ashwini Akkunji, tested positive in June 2011 and served out a two-year ban. Ashwini and five others — Sini Jose, Mandeep Kaur, Priyanka Panwar, Juana Murmu and Tiana Mary Thomas — tested positive for banned substances. They claimed the substances were in the food supplement given to them by their coach.
According to Moses, in this digital age, athletes should take responsibility for conforming to the Anti-Doping Code. “A great part of the problem is the athletes themselves.
“If you are in a sport like track & field and you’re out there earning significant money and have people working with you such as physical therapists, masseurs and coaches, and you have access to electronic devices which can easily download all the information instantly, then the case of pleading ignorance should not be as acceptable as it was during the pre-digital era when we had to circulate a piece of paper around the world.
“Athletes have to begin to take more responsibility because strict liability is a fundamental principle of the Code. When I was an athlete I knew what things not to take, what things to be aware of, and there was nowhere near the level of supplements that there are today,” he said.

","Kristian Karlsson thwarted A. Sharath Kamal’s challenge to help Maharashtra United prevail over Warriors TTC 11-10 in Ultimate Table Tennis here on Wednesday. 
Elizabeta Samara won two crucial matches to give United the lead early on and helped it reach the semifinals with a tally of 49 points. 
Karlsson turned things round in the sixth match when he collected six consecutive points to pip Sharath Kamal, who led 10-5 at that stage, at the post and win the first game 11-10. Karlsson won the next two games easily to secure an unassailable 11-7 lead.
The first four matches saw the two sides sharing the honours with six games each.
Samara gave United a flying start by blanking Pooja Sahasrabuddhe 3-0. Chih Yuan Huang played a fine attacking game to wipe out Amalraj 3-0 and level the scores for the Warriors. 
Amalraj then paired with Lily Zhang to upstage the fancied Warriors’ pair of Sharath Kamal and Sofia Polcanova 2-1 before Chih returned to outlast Joao Montiero 2-1. 
The fifth match saw an interesting clash with Polcanova coming up against Samara. The clash of the left-handers saw Polcanova winning the opening game 11-9 but Samara showed better nerves to win the next two on ‘golden points’ (11-10, 11-10) to give United a 8-7 lead.
The result: 
Warriors TTC lost to Maharashtra United 10-11 (Pooja Sahasrabuddhe lost to Elizabeta Samara 11-6, 11-8, 11-1; Chih Yuan Huang bt A.Amalraj 11-6, 11-6, 11-6; Sharath Kamal & Sofia Polcanova lost to A.

Who says golf is an old man's game?
","I have often been asked why I play golf when it is clearly an old man’s game. Now consider this, the golf swing is pure physics. The upper body coils round the lower body creating torque. When this torque is released through the golf club with the club head speeds reaching up to and beyond 100 mph, kinetic energy is transferred to the ball allowing it to fly long distances. The hips, shoulders and arms must all rotate in sync to harness your core strength to achieve this. Merely powering the club with the arms by flinging it will only have negative effects including compression of your spine. So while one can still enjoy the game at an advanced age, being of sound mind and body is the key to being able to play golf at higher levels.
The synchronisation of the body occurs through a proper address position. The knees need to be flexed just right, as needs to be the forward tilt of the spine. The waist, shoulders and hips are to be parallel to the ball to target line and not in an open or closed position (trick shots being the exception!). The top professionals and amateurs go back to their address position when things are not going well. More often than not, the fault lies there.
Some of the most salubrious surrounds that I have seen are at golf courses. The R&A, the apex body for golf, spends substantial resources on what it calls “sustainable golf”. Its stated objective is to work to protect the enjoyment of the game and to safeguard the financial operations of golf facilities in a manner that preserves natural environments and enhances community engagement.
As the Technical Delegate for Golf at the 17th Asian Games at Korea in September 2014, I recently visited the Dream Park Golf Course at Incheon. Built on a low-lying area and the land filled with only the waste generated by Incheon City over eight years, this course is a standing example of how humans can work alongside nature to create a thing of beauty.
A typical golf course needs 125-150 acres of land and will cost about Rs 60 crores to build. So when you visit a golf course, do take time to appreciate the effort, thought, planning and care taken to create something environmentally sustainable.
This game is calling you to take it up. The handicap system allows all levels of players to compete against each other and against the difficulty of the course. Time to get started.

Saqib’s long wait finally over
"," 
For a brief moment, as he came up with successive bogeys on the 15th and 16th holes in the final round on Saturday, Syed Saqib Ahmed felt his title chances slipping away in the PGTI Cochin Masters.
The 24-year-old golfer from Bengaluru had produced amazing play over the last two days, including a hole-in-one at Nedumbassery’s CIAL Golf Club, but suddenly everything appeared to be going up in smoke.
He then found out from his friends that Delhi’s Honey Baisoya, his nearest challenger who had started half hour earlier, had finished with a seven-under and realised that he had to buck up. And Saqib found his touch just in time, produced birdies in the last two holes, and clinched his maiden professional title.
The victory came with a cash prize of ₹6 lakh and took Saqib to the top of the 2018 PGTI Order of Merit after two events.
“I really felt the pressure after the bogeys on the 15th and 16th because both the par fives are actually easy holes,” said Saqib, who finished with a three-shot lead over the pre-tournament favourite Baisoya. 
“But I had a birdie on the 17th, which I think is one of the toughest. And the 18th went like a dream, I really didn’t think I could handle it so well. This is really a big burden off my head.”
The title ended three years of waiting for Saqib.
“I dedicate this, my first pro title, to my parents and my grandfather,” said the young man and then turned emotional.

A challenge to win the gold again: Srinivas ","HYDERABAD: He guided South Korea to its maiden Asian Games bronze in the last edition as a coach. In his maiden assignment with the Indian kabaddi team for next month’s Games, Lingampally Srinivas Reddy is optimistic of the country retaining the gold for the eighth successive time.
The 41-year-old Srinivas, who is in the city for a short break before joining the Indian preparatory camp at Sonepat, said it would be a challenge to win the gold again but not insurmountable as despite the improved standards of other teams like Pakistan, Korea, Japan, India stands well and above the rest.
“There is everything in place as far as combinations of the team are concerned, both in defence and attack. The biggest advantage is that we have very good all-rounders,” said the Andhra Bank manager.
“The recent triumph in the Dubai World Masters was a reminder that this Indian team is capable of rising to the occasion in any event. The best part is that we have been preparing for four months already,” said Srinivas, who owes a lot to the first Dronacharya in kabaddi E. Prasada Rao.
“The ProKabaddi League is the biggest thing to have happened as it not only changed the lifestyle of the players but also saw foreigners feature in it. It also gave the Indians a feel of their strengths and weaknesses. 
“This might hold good for other nations too. But we have a better domestic structure unlike other countries, which at the most play only one big national event,” Srinivas said.
What exactly will be the focus in the final phase of the camp? “It will be on super tackles — how to execute and also how to counter them. This will be the key to the preparations as we will be formulating different strategies for the opponents,” says the former player who will be coaching Jaipur Pink Panthers in the next edition.
“We are all geared up for the big moment again in Jakarta,” signed off the 2005 Asian Championship gold medallist.

Smashers make their intentions clear
","Having acquired the services of two of India’s in-form paddlers for the CEAT Ultimate Table Tennis’ second edition, Dabang Smashers TTC has hopes to better its third-place finish in the inaugural season.
The Smashers paddlers displayed their swag in abundance as they thumped defending champion Falcons TTC 17-4 on Monday night at the Shree Shiv Chhatrapati Sports Complex. 
The win catapulted Smashers to the top of the points table with 31 while Falcons remained in the fourth position with 15.
Manika Batra continued her giant-killing spree by accounting for World No. 30 Matilda Ekholm in the opening match. The Indian displayed tremendous control with her long-pimpled rubber, after losing the opening game.
Once Manika had given the impetus, Smashers dominated the next two matches, with Japanese Yoshida Masaki thumping India’s Sanil Shetty and the mixed doubles combination of Sathiyan and Sakura Mori rolling over Shetty and Bernadette Szocs.
Even though Liam Pitchford overcame Masaki, the Englishman only delayed the inevitable for Falcons. 
When Puerto Rican Adriana Diaz, the youngest among the 24 Olympians participating in the league, stunned Szocs in the first two games, Falcons had pocketed the tie with seven games to spare. 
With virtually nothing to lose, Sathiyan showcased his artistry with forehand top-spins and side-spin serves to outsmart lower-ranked Spaniard Alvaro Robles in straight games. 
Mori then capped off a perfect evening for her team by making short work of Falcons’ Sutirtha Mukherjee, the National women’s champion. 
The results: Dabang Smashers TTC bt Falcons TTC 17-4 (Manika Batra bt Matilda Ekholm 8-11, 11-10, 11-10; Yoshida Masaki bt Sanil Shetty 11-5, 11-4, 11-8; G. Sathiyan & Sakura Mori bt Sanil Shetty & Bernadette Szocs 11-9, 11-4, 11-4; Masaki lost to Liam Pitchford 11-10, 11-9, 6-11; Adriana Diaz bt Szocs 11-9, 11-8, 9-11; Sathiyan bt Alvaro Robles 11-10, 11-6, 11-6; Mori bt Suthirtha Mukherjee 11-3, 11-7, 11-10).

James ponders leaving Cleveland again
","NBA superstar LeBron James admits he’s considering breaking the hearts of Cleveland sports fans once again by leaving the Cavaliers for a better chance at becoming a champion again. James, who played his eighth consecutive finals, can opt out of his contract and become a free agent in July, much the way he did when he left Cleveland in 2010.
While opportunities with the Houston Rockets, Philadelphia 76ers and Los Angeles Lakers are likely available, the native of nearby Akron might elect to stay and try to keep the Cavs a contender.
“I have no idea at this point,” James said. “Sitting down and considering everything, my family is a huge part of whatever I’ll decide to do in my career, and it will continue to be that. So I don’t have an answer for you right now.
“I’m not going to take you throughout the whole process. That’s not fun. But when I decide what I’m going to do with my future, my family and the folks that have been with me for the last, you know, 20 years, pretty much, will have a say-so. Then it ultimately will come down to me, and so we’ll see what happens.”
In 2014, James returned to the Cavaliers vowing to win a title and did so in 2016, the first by any Cleveland sports team since the 1964 NFL Browns.
“I came back because I felt like I had some unfinished business,” James said. 
Asked if his business was finished, James called that a “tricky question” but noted the victory fed his hunger for more trophy ceremonies.
“I still have so much to give to the game,” James said. “I think I’ve shown this year why I will still continue to be in championship mode.”

Football shadow looms over UTT season 2 "," With the football World Cup looming over it, the CEAT Ultimate Table Tennis (UTT) promoters would be hoping that at least their fraternity does not turn its back on the tournament’s second edition, which will commence on Thursday at the Shree Shiv Chhatrapati sports complex.
Joao Monteiro, the Portuguese veteran who will be leading Maharashtra United, will be hoping to avenge last year’s semifinal loss to eventual champion Falcons TTC during the tournament-opener even as the 34-year-old veteran will also be keeping an eye on Friday night’s World Cup clash between Portugal and Spain.
After all, Cristiano Ronaldo used to be his sparring partner at times during Monteiro’s first stint with the Sporting academy in Lisbon. Monteiro recalls that Ronaldo, who also was at Sporting, would be a regular in the table tennis hall. 
“Ronaldo enjoyed playing table tennis. Almost everyday before practice, he would come with a few friends and play with us. Even now he mentions table tennis as his hobby,” Monteiro told The Hindu after his team’s training on Wednesday. 


Having led Portuguese table tennis’ rise, thanks to the team’s fifth-place finish at the London Olympics in 2012 and the team gold at the European championship two years later, Monteiro is chuffed to be among the most sought-after sportspersons in Portugal besides footballers. But he still has a regret of sorts.
“I am a team match lover. I love playing for somebody than playing for myself,” Monteiro says. “This is my sport. Yes, it is primarily an individual sport but many competitions are team events. I love playing team matches. Many time when I speak with friends, I feel maybe I am not in the right sport because I love playing team sport. But I have learnt to deal with it.”
Maharashtra United would be hoping the veteran would help them get off the blocks by upsetting the defending champion come Thursday.

On eight wheels
","If you have never been to a skating rink, it is a challenge to express the rush that the sport has on a spectator. Visakhapatnam is known for many things, and skating is one of them. The third edition of Rising Star Summer Roller Skating Championship organised by the Sivaji Park Skating Association (SPSA) at the Park, MVP Colony, got off to a colourful start on June 2. The modest-sized skating arena was decorated with colourful flags and was lined by parents sitting around the rink, cheering each time a skater zipped passed them. The impressive movement of feet and the turns — squatting slightly and staying absolutely still — was made to look effortless by the children in the rink. But it’s only when you get on the wheels do you really know what it takes to look effortless. Manha Begum, a three-year-old, has been skating since the last five months. Reshma Begum, Manha’s mother says, “We come to the park every day; she immediately got drawn to the sport.” 
The championship consisted of jonex, practice and speed wheel events. “A skater begins with jonex wheels and moves eventually to speed wheels as they improve,” says SPSA general secretary Mahendra Tated. About 260 children aged between three to 16 years registered for the two-day event. Andhra Pradesh Roller Skating Association president Raghupati Raju inaugurated the championship. In his inaugural address, Raju says “Thanks to existing infrastructure, the city has produced many world-class skaters. But we need an indoor facility as for next two years the nationals will take place here. We have requested the municipality to turn Sivaji Park skating rink into an indoor facility so that monsoons do not affect the competition.”
All the children participating were radiating the sportsman spirit. It was soul lifting to see children finish the race, without worrying about results. After each race, skaters rushed back to their parents for a hug and joined in the cheering for other participants. Ananda Dissanayake, a proud parent, said: “I am so proud, Chehitha (7) has learned so well in 11 months and qualified for the next round.” On June 3, the championship came to an end with the award ceremony. The event took a moment to recognise 20 children who won medals at the 55th National Roller Skating Championship and 13 skaters who will represent the nation in the 18th Asians Roller Skating Championship to be held in South Korea.

Sharath’s second coming
","Achanta Sharath Kamal is the classic comeback man. From his maiden 2003 conquest to claiming the senior National table tennis men’s singles title five years in a row, spilling it in the next five and regaining it twice in the last two years, he equalled Kamlesh Mehta’s record of eight titles at Ranchi last week.
It’s a second coming for the Chennai-based champ, laid low by a hamstring injury in 2015, wheelchair-bound for four weeks and able to walk without support only three months later. From an all-time high world ranking of 32, he had crashed to 74 the same year.
“I largely went unchallenged when winning five times on the trot, with either 4-0 or 4-1 verdicts,” Kamal told The Hindu on the sidelines of the Petroleum Sports Promotion Board (PSPB) inter-unit tournament here.
Recalling his Ranchi triumph, he said, “I was in Chennai all December. I trained in small halls where the ball travels faster than the bigger arenas that host major National or international tournaments. Such a switch suited me fine and I could come out guns blazing,” he said of his success.
The climb back to the top was slow but steady. Under the tutelage of coach Linus Mernsten since 2012, his game saw a transformation. The Swede who previously trained England and Luxembourg stood by his ward through the depths of despair. 
“I began to counter Anthony Amalraj with the backhand flick that he used to subdue me with. Consequently, I would lean less to the right to curb my overtly forehand game, realigning my body and correcting the posture,” said the highest-ever ranked Indian paddler.
The road to the final saw him cruise through seven rounds at his explosive best. “As the tournament progressed, my timing only got better,” said Kamal, a senior manager in Indian Oil. As always his pet stroke is the forehand top spin lash, unleashed close to the net with the ball on the ascent. “It defies physics,” he said of the shot, mastered under his uncle Muralidhara Rao.
“With Sharath based in Europe and adopting their style of play, he had difficulty in adapting to Indian conditions — the air, atmosphere, ball and tables. That caused his slump. Now that he has blended the two, he’s doing well. I wish he wins the National title a ninth time, because he deserves it for his dedication,” said India coach Arup Basak.

Falcons fly into the second spot
","Falcons’ flight into the top-four bracket stayed on course with 15-6 dismantling of Empowerji Challengers, as Sanil Shetty and Manav Thakkar drew a blank in singles, in the Ultimate Table Tennis league here Sunday. 
The one-sided result lifted Falcons to the second spot with 45 points and pushed Challengers to the fifth with 36. 
After the teams were locked 3-3 following two singles matches, Falcons broke away with Sanil making amends for his ordinary show in the singles by pulling off the doubles with ease in the company of the energetic Bernadette Szocs. 
Liam Pitchford maintained his unbeaten streak with a 2-1 win over Tiago Apolonia. The 49th-ranked Briton made light of the loss of the opening set to the Portuguese, placed nine rungs higher, and then called the shots to live up to his team’s expectations. 
Bernadette, ranked 36th, took a leaf out of Pitchford’s book and upstaged Lee Ho Ching in straights sets. Later, the 20th-ranked Hong Kong girl did prove superior to Sutirtha Mukherjee but not before dropping a game to the World No. 613. 
Even though there were victories for lower-ranked players in the tie, the singles matches involving Sanil and Manav disappointed the vociferous crowd. 
Sanil could not reproduce the magic of Friday and went down to World No. 12 Simon Gauzy, the highest-ranked player in the league this season, without a fight. The left-handed Indian could manage on 13 points during the 3-0 drubbing. 
Manav, ranked second in the world among juniors and the most promising Indian kid on the block, faced 56th ranked Alvaro Robles. In the first two sets, Manav ran Robles close but perished without a fight in the third. 
The results: Falcons beat Challengers 15-6 (Matilda Ekholm bt Divya Deshpande 11-9, 11-6, 11-7; Sanil Shetty lost to Simon Gauzy 5-11, 3-11, 5-11; Sanil Shetty & Berdadette Szocs bt Manav Thakkar & Georgina Pota 11-4, 11-9, 11-8; Liam Pitchford bt Tiago Apolonia 8-11, 11-7, 11-8; Bernadette Szocs bt Lee Ho Ching 11-9, 11-3, 11-10; Alvaro Robles bt Manav Thakkar 11-10, 11-9 11-2; Suthirtha Mukherjee lost to Lee Ho Ching 9-11, 11-5, 9-11).

Yuva bhavan to come up in Chittoor for 500 youth
"," Chittoor district will soon become a hub of youth-related activities, if the announcement made by Sports Authority of Andhra Pradesh (SAAP) Vice-Chairman and Managing Director N. Bangara Raju are any indication.
While Chittoor, the district headquarters town, has been sanctioned a ‘Yuva Bhavan,’ SAAP has agreed to provide one more for Tirupati, which is not only emerging as an academic hub, but also a destination for sports, fitness and athletics.
 Mr. Raju, during a marathon meeting with youth welfare and sports officials here on Thursday, announced that the Yuva Bhavan, to be developed at an outlay of ₹5 crore to house 500 young participants, will be used to conduct workshops, seminars and other forms of talent-nurturing events. 
Positive aspects
He said that youth would be trained in positive aspects such as in disaster management. While folk artistes are identified once in a year through cultural and youth festivals, he suggested a year-long calendar for holding such events on a regular basis.
“Skill development will get enhanced attention, where local youth will be trained as plumbers and electricians.” The meeting also discussed development of playfields, KVK stadiums and other cultural programmes.
SETVEN and District Sports Authority Chief Executive Officer S. Lakshmi was among those present.

Asian Games selection headaches continue ","With just over two months to go for the Asian Games, the cobwebs around various sports federations are being dusted and new issues flaring up. After gymnastics and equestrian, it’s now time for taekwondo to see a struggle for selecting teams.
The martial art form isn’t exactly a medal hope and is de-recognised by the Sports Ministry but that hasn’t stopped the powers-that-be from indulging in power games. In fact, there are four different factions existing in the sport in India at the moment with each claiming allegiance to a different parent organisation.
“The ministry has suggested that the Sports Authority of India (SAI) conduct selection trials and the same could then be ratified by the world body-recognised faction. That will make it easy for everyone but it may well run foul of World Taekwondo and we have already suffered once before CWG,” sources said.
Officials added that the IOA was instead keen on forming an ad-hoc committee, on the lines of gymnastics, involving all parties concerned — the government / SAI, the IOA and the faction officially recognised by the world body — but there was no clarity yet. The IOA and WT recognise the Chetan Anand-led faction.
Meanwhile, the Fencing Association of India has been unable to send its team for the upcoming Asian Championships in Bangkok pending an official order from the SAI. Interestingly, the trip and its budget has already been cleared by both the Sports Ministry and the finance committee of SAI.
“We have to leave latest by 15th, we have already postponed our departure twice. Next up is the weekend, how would arrangements be made? We had given the proposal even before the ACTC was submitted, met the sports secretary on May 22 and got verbal clearance. Two days later, it was officially cleared after being satisfied with our selections and other details. And yet the SAI hasn’t passed the order,” FAI secretary general Bashir Ahmed Khan said.
Twenty-four athletes — 12 men and women, four each in three events epee, foil and sabre — are to participate. Khan said two more in each event would be added to the squad on return and the best 24 would then be selected for the Asian Games.
