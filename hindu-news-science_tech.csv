Go, Google, gone
"," ‘In India, we choose our career after becoming an engineer,’ reads a popular meme on digital media — and this applies to Apoorva Tiwari as well. A final year student of Electronics and Communication at Vidya Jyothi Institute of Technology, app development is her forte. This deviation from her academic branch concerned her parents initially, but Apoorva’s impressive academic progress didn’t clash with her coding interests. 
She was the only student from Hyderabad to have made it to the annual Google I/O conference, California this May. Thrilled to have shared stage with global leaders and developers, she says the opportunity helped her engage in fruitful discussions on building applications with Google and many open source platforms (Android, Chrome and Chrome OS, APIs, Google Web Toolkit, App Engine). 
Her entry was facilitated through an app development course by Udacity. A series of contests helped her bag a Google scholarship out of a 5000-member community. Commitment levels, participant camaraderie and development prowess were the criteria. “This course has been interesting. There were contests that judged our abilities on a daily basis, I felt thrilled to have made the cut,” Apoorva says. She calls the Google I/O conference an unforgettable experience, “It was great to interact with global leaders. Though the course had us engaging with hangout calls with them regularly, meeting them at the conference was special.”
 I want to create something that will help people at an individual level too, like helping people to battle depression; no current apps do a great job of it
Not everything at the conference was technical, she made friends with people from different countries; it was a learning curve. “We were introduced to various Google products. I aspire to be an Android developer and I wanted to understand nuances, drawbacks and market needs before I take the plunge. The Google staff made sure we had enough opportunities to break ice — a DJ night, a magic show, performances by a few international bands and a dinner with the Indian community. It helped us get to know each other better. It was nice talking to them about aspects that could enhance our career prospects.”
Did the course and programme play spoilsport with her college schedules? “Not really. I was in my final year, so it didn’t demand my presence at college on a regular basis.” The first girl in her family to have made an overseas trip, she wishes to put her app development lessons to make the world a better place — she has ideas of an app that will help identify trash in every area that has to be disposed. “I want to create something that will help people at an individual level too, like helping people to battle depression; no current apps do a great job of it,” she points out. 
For those aspiring to make it to future Google I/O conferences, she says, “Enrolling in many community programmes beyond college is necessary. It will give you a direction. One must focus on academics, but shouldn’t compromise on their true calling.” 
Apoorva, currently wrapping up her nanodegree course in app development hopes to a bag a job that will further her interests.

Demystifying Science - June 3, 2018
","Two teams of researchers have identified a gene family called NOTCH2NL that appears to play an important role in human-specific cortex development and may have been a driving force in the evolution of our large brains. The evolution of larger brains, in the last 3 million years, has played an important role in our ability as a species to think, problem-solve, and develop culture. The researchers have found that NOTCH2NL can substantially expand the population of cortical stem cells, which in turn generate more neurons, making the human brain larger. The findings have been published in the journal, Cell.

Our competition is cash by itself, says PayPal's Guru Bhat
"," 
PayPal started domestic payments in India six months ago. How is that coming along?
It’s coming along well. We processed upwards of 450 billion dollars in payment in 2017 globally; that’s over 16,537 dollars per second. Still when we started the domestic payment six months ago, there were a lot of questions: were we too late, are there too many rival companies... But if you look at the payment volume in India, 85% is still in cash — so that is where our focus is. Our competition is not the other players in the market but cash in itself. Moreover, here we have the regulatory authorities as well as the government championing digital payment. Combine that with the increasing spending power of the Indian middle class, smartphone availability, Internet penetration and the number of millennials (people under 35 years of age) — the Indian market is really vibrant right now.
What is your growth strategy for India, are you looking at expanding presence in the Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities?
When we introduce something into a new market which is as complex as India, we need to understand the user base and modify our products to fit the Indian need. We recognise that the Indian market needs to be a marathon not a sprint. Given the dynamic market, we can’t build a fixed product here. We need to keep redesigning it to meet fresh demands.
India is an untapped opportunity for digital payments. Currently, we are focusing on the tier 1 market, but we will grow subsequently. Government initiatives and a favourable regulatory environment, along with mobile adoption, are changing the game in India. There has been a positive impact on how consumers and merchants are interacting, and this will accelerate the process of bringing online and offline together.
I’m not sure if we can have something truly offline, however, because you’ll still need to go online to sync your information to your account. But yes, say you have a lot of information about a customer’s payment activity, their patterns, how religiously they pay all their bills, then you can build in a system for offline payment. The technology is not an inhibitor there. If there is a need for it, we will make it happen.
The other thing we are working on is making PayPal easily accessible — any merchant can sign up to a PayPal account.
How do you plan to stand out in such a highly competitive market?
We have been in the market for several years. With so much data, comes a lot of insight as well. Our risk management is efficient — reducing fraud loss rates to 0.28% — that’s our secret sauce.
We use artificial intelligence to prevent collusion fraud — where a buyer and seller collude to cheat the company. We have algorithms to read patterns and detect which combination of buyers and sellers are most likely to commit fraud.
Moreover, we have a unique value proposition to protect sellers as well as buyers, where a customer has 180 days to dispute a fraudulent transaction.
Another difference right now is that our customers are not required to hold a balance or a wallet, you can directly use funding instruments like a credit or debit card. So the KYC mandate to register the customers’ Aadhaar or PAN number does not apply to us as of now.
What sort of tie-ups is PayPal looking at, to increase its user base?
For the domestic launch, we had partnered with a select set of merchants like BookMyShow, Yatra and MakeMyTrip. PayPal is now available for all merchants and consumers — offering a single account for their domestic and international transactions.
Do you see cryptocurrencies playing a big role in digital payments in the future?
If you look at the technology behind cryptocurrencies — the blockchain — that itself is promising; there is a huge potential in certain use cases. As a neutral payment system, we are committed to accepting the forms of payment our customers and merchants demand. But right now, we have not seen that kind of demand for cryptocurrency. It is just one of those things we are keeping an eye on, but not very closely.
My personal opinion is that despite the noble intention to enable free movement of money, it is lending itself to a lot of rackets. Moreover, it is prone to fluctuation, and anything that has so much speculation around it will not attract the big players. So it will be interesting to see what happens after the dust settles down after a year or so. Now, there is no technical reason to not use it, but we just do not see the need to introduce it.

Failure and faith
"," Like most football fans the world over, I spent late Saturday night last week, glued to a screen, watching the finals of the UEFA Champions League between Liverpool and Real Madrid, arguably one of the biggest matches in professional football. That Real Madrid won 3-1 was a result that surprised nobody really, though it disappointed many. However, the two big individual stories of that night mirrored certain patterns one sees in the entrepreneurial and startup world.
Take the biggest story of the night, for example, that of the Liverpool goalkeeper Loris Karius. He was a goalkeeping talent who at one point was considered to be at the same level, or even better, than the similarly-hairstyled David de Gea, who is now acknowledged to be one of the best goalkeepers in European football. 
But the only image that people will remember is of Karius, crying inconsolably, hands folded, apologising to Liverpool fans everywhere for two utterly improbable mistakes. He definitely did not plan for these. His coach, or investor sort of, believed that he was a better choice than Simon Mignolet, someone of comparable skill but lesser pedigree. He was just like a founder with great background and history that everyone — investors and otherwise — believes will result in unerring success. 
But something as trivial as two wrong decisions can change everything. Like it did for Karius. Karius right now is being courted by a third-tier Italian club, Rimini, in all seriousness. Hopefully, he need not accept the offer, but the startup world is littered with instances of those who had to accept similar changes. Take for example, the brashest entrepreneur out of IIT Bombay, who to be fair, upended a lot of what a startup dealing with real estate could do. If Karius does end up at Rimini, we’ll all do well to remember it is no ignominy, just as a superstar of the ‘housing’ sector working at a less fancied firm is.
Now, for the other big story of that night. Gareth Bale’s first goal. It was a feat of unimaginable athleticism that had enough visual appeal to go down in history as one of the greatest ever goals in competition history. For all the cachet that Bale has, for all the cachet that the BBC (Bale Benzema Cristiano) attack formation has, Bale’s star had been waning. When he was brought on as a substitute, it felt more like a defensive move than one that is attacking. Yet, he comes on. And his first touch is a bicycle kick that goes straight into goal. The only goal of the night for Real Madrid that did not depend on Karius’ nightmare performance. A goal that reminded many of the silliness of writing talented people off. Again something that happens all too often in the startup world. Investors tend to be so obsessed with what is fresh in the entrepreneurial funnel that they completely ignore people whose ideas demonstrably work.
They say it is too wishy-washy to draw real-life analogies from sports. But as far as I care, sports keeps proving this idea wrong.

'Dark Souls Remaster' review: Die in glorious detail "," Love it or hate it, the Dark Souls series is one of the most unique and visceral gaming experiences out there today. Some may call it masochistic and make religious warding signs every time they see it, but those who have had a taste of the darkness of Souls games always want more. No matter how many times the game punishes players by hurling them off a cliff, with a well-placed enemy or one of their towering bosses, one cannot help but come back. So much so it has spawned off a niche of ‘Souls’ games like Bloodborne, Nioh and the upcoming Code Vein. All this, kick-started by a game called Demon’s Souls, followed by Dark Souls, that gets a brand-new remastered treatment, so that you can go right to the source of where the ‘Souls’ craze begins.


What is it about?
The Dark Souls series has always been lauded for its inventive and unconventional storytelling experiences. Every one of these games throws you into a mysterious fantasy world, with just a smidgen of lore that does not make any sense whatsoever. While you’re dying all over the place, the game never hand-holds you through boring storytelling, if you don’t want to. However, for those intrepid explorers, a massive treat awaits, as the game encourages you to observe, connect the dots, find story snippets lying around. Thread by thread, it weaves itself into a beautiful tapestry, telling a deep story with very interesting characters, all left to you to interpret.




You play a character that you can create from a bunch of presets and classes, who finds himself in a dark world. An undead entity doomed to roam the lands, each death stripping him of his humanity further and further into a wraith. Even though you resurrect, you have to constantly quest to preserve what vestiges of humanity you have left, as you rush to reignite the Age of Fire once more. 
No game captures you as much as Dark Souls, as you keep exploring on and on, deep into this world of true despair. It is that feeling of existential dread that keeps you going on. Chalk that up to the superb gameplay. 
How does it play?
At its core, Dark Souls is an action role-playing game, that’s a lethal combination of a deep sword play and dodge, parry system and completely devilish level design. Along with its secret sauce, which is death. Expect to die hundreds of times, because that is the core mechanic on which this game is built upon. Killing monsters of all kinds gives you a currency called Souls, which you spend on upgrading yourself or buying items. If you die, your souls remain on the spot of your death for you to double back and collect them again. If you die en route, you lose everything. 
This risk reward system is the whole and soul of this game, and while it does sound dark and dreary, it’s actually the most fun element. The elation you feel when you narrowly escape that death is like a drug that keeps on giving. This game is so unbelievably unforgiving that it plays some sort of reverse psychology joo joo on you, making you want to conquer that level. Where in an RPG, when you level up, you get better, in Dark Souls you level up your skills with the game. No matter how high your level is, even the lowest minion can kill you with a few well-placed hits. The level design is treacherous, tricking the careless adventurer into plunging to his death. 




The bosses though are truly scary, instilling complete and utter fear in you. All of them are truly creepy, crawling straight out of your worst horror movies. There is a secret escape-it-all though in Souls games, which is the evade roll, which just adds that level of agility to the game that makes you feel like a proper swashbuckling knight. Add to that some magic and some quick thinking on your part, you can overcome any of these bosses. That endorphin hit you get will make you shout in glee. Good luck trying to explain what just happened to your flatmates though.
The original Dark Souls was a beautiful game, but a complete mess on PC. The remaster just makes everything so much better, running at a smooth 60 frames per second, even in the dreaded blight town. If you own a good PC, PlayStation Pro or Xbox One X, the game can scale up to 4k. With improved graphics, texture quality and lighting, worthy for today’s gamers. 
Should you get it?
If it is challenge ye seek, oh adventurer, then look no further than Dark Souls, to set you off on ye merry way. Those warriors on the go, may want to wait till the Switch version launches to take this masterpiece on the subway with you. Whether you are a returning player or a newbie, you cannot afford to miss out on Dark Souls: Remastered.

The best from the science journals: Melancholic moulds and the first footprints
","First footprints?
Published in Science Advances
South China is now officially the place where an animal laid the first footprint. A new fossil containing track imprints, believed to have been made by a pair-legged creature like a millipede or a worm with legs has been discovered here. The fossil is about 635 to 541 million years old, which means that the creature lived during the geological period known as Ediacaran Period. With this new fossil, scientists now have solid evidence to prove that the Ediacaran Period saw the first animal with paired appendages, thus filling gaps in evolutionary history.
Blood protein atlas
Published in Nature




Did you know that we have above 1,500 proteins in our blood? And there are about 2,000 genetic associations with these proteins? An international team of researchers has now created the first detailed genetic map of the proteins in human blood plasma. The scientists built this map after studying about 3,300 individuals, their DNA, and genomes. The authors say that this atlas can improve our understanding of diseases and help in developing new drugs.
Hidden state of matter
Published in Nature Materials
Using new high-tech equipments researchers have now seen electrons interacting inside a superconductive alloy. Short pulses at terahertz frequency were used to bombard the superconductor (niobium-tin) and these flashes suddenly turned the compound into a new state of matter. Further studies are planned to understand more about this hidden state which can find applications in quantum computing.
Unhappy fungi
Published in Nature




Even lowly fungi leading a hidden life in tree roots are affected by pollution. Looking at 40,000 roots, 13,000 soil samples from 137 forests in 20 European countries, a ten-year study has now shown that increased nitrogen and carbon in the air is causing stress to helpful fungi that live on the roots of many trees. The team also found that as the fungi went sick the trees also looked malnourished indicating how the plant-fungal symbiotic relationship was important for the survival of the tree.
Stubborn Zika
Published in Science Advances




To understand if Zika infection in newborn babies can persist into adulthood, researchers infected three-day-old mice with the virus and observed its developments. They found that even after reaching adulthood, the mice suffered from seizures, showed reduced motor functions and did not perform well in behavioral and memory tests. The team also found that by using a drug called infliximab, the number of seizures could be reduced. This study is the first to look at the long term effects of the disease.

Even small dams have severe impact on river ecology
"," It seems to stand to reason that small dams cause less environmental problems than large ones. But the first study on small hydropower projects in India proves that they cause as severe ecological impacts as big dams, including altering fish communities and changing river flows.
Such hydroprojects, which usually generate less than 25 megawatts of power and consist of a wall that obstructs a river's flow, a large pipe that diverts the collected water to a turbine-driven powerhouse to generate electricity and a canal that releases the water back into the river, are touted to be better than large dams because they submerge fewer regions and barely impact river flow. Such projects receive financial subsidies — even carbon credits — for being ‘greener’.
To see how green such small dams really are, scientists from organisations including Bengaluru’s Foundation for Ecological Research, Advocacy and Learning (FERAL) compared almost 50 kilometres of three river tributaries — over one undammed and two dammed stretches — of the Netravathi river in the Western Ghats of Karnataka. 
They studied three zones in detail: above the dam (upstream), in the area between the dam’s wall and the powerhouse, sometimes completely devoid of water (‘de-watered’) and below the powerhouse (downstream). Here, they studied differences in water depth and width, which signify how much habitat is available to the river's denizens, and habitat quality through factors including dissolved oxygen content and water temperatures. 
Their results show that changes in water flow in the dammed sections reduced the stream’s depth and width; water in these stretches was also warmer and had lower dissolved oxygen levels. These changes were most evident in the ‘de-watered’ zones and worsened in the dry seasons.
Habitat quality
This decrease in habitat quantity and quality showed in fish diversity too. The team found that un-dammed stretches recorded a higher diversity of fish species, including endemics (species seen only in the Western Ghats).
“The upstream and downstream stretches get disconnected and this impedes the river,” says Suman Jumani, lead author of the study and researcher at FERAL.
Such small hydro-projects cropping up on rivers in the Ghats is a serious worry, she adds, especially because they do not require environmental impact assessments.
“It is not a question of small versus big dams,” says Jumani. “Small dams are not necessarily bad if there are proper regulations in place.”
Regulations could include limiting the number of dams in a river basin or maintaining a minimum distance between dams on the same river stretch.

New route to clean wastewater
"," Self-propelling nanomotors, just 200 nanometre in size, could be used for wastewater management in chemical industries. Developed by researchers from Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Kolkata, and The Institute of Mathematical Sciences, Chennai, the nanomotor can be used for transporting catalysts needed in harsh chemical environments and removing unwanted chemicals in water.
Nanorods (rod shaped nanomotors) are made using ammonium heptamolybdate tetrahydrate and dispersed in the solution to be treated. When hydrazine sulphate is added to water, it reacts with the nanorods producing nitrogen gas. This leads to an osmotic stress in the fluid and causes the nanorods to move along the direction of the gas evolved. 
The paper published in Frontiers in Chemistry says that this nanomotor is amongst the fastest reported active nanoparticles.
“Molybdenum based soft-oxometalates are non-toxic and easy to synthesize. The complementary charge interactions on the surface trigger their motion. The speed can be increased by increasing the concentration of the fuel hydrazine on the surface of the nanorods and they were found to remain in their motile state for about three days,” says Prof Soumyajit Roy from the Department of Chemical Sciences, IISER Kolkata and one of the corresponding authors of the paper.
Structure matters
The anterior end of these structures is capped like a pencil while the posterior end consists of a series of rod like protrusions. “We believe that these exposed ends of the rods provide a more accessible reaction surface than the capped end. 
Therefore, the fuel hydrazine preferentially reacts at the posterior open end and generates gaseous nitrogen which triggers motion and the propulsion speed reaches up to a maximum of 600 metres per hour.” says Prof. R. Adhikari from Department of Physics at IMSc, Chennai who is one of the corresponding authors of the paper, in an email to The Hindu.
In a paper to be published in the journal Nanoscale, the researchers have shown that another type of nanomotor in the form of a sphere (using titanium dioxide, heptamolybdate and gold) can also be used for delivering a catalyst to a particular area of interest by using visible light. The nanospheres were found to move away from visible light. “The catalyst triggers a reaction and the pollutants get adsorbed on the nanospheres leading to quickly removal of organic pollutants from water. The solution can then be filtered, dried and the nanosphere can be retrieved,” says Apabrita Mallick, an Integrated PhD student at IISER Kolkata and one of the first authors of the paper.

Now, polyethylene plastic with antibacterial properties
","Silver nanoparticles embedded on clay have now been successfully dispersed inside plastic to create new antimicrobial films, filaments and can also be moulded into other plastic items. Silver nanoparticle-embedded plastics were found to have greater than 99% antibacterial activity against common bacterial pathogens like Escherchia coli and Staphylococcus aureus.
Silver nanoparticles of about 10 nanometre size were deposited on clay particles of about 200-300 nanometre length. “We used an inorganic clay found in volcanic sites called Montmorillonite. Silver nanoparticles have a tendency of agglomeration or clumping due to high surface area, so we provided clay as a platform for the silver to sit on,” explains Anasuya Roy, PhD scholar at IIT, Delhi and first author of the paper published in Polymer Composites.
Clay-silver compound
The clay–silver compound, containg 10% silver, was then loaded into the high density polyethylene plastic using a melt compounding method. “The clay is inorganic and highly hydrophilic, whereas our plastic is organic, hydrophobic and nonpolar. They are highly incompatible. So we use a compatibilizer, which gives the required adhesion between the two phases. Also, inside the twin screw extruder machine, the necessary speed, temperature and time gives uniform mixing and the silver-clay is well embedded inside the plastic,” explains Prof. Mangala Joshi, from Department of Textile Technology at IIT Delhi and corresponding author of the paper.
Films and filaments
They then converted the newly formed silver–clay–plastic nanocomposite into films, filaments and also moulded these into specimens and checked the antibacterial property. The films and filaments showed higher activity than the moulded ones. “In the moulded ones, we found that the antimicrobial silver was not available on the surface leading to the reduction in activity. But when the concentration of silver–clay complex was increased from 3% to 5%, the moulded ones also showed excellent activity against the two pathogens,” adds Joshi. The research team has got a U.S. patent.
The team also tried other metal ions like zinc and copper in the place of silver. “Silver has a high reduction potential, meaning it can quickly go from silver ions to silver nanoparticles without the need of any external reducing agent. These silver nanoparticles interact with the bacterial cell wall and also generate oxidative stress inside the cell, thus killing it,” explains Roy. “The content of silver is very low in these nanocomposite plastic so no toxicity to human cells. Further, we checked the biocompatibility of the plastic with human skin and blood in vitro. In vivo tests are in progress and we hope that the new plastic can find a wide range of applications in the biomedical field and also in commodity items where this antimicrobial property can be an added advantage.”

What caused the Dec. 1, 2015 Chennai downpour? ","On December 1, 2015 Chennai and its surrounding regions experienced an unprecedented, heavy rainfall. In a region where the average rainfall during the season is expected to be 8-10 mm per day, one of the rain gauges in the city recorded an abnormally high, 494 mm, rainfall over 24 hours that day. This led to death of nearly 250 people, and Chennai was declared a ‘disaster zone’. There have been attempts to explain this phenomenon of how clouds remained stationary over this region, continuously giving rain over 24 hours. In a first, Jayesh Phadtare of Centre for Atmospheric and Ocean Sciences, Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru, links the presence of the Eastern Ghats to this phenomenon, in a paper published in Monthly Weather Review.
Cold pool
When clouds give out water droplets, the droplets evaporate mid-air, as they fall down. This cools the surrounding air, forming a cold pool of air which sinks down and flows horizontally. “The gusty cold wind that heralds an approaching thunderstorm is nothing but a cold pool, which plays a pivotal role in cloud dynamics.” says Jayesh.
Unlike the Western Ghats, which run close to the west coast of India, the Eastern Ghats are nearly 200 km away from the coast. Therefore, the link between the mountains’ orography and the rainfall over the region is not obvious, and this is the first study to link the two. Jayesh, who is studying cloud propagation over the Indian region, could see the connection by observing satellite images: “In Kalpana-I satellite images, I saw that the clouds that gave so much rain over Chennai on 1 December 2015 moved from Bay of Bengal to the coast and became stationary there,” he says. Realising that the Eastern Ghats must be having a role in this, he went on to study a model of the system. “The interaction between mountains, clouds and cold pools became clear after performing the model experiments,” he adds, in an email to The Hindu.
According to the model, the cold pool was obstructed by the Eastern Ghats from flowing downward. Hence it piled up and remained stationary over the Chennai region. “The reason for the clouds remaining stationary was that there was a balance between the piling of cold pool along the mountain and the winds from the bay. This does not happen in all heavy rainfall incidences over Chennai,” says Jayesh.
Sensitivity experiments were done to check this model. In the experimental model in which the orography was absent, the winds just swept downstream and the clouds moved inland. In the model where the evaporative cooling was removed, the cold pool did not form at all and the clouds moved over the Ghats.
Dust storms
Cold pools are known to play an important role in the dust storms (Aandhi) that form in northern India. They form by the evaporation of raindrops. This process is more efficient in the drier and warmer environment as there is lot of scope of evaporation. So, the cold pools that form in these conditions, are deeper and more vigorous. “As pre-monsoon conditions in north India are very dry and warm, cold pools that accompany the pre-monsoon thunderstorms there are far more destructive, causing widespread damages,” says Jayesh. For the first time, this study links cold pools and the mountain structure to explain rainfall over south India.
Though the primary aim of the study is to explain the anomalous rainfall over Chennai on December 1, 2015, ""the understanding gained from this analysis can be useful for improving the general weather forecast over this region,” the author writes in the paper.

Conquering the emperor of maladies "," The title that the cancer specialist, Dr Siddhartha Mukherjee chose for his Pulitzer-prize winner book on cancer was “The Emperor of All Maladies.” It signifies both the awe and a sportsman-like admiration of the challenge posed by the opponent, cancer. Earlier in 1971, President Richard Nixon of the US, on a similar vein, declared a “war on cancer,” with a federal funding of $1.4 billion. And over these 47 years, the US National Cancer Institute alone has spent $90 billion on the war on cancer. We are yet to win.
Each year, 1.73 million new cancer cases are reported in the US, with apparently one cancer death every 20 minutes. In India, it is 2.5 million people, with one death every 8 minutes. It is thus urgent and vital that solutions be found for this deadly disease, which has been with us since the dawn of civilisation.
Cancer occurs when an otherwise healthy cell is damaged, leading to uncontrolled growth, affecting the health of the body. Damage can occur either because of inborn or inherited errors in one or more genes affecting the cell, or due to lifestyle and environmental factors. While normal cells are programmed to multiply and grow to a certain size and stay so, cancer cells, whose DNA is mutated by such damage, go on rampant growth leading to tumours. The cancer specialist removes these errant cancer cells and tumour by medication or surgery. But the big challenge is not the first treatment alone, but that it should not recur and/or metastasise (move to and affect other parts of the body). The fight against cancer is thus to uproot the cause of the damage once and for all.
Immunity
It is here that we turn to the in-built defense mechanisms in the body. These are through the immune system, which is a complex network of cells, tissues and the molecules they make to help in fighting infections and other diseases, including cancer. White blood cells play the main role here. In particular, there is the group of cells called B-lymphocytes which recognise the shape of the molecules in the invader, and make proteins called antibodies which lock on to the invader and removes it. (Importantly, this shape is ‘remembered’ so that when a fresh attack by this same invader occurs, B cells are prepared!) Another set called T cells release chemicals that push the invading cells to commit suicide. In this process, these T-killer cells are aided by a group called T-helper cells. In addition, there is another group called dendritic cells which help activate both the B- cells and T-killer cells, enabling them to respond to specific threats. 
Each cell has on its surface a little marker, a small molecular ID- card or a biometric, called an antigen. These are small molecular fragments found on the cell surface. Antigens in the normal cells of the body are recognized as “self” by the immune system of the body and left alone. But when “foreign” cells such as those of an invading microbe or virus enter the system, their ‘non-self’ antigens are detected, attacked and thrown out of the body by the B and T lymphocytes.
This is also the basis of vaccines. In a vaccine, we introduce the disease- causing germs (either in the dead from or highly- disabled “live” form) into the body. This causes the immune system to recognise the “non-self” foreign antigen, grab it (using the antibody proteins) and throw it out of the body. Plus, the immune system ‘remembers’ this non-self antigen and when the invader comes again, has the B cells make antibodies against it and remove it from the system, thus offering protection for a long time. This is the basis behind vaccination against many diseases, including cancer-causing viruses such as human papilloma virus (HPV) and the hepatitis B and C viruses.
Once bitten, twice prepared
How is this relevant to other forms of cancer? Cancer cells too have antigens on their surface. These form the cancer-associated antigens, including some that have not been seen previously by the body’s immune system. These are called neo-antigens. They are foreign to the body, and come from the invader. 
In the current excitement on the cure of the cancer, this idea of using our immune system and make an anti-cancer vaccine is on the high table. This is not a preventive vaccine (as the HPV or hepatitis vaccines are) but a therapeutic (or treatment) vaccine. Here, the doctor first treats the cancer by existing methods. In order that it does not recur, nor metastasise, he/she then takes a piece of the cancer tissue from the patient, and has the neo-antigens identified. Next, he/she works with a group of scientists who use computer methods to check which fragment will trigger the patient’s immune system best to fight the cancer cells. The so-chosen neo-antigen is used to make the vaccine, and once the vaccine is made, use it on the patients to protect them from further recurrence of the illness and thus get rid of the cancer, hopefully forever.
Some cancer vaccines are already in the market; for example, HER2 against breast cancer, Provenge against prostate cancer, and T-VEC against melanoma. Increasingly though, some researchers want to read the patient’s genome, sequence the DNA or RNA of the tumor there, identify the mutations therein and make a specially constructed ‘personalised’ vaccine for the individual. The emperor may hit and maul. But now that we are adopting the Boys Scouts slogan, “Be Prepared”, will his days be numbered?

Severe uranium contamination in India’s groundwater: Study ","Scientists have found widespread uranium contamination in groundwater from aquifers across 16 states in India, much above the WHO provisional standard for the country. The findings published in the journal Environmental Science & Technology Letters are the first to demonstrate the predominant prevalence of uranium in India’s groundwater.
The researchers from Duke University in the US unveiled new data showing that the occurrence in uranium in Indian groundwater — a primary source of drinking water and irrigation — is an emerging and widespread phenomenon.
They compiled data on groundwater uranium from 16 Indian states and new data from 324 wells in Rajasthan and Gujarat that shows a high prevalence of uranium concentrations above the WHO provisional guideline value across India.
The WHO has set a provisional safe drinking water standard of 30 micrograms of uranium per litre for India, a level that is consistent with US Environmental Protection Agency standards. Despite this, uranium is not yet included in the list of contaminants monitored under the Bureau of Indian Standards’ Drinking Water Specifications, researchers said.
The study suggests that contribution of human factors such as groundwater depletion and nitrate pollution may be aggravating the already present natural uranium contamination to dangerous levels. Several studies have linked exposure to uranium in drinking water to chronic kidney disease.
“Nearly a third of all water wells we tested in one state, Rajasthan, contained uranium levels that exceed the World Health Organization and US Environmental Protection Agency’s safe drinking water standards,” said Avner Vengosh, a professor of geochemistry and water quality at Duke’s Nicholas School of the Environment. “By analysing previous water quality studies, we also identified aquifers contaminated with similarly high levels of uranium in 26 other districts in northwestern India and nine districts in southern or southeastern India.”
Many of India’s aquifers are composed of clay, silt and gravel carried down from Himalayan weathering by streams or uranium-rich granitic rocks. When over-pumping of these aquifers’ groundwater occurs and their water levels decline, it induces oxidation conditions that, in turn, enhance uranium enrichment in the shallow groundwater that remains.
While the primary source of uranium is geogenic (naturally occurring), anthropogenic (human caused) factors such as groundwater table decline and nitrate pollution may further enhance uranium mobilisation. Using geochemical and uranium isotope data, it suggests factors that may drive high uranium concentrations in groundwater, including uranium content in aquifer rocks, oxidation state, and groundwater chemistry that promotes the formation of soluble uranyl carbonate complexes.
“Our analysis showed that the occurrence of uranium in these groundwater sources depends on several factors,” said Rachel M Coyte, a PhD student in Vengosh’s lab.
These factors include the amount of uranium contained in an aquifer’s rocks; water-rock interactions that cause the uranium to be extracted from those rocks; oxidation conditions that enhance the extracted uranium’s solubility in water; and the interaction of the extracted uranium with other chemicals in the groundwater, such as bicarbonate, which can further enhance its solubility.
“In many parts of India, these factors co-occur and result in high uranium concentrations in the groundwater,” Coyte said. “Geochemistry and isotopic tools help us to better understand the process and conditions that control uranium occurrence in groundwater.”
Human activities, especially the over-exploitation of groundwater for agricultural irrigation, may contribute to the problem, said Coyte. “One of the takeaways of this study is that human activities can make a bad situation worse, but we could also make it better,” Vengosh said.
The study strongly suggests the need for revision of the current water quality monitoring program in India, evaluation of human health risks in areas of high uranium prevalence, development of adequate remediation technologies, and, above all, implementation of preventive management practices to address this problem, said Vengosh.
“Including a uranium standard in the Bureau of Indian Standards’ Drinking Water Specification based on uranium’s kidney-harming effects, establishing monitoring systems to identify at-risk areas, and exploring new ways to prevent or treat uranium contamination will help ensure access to safe drinking water for tens of millions in India,” he said.

NASA rover data shows Mars had organic compounds, methane
"," Curiosity rover has detected a bonanza of organic compounds on the surface of Mars and seasonal fluctuations of atmospheric methane. The findings released on June 7, mark some of the strongest evidence ever that Earth's neighbour may have harbored life.
But NASA scientists emphasized there could be nonbiological explanations for both discoveries made by the Curiosity rover at a site called Gale crater, leaving the issue of Martian life a tantalizing but unanswered question.
Three different types of organic molecules were discovered when the rover dug just 5 cm into roughly 3.5 billion-year-old mudstone, a fine-grained sedimentary rock, at Gale crater, apparently the site of a large lake when ancient Mars was warmer and wetter than the desolate planet it is today.
Curiosity also measured an unexpectedly large seasonal cycle in the low levels of atmospheric methane. About 95 % of the methane in Earth's atmosphere is produced from biological activity, though the scientists said it is too soon to know if the Martian methane also is related to life. Organic molecules are the building blocks of life, though they can also be produced by chemical reactions unrelated to life. The scientists said it is premature to know whether or not the compounds were created in biological processes.
Whether anywhere other than Earth has harbored life, perhaps even in microbial form, is one of the paramount questions in science.
“There's three possible sources for the organic material,” said astrobiologist Jennifer Eigenbrode of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland. “The first one would be life, which we don't know about. The second would be meteorites. And the last one is geological processes, meaning the rock-forming processes themselves.”
“What the organic detections in the rock do is to add to the story of habitability. It tells us that this ancient environment on Mars could have supported life,” Eigenbrode said. “Everything that was needed to support life was there. But it doesn't tell us that life was there.”
Christopher Webster, an atmospheric science research fellow at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California, said it is possible existing microbes are contributing to the Martian atmospheric methane. “With this new data, we again cannot rule out microbial activity as a potential source.”
The amount of methane peaked at the end of summer in the northern hemisphere at about 2.7 times the level of the lowest seasonal amount. The scientists were surprised to find organic compounds, especially in the amounts detected, considering the harsh conditions, including bombardment of solar radiation on the Martian surface. 
After drilling, Curiosity heats the rock samples, releasing the compounds. Referring to the findings regarding organic compounds and methane, Webster said, “They hint at an earlier time on Mars when water was present and the existence of primitive life forms was possible.”
The scientists hope to find better preserved organic compounds with Curiosity or other rovers that would allow them to check for chemical signatures of life.
The research was published in the journal Science.

French team tests virtual reality path to pain relief
","The very thought of visiting a hospital emergency department is stressful enough for many people, even without the discomfort or pain of an examination or treatment.
Enter an immersive virtual-reality programme created by three graduates being used in France to relax patients and even increase their tolerance of pain — without resorting to drugs.
“What we offer is a contemplative world where the patient goes on a guided tour, in interactive mode, to play music, do a bit of painting or work out a riddle,” said Reda Khouadra, one of the 24-year-olds behind the project.
As patients are transported by chunky VR goggles into a three-dimensional world of Japanese zen gardens or snowy hillsides, they become more tolerant of minor but painful procedures such as having a cut stitched, a burn treated, a urinary catheter inserted or a dislocated shoulder pushed back into place.
Curbing anxiety
“The virtual reality project ... enables us to offer patients a technique to distract their attention and curb their pain and anxiety when being treated in the emergency room,” said Olivier Ganansia, head of the emergency department at the Saint-Joseph Hospital in Paris. “I think in 10 years, virtual reality won’t even be a question any more, and will be used in hospitals routinely.”
The Healthy Mind startup is not a world first but has landed a $20,000 prize from a university in Adelaide, Australia, which will now pay for the three founders to present their project at Microsoft’s headquarters in the U.S. city of Seattle.

WhatsApp sharing limited data with Facebook on payment feature
"," Popular messaging app WhatsApp has claimed it shares limited data of payment service with its parent firm Facebook and the social media major does not use the information for commercial purpose.
“Facebook does not use WhatsApp payment information for commercial purposes, it simply helps pass the necessary payment information to the bank partner and NPCI(National Payment Corporation of India). In some cases, we may share limited data to help provide customer support to you or keep payments safe and secure,” WhatsApp claimed on its website. WhatsApp is running beta version of its payment service in India. 
According to government sources, the Ministry of Electronics and IT has written to National Payment Corporation of India to verify compliance around WhatsApp payment and check if WhatsApp is sharing data with its parent firm Facebook.
 The ministry has asked NPCI to verify compliance of WhatsApp payment it scales up its service. 
WhatsApp on its website said that when a user makes a payment, the mobile messaging app creates the necessary connection between the sender and recipient of the payment, using Facebook infrastructure. 
“We pass the transaction information to the bank partner, which is called a PSP (payment service provider), and to NPCI (National Payment Corporation of India), so they can facilitate the movement of funds between the sender’s and receiver’s bank accounts,” the website said.
When contacted, WhatsApp spokesperson said, Facebook processes UPI (Unified Payments Interface) transaction data as a service provider for WhatsApp, and does not use WhatsApp payments transaction data for commercial purposes. 
The IT ministry has expressed concern around data safety Facebook users in India following data leak from its platform to Cambridge Analytica. The ministry on June 7 again issued to Facebook seeking explanation on reports that it shared information of users with mobile device makers. WhatsApp claimed that it also does not store any sensitive payment information such as one-time password send for the transaction, account number or full debit card details. 
“Today, almost 1 million people are testing WhatsApp payments in India. The feedback has been very positive. People enjoy the convenience of sending money as simply and securely as they send messages. We’re working closely with NPCI and multiple banks including our payment service providers to expand the feature to more people and support India’s digital economy,” the spokesperson said.

Microsoft working on next-generation Xbox
","Pulse-pounding new video games and more ways to enjoy them are at the centre of the Electronic Entertainment Expo extravaganza officially kicking off here on Tuesday.
The annual E3 expo promised glimpses at trends such as collaborating in online teams instead of playing solo, and blazingly popular battle royale death matches such as those at the heart of Fortnite and Playerunknown’s Battlegrounds.
Microsoft is hard at work on a next-generation console along with a cloud service that would let players stream games to any device.
Microsoft is adding five new game studios, one it is creating in Southern California and another four it is buying, Xbox team chief Phil Spencer said. “We are making one of our greatest single year’s investments in teams by adding five new creative studios,” Mr. Spencer said at a media event ahead of the formal start of the Expo.
Microsoft has been criticised for lacking hit video games exclusively for play on Xbox, while Sony has dominated this console generation with PlayStation 4 models.
The event was packed with cinematic snippets or play of 52 games. Of those, 18 titles were tailored for the Xbox console.

Street Fighter Anniversary collection review: Back to the streets
"," Any kid growing up anywhere in the world in the 80s and 90s will fondly remember going to the arcades. Referred to by parents as havens of sin, for us we saw it as an escape into the fight clubs where we could test our mettle. One of those games that allowed us to do so was Street Fighter, a game that we challenged and were challenged by others. It’s been 30 years of the fighting game and it’s still going strong. To mark this, Capcom has launched a special collection of all the past Street Fighters.
What’s it about?
Street Fighter is a one-on-one fighting game, one of the games that made the genre so popular, that today it’s a serious competitive e-sport. Featuring iconic characters like Ken, Ryu, Chun-Li, Guile, Akuma, over the years the roster has expanded and evolved, introducing newer characters.
This collection of classic Street Fighter games has the very first game right upto Street Fighter III. That includes each sequel’s sub games, in all its glory. Also included is the excellent Street Fighter Alpha series, with Alpha I, II and III.
How does it play?
The 30th Anniversary Collection is loaded with nostalgic goodness. Capcom has put the games in their entirety, as they appeared on the Arcades. You can choose to play it in 4:3 screen aspect ratio, which was popular then, or you can choose to stretch it across the 16:9 ratios of today, which is not advisable, since it stretches the onscreen fighters. The best part though, is that you can turn on an arcade mode that includes the scanlines and coloration of those old CRT displays.
The Switch edition, especially, is worth noting, so you can take the fight on the go. It makes the most sense, especially when you’re docked to the console. Though the Xbox and PlayStation controllers are better for ergonomics. You can not only play against someone the usual two-controller way, but you can also connect online with some of the games and play against people across the world. Not only that, you can play on a local network on the Switch.
Should you get it?
If you love Street Fighter, and want to relive your arcade days, then look no further than the 30th Anniversary Collectors edition. It’s after all, twelve whole games in one.

The story of creating an Indian network to connect blood donors and recipients "," Way back in 1998, in the days of high internet costs and dial-up connections, when going online in India meant sitting in an internet café, Khushroo Poacha, now 50, was doing just that. Except, unlike most of us who went online to chat though, he was emailing his cousin in Canada, to ask for help setting up a website that would help connect people who wanted to donate blood with those who needed it.
“In 1994, my grandmother was in a coma in a hospital in Nagpur, and I used to spend the night in the hospital. One night, I heard loud noises and I rushed out to see people beating up a doctor,” says Poacha. He asked what the matter was and was told that the doctor had ‘killed’ a patient. Delving deeper, he understood that the patient’s relatives had been told to arrange for some blood which they couldn’t manage. Something stirred in Poacha. A few years later, he was personally affected when a friend called to ask for help arranging blood donors. “We weren’t able to, and the person died,” he says.




So, in March 1999, he got into a conversation about starting a website that would make the connection. He realised the power the internet would play, “but things like domain names, servers, all this was not known to us, and so we registered the name www.indianblooddonors.com. It was only later that someone told them that .com was usually used for a business and that they could have registered it as .org. “My wife, Fermin and I spent ₹40,000 to ₹45,000 on this, buying a second-hand computer and domain name, hosting the website in the US. It was a huge amount those days, and I withdrew my PF for this,” says Poacha.
The first few who registered were friends. This was soon followed by using the paging technology. Poacha put out a line asking people to page him if they needed blood and someone from outside Nagpur paged back saying they did. He immediately connected to his registered friends, and someone who had never been a donor before stepped forward. “When I saw the way the person thanked her, I knew this would work,” he says.
An employee of the Indian Railways, his wife worked in a school office, and he says he was clear it never was, nor ever will be about making money off it, or even turning it into an NGO. It will, however, reach out to as many people as possible, using the most popular technology of the time, because “people at the bottom of the pyramid should be able to access it”.




In 2001, the Gujarat earthquake happened. His wife’s family was from there, and though they were unhurt, he felt he needed to do something. He made a cold call to Zee TV, asking them to run the website in the ticker. “Our site crashed in half an hour. It was January 26, so everyone was on leave. I woke up the guard at the web hosting company (by then he had moved the website to an Indian server), and begged him for the number of the company owner. That very day, they moved the website to a standalone server,” he says. The company, Net4India, till date, hosts the website free of cost.
After this, the numbers on the website only grew, and today, there are over 50,000 registered donors online. In 2009, they started keeping track of numbers, and have connected 1,36,000 people since then. When mobile services picked up, SMSes were what kept up the momentum. He got the idea when his wife sent him out to buy vegetables during a cricket match and he texted a number for a score.
Today, it’s a helpline number 7961907766 on an interactive-voice response (IVR) system that Neil Patel, CEO of Awaaz.De, a volunteer, has helped him set up. There’s also an app for Android (Indian Blood Donors), even as he’s figuring out how WhatsApp can be used to expand reach. He’s currently looking for people to volunteer in other areas of the organisation.
“After 19 years of marriage, I was blessed with a daughter five years ago,” says Poacha. “I am sure it was the blessings of all those thousands of people I have helped.”

Fighting fire
"," What you do day-to-day at your job, when you are at any level of management, and especially so in the world of technology, can be divided into a convenient dichotomy. There is time that you spend on immediate problems, usually under tremendous amounts of pressure because of the impact that not tackling the problems will have on your business. Then there is time that you spend on making plans for the long term, trying to shape the directions in which your business will grow. Some term this dichotomy as ‘running the business’ versus ‘scaling the business’. I prefer to think of it in terms of dousing the flames of a house on fire versus digging a pit to lay stones as foundation for a big house that you intend to build.
In a larger company, fighting fires is easy. The fire can be compartmentalised, localised, and fought. Think of it as a large skyscraper, where there is a fire in one floor. Unless the fire is really catastrophic, or people fail to handle it correctly, it will not bring the whole building down. You can even have teams focusing on just firefighting, and you can have a whole bunch of other people thinking about building long-term businesses.
But in startups, it often feels like one’s entire time is taken up by firefighting. There are product features failing. There are cases of the operations set-up not being able to handle sudden surges in demand. There are vendors demanding payment. There are clients who are refusing to pay up. There are angry customers threatening hell and high water because they feel that they are entitled to far more than what they have paid for. It is like a small unfinished house full of highly flammable materials that has caught fire, and the damage that it causes can quickly turn permanent and irreversible. At a time when entrepreneurs should be thinking about how their startups can scale up, and build for the future, they end up using all their resources on just keeping the company alive.
So what should startups be doing to avoid the dangers of perennial firefighting? A mantra from the world of healthcare is useful here. Prevention and early detection. As a startup, pay extra attention to cases that go wrong and cause flare-ups, and make sure that you have mitigation plans at hand. 
The mitigation plans may range from something as unrelated to your business as having a good relationship with the local police (which can come in handy when a client is refusing to pay), to training your employees with at least two different skills, so that they can fill in for other roles under conditions that call for it. Also, fight these fires when they are still small. This is usually a matter of prioritisation. If something looks like it is about to be problematic, pay attention to it immediately and get it out of the way. The more you push doing that to a different day, the greater the probability of the fire being catastrophic.

#NomoreBagheeras: a movement to fight online sale of dogs and cats
"," Last month a 21-day-old Labrador puppy, endearingly named Bagheera, was bought on Quikr. He was born with a contagious, fatal viral disease, called canine distemper, usually caused due to vaccinations not given on time and unhygienic living conditions. Sadly, Bagheera died.
The petition
Puppy mills and backyard breeders are what the largely unregulated, untaxed pet industry ends up being. Breeding animals in horrible conditions, where they are taken away as newborn babies from their mothers, confined in cramped spaces, with barely any vaccinations or places to defecate, and without proper food, often leads to animals contracting or even being born with diseases.
As with most things, the Internet has added to the trade. Now, #NomoreBagheeras is a movement to fight this menace. About 20 groups from all over India — including Bombat Dawgz, CUPA (Bengaluru), Federation of Indian Animal Protection Organisations (FIAPO) (Delhi), VOSD, RESQ (Pune), The Pound (Chennai), Jhatkaa and Humane Society International — have joined hands and launched a petition (bit.ly/onlinepets) seeking the total ban of pets online. The petition was triggered by CJ Memorial Trust and front-ended by the members of Cubbon Park Canines, Bengaluru, a dog-lovers group founded by Priya Chetty-Rajagopal. The petition has been signed by more than 30,000 people.
A Facebook post by group member Anushree Thamanna, who fostered Bagheera, showing a poignant picture of a tired sleeping foster mom and a dying Bagheera, triggered the launch of the petition and signature drive.
The rules
The Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (Dog Breeding and Marketing) Rules, 2017, clearly states no public display of pets is allowed for ‘instant’ sale. It also lays down the rules for dog breeders to have a legal licence. No dog below the age of eight weeks can legally be sold. 
“Bagheera was just three weeks old when sold. He would search for his mother’s nipple because he was separated from her very early. Of course, we are very emotional, our hearts are bleeding, but our brains haven’t stopped functioning. We are talking about rules and regulations. The law discourages ‘public display of pets for instant sale’ because it prompts impulsive buying. There is also the question of anonymity. Breeders put up ads of selling dogs online, and once the dog is sold, they disappear, switch off their phone and change their numbers,” says Chetty-Rajagopal, who says that the sale of Bagheera, has transgressed the law.
Bagheera was meant to be a surprise birthday gift for a person. We don’t know if she/he was ready for the dog, but the ease of buying a ‘cute adorable puppy’ online, accelerates such sales. 
“There are very effective laws on paper, but are they being implemented and followed? The person the dog was gifted to didn’t know what to do, especially with a sick dog, and the breeder is untraceable. One breeder in Ejipura got a paralysed Alsatian and wondered if she could give birth, otherwise, he said, “she is of no use to me”.
Cyber canine combat cops
Following his death, the groups formed a cyber outfit: Cyber Canine Combat Cops, which started collecting data pertaining to ads of dogs and cats posted online. “Research shocked the team. Quikr itself had 791-odd pages of puppy listings for sale. Indiamart has hundreds of pedigree pups on ‘wholesale’.
 According to Chetty-Rajagopal, “Even though the Facebook policy is crystal clear against the sale of drugs, dogs and guns, there are Facebook groups selling dogs online. A Google doc was started for recording all transgressions. Even Instagram, Snapchat and YouTube were flaunting sales. One Instagram ad actually said dogs were ‘available as low as ₹999, so call us now!’”
The group began connecting with different online platforms. “We received canned responses saying the matter would be looked into. Nothing happened,” says Chetty-Rajagopal. In the meantime, the WhatsApp group brought together people from diverse backgrounds, and they began writing to companies that put out such ads and are now consulting with legal experts. 
“Marshalls Pet Zone stopped listing, as did Justdial, and FB removed dogs for sale from Marketplace but NOT on its groups. We really appreciate other online platforms for choosing not to sell beating hearts online,” says Chetty-Rajagopal. 
A parallel campaign is also on the cards to educate buyers about the perils of buying online.
Response from Quikr
We were recently made aware of dog breeding malpractices by a few petitioners and we thank them for bringing it to our attention. We are committed towards healthy community practices and are always looking to evolve and are working on doing the right things.
To begin with, we launched an email campaign under ‘Quikr Cares’ to educate our consumers about dog breeding and marketing rules, 2017. They were given about three weeks to produce necessary documentation with a request to delete the ads and we deleted them if they did not meet the criteria. We also spoke to about 600+ customers to educate them about these rules. While the awareness was low, 30% were willing to apply for the certification, a few said they have the licence, some others showed resistance stating these rules were being discussed with the ministry. We are also in touch with a couple of AWBI (Animal Welfare Board of India) members.
On the product side, some of the key rules of AWBI are prominently displayed for both sellers and buyers on our platform. Consumers cannot proceed to post an ad without an AWBI registration number and the certificate. We have deleted a few thousand ads and it’s a work in progress.

When Artificial Intelligence goes psycho ","No, it’s not a new horror film. It’s Norman: also known as the first psychopathic Artificial Intelligence, just unveiled by U.S. researchers.
The goal is to explain in layman’s terms how algorithms are made, and to make people aware of AI’s potential dangers.
Norman “represents a case study on the dangers of Artificial Intelligence gone wrong when biased data is used in machine learning algorithms,” according to the prestigious Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Pinar Yanardag, Manuel Cebrian and Iyad Rahwan, part of an MIT team, added: “There is a central idea in machine learning: the data you use to teach a machine learning algorithm can significantly influence its behaviour.” 
“So when we talk about AI algorithms being biased or unfair, the culprit is often not the algorithm itself, but the biased data that was fed to it,” they said via email.
Hence the idea of creating Norman, which was named after the psychopathic killer Norman Bates in the 1960 Alfred Hitchcock film Psycho.
Scary results
Norman was “fed” only with short legends describing images of “people dying” found on the Reddit internet platform. 
The researchers then submitted images of ink blots, as in the Rorschach psychological test, to determine what Norman was seeing and compare his answers to those of traditionally trained AI. The results are scary, to say the least: where traditional AI sees “two people standing close to each other,” Norman sees in the same spot of ink “a man who jumps out a window.” 
And when Norman distinguishes “a man shot to death by his screaming wife,” the other AI detects “a person holding an umbrella.”

Now, a spider silk based capsule to deliver vaccines
","Scientists have developed microcapsules made of spider silk that can deliver vaccines directly to the heart of immune cells.
To fight cancer, researchers increasingly use vaccines that stimulate the immune system to identify and destroy tumour cells. However, the desired immune response is is not always guaranteed. In order to strengthen the efficacy of vaccines on the immune system and in particular on T lymphocytes, specialised in the detection of cancer cells researchers developed this new spider silk microcapsules
This process, described in the journal Biomaterials, could also be applied to preventive vaccines to protect against infectious diseases, and constitutes an important step towards vaccines that are stable, easy to use, and resistant to the most extreme storage conditions.
The human immune system is largely based on two types of cells: B lymphocytes, which produce the antibodies needed to defend against various infections, and T lymphocytes. In the case of cancer and certain infectious diseases such as tuberculosis, T lymphocytes need to be stimulated.
However, their activation mechanism is more complex than that of B lymphocytes: to trigger a response, it is necessary to use a peptide, a small piece of protein which, if injected alone, is rapidly degraded by the body even before reaching its target.
“To develop immunotherapeutic drugs effective against cancer, it is essential to generate a significant response of T lymphocytes,” said Carole Bourquin, from the University of Geneva (UNIGE), who directed this work. “As the current vaccines have only limited action on T-cells, it is crucial to develop other vaccination procedures to overcome this issue.”
Scientists used synthetic spider silk biopolymers – a lightweight, biocompatible, non-toxic material that is highly resistant to degradation from light and heat.
“We recreated this special silk in the lab to insert a peptide with vaccine properties,” said Thomas Scheibel, from the University of Bayreuth in Germany and one of the authors of the study. “The resulting protein chains are then salted out to form injectable microparticles,” said Scheibel.
Silk microparticles form a transport capsule that protects the vaccine peptide from rapid degradation in the body, and delivers the peptide to the center of the lymph node cells, thereby considerably increasing T lymphocyte immune responses.
“Our study has proved the validity of our technique. We have demonstrated the effectiveness of a new vaccination strategy that is extremely stable, easy to manufacture and easily customizable,” said Bourquin.
The synthetic silk biopolymer particles demonstrate a high resistance to heat, withstanding over 100 degree Celsius for several hours without damage. In theory, this process would make it possible to develop vaccines that do not require adjuvants and cold chains. An undeniable advantage, especially in developing countries where one of the great difficulties is the preservation of vaccines.
One of the limitations of this process, however, is the size of the microparticles: while the concept is in principle applicable to any peptide, which are all small enough to be incorporated into silk proteins, further research is needed to see if it is also possible to incorporate the larger antigens used in standard vaccines, especially against viral diseases.

For China’s lonely children, ‘iPal’ robot is a companion ","It speaks two languages, gives math lessons, tells jokes and interacts with children through the tablet screen in its chest — China’s latest robot is the babysitter every parent needs. 
The “iPal” was among a slew of new tech unveiled at the Consumer Electronics Show Asia in Shanghai this week, offering education and company for lonely children and peace of mind for adults.
The humanoid device stands as tall as a five-year-old, moves and dances on wheels and its eyes keep track of its charges through facial recognition technology.
Parents can also remotely talk to and monitor the children through the iPal, which is linked to a smartphone app that allows them to see and hear everything. “The idea for this robot is to be a companion for children,” said Tingyu Huang, co-founder of AvatarMind Robot Technology. “When a child sees it, he or she will think of the robot as a friend, as another child in the family.”
The price tag of 9,000 yuan ($1,400) has not dampened interest from buyers watching a performance of several iPals dancing in unison. “They’re pretty cute. I was just thinking my own two-year-old daughter would love one,” Mike Stone, a buyer from Australia said.
China’s young working parents often face the burden of taking care of children or elders without help from a large extended family, as the impact of the country’s decades-long one-child policy lingers. 
The limit was raised to two children in 2016.

The company told Reuters it was aiming to protect all customers, especially in countries where phones are readily obtained by police or by criminals with extensive resources, and to head off further spread of the attack technique.
The privacy standard-bearer of the tech industry said it will change default settings in the iPhone operating system to cut off communication through the USB port when the phone has not been unlocked in the past hour.
That port is how machines made by forensic companies GrayShift, Cellebrite and others connect and get around the security provisions that limit how many password guesses can be made before the device freezes them out or erases data. Now they will be unable to run code on the devices after the hour is up.
These companies have marketed their machines to law enforcement in multiple countries this year, offering the machines themselves for thousands of dollars but also per-phone pricing as low as $50.
Apple representatives said the change in settings will protect customers in countries where law enforcement seizes and tries to crack phones with fewer legal restrictions than under U.S. law. They also noted that criminals, spies and unscrupulous people often use the same techniques. Even some of the methods most prized by intelligence agencies have been leaked on the internet.
Were constantly strengthening the security protections in every Apple product to help customers defend against hackers, identity thieves and intrusions into their personal data, Apple said in a prepared statement. We have the greatest respect for law enforcement, and we dont design our security improvements to frustrate their efforts to do their jobs.”
Apple began working on the USB issue before learning it was a favorite of law enforcement.
The setting switch had been documented in beta versions of iOS 11.4.1 and iOS12, and Apple told Reuters it will be made permanent in a forthcoming general release.
Apple said that after it learned of the techniques, it reviewed the iPhone operating system code and improved security. It decided to simply alter the setting, a cruder way of preventing most of the potential access by unfriendly parties.
With the changes, police or hackers will typically have an hour or less to get a phone to a cracking machine. That could cut access by as much as 90 percent, security researchers estimated.
This also could spur sales of cracking devices, as law enforcement looks to get more forensic machines closer to where seizures occur. Undoubtedly, researchers and police vendors will find new ways to break into phones, and Apple will then look to patch those vulnerabilities.
The setting change could also draw criticism from U.S. law enforcement officials who have been engaged in an on-again, off-again campaign for legislation or other ways to force technology companies to maintain access to users communications.
Apple has been the most prominent opponent of those demands. In 2016, it went to court to fight an order that it break into an iPhone 5c used by a killer in San Bernardino.
Then-FBI Director James Comey told Congress that without compelling Apple to write new software to facilitate the digital break-in, there would be no way to learn if the shooters device contained evidence of a conspiracy. The FBI ultimately found a contractor that broke into the phone without Apple's cooperation.
Apple and most private security experts argue that government contractors and others can usually find means of cracking devices. They also say that weakening encryption by design would lead to more hacking by those outside of government.
Until recently, current FBI Director Christopher Wray repeatedly claimed that the Bureau had been unable to get into more than 7,000 phones in 2017. Last month, the Washington Post reported that the true number was less than a third as high. The FBI blamed “programming errors.”

Folly of fake forwards
"," Fake forwards that are circulated every morning and shared a thousand times without any supporting facts or evidence is not a new practice in India. The Nipah Virus Havoc, Air India Free tickets scam and a lot more have been flashing on millions of phones. But what comes as a surprise is the increasing number of killings, mob deaths and lynching cases due to these forwards.
With over 200 million active users in India, exchanging messages every day on India’s popular messaging application, WhatsApp, it becomes difficult to pull out the source of these forwards. End to end encryption on the application makes it all the more difficult as no third party, including the company itself, has access to messages shared between two numbers. 
Long messages in English, Hindi and various regional languages are being circulated over WhatsApp in most of south India, including the states of Telangana, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Karnataka. During the last week of May, a man was abused by a mob over a WhatsApp forward where he was accused of being part of the ‘deadly Pardhi gang’.
Another message accompanied by a reportedly fake video of child abductors has been doing rounds that has cost lives all across the country. It started with two lynching cases in less than 24 hours in Jharkhand in 2017, and following cases of a supermarket clerk, an old woman, a 26-year-old youth, a transgender woman and two Assamese youth were beaten, thrashed or abused to death for being mistaken as child abductors from the fake videos, with no concrete proof during late May this year. 
Voice of youth
“The whole scenario is devastating and saddens me,” says Sanchita, who is pursuing Mass Communication in Bangalore. Sanchita Singh, the 19-year-old student believes that she, as a part of the young generation, understands how the internet works and how everything shared is not authentic, and simply ignores any forwards that involve accusations. 
“I think it’s important to cross check the information we share over any medium and mention a proper source to it. If people start taking law in their own hands over a few videos or messages shared that have no basis of authenticity, measures beyond ignorance have to be taken to cross verify and inform if the information is actually true”, she adds.
Anisha Rajasekar, a journalism student from Chennai has been added to a WhatsApp news group by her family members as they think it will help in her education. “I receive a lot of these forwards on the group, if I know that the news shared is fake or baseless, I make it a point to inform the person who has shared the message that it might be faux and request them to not forward it any further.” 
S Divya, who’s pursuing Bcom, puts forth a point about how the pictures and videos that are accompanied with these massages trigger people’s emotions. “Even people who are illiterate and cannot read might be triggered by the gore visuals that are presented on these fake videos, resulting in a larger audience being misled,” she adds.
“It’s the baby boomers who are easy trap for such news,” says Raghav Bherwani, a 19-year-old law student. It is the responsibility of youngsters to inform the older generation about how everything on the internet is not true, how these men might not actually be child abductors, how one doesn’t have to stop eating fruits because of Nipah virus and more, says Raghav.
“The public needs to let the legal system do its job and not motivate vigilante sayings like ‘if you want to see justice, you have to do it yourself’ because maybe a person is still innocent until proven guilty by a competent court,” he adds.

Govt. to set up fifth national data centre ","The Centre will set up the country’s biggest data centre in Bhopal with a capacity to host five lakh virtual servers, Electronics and IT Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said on Monday.
The data centre, which will take about two years to come up, will be set up by the National Informatics Centre (NIC), under the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY).
This will be the fifth National Data Centre after the ones at Bhubaneswar, Delhi, Hyderabad and Pune. These National Data Centres host government websites, services and applications. 
“India’s digital ecosystem has got a momentum of its own and this process is going to be irreversible. As far as data privacy is concerned, we have always said that data must be protected, and India should become a good centre of data analysis,” the Minister said.
Replying to a query on data mining by firms in the context of the general elections in 2019, Mr. Prasad said, “Any attempt to influence India’s elections in a covert or overt manner by abuse of data will not be tolerated. People can campaign on social networking sites, but misuse and abuse of data is not acceptable.”
He added that the government planned to expand its BPO promotion scheme to one lakh seats from the “current 48,000 seats.” 
Under the initiative, which had an outlay of ₹493 crore, 91 BPOs had been set up in small towns and rural areas till now.
‘121 cr. Aadhaar issued’
On Aadhaar, the Minister said that while only 61 crore Aadhaar numbers had been generated up to 2014. The numbers had jumped to more than 121 crore as on June 16, 2018. “The difference between Narendra Modi Government’s Aadhaar and that of Manmohan Singh... the old Aadhaar was Niradhar [without basis]...there was no legislative support to that platform. Today, Aadhaar has a robust parliamentary law,” Mr. Prasad said.
Asked about the government’s action plan in case the Supreme Court’s decision was not in favour of Aadhaar, the Minister said, “The question is hypothetical... the judgment [in the case] is reserved but I believe our Aadhaar team lawyers have argued it with proof, and Aadhaar has already established its benefits for the public.”
He further added that as many as 59.15 crore Indians had linked 87.79 crore bank accounts with Aadhaar.

Apple iOS 12 to share location of emergency calls in the US
"," Apple is using technology from RapidSOS, a New York startup, and is updating the iPhone’s next operating system to automatically deliver quicker and more reliable information by pinpointing the location of 911 calls to about 6,300 emergency response centres in the U.S. 
An estimated 80% of roughly 240 million emergency calls in the U.S. this year will come from mobile phones which are mostly capable of precisely tracking where their users are. Most emergency centres, however, are unable to get detailed location information from 911 calls and must use other methods which can be unreliable and inaccurate. Emergency responders are sometimes dispatched a mile or more away from a caller’s location.
The planned changes were on announced Monday during a 911 convention in Tennessee. They’ll be part of iOS 12 which the company will release in September as a free update. 
That can take up precious time and often isn’t very accurate, especially when calls come from inside a building. . 
The approach developed by Apple and RapidSOS sends location data from an iPhone to a “clearinghouse” accessible to emergency calling centers. Only the 911 calling centers will be able to see the data during the call, and none of it can be used for non-emergency purposes, according to Apple.
Individual call centers will each have to embrace the technology required to communicate with the RapidSOS clearinghouse. Some centers already have the compatible software, according to Apple, but others will have to install upgrades to their existing software.
Apple expects calling centers for large metropolitan areas to upgrade more quickly than those in rural areas.
Tom Wheeler, a former chairman for the Federal Communications Commission, believes Apple’s new approach for locating 911 calls will set a new industry standard. “This is going to save a lot of lives,” said Wheeler, now a visiting professor at Harvard University. He said he hopes other phone makers will follow Apple’s lead.

Upstart: What we’ll do in the future "," In 1930, at a time of tremendous economic pessimism, the economist John Maynard Keynes wrote an essay filled with optimism. It was titled ‘Economic Possibilities for our Grandchildren’, and in this essay, Keynes envisioned what 2030 would be like. The main thrust of this essay was that any sort of economic recessions are temporary, and in the long term, such economic problems will be solved for good. To quote him exactly, “I draw the conclusion that, assuming no important wars and no important increase in population, the economic problem may be solved, or be at least within sight of solution, within a hundred years. This means that the economic problem is not, if we look into the future, the permanent problem of the human race.” But there have been a few important wars, as well as great increases in population, which is probably why we will miss the 2030 deadline that Keynes set, but his basic assertion still holds. Sooner or later, we will all be living in a society where people will have more time for leisure than time that is needed for various definitions of “work”. A lot of great science fiction, such as one of my all-time favourites, The Culture series by Iain M Banks, gives us insight into what such a future may look like. There is also a famous Richard M Stallman quote on how the idea of such a future is what motivated him to start the GNU Project. He said, “In the long run, making programs free is a step toward the post-scarcity world, where nobody will have to work very hard just to make a living. People will be free to devote themselves to activities that are fun, such as programming, after spending the necessary ten hours a week on required tasks such as legislation, family counselling, robot repair and asteroid prospecting. There will be no need to be able to make a living from programming.” But I see a set of startups, even from a purely Indian perspective, that gives us glimpses into parts of such futures, both in terms of what kind of work there might be, as well as what people might do for leisure.
When you have a lot of time to spare, you will travel a lot. The sort of travel that is different from ‘a Cook’s tour’ (a British idiom that refers to a brief and cursory look at a place, having its origins in the 19th Century packaged tours organised by Thomas Cook, the likes of which are still popular today) but is instead something that is more immersive and centred around fairly specific interests of the traveller. These interests may have to do with sports, music, art, or just about anything else. Pickyourtrail, Sportytrip, Eventraveler, are all startups that are doing this.
When you have a lot of time to spare, things that you had previously consigned to the category of ‘hobbies’ (such a quaint word already, no?) become all-consuming passions. These could range from playing certain sports, to playing musical instruments, heck, even something like quizzing. And when markets for what were earlier niche interests grow exponentially, you will see startups very quickly catering to those needs. In India today, I can see around half-a-dozen startups catering to any pastime of note. And it is only a matter of time before they become far more formidable than they are now.
Also, as we inch closer to a world of plenty, the value of curation increases many-fold. And that is probably a topic for a future column.

All the best game reveals from E3 2018
","This year's Electronic Entertainment Expo, known as E3, the biggest celebration of gaming in the world, and a place where all the newest games are revealed, saw a stunning slew of games released with strong female protagonists. It's great to see that finally gaming it's shedding off it's one dimensional protagonists to embrace more of diversity, letting users identify with who they want to be with their gaming avatars. As always this year was explosive as ever with some incredible games revealed. Here are the best of what was unveiled.
 
The Last of Us 2
Sealed with a kiss and punctuated with brutal violence. The Last of Us 2, sequel to the award winning game from Naughty Dog, warmed our hearts with a beautiful kiss between Ellie, the protagonist and her girlfriend. Like a red apple in a dying forest, the rest of the demo showed Ellie survive against a group of cultists in a return to the post apocalyptic world. There was no glimpse of Joel, Ellie's guardian from the first game.




Cyberpunk 2077
While the latest game from the studio that created Witcher 3 has been on the cards since 2013. This year we finally get a clear glimpse into the world of Cyberpunk 2077's world. You get to chose from a male or female character called V, and you drive, run and gun around a massive futuristic city that seems to combine all your favourite Cyberpunk fiction in one place. With it's retro-futuristic neon styling to it's bold visual language, Cyberpunk 2077 is undoubtedly different.




Ghost of Tsushima
From the makers of the famous Infamous series, comes a game that's a radical departure from their usual body of work, but somehow looks perfect. Set in the year 1274, during the mongol invasion of Tsushima island, the trailer gave us a glimpse of a lone samurai in a beautiful land. There was major Witcher 3 vibes, from the game world to the action. Which was very reactive, with some interesting platforming.




Fallout 76
The next game in the popular post apocalyptic series Fallout 76 is set just a few years after the underground vaults open. Letting you create and play as your own vault dweller to go out into the wasteland to rebuild society. Set in West Virginia, the game is an online game that can also be played offline as a single player experience. Though, with the lands teeming with all manner of beasties, it's best if you have a bunch of friends along.




Assassins Creed Odyssey
The latest Assassins Creed was unveiled, and it's set in Ancient Greece. During the conflict between Sparta and Athens, as well as the zenith of Greece's philosophical and scientific discoveries. You play a descendant of the famous Spartan Leonidas, of 300 fame, as you journey around a beautiful, recreated Greece, fighting on land, sea as well as in large scale battles. The best part is you can choose to play as a male or female protagonist. The game looks a lot like a reskin of Origins and set way before the story of the foundation of the order of Assassins. So perhaps Odyssey tells a completely different story from canon, we'll have to see.




The Division 2
Having it's share of ups and downs, the first Division game emerged victorious. Letting players play as elite agents tasked with taking over and protecting the peace after a virus hits New York. Now the action moves to Washington DC, taking the Massively Multiplayer Online Shooter into another theatre of war, telling a different story. By the looks of the gameplay, it seems to be less of an urban sprawl of the Big Apple, and more of a vegetated area, with lots of foliage. The game also features three new specialisations, so color us interested.




Gears of War 5
With a female lead, the next generation of Gears races ahead with the 5th instalment. An Xbox exclusive, you play as Kait, who is on a personal mission to seek answers to her dreams. While Gears of War 4 seems to be a setup for a new series of games, 5 seems to be quite intense. Our only worry is that it looks same old, same old. Hopefully, the game will go the way of God of War and reinvent itself.




Forza Horizon 4
The latest Forza Horizon 4 is one of the best games revealed at E3, if not the best racing game. Sporting some incredible graphics as cars race across realistic tracks, getting dust and dirt on them. The game is set in Great Britain and features a dynamic weather system as well as the onset of seasons. Each bringing it's own set of thrills and spills with it.




Wolfenstein Youngblood and Doom Eternal
In addition to the reveal of a new Wolfenstein game, featuring the twin daughters of B.J. Blazkowicz, ID Software also revealed Doom Eternal. Youngblood takes the fight to a whole new level, featuring not one, but two protagonists, with which you can co-op play. Doom Eternal gave us an glimpse of an hellscape before the Doom Marine steps in to the backdrop of a melted building. It's that modern take Hell on Earth we've all been waiting for.




Dying Light 2
With game design legend and master storyteller Chris Avellone attached to Dying Light 2. A game about parkour and some intense zombies gets a whole lot better as he showed us how the decision tree works. Where the way you save a water supply could positively or negatively affect the world. Not to mention, at night, the zombies get truly scary.




Rage 2
Id Software announced and gave us an in depth look at Rage 2, from Avalanche studios, the people who gave us the Just Cause games as well as Mad Max. Featuring a dusty post apocalyptic world filled with menacing mutants featuring some incredible first person shooter gameplay that was fast, brutal and filled with weird gadgets and wicked guns. Also shown was the vehicular action, as you take down enemy cars with an assortment of armaments from your armoured vehicle. Rage 2 is definitely the Mad Max game sequel we deserve, with a helpful serving of Doom thrown in.
Other Glimpses
In addition to in depth looks at these games, we also got announcement trailers of a new Elder Scrolls VI, exclusively for next generation consoles, as well as a new intellectual property from Bethesda called Starfield, which looks very sci-fi. EA verbally revealed a new Star Wars game called The Fallen Order. Nintendo revealed Mario Party as well as a new Super Smash Bros Ultimate. Sony revealed a game called Control from Remedy entertainment, featuring their usual time stopping mechanics. The samurai souls game is back with a Nioh 2 reveal. From software had two reveals, one in the form of Shadows die twice, which featured a ninja with a gruesome prosthetic arm, the other is an odd creepy VR game called Déraciné. Microsoft gave us a taste of Halo Infinite, teasing the return of Master Chief. We did see Just Cause 4 and way too much of Kingdom Hearts 3 and Rise of the Tomb Raider.

Ramana Gogula’s pursuit for a green future
"," There was no phase in Ramana Gogula’s life where he was doing only one thing at a time. The composer-entrepreneur was part of the founding team of Sybase, a cyber database firm even as he was composing music for films. His film stint spread over 25 projects, yet not many in the industry knew about his entrepreneurial ambitions. He may have distanced himself from films for a while (he last composed for Venkatadri Express), his goals have only gotten bigger. Besides his brain-child Earthen Glow that provides off-grid solar lighting to villages, he’s now also a Vice President, Clean Technology Innovation at Stanley Black & Decker, Inc and a venture partner at Anthill Ventures, roles that are helping build an energy-efficient future for the country.
The social entrepreneur is on a globe-trotting spree, scheduling meetings with global giants, grooming startups, attending top business summits in a bid to mainstream the use of clean technology. He says, “The world is now trying to make devices that use electricity more efficiently. I am trying to do my part in minimising the use of electricity and connecting the country with clean technology power sources and reduce carbon emissions.” His aim with Earthen Glow has been to ensure optimum utilisation of distributed solar, something that’s not centralised. “That’ll allow poor families some light, ensure education for children, helping them extend work hours.”
Technology shift
His role with Stanley Black and Decker is an extension of these interests; engaged in popularising the use of solar pumps over electric AC pumps. “Over 25 million pumps in the country that draw water out of the earth through borewells, irrigation consume almost one-fifth of the power generated in the country. There’s a tremendous burden on subsidies that the Government faces. Here we are building the next generation solar pump that uses brushless DC motor to pump water from the ground.”Also, the solar energy is diverted to provide off-grid lighting, cold storage, drip irrigation. 




The biggest challenge lies with the farming community. “It’s important to not intimidate them and educate them on the technology shift.” He realises the need for solutions to be cheaper and more accessible. “Sensitivity is crucial too,” Gogula points out. Direct interaction with people at the bottom of the pyramid has helped him understand the complexity of many issues. A tie-up with T-Hub now has him identifying startups who can make a difference to agriculture, clean technology and integrate innovations across the globe on one platform.
The response from startups has been promising, his mentoring/investing role with emerging companies have taught him important lessons. “Startups start with a problem, you identify a clear solution to it, build the technology and find people who pay for it. If not, the cycle repeats. I’ve learnt that startups need to learn very fast, the good ones complete that cycle quickly.”
Music plays on
 Music has always been a part of Ramana Gogula’s life, though he misses composing for films. “My focus is on finding a solution for a larger population of the country now. In a year or two, I might get back to making films and compose music too. I am currently working on my second album, it’s coming after a gap of 15 years.”
For now, he enjoys listening to the various kinds of music, plays the guitar and teaches his daughter too. “If I didn’t play music, I wouldn’t be as creative as I am. I still sing, play music, it’s more for myself than public consumption. I am very grateful for a few films in which I have been able to articulate my talent. When the time is right, I’ll go back and let people know, I’m ready. Look at Robert De Niro’s drive at 74. I see myself being like that.”

Google to train 8,000 Indian journalists on fact checking
"," To guard journalists from falling prey to false news stories, Google India on Tuesday said it will provide training to 8,000 journalists in English and six other Indian languages in the next one year.
For this, the Google News Initiative India Training Network will select 200 journalists from cities across India who will hone their skills in verification and training during five-day train-the-trainer boot camps that will be organised for English and six other Indian languages.
This network of certified trainers will then train more journalists at two-day, one-day and half-day workshops organised by the Network. 
Training workshops will be conducted in English, Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, Bengali, Marathi and Kannada in cities across India, Google India said in a statement. 
The focus of the training will be fact-checking, online verification and digital hygiene for journalists, using a curriculum built by experts from First Draft, Storyful, AltNews, BoomLive, Factchecker.in and DataLeads.
“Supporting trusted, authoritative media sources is a top priority for Google, which is why we are proud to collaborate with Internews, DataLeads and BoomLive to support journalists in their fight against misinformation in India,” said Irene Jay Liu, Google News Lab Lead, Asia-Pacific.
“Our goal is to train more than 200 trainers, who will then train 8,000 journalists in six languages over the next year, making this Google’s largest training network in the world,” Liu added.

Instagram launches mobile app for long videos "," 
Facebook Inc-owned social network Instagram launched a mobile app on Wednesday dedicated to user-generated videos that can go up to an hour, thereby intensifying the competition for consumers' time among ad-supported streaming services such as YouTube.
Called IGTV in a nod to traditional television, the service plans to feature videos from rising internet celebrities, artists and pets, some of whom have tens of millions of social media followers.
“Teens are now watching 40% less TV than they did five years ago,” Instagram Chief Executive Kevin Systrom said at an event to announce the launch in San Francisco. “It's time for video to move forward and evolve.”
Facebook shares rose 2.3 % on Wednesday to $202.06 after earlier crossing the $200 mark for the first time.
Instagram, which was founded in 2010 as a photo-sharing app, has surpassed 1 billion users, Systrom said.
Tech firms such as Facebook, Alphabet Inc's YouTube and Snap Inc's Snapchat have been spending heavily to grow mobile video services that will attract both users and corporate brand advertising.
Courting stars to post videos is part of their strategies. Instagram said it has signed up personalities such as Lele Pons, who has 25 million Instagram followers, for IGTV.
Pons said she did not plan to choose sides between two of Silicon Valley's largest companies. “I'm still going to be posting on YouTube as well as on Instagram,” she told reporters.
Facebook on Tuesday launched a separate effort to lure video makers away from YouTube, offering ways to make money on the Facebook app. YouTube said it plans to update its commercialization options this week.
Instagram does not immediately plan to share revenue with video creators but may in the future, Systrom said.
IGTV will be available as part of Instagram's app and as a separate app, he said.
The service does not have advertising at launch, but research firm eMarketer said it expects it will have ads eventually, and that marketers in the meantime will sign up stars for endorsement deals.
As social media “influencers” have gained popularity, “I only wonder why it took Instagram so long to roll this out,” eMarketer analyst Debra Aho Williamson said.
Instagram, which Facebook bought in 2012 for $1 billion, has grown by adding features like messaging and short videos. In 2016, it added the ability to post slideshows that disappear in 24 hours, a copy of Snapchat's popular “stories” feature.

U.S. stepping up the earth’s protection from asteroids
","The U.S. government is stepping up efforts to protect the planet from incoming asteroids that could wipe out entire regions or even continents. 
The National Science and Technology Council recently released a report calling for improved asteroid detection, tracking and deflection. NASA is participating, along with federal emergency, military, White House and other officials. 
NASA’s planetary defence officer, Lindley Johnson, said scientists have found 95% of all these near-Earth objects measuring one kilometre or bigger. But the hunt is still on for the remaining 5% and smaller rocks that could still inflict big damage. 
Altogether, NASA has catalogued 18,310 objects of all sizes. 
There’s no quick solution if a space rock is suddenly days, weeks or even months from striking, according to Mr. Johnson.
Emergency planning
But such short notice would give the world time, at least, to evacuate the area it might hit, he said. 
Ground telescopes are good at picking up asteroids zooming into the inner solar system and approaching from the night side of the earth, Mr. Johnson said. What’s difficult to detect are rocks that have already zipped past the sun and are heading out of the solar system, approaching from the day side. 
That’s apparently what happened in 2013 when an asteroid about 66 feet in size suddenly appeared and exploded over Chelyabinsk, Russia, damaging thousands of buildings and causing widespread injuries.

India to teach satellite tech to students from abroad
"," India has thrown open its satellite-building expertise to engineering graduates chosen from other countries.
Starting this year, and for three years, a total of 90 qualifying engineers from various countries will be taught to build and test three small satellites each year. They will be hosted in Bengaluru for two months each year and work in three annual batches of 30.
India is also ready to launch the small satellites built during the programme if they are good, Chairman of the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), K. Sivan, and other ISRO officials announced at an event in Vienna, where the global space community is meeting from June 18 to 21. 
Indian start-ups and participants at the meeting shared the details of the training proposal, called the Indo-UN Small Satellites Programme (UNSSP). 
The countries are marking the 50th year of the first UN Conference on the Exploration and Peaceful Uses of Outer Space — called UNISPACE+50. Three such conferences held earlier recognised the potential of space and laid the guidelines for human activities and international cooperation related to outer space.
ISRO’s Bengaluru-based U.R. Rao Satellite Centre (URSC) — until recently known as ISAC — will train the overseas students in November and December this year through 2020, according to URSC Director M. Annadurai. In the last 40-odd years, URSC has rolled over 100 Indian satellites for various purposes out of its facilities. 
Dr. Sivan said the capacity-building programme was India’s contribution to the world in response to a request that the UN Office for Outer Space Affairs had made to space-faring nations last year.

Plink: the sound of falling drops decoded
","Scientists have finally cracked the “dripping tap” enigma and know exactly how the sound is generated.
“Until now, everyone thought these sound waves just passed through the water surface and that’s how we heard the sound, much like if you hear someone speaking through a wall,” said Samuel Phillips, an undergraduate student at the University of Cambridge and lead author of a study in Scientific Reports.
The idea to probe further came to Mr. Phillips’ professor, Anurag Agarwal, while he was visiting a friend who had a small leak in the roof of his house. “I was being kept awake by the sound of water falling in a bucket,” he recalled. “The next day I discussed it with my friend and another visiting academic and we were all surprised that no one had actually answered the question of what causes the sound.”
To find out, the researchers set up an experiment making full use of cutting-edge video and audio recording technology. Using ultra-slow-motion video, a microphone and a hydrophone, they were able to perceive details that had previously gone unnoticed.
The trapped air bubble, it turned out, began to vibrate as the cavity deepened. “Sound waves emitted by the vibrating air bubble don’t simply pass through the water surface into the air, as previously thought,” Mr. Phillips explained. “Rather, the oscillating bubble causes the water surface itself to vibrate at the bottom of the cavity, acting like a piston to drive sound waves into the air.” 
No bubble, no ‘plink’ 
Not only did the researched crack the enigma, they also found a way to neutralise the “plink” for those leaky-roof rainy days.
Adding a little dish-soap will do the trick, they said. “It changes the surface tension of the water, and so prevents the bubble from being trapped under the water,” Phillips said. “No bubble means no sound, hence no ‘plink’!”
In 1908, Arthur Mason Worthington published a treatise, A Study of Splashes, featuring the first known photograph in a scientific journal of a drop as it punctures a body of water’s still surface. The image shows the formation of a cavity on the water’s surface upon impact, followed by a narrow column of water rising as the cavity recoils. But if the fluid mechanics of drops-in-liquid have been understood for a century, the signature noise they make remained harder to grasp.
Around 1920, a team of researchers in England decided that resonance inside the tiny water cavity was the likely mechanism behind the sound. A decade later, another group discovered that a minimum height was required to generate a “plink.” Finally, in 1955, scientists noticed the formation of a bubble of air briefly trapped beneath the cavity as it took shape, speculating that when it burst sound waves rose to the surface and escaped into the air.
Over the following decades, dozens of published experiments with increasingly precise instruments backed up this idea.

Using multiple sclerosis drug to treat pancreatic cancer "," An FDA-approved drug currently used for treating multiple sclerosis has been found to be effective for pancreatic cancer. Researchers from Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology (RGCB), Thiruvananthapuram, in collaboration with Regional Cancer Centre in the city and NIMHANS, Bengaluru, found that the drug was also able to increase the efficacy of gemcitabine, the current standard drug for pancreatic cancer. The results of the study have been recently published in Theranostics.
The drug used to treat multiple sclerosis was found to act through a receptor called S1PR1 that is involved in lipid signalling and which regulates numerous cellular events such as cell growth, migration and vascular integrity.
“The precise role of the receptor in pancreatic cancer is still not clear and our study has brought out its importance. We found that the [multiple] sclerosis drug can bind to the receptor and alter the key cellular events and prevent the progression of pancreatic cancer,” explains Dr. K.B. Harikumar, from the Cancer Research Program at RGCB and corresponding author of the paper. The sclerosis drug was also found to be a potent inhibitor of NF-kappaB, a transcription factor that helps in tumour progression.
The effectiveness of the multiple sclerosis drug when used together with the current pancreatic cancer drug was checked in mice models. The combination drug treatment was able to control various signalling molecules, thereby decreasing cancer cell proliferation and increasing apoptosis. It also helped produce higher levels of reactive oxygen species and inhibited the migration of the cancer cells. They also studied the genes involved in inflammation and immunity in pancreatic cancer and found that the combination drug regime activated a tumour-suppressor gene and downregulated another that is involved in drug resistance and decreased immunity.
Better clinical outcome
The team also addressed one of the major problems in pancreatic cancer known as desmoplasia, which is the presence of a rich collagen deposition around tumour. Collagen deposition leads to poor clinical outcome due to decreased delivery of the drug to tumor. “In fact, gemcitabine itself leads to desmoplasia thereby reducing its own effect. We found that the combination drug therapy reduced desmoplasia. The [multiple] sclerosis drug loosens up the tumour and aids gemcitabine to penetrate into the tumour thereby increasing the bioavailability of the cancer drug,” adds Dr. Harikumar.
The combination strategy showed no toxicity to the normal human and mouse cell lines thereby pointing towards the promising possibility of using this for the treatment of pancreatic cancer.
“Repurposing existing drugs cuts down the time taken to bring drugs to clinical testing. Moreover, using combination drugs can reduce the dosage of the drugs thus reducing side-effects,” explains Manendra Babu Lankadasari, PhD scholar at the Centre and first author of the study in an email to The Hindu.

How insects evolve immune-memory against bacterial infections
"," Much like humans, insects too develop an immune-memory in response to infection, a team at the National Centre for Biological Sciences (NCBS), Bengaluru has found. In humans, for instance, natural infection or vaccination can lead to the formation of important immunological memory in the human immune system. In other words, once infected, the immune system becomes ready to deal with that particular antigen because of immune-memory. For long, it has been a point of debate whether insects have such a memory that can protect them against future infections. The present study shows that such a memory can evolve over generations in red flour beetles (Tribolium castaneum) infected with Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt). The results of the study were recently published in Proceedings of the Royal Society B.
The study was conducted in Deepa Agashe’s lab at NCBS and the experiment was designed by Imroze Khan, first author of the paper, and Dr. Agashe, the principal investigator. The team infected nearly 5,000 to 6,000 beetles in every generation. “Every insect had to be pierced at the right point and injected with a standard number of bacterial cells. It took a year to standardise this process,” says Dr. Khan, who is now a faculty at Ashoka University, Delhi. With a generation being approximately 45 days long, the study of 10 generations stretched over two years. “Every day Arun Prakash [one of the authors] and I had to infect 1,000 insects,” he adds when asked what was the most challenging part of the study. The beetle populations were exposed to a single large dose of live Bt antigens or exposed to dead bacteria followed by live infection. 
Evolved immunity
After observing ten generations, the team found that the new generation of insects had evolved better defence against Bt antigen. The emerging populations showed either improved innate resistance or immune-memory, as opposed to control populations which were injected with a buffer solution and did not evolve any special ability to deal with the pathogen.
“This is the first real-time observation of the evolution of immune-memory in an insect; we showed that this can happen very quickly, and quite often,” says Dr Agashe, in an email to The Hindu. “If our results hold true for other insects (which remains to be tested), this suggests that immune-memory can be a very broad system of defence against pathogens,” she adds. Since insects do not have the kind of immune cells that humans have, for a long time, scientists did not think it was even possible for insects to develop an immune-memory.
 In the past few years, multiple studies showed that insects do show some form of immune-memory, but how such memory evolves remained a puzzle. “We now have some clues about how fast and how reliably memory could evolve, what might be the mechanisms involved and when might immune-memory versus resistance be favoured by natural selection,” says Dr Agashe.
Together, Dr. Khan and Dr. Agashe’s labs are now trying to figure out the molecules responsible for immune-memory and resistance.

IISc researchers find asthma drug effective in treating TB "," A drug (Pranlukast) currently used for treating asthma has been found to be effective against tuberculosis, researchers from the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bengaluru, have found. Studies carried out in mice models found the drug to be effective in treating TB both when used alone and in combination with an anti-TB drug rifampicin. The results of the study have been published in EMBO Molecular Medicine.
Besides speeding up the process of drug discovery by repurposing an existing drug, the highlight of the study is the new approach adopted by researchers led by Prof. Avadhesha Surolia from the Molecular Biophysics Unit at IISc to zero in on the asthma drug. The drug uses a unique strategy to target the TB bacteria and is therefore quite unlikely to cause any adverse side-effects either to the human cells or the beneficial bacteria found in humans. 
Most of the current anti-TB drugs target either the RNA synthesis (transcription) or cell-wall synthesis of the bacteria. “But we decided to look for drugs that target the arginine (an amino acid) biosynthesis pathway that is essential for the survival of the TB bacteria as well the pathogenesis [process by which the bacteria cause the disease],” says Prof. Surolia.
Many steps make up the arginine biosynthesis pathway and one of them involves an enzyme ArgJ (Ornithine acetyltransferase) which is essential for the survival and virulence of TB bacteria. The ArgJ enzyme is unique to TB bacteria and its counterpart neither exists in humans nor in the beneficial bacteria of human microbiome. This makes the ArgJ an exciting target for drug development and is very unlikely to cause any harmful side-effects in the human host.
To further reduce the chances of the chosen drug causing any side-effects, the researchers decided to target a unique site on the ArgJ enzyme that is not found in other proteins described so far. “If you target the active site in the enzyme, there is a possibility that the drug will target the same site in other biochemical reactions in the body,” explains Prof. Surolia.
Based on these conditions, the researchers carried out in silico computational modelling of all FDA-approved drugs that bind to the site. After screening 1,400 drugs, 34 were found to be binding to the site. “Of the 34, we tested 15 drugs for their ability to bind to the enzyme site, and two drugs — Pranlukast (anti-asthma drug) and Sorafenib (anti-cancer drug) — were found to have inhibitory action,” he says.
Effective drug
Both these drugs were tested in vitro and were found to be effective in curtailing the growth of TB bacteria. “The asthma drug was found to be more effective in curtailing the growth when used alone and in combination with other anti-TB drugs — rifampicin and isoniazid,” says Archita Mishra from IISc and first author of the paper. “The combination of asthma drug and the two anti-TB drugs was significantly better in killing the bacteria than the currently used first-line combination drugs — rifampicin, isoniazid and ethambutol.”
“Like the asthma drug, ethambutol is also a metabolic inhibitor. So replacing ethambutol with the asthma drug for the combination therapy would be a viable strategy,” Mishra adds.
Both the drugs were also able to kill the bacteria found inside the macrophages (white blood cells) without causing any harmful side-effects to the macrophages. 
The potency of the asthma drug was much higher than expected. This would mean that lesser amount of the drug will be sufficient to kill the bacteria within the macrophages. The higher potency comes from the drug’s ability to counter the survival strategy of the TB bacteria. When bacteria infect the macrophages, they usually cause inflammation within the cells, which helps the bacteria multiply. The asthma drug was able to prevent the bacteria from causing inflammation thereby proving to be more potent in killing them.
“Since the drug targets the pathogen as well as the host pathway, it could potentially help in treating multidrug-resistant TB bacteria,” says Mishra. The researchers are already working in that direction. 
Animal trials
Even in mice models, the drug was more effective in killing the TB bacteria both when used alone and in combination with rifampicin. There were fewer granulomas in the drug-treated mice. “Our studies show that ethambutol can be replaced with the asthma drug,” he says. 
The researchers plan to test the drug on guinea pigs in a few months’ time. The efficacy will be tested by using it alone and in combination with rifampicin. “If we get encouraging results from guinea pig studies, we can straight away conduct Phase II trials in humans, as the safety of the drug is already proven,” says Prof. Surolia.

What the well-gadgeted man is wearing
"," Fans of P. G. Wodehouse will remember how the hero Bertie Wooster was persuaded by his aunt Dahlia to write a piece on ‘what the well dressed man is wearing’ for her weekly magazine “Milady’s Boudoir”. That was in the 1920s and the days of gentlemen of leisure. A century later, these are the days of gentlemen (and ladies) on the go. And the biweekly magazine “Science News” has published an article called: “Fashion forward: Advanced textiles may add serious gadgetry to clothes”, authored by Maria Temming and Mariah Quantanilla, in its May 25, 2018 issue.
The two authors, Maria and Mariah, write about how future ‘smart’ clothes could pack ‘serious’ gadgetry, and give a few examples presented by several developers and innovators at some recent technological meetings in the US. Here are some excerpts from this article.
Clothes that change colour
 About sixty or seventy years ago, one could buy a shirt made of a cloth teasingly called ‘Bleeding Madras’. It would change colour upon each wash (and fade!). The one discussed here changes colour not upon washing, but reversibly upon exposure to light (such as sunlight or on stage), when the wearer taps his/her smartphone screen. How does this happen? The fabric is made of thin yarn containing some thinner strands of copper wire sheathed in polyester (or nylon). This polyester fibre is coated with pigments just as normal clothes are. A garment is made of this pigmented cloth, and the garment also carries a tiny battery. The wearer sends a wi-fi signal from his/her smartphone, which activates the battery to heat the copper wire in the yarn. With that signal, the colour changes and the wearer now shows off the new colour (or stripe or pattern – whatever has been built in) on his/her garment! Developed by Dr. Joshua Kaufman and Dr. Ayman Abouraddy of the University of Central Florida at Orlando, FL, USA, this fabric and the clothes, bags or upholstery will hit the market soon.
 Traditional women in Gujarat and Rajasthan wear long skirts called lehangas or ghararas using fabrics which are studded with small discs made of glass mirror pieces. They shine when light falls on them. Well, now we have hi-tech versions that will be available soon; except, they will not have the traditional ‘inorganic’ mirror pieces but light emitting diodes or LEDs. And these LEDs too will be ‘organic’ in nature, or what the authors have called as OLEDs. These OLEDs are created on cloth- polyester- and are thus far more flexible than the conventional ‘inorganic’ LEDs. Developed by Dr. S. Kwon and associates at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology in Daejon, South Korea, these OLEDs, when activated using electric signals generated using smartphone signals, can light up the fabric. They can thus be organised in the fabric to display patterns and messages, or just light up the street to help pedestrians at night. 
After a brisk run, you feel hot — the active motion generating thermal energy. Likewise, as you stand for a while in bright sunlight, you feel warm. Rather than lose energy through heat this way, can we convert heat or body motion into electricity? This was the question that Dr. Jun Chen and Dr. Zhong Lin Wang of Stanford and Georgia Tech Universities attempted to work on. To this end, they threaded a fabric with photovoltaic wires which, when sunlight falls on them, generate tiny amounts of electricity just the way traditional solar cells do. And this energy can be stored safely in a small battery attached to the garment. Dr. Chen is reported to have said that a 4 cm x 5 cm piece of such a solar cell fabric stitched on to your T-shirt as you run in the sun can charge up your cellphone. Imagine wearing a whole shirt or a jacket made of such a fabric. 
Dr. Chen has also devised a fabric made of a special type of polymer (called PTFE) which captures energy coming out of motion (movement of the body) and converts it into electrical energy. Maria and Mariah write: “this energy-harvesting material could also be built into tents that, when bathed in sun or rustled by wind, could charge campers’ devices”. The article by these two ladies, titled: “Future smart clothes could pack serious gadgetry”, is available free on the net, and is recommended. It covers a few more such studies which focus on capturing energy from the environment through the use of devices of this kind, and converting it into storable and usable electric energy. 
Light cell phone
Some people have done away with carrying bulky cell phones; instead, they go for wrist-wearable ones and earplugs. Many others no longer carry a laptop; smart phones do the job for them. (The Nobelist Prof. Martin Chalfie gave three different lectures recently in Hyderabad, with all lecture materials- slides and movies- saved in his smartphone, no laptop). Wearing gadgets (even computers) will become increasingly popular and convenient. Since these can now be charged using stuff in your clothes, look out for what Generation Z is wearing next year.

Novel packaging extends shelf-life of chicken
"," Now, chicken kept in the chiller of the fridge may remain fresh and without any bacterial contamination for up to two weeks thanks to researchers from Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC), Mumbai. The researchers have developed a new eco-friendly food-packaging material using mango peel extracts and three other biodegradable polymers to extend the shelf-life of chicken. The packaging film showed good antimicrobial properties against common food microbes and also exhibited high antioxidant characteristics.
Peels from four different mango varieties were used for the study — Alphonso, Kesar, Langra and Badami. The peel content was extracted using different techniques and the bioactive properties, antioxidant and antimicrobial activity of the extracts were studied.
Amongst the four mango peel varieties studied, the Langra variety extract exhibited the highest inhibition against Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas fluorescens. It was also rich in bioactive compounds like phenolics and carotenoids and thus had high degree of antioxidant capacity.
The packaging films were then made using the Langra extract (5%), polyvinyl alcohol, gelatin and cyclodextrin. “All the ingredients are biodegradable, and the new film can be a viable option for developing new eco-friendly packaging material. Also, India is one of the highest producers of mango, and the peel, which is usually thrown away, has higher phenolic content than the pulp and can serve as a good antioxidant,” explains Dr. Sweetie R. Kanatt, Senior Scientific Officer from the Food Technology Division of the Centre and first author of the paper published in Journal of Food Safety.
The packaging film was 150 microns in thickness and exhibited good tensile and puncture strength. The package was then tested for storing minced chicken meat.
The meat was stored at 2–4˚C and tested every three days. The meat packed using the mango peel film was able to keep the meat fresh and without spoilage for up to 12 days whereas the ones packed in normal polythene bag got spoilt within three days. 
“Meat has high lipid content that is prone to oxidation on storage/processing. We wanted to check how the film preserved the meat from both microbial spoilage and oxidative rancidity,” adds Dr. Kanatt. “Increase in shelf life as well as safety of the meat will be a boon to the food processer as they can store this meat in chilled rather than frozen state. Film preparation methods are being fine-tuned for possible commercial applications.”

River dolphins could be hunting prey using many methods
"," Asia's river dolphins may be nearly blind, but compensate by using many methods to catch prey. Though chiefly known as echolocators, researchers now suggest that these dolphins could also be listening for surface-swimming fish and sensing electrical signals emitted by bottom-dwelling prey on the river-bed.
Eyes are of no use for river dolphins (genus Platanista) in the naturally murky waters of the Indus and Ganga. Instead, they have evolved to use echolocation to navigate and catch fish: the small clicks they produce underwater echo back at them, helping them identify a prey or obstacle on their path. Despite increasing pressures on their habitat – from ships' underwater noise (which could affect dolphin echolocation) to dams that alter the river's flow – dolphins still survive in many heavily human-used river stretches.
Wondering if these aquatic mammals have other methods to catch prey and thereby survive, a team of researchers from institutes including Bengaluru's Asoka Trust for Ecology and Evolution (ATREE) first dug through 105 studies and historical references for information about dolphin anatomy and physiology as well as that of their prey (shrimp and fish). They also complemented this with the prey they found in dead dolphins' stomachs and acoustic information on the echolocation clicks Gangetic river dolphins use in varying depths of a 100-km stretch of the Ganga in Bihar.
The results show that dolphins choose their prey based on size; bottom-dwelling fish dominate their diets. Dolphins grasp their prey and potentially suck them into their mouths using their unusually large tongues. The study, published in Mammal Review, is the first to calculate the distance that these dolphins can detect a fish from: their echolocation enables them to 'see' a fish the size of your finger from 20 metres away.
There is also a clear difference in the ways dolphins catch fish at various river depths: at the surface they listen for fish movement; prefer echolocation at the middle depths (dolphins produced the most number of clicks here); and sensitive snout-whiskers, especially in calves and juveniles, could help sense weak electrical signals emitted by bottom-dwelling fish and shrimp. This could make Platanista dolphins one of the few mammal groups in the world that use this method, says ATREE's Nachiket Kelkar, lead author of the study.
Scientists did think that this 'electroreception' could be a possibility in other dolphin species too when an experimental aquarium study in 2013 found that Guiana dolphins (that dwell in the coastal waters off South America) can detect fish prey using electric perception through nerve fibres in their snout-whiskers.
“The use of these different feeding strategies together could perhaps also explain why we see Platanista dolphins even in some highly disturbed habitats,” adds Kelkar.
According to the authors, the research findings would be highly relevant for future studies on river dolphin ecology, feeding behaviour and assessments of their responses to human-induced threats.

Thanos : A technological ‘marvel’
"," Thanos may be popular as a Marvel character, but also translates into a ‘never ending spirit’ and is an ode to the Greek philosopher Athanasius. The Hyderabad-startup named after the Greek word was established when drones were mostly used by hobbyists, photographers and videographers. Pradeep Palelli, CEO of Thanos, wanted to be more constructive and use drones to solve problems in the society. It took a year’s research to see what could come out of it. Marking a drastic transformation in life of farmers with the usage of an aerial-pesticide spraying technology and eliminating many health hazards that could potentially cause partial blindness among agriculturists, Thanos is moving into the future.
“We talked to hundreds of farmers in the Telugu states. Many complained of the non-availability of labour to spray pesticides in the fields, mostly due to the migration of people to urban areas. Even with the limited labour base, there were delays, complaints of overdosage/ underdosage of pesticides. Ideally, the spraying needs to be done with a helmet and a protective suit, which may not suit our climate conditions. One is prone to health hazards too. That’s when we realised this is an area ready for automation,” Pradeep says.




The startup co-founded by Pradeep and Prathyush Akepati, has Harish Alladi in its technical team and is backed by IIIT and ICRISAT. The tie-up has earned Thanos considerable access to summits/showcases across the country and opened them to a wide investor and academician base. The concept interested politicians, farmers and investors from Srikakulam, East Godavari initially. The regulations pertaining to drones are being worked in different states —Telangana, Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh. Thanos has tied up with field partners across tier-2 and tier-3 towns, with tractor-owners, weeders to take the solution to the market. For now, Thanos is providing the spraying as a service-model to farmers, but more intelligence aspects are being worked on, including identification of specific areas that need pesticides. 
“Many progressive farmers have expressed interest to buy the drones. They have the financial capacity, but they need to know more to fulfil it to its maximum capacity. We hire it on a per acre basis now,” Pradeep mentions. 
Paradigm shift
How have the farmers reacted to the change? “We are in the process of educating them. Even in the surveying part, many used to wonder if it was a mini helicopter that was landing. The idea of drones is gradually becoming mainstream across the country.”


Thanos takes up a low volume spraying method, uses less chemicals and covers more areas with uniform spreading. The startup is exploring avenues beyond agriculture; they’ve had discussions with the R&D wing of the Indian Army, besides opportunities for greenfield mining. 
“We are customising drones for hobbyists and serious operators too, we are also capable of repairing drones that others have built. Some of the other drone applications in future could be its use in emergencies as a first responder, tracking e-waste, for property tax billing and even pollination of flowers. There might be traffic management issues with drones, but that’s a few years away.”

Incredulous and Incredibles
"," Creepy crawly aliens and derelict space stations are always a great combination for disaster. Add to that the fact that said aliens, the Typhon, can shapeshift into anything, and you have a jump scare fest on your hands. That was 2017’s Prey in a nutshell. Inspired by System Shock and BioShock, Prey did not really capture gamers as much as it should have. A year later, comes a new expansion, Mooncrash, which is a lot different than what you’re expecting.


What’s it about?
Trapped on a spy satellite is a hacker named Peter, whose job is to intercept communication messages from a super secret TranStar moonbase. Except after the events of Prey, he finds himself stuck, with the only hope of getting out lying within the moonbase itself. To uncover its secrets, he has to play through a simulation built off the experiences of five TranStar employees, to find out exactly what happened.
As a story, Mooncrash is meaty and filled with little narrative titbits. Arkane Studios have really fleshed out their world a lot more, making an expansion feel like a full-length game. You will actually enjoy this game a bit more than the original.
How does it play?
Mooncrash falls under a genre of gaming called ‘Roguelikes’. While it is still a first-person action game, a roguelike is typically a series of small levels that are generated on the fly. The objective is to play each level to unlock more of the characters. Each of which have their own abilities and playstyles. The more you do, the more of their stories come to light.
That’s not all. Each level has a timer, where you have to cut through several Typhon of various sizes and survive. Find ways to escape and find out what happened on the base before time runs out. When your character dies, reset the simulation and keep pushing on. This rinse, die, repeat gameplay is incredibly addictive.
Should you get it?
Mooncrash builds upon Prey in ways that will make you want to play the original game again. Breathing new life into the franchise, giving us a bit of hope for Prey 2. You should get it, if you especially like roguelikes.
Traveller’s Tales has carved quite a niche for themselves with the Lego games they keep releasing. From Avengers to Batman to Harry Potter to Star Wars, they’ve got that one formula and they squeeze the most out of it. While it’s showing its age at the moment, they still infuse their game with that signature zany Lego writing, and they’ve taken a stab at Pixar’s The Incredibles in their latest game.






What’s it about?
The Incredibles released more than a decade ago, and it was Pixar’s take on the Fantastic 4 super-family concept. With similar powers, the movie charmed their way into everyone’s hearts. Lego’s The Incredibles is two movies in one, letting you play through that original movie, as well as the sequel that’s in the theatres. With a little bit of masala thrown in for good measure. There are two big differences though — everyone and everything is made up of Lego blocks, and the story takes an even lighter take, edging into a simpler kind of funny. That makes a movie for kids, even more kid-friendly, making this game the perfect game to play with your kids.
How does it play?
 The gameplay is similar to every Lego game, with melee combat, and you get to switch family members to get past obstacles. You can collect Lego coins and build things. If you’ve played Lego Avengers, a lot of elements look almost similar. What it does have is a lot of fan service, with over a hundred playable characters. Undoubtedly, as with the movies themselves, Elastigirl is the star of the show.
Should you get it?
Right now, as you’re reading this, a young boy or girl is tugging their parents along to see Incredibles 2. Chances are, after watching the movie, they’re going to be bouncing off the walls in excitement. Making Lego’s The Incredibles a game you should own, if you want to spend some time with your kids in the world of the Parr super-family.

Neanderthals hunted in bands, speared prey up close: study ","Neanderthals were capable of sophisticated, collective hunting strategies, according to an analysis of prehistoric animal remains from Germany that contradicts the enduring image of these early humans as knuckle-dragging brutes.
The cut marks — or “hunting lesions” — on the bones of two 1,20,000-year-old deer provide the earliest “smoking gun” evidence such weapons were used to stalk and kill prey, according to a study the journal Nature Ecology and Evolution.
Microscopic imaging and ballistics experiments reproducing the impact of the blows confirmed that at least one was delivered with a wooden spear at low velocity. “This suggests that Neanderthals approached animals very closely and thrust, not threw, their spears at the animals, most likely from an underhand angle,” said Sabine Gaudzinski-Windheuser, a researcher at Johannes Gutenberg-University Mainz, Germany.
“Such a confrontational way of hunting required careful planning and concealment, and close cooperation between individual hunters,” she said.
Neanderthals lived in Europe from about 300,000 years ago until they died out 30,000 years ago, overtaken by our species.
It was long thought that these evolutionary cousins — modern Europeans and Asians have about 2% of Neanderthal DNA — were not smart enough to compete, and lacked symbolic culture, a trait supposedly unique to modern humans.
But recent findings have revealed a species with more intelligence and savoir faire than suspected.
They buried their dead in ritual fashion, created tools, and painted animal frescos on cave walls at least 64,000 years ago, 20,000 years before Homo sapiens arrived in Europe.
Hominins — the term used to describe early human species, as well as our own — most likely started hunting with weapons more than half-a-million years ago. 
3,00,000-to 4,00,000-year-old wooden staves found in England and Germany are the oldest known spear-like implements likely used for killing prey. But there was no physical evidence as to their use, leaving scientists to speculate.
The new find from the Neumark-Nord area of Germany removes that doubt, said Gaudzinski-Windheuser. “As far as spear use is concerned, we now finally have the ‘crime scene’ fitting to the proverbial ‘smoking gun’,” she said.
Lake shore excavations from the same site since the 1980s have yielded tens of thousands of bones from large mammals, including red and fallow deer, horses and bovids. 
They have also turned up thousands of stone artefacts, attesting to a flourishing Neanderthal presence in what was a forest environment during an interglacial period 135,000 and 115,000 years ago. The old deer bones examined for the study were unearthed more than 20 years ago, but new technologies helped unlock their secrets: which injuries were lethal, what kind of weapon was used, and whether the spears were thrown from a distance or thrust from close up.

James Webb Space Telescope to study Jupiter’s Great Red Spot: NASA "," 
 
NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope - the most ambitious and complex space observatory ever built - will be used to study Jupiter’s Great Red Spot, shedding new light on the enigmatic storm that has been raging on the planet for over 350 years.
 Jupiter’s iconic storm is on the Webb telescope’s list of targets chosen by guaranteed time observers, scientists who helped develop the incredibly complex telescope. 
 One of the telescope’s science goals is to study planets, including the mysteries still held by the planets. 
 Researchers plan to use Webb’s mid-infrared instrument (MIRI) to create multispectral maps of the Great Red Spot and analyse its thermal, chemical and cloud structures.
 They will be able to observe infrared wavelengths that could shed light on what causes the spot’s iconic colour, which is often attributed to the Sun’s ultraviolet radiation interacting with nitrogen, sulphur and phosphorus-bearing chemicals that are lifted from Jupiter’s deeper atmosphere by powerful atmospheric currents within the storm.
 Using MIRI to observe in the five to seven micrometre range could be particularly revealing for the Great Red Spot, as no other mission has been able to observe Jupiter in that part of the electromagnetic spectrum. 
 Those wavelengths of light could allow the scientists to see unique chemical byproducts of the storm, which would give insight into its composition.
“We’ll be looking for signatures of any chemical compounds that are unique to the Great Red Spot, which could be responsible for the red chromophores,” said Leigh Fletcher, a senior research fellow at the University of Leicester 
 Chromophores are the parts of molecules responsible for their colour.
“Any waves produced by the vigorous convective activity within the storm must pass through the stratosphere before they reach the ionosphere and thermosphere.If they really do exist and are responsible for heating Jupiter’s upper layers, hopefully we’ll see evidence for their passage in our data” Fletcher said.
 Generations of astronomers have studied the Great Red Spot; the storm has been monitored since 1830, but it has possibly existed for more than 350 years.
 The reason for the storm’s longevity largely remains a mystery, and the key to understanding the formation of storms on Jupiter is to witness their full life cycle - growing, shrinking, and eventually dying.
“We did not see the Great Red Spot form, and it may not die anytime soon, so scientists must rely on observing “smaller and fresher” storms on the planet to see how they begin and evolve, something that Webb may do in the future, said Fletcher.

Dasubhashitam : Resurgence of literature
"," A bulk of social media debates, virtual discussions contribute to extending the longevity of vernacular literature in the Telugu states. Yet their efforts in encouraging readers to turn to classics and look back at our literary richness have been more restrictive than effective. 
The advent of technology has opened up opportunities to connect and find innovative solutions. That’s precisely what the Hyderabad-based father-son duo Tulasidas Konduru and Kiran Kumar have done, they’ve come up with an Audible-like app for Telugu audiobooks called Dasubhashitam. The two call it a first of a kind platform to tell stories, revive art forms, encourage budding and established writers, narrators in Telugu, connect them to a wide user base.
A year ago when Tulasidas, a retired government employee, had suggested that his software engineer son Kiran read PVRK Prasad’s memoir Asalem Jarigindante, the latter responded, “I hardly have any time. You’re anyways free. Why don’t you read it out to me?” The casual conversation between the two literary enthusiasts became a starting point to develop the app. They saw this as a right opportunity to re-introduce Telugu literature to a new generation. “We can’t eat for someone else, we can’t watch a movie for others, but reading for others seems quite possible,” says Tulsidas.




Kiran’s stint with Google, HCL helped him work extensively on the interface, he also collaborated with a Chennai-based team to develop Dasubhashitam. Though the app targeted youngsters, their initial reader base was aged around 35-40 years. “The icons, font size, interface are quite easy to handle. We inhabited the sensibilities from apps like Audible and Apple podcasts,” says Kiran. The app has separate sections for fiction, poetry, non-fiction,e-books and interviews. Apart from Tulsidas, narrators of the novels and short stories include Mulugu Sarada, Goli Anjaneyulu, Chegondi Veera Venkata Satyanarayana (lyricist Anantha Sriram’s father). “Vocal clarity has been my strength since childhood, this worked in storytelling. I keenly observe the way people speak and their modulation. I dramatise the works without overdoing it. I involve myself in the content,” says Tulasidas. 
Platform for arts




Also envisaged as a platform to nurture newer and ancient art forms, the duo hopes the medium helps revive radio plays and have contemporary stories narrated through the format. Dasubhashitam, available on Android and iOS devices is bound to be a boon for a wide audience that can speak but cannot read Telugu. “We did made mistakes initially, on the quality side, but our intentions are honest and we have improved over time,” they share, adding “There are not many Telugu writers these days and it’s necessary to create a market. Many lose out on distribution too. We want to create an eco-system where people think about audiobooks.”
The responses over six months have been promising. Ganapathi, Amaravathi Kathalu, Kumara Sambhavam are popular picks on the app that comprises mostly classics, epics and spiritual audiobooks as of now. PVRK Prasad had even requested the duo to come up with audiobook versions of his other works. Tulasidas says, “PV Narasimha Rao’s daughter Vani too has requested us to come up with audio books of her father’s stories. We intend to stay free from books that endorse political ideologies.”
For the future
Copyrights pertaining to the books is an area of concern, but they say the app is not pirating anything. “We are giving publicity for Telugu literature. For instance, we don't know who holds the rights for Barrister Parvateesam. We’ll put the audiobook for sale on the app and give them their share of the claim, if anyone comes forward,” Tulasidas signs off.

Mars may have hosted life before earth
"," The crust that encases rocky planets and makes possible the emergence of life took shape on Mars earlier than thought and at least 100 million years sooner than on Earth, researchers said on June 27. 
Analysing grains of the mineral zircon extracted from a Martian meteorite known as Black Beauty, they determined that the Red Planet’s outer layer hardened 4.547 billion years ago, only 20 million years after the birth of the Sun.
“Mars’s primary crust formation — which is the end product of planet formation — happened much faster than previously thought,” said Martin Bizzarro, a scientist at Denmark’s Centre for Star and Planet Formation and senior author of a study published in Nature. “Our results indicate that Mars could have had an environment with oceans, and potentially life, much earlier than Earth,” he told AFP. 
Water is considered to be an essential precursor for life, at least as we know it. Mars was once much more Earth-like, with a thick atmosphere, abundant water and global oceans. Up to now, mathematical models have suggested that the solidification of the Red Planet took up to 100 million years. The new study tackles the question by examining a chunk of Mars that streaked into the Saharan Desert and was discovered in 2011.
The Black Beauty meteorite weighed 320g when found. The researchers secured 44g of the precious space rock, and crushed five — enough to extract seven bits of zircon that could be used in experiments. By measuring the lead decaying from uranium that had been trapped in zircon as the young Mars’s molten magma hardened, the scientists were able to precisely date the crust from which the zircon formed.
“I’m glad we chose that strategy,” said Mr. Bizzarro. “Zircon is like a time capsule.”
There are two main models for the formation of planets. 
In one, it occurs in stages, with small dust particles coalescing into “planetesimals” — rock fragments ten to 100 km in diameter — that collide to form planetary embryos, and then planets, over a time scale of 50 to 100 million years. 
According to a more recent model, planetary growth unfolds more quickly and is fuelled by so-called “pebble accretion”, the layered accumulation of particles measured in centimetres and metres that are loosely bound with gases.
“Our data supports newer models indicating the very rapid formation of terrestrial planets,” the authors said.
The new timeline suggests that something similar may have happened on our planet, but only after Earth was “reset” by the giant impact that formed the Moon about 4.4 billion years ago, Mr. Bizzarro said. 
Mars is thought to have a dense metallic core with a radius of about 1,800 km, consisting primarily of iron, nickel and sulphur. The core is surrounded by a largely dormant mantle — some 1,500 km thick — made mainly of silicon, oxygen, iron and magnesium. 
Finally, the crust averages about 50 km in depth, with a maximum of about 125 km. Earth’s crust averages 40 km, but is one-third the thickness of the Martian crust once planet size is taken into account.

Saturn’s moon could support life, says study
","Complex organic molecules have been discovered originating from one of Saturn’s moons, Enceladus, adding to its potential to support life, researchers said on Wednesday.
The Cassini spacecraft first flew close to the ice-covered moon in 2005 as part of a mission to gather data on Saturn that will be analysed for years to come.
A team led by Frank Postberg and Nozair Khawaja of the University of Heidelberg in Germany said they had identified fragments of large organic molecules in ice grains that were ejected from geysers through cracks in the moon’s icy exterior.
Their findings were published in the journal Nature. “It is the first ever detection of complex organics coming from an extraterrestrial waterworld,” Mr. Postberg was quoted as saying.
The Enceladus findings come after data earlier this month showed organic compounds on the surface of Mars and seasonal fluctuations of atmospheric methane, marking some of the strongest evidence ever that the earth’s neighbour may have harboured life. 
Cassini has previously detected lightweight organic molecules at Enceladus but the newly found fragments are much larger. Such large molecules can only be created by complex chemical processes including those related to life, ESA said. 
“This is the most recent in a long series of discoveries made by Cassini,” ESA added.

Decreasing ‘greenness’ in India’s forests
"," Most forests are green. But a recent study finds that this ‘greenness’ is consistently decreasing across more than 46 lakh hectares of various types of forest in India, particularly in core protected areas. This indicates that our forests are vulnerable, write scientists.
India's diverse forests face several threats including forest degradation, as the loss of greenness signifies. Scientists at Hyderabad's National Remote Sensing Centre analysed NASA’s MODIS satellite images of India’s forests at eight-day intervals for 15 years (2001 to 2014) and assessed the persistent decreases in greenness. Using an index that determines the amount forest “vigour,” they assessed the seasonal greenness of 14 different forest types: the negative the trend of greenness over years, the more degraded and vulnerable the forest.
They found that the highest degradation is in moist deciduous forests (more than 20 lakh hectares), especially in the states of Chhatisgarh, Odisha, Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh. Wet evergreen forests – including those in the Western Ghats and Eastern Himalayas – are also affected, with the major changes observed in Karnataka and Arunachal Pradesh, followed by Kerala and Meghalaya. More than 15% of India’s total mangrove forests also showed a decrease in greenness. Nearly 80% of these changes occurred in ‘core’ forests like protected areas.
Using statistical analyses, the team determined the ‘spots’or areas where the decrease in seasonal greenness were high and spatially contiguous. West Bengal was a major hotspot of mangrove degradation. Arunachal Pradesh, Kerala, Karnataka and Meghalaya were hotspots of decreasing greenness of wet evergreen forests while Manipur, Tamil Nadu, Mizoram, Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh showed degraded montane (high-elevation) wet forests.
According to the authors, the result of this study could provide first hand information to prioritise and plan conservation of these areas or restore them to their original glory. However, while the study identifies the hotspots where decreasing greenness is a worry, it does not identify what caused this problem.
“This decreasing greenness could be due to natural or anthropogenic factors that we have not identified in the study,” said Abhishek Chakraborty, lead author of the study published in Ecological Indicators. “It could be due to changing climates, shifts in monsoon patterns, decreasing soil fertility or the impact of human activities.”

Astronomers puzzled by ‘cow’ in the sky
"," Astronomers across the world are puzzled by a new phenomenon — a very bright celestial object seen close to the very small galaxy CGCG 137-068 — reported in The Astronomer’s Telegram on June 17. Since then, the journal has been receiving a spate of communications, from Indian astrophysicists, too. A fast-brightening spot, initially thought to be a bright transient astronomical event lying close to the galaxy CGCG 137-068, was spotted by the ATLAS telescope. Named AT2018cow, the transient was soon given the nickname ‘cow’. This is not due to any resemblance to the quadruped but a mere coincidence of letters in the way of naming such transients.
The cow proved to be suitably interesting, because though it was initially thought to be a nova, later analysis showed that it was more like a broadline supernova of the type Ic. Transient astronomical events last from a few seconds to several weeks and may have several causes. Specifically, a Type Ic supernova is caused by the explosion of an extremely massive star which has lost its outer layers of hydrogen and helium. 
“As part of the GROWTH collaboration, we are keeping an eye on the mysterious transient AT2018cow using the 2-metre Himalayan Chandra Telescope (HCT) at Hanle, Ladakh,” says Shubham Srivastav, a post-doctoral fellow at IIT Bombay, in an email to The Hindu. The HCT observations indicate that the transient is steadily fading in all optical bands. Although spectroscopic features indicate a tentative similarity with broad line Ic supernovae, its true nature remains a puzzle, he adds.
A.J. Nayana, a research scholar at National Centre for Radio Astrophysics, Pune (NCRA) says: “We observed AT2018cow with the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) on June 28 and reported our first results on June 29 in The Astronomers Telegram.” Since there are many transients being discovered each day, the researchers had to wait and decide if this object was worth the effort. Also, as Prof Poonam Chandra at NCRA, Pune, explains, “Radio frequencies are the lowest energy of the electromagnetic spectrum and the object evolves much later at radio frequencies. The GMRT results tell us that the radio-frequency radiation is still absorbed, most likely, by the relativistic electrons themselves which are responsible for the radio emission.”
 Astronomers are in a frenzy trying to figure out what this is. “Even if it is finally a Type IC supernova, it will not be a conventional one,” says Varun Bhalerao from the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, who is involved in analysing data received from the GMRT as well as the Himalayan Chandra Telescope. “The images and spectrum were obtained by the Hanle facility and GMRT. We have requested Astrosat to observe and it will start on July 3,” he adds.
In particular, AT2018cow’s fast rise time and high luminosity are unprecedented for a supernova. Hence it seems like nothing that was known before. “Anything in the unknown territory becomes exciting, and hence currently difficult to explain. However, I am confident that as astronomy community collects more data in multiple wavelengths, we will be able to nail down this exotic supernova,” says Prof. Chandra.

Bacteria develop resistance even without exposure to antibiotics
"," The environment where bacteria such as E. coli thrive can be complex with different stresses being present at the same time and changing unpredictably at different time scales — daily or seasonal. Researchers at Pune’s Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) found exciting results when they replicated these conditions in the lab — E. coli developed resistance to antibiotics and heavy metals even when the bacteria were not exposed to them.
Study design
When exposed to a combination of stresses — salt, pH and oxidative stress — that varied unpredictably on a daily basis, E. coli did not show statistically significant adaptability at the end of 30 days (170 generations). But bacteria did show improved fitness and better growth rate at the end of 100 days. Thirty days produce 170 generations of E. coli while 100 days produce 900 generations.
To make the environment complex, the researchers led by Sutirth Dey from IISER Pune’s Biology Division exposed the bacteria to one or two factors (says pH and salt) that were kept normal while one or two factors were abnormal and caused stress. Unpredictability was brought in by randomly changing the three factors that caused stress on a daily basis. Totally, 30 combinations that make the environment complex and unpredictable were used for the study.
“At the end of 30 days when compared with ancestors [or controls], the bacteria exposed to complex, unpredictable environment did not develop statistically significant advantage in terms of improved fitness,” says Shraddha Karve from IISER Pune’s Biology Division and first author of a paper published in the Journal of Evolutionary Biology.
Surprise finding
“But what came as a surprise was that the bacteria evolved the ability to tolerate novel stresses that they were not exposed to, such as antibiotics (norfloxacin) and heavy metals (cobalt and zinc),” says Dr. Karve. “We repeated the experiment all over again as the result was so surprising, and we got the same outcome.”
Another study in the Journal of Biosciences by the team confirmed that efflux pumps in bacteria show greater efficiency in throwing out antibiotics from inside (the bacteria) though they have not been able to precisely find out why and how the exposure to complex, unpredictable environment causes this.
The researchers also studied resistance at the population level. The bacteria that have already been exposed to 30 days of stress (pH, salt and oxidative stress) were then exposed to antibiotics or heavy metals. The whole population showed better growth rate than controls and could better resist antibiotics and heavy metal stress. 
“What we found was that the bacteria had much better efflux efficiency than the ancestors [controls]. It could be that during the 30 days of evolution the efflux pumps had greatly evolved either by working continuously or by becoming more efficient,” she says.
“Once the efflux pumps’ efficiency has been increased by exposure to other stresses, the ability to resist multiple drugs is only to be expected,” adds Prof. Dey.
Implications for public health
“It’s alarming that bacteria exposed to complex, unpredictable fluctuations can lead to resistance to antibiotics or heavy metals, and it could happen in about 30 days,” says Dr. Karve.
“Climatology studies have shown that variability in the environment has drastically increased in many parts of the world, India included. As a result, there is a possibility that bacteria could show increased efflux activity and greater resistance to antibiotics even when not exposed to them,” says Prof. Dey.
The isolated Amazonian tribe that had no contact with civilisation till recently showed drug resistance can arise even when not exposed to antibiotics. The gut bacteria of this population showed resistance to latest antibiotics, including synthetic antibiotics, which are not found naturally in soil.
Another study (Journal of Evolutionary Biology) by the team found that unlike bacteria which had not evolved to handle stress in 30 days, the ability to cope with stress was significantly better when the exposure to complex, unpredictable environment continued for 100 days. “Besides better growth rate and greater ability to tolerate stresses, the bacteria showed no variation in their ability to handle different stresses compared with ancestors,” she says.
In the latest study paper published a few days ago in the Journal of Evolutionary Biology, they investigated whether complexity or unpredictability that hinders adaptation over short term. And they found that bacteria could adapt to unpredictability when complexity was absent. They also found E. coli shows little adaptation to acidic pH as it is already very well adapted to it. In contrast, the bacteria show significant adaptation to salt, a stress for which it is poorly adapted to begin with.

University of Hyderabad increases bioavailability of harpin biopesticide "," Researchers at the University of Hyderabad have found that harpin biopesticide brought about 80-90% reduction in severity of fungal infection in tomato plants when it is encapsulated in chitosan nanoparticles. The fungal infection was caused by Rhizoctonia solani. The reduction in disease severity is only about 50-55% when the biopesticide is used without loading it in nanoparticles. The results were published in the journal Carbohydrate Polymers.
Though harpin is used against several bacterial, fungal and viral infections, poor bioavailability is a major hurdle when harpin protein, taken from the bacteria Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae, is just sprayed on the leaves like any other pesticide.
Chitosan to the rescue
To address the issue of poor bioavailability of harpin arising from the inability to permeate into plants, the researchers led by Prof. Appa Rao Podile from the Department of Plant Sciences turned to nanotechnology. They used the biocompatible and biodegradable chitosan in nanoparticle size to encapsulate the biopesticide. Chitosan nanoparticles are capable of getting into the plant through the stomata (pores on the leaves through which gas exchange takes place) and then diffuse through the cell wall to enter the cells. The team found that chitosan nanoparticles containing harpin pass through the cell wall and end up in the chloroplast of tomato plants.
As a result, bioavailability of harpin inside tomato plants increases sharply when loaded in chitosan nanoparticles. Also, less amount of harpin will have to be sprayed on leaves when it is contained in nanoparticles.
Chitosan by itself has another advantage. “Chitosan’s antifungal property and its role in triggering plant defence responses are already well known. Its ability to biodegrade inside the plant without harming the plant cells is why we chose it for encapsulating harpin,” says Prof. Podile. 
The disease severity in tomato reduced significantly and there was fivefold decrease in fungal biomass in the case of harpin encapsulated in nanoparticles compared with bulk harpin sprayed on leaves. While the fungus failed to colonise and infect tomato leaves upon extended incubation, it completely destroyed the leaves used as controls. 
Laboratory studies found harpin was released from the nanoparticles in two phases. “The biopesticide adsorbed on the nanoparticles gets released in a burst in the first 48 hours followed by slow release up to 120 hours,” says Dr. Sandhya Rani Nadendla from the Department of Plant Sciences at UoH and first author of the paper.
Currently, the shelf-life of harpin nanoparticle is limited to 30 days as the encapsulation loses its efficiency. “The nanoparticles are currently stored in a liquid phase. We are trying to make some chemical changes at the time of preparation of chitosan nanoparticles to make it more stable. We are also trying to make it in a powder form by spray drying to further increase the shelf-life,” says Prof. Podile.
Tomato plants and R. solani fungal infection were only used as a model system to test the efficacy of chitosan nanoparticles containing harpin in controlling the disease. “The objective was not to develop an exclusive disease control method. We used this particular fungal infection as an index,” he says. “The plant defence activated by harpin is broad-spectrum so can control even bacteria.”
The team is planning to test harpin-containing chitosan nanoparticles on a large-scale on four different crops and at least two pathogens per crop. Two of the crops to be tested will be grown in fields and two others will be greenhouse crops.

Miriam Kepler of the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy in Germany said hints of baby planets have been detected before, but astronomers weren’t sure whether those observations might simply be features in the swirling dust. In a paper to be published in Astronomy & Astrophysics, scientists describe the planet, located about three billion km from the star PDS 70, as a gas giant bigger than Jupiter. It has a cloudy atmosphere and a surface temperature of 1,000 degrees Celsius.

China aims to outstrip NASA with super-powerful rocket
","China is working on a super-powerful rocket that would be capable of delivering heavier payloads into low orbit than NASA, a leading Chinese space expert was quoted as saying on Monday.
By 2030, the Long March-9 rocket under development will be able to carry 140 tonnes into low-Earth orbit — where TV and earth observation satellites currently fly — said Long Lehao, a senior official from the Chinese Academy of Engineering, according to the official Xinhua news agency.
This compares to the 20 tonnes deliverable by Europe’s Ariane 5 rocket or the 64 tonnes by Elon Musk’s Falcon Heavy, which in February catapulted one of the US entrepreneur’s red Tesla Roadster cars towards Mars.
It would also outstrip the 130 tonnes of NASA’s Space Launch System, which is due to become operational in 2020.
China’s Long March-9 would have a core stage measuring 10 metres in diameter and boast four powerful boosters, each with a diameter of five metres.
Xinhua quoted Long as saying the rocket could be used in manned lunar landings, deep space exploration or constructing a space-based solar power plant.
In addition, China is working on a reusable space rocket, which is expected to make its maiden flight in 2021. The first stage and the boosters will be retrieved after a vertical landing, Long said in a speech in Beijing.
China is pouring billions into its military-run space programme, with hopes of having a crewed space station by 2022, and of sending humans to the Moon in the near future.
The Asian superpower is looking to finally catch up with the U.S. and Russia after years of belatedly matching their space milestones.
China is also planning to build a base on the moon, the state-run Global Times said in early March, citing the Communist Party chief of the China Academy of Space Technology.

A desi keyboard for Indian languages ","A small room on a terrace in Uttarahalli, Bengaluru, is bursting with a big idea. It is the office of KaNaada Phonetics Pvt Ltd which has just launched their new product, ‘Ka-Naada’, in April this year.
Ka-Naada (ka-naada.com) is a patented keyboard layout available as both hardware (with a USB cable) and software. It groups letters according to phonetics, creating a more intuitive interface for languages based on the Brahmi (the common ancestor of Indian scripts) script. The keyboard is available in multiple languages: Kannada, Gujarati, Gurumukhi, Malayalam, Tulu, Oriya and more. A user can switch languages, using the keyboard of one script to type in another. The current keyboard requires QWERTY for certain commands, such as the control and function keys. The future version of Ka-Naada will have these commands as well.
A long time coming
The idea was born in 2009 when Guru Prasad — a simulator based in Orlando, Florida — saw children struggling to learn their mother tongues. With a Ph.D in industrial engineering (simulation systems) he is an expert in simulation, network architecture, distributed systems and systems modeling. The QWERTY keyboard, he determined, was unfit for Indian languages. Navigating a keyboard meant for English disrupted ‘native thinking’. He worked predominantly with linguist Professor BVK Sastry at theYoga-Samskrutham University in Florida, and a few others, to find a solution. The Ka-Naada keyboard layout was finalised by 2011, the first prototype was done by 2012 and the first full keyboard, by 2015. It was an uncomfortable square shape, and had to be redesigned to be rectangular.
KaNaada has received funding from associations such as Kannada Praadhikaara and ITBT (Department of Information Technology, Biotechnology and Science and Technology of Government of Karnataka) and design assistance from the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME), Centre of Excellence, IISc. They received their patent in 2017.
“The response, particularly, has been very overwhelming,” Prasad says. “It is highly intuitive for users, right from the get go. Children, particularly, are thrilled to use it. I have heard comments like, Maine aankhe band karke, type kiya (I was able to type with my eyes closed), from them. For adults, there were some training issues because they are so accustomed to QWERTY. We are trying to work to come closer to that keyboard ergonomically.” While maintaining their current layout, the company is experimenting with the size and qualities of the keys and keyboard for the most user-friendly combinations.
For Prasad, the most fascinating part of his journey has been reviving the script of his mother-tongue — Tulu. “The language came alive. All of a sudden, we have a user interface for Tulu. It is the same with Kashmiri (in the Sharada script) and for all the other languages that might go out of use. This might be a boon, that we can keep them alive through our children.”
Increase accessibility
The entrepreneur lights up when asked about the potential of his product. It could open up job opportunities for those in the rural areas who do not know English. It could be a key learning device, and he plans on introducing a toy keyboard for children to use, as they learn their mother tongue. It could be used in government offices, for desktop publishing, or by visually-impaired users. It will soon be available in foreign languages, including Malay, Sinhalese, and Nepalese, which are all Brahmi-based.
As his dreams grow, so does his work. Currently, the entrepreneur is juggling production, research and development, and marketing. He receives his supplies from vendors across the country and is co-sharing a production facility in Bengaluru. However, a large machine has been ordered in anticipation of a full-scale production unit. He has now tied up with NGOs and is working with overseas students who come as part of a Youth Ambassador programme to distribute the keyboard in various rural schools in India.

'The Crew 2' review: Better than the original "," Much like the first Watch Dogs, The Crew had a fantastic premise. The thought of driving across an entire country, edge-to-edge, was ambitious, and to some extent The Crew delivered. Yet, it had a ham-handed story that was close in a revenge tone, the worst part of Watch Dogs too. While Watch Dogs 2 did reinvent itself in a lighter tone with success, The Crew 2 seems to take that same path, with mixed results.


What’s it about?
Think of The Crew 2 as a frankengame of sorts. The best parts of the most popular games out there cut down to their bits and pieces, in a development chopshop. Then assembled together into The Crew 2, then glossed over with a shiny coat of paint. This is not necessarily a bad thing; it actually makes The Crew 2 a lot better than its predecessor.
At its core, the game resembles the popular Forza Horizon series a lot more than the other games. With a lot of similarities to the latest Need for Speed Payback. There is a threadbare story connecting the dots, which has you select a driver and race to the top of the American motorsports food chain. The overtly happy-voice actors ham their way through all their voice lines, appropriately grating your nerves to dust, and making you just want to get the initial parts of the game over with and get to the racing.
How does it play?
The best part of The Crew 2 is the way it uses its ideas on the game world. In addition to driving, you can also fly a sports plane or drive a jet boat. Both of these handle really well. Using a mechanic called Fast Fav, the game actually lets you switch amongst your favourite plane, car or boat any time. What it also does neatly in the intro is the way that it uses the environment to bend cinematically, as the city folds like in Inception. The menus and interstitial loading graphics too are just plain rad. Just wish it carried that consistency throughout.
A racing game is as good as its racing, and The Crew 2 does not excel in that department. The cars, while they look appropriately gorgeous, feel heavy and weighed down, making it incredibly hard to control, especially with that handbrake that seems to work like a drift button. There’s no effortless flow into a corner drift, like Forza Horizon allows you to do — even though both share the arcade style controls with simulation-like looks. On the flip side though, offroading seems to work really well with these controls. The boat racing has great eye candy, but feels too slow and sluggish.




The same goes for the world. At some places, especially in the wild, open spaces, the detail is incredible. Grass moving in the wind and mountains in the distance, provide a picturesque setting to race in. In cities, it just feels like buildings are made of papier mache, with realistic roads. The water sequences are sublime, with every frame, desktop wallpaper-worthy. Add to that some spotty guides to mark out your race path, and you’ll be seeing that annoying ‘Wrong Way’ sign way too often.
The simple online component and the ability to just drive across the USA — experiencing glitzy Las Vegas to San Francisco to New York and everything in the middle — is undoubtedly the best part of the game, and quite the sublime experience. 
The Crew 2 is a fun game to play, especially if you want fun. Judging by Ubisoft’s dedication to constantly making The Division or Assassin’s Creed Origins fun, they will tweak and make The Crew 2 a lot better.
Should you get it?
The Crew 2 is leagues better than the first game, that is for certain, though it is quite far away from the leaders in the genre. If you are looking out for a fun car-racing game that splits into other genres of motorsports, then The Crew 2 will satisfy.

Upstart: Pinnacles and pitfalls
"," Here is how it goes down usually: You’re a very smart person. Everything you’ve done in school and college reinforces that. Class topping, school topping, state topping marks all the time. You clear through the hoops and hurdles that entrance exams pose easily enough. You land an excellent job straight out of college. You do well there too, just by going through the motions. Ennui strikes soon enough, and if you are close enough to the age of 30 and still with very little real responsibility, this is when the idea of taking the risks associated with starting up seem not all that scary. 
So you dive into it. You start your own company. Alone, or maybe with one or two people whom you thought you could trust in and would share the same burdens — banal, legal, intellectual, and whatever else that starting up entails — as you in an equal manner, or more often than not, in an equitable manner based on how you are slicing up the ownership of the company. Given your track record through school, college, and the job or jobs you have held, you expect this startup to be a success every which way. Just that, despite everything, the startup turns out to be an utter failure. Some do not bother about that. They move on, to either another startup if they have the security cushion for that, or to something stabler (which usually means a job at a large company), where they can, at the very least, sustain themselves and make enough money to live well. And then you also have a significant percentage of such people who take the failure of their startup very badly.
The Indian startup ecosystem, for better or worse, trails trends of the Silicon Valley startup ecosystem by a few years. In this particular case, it is definitely for the better. An award-winning article by journalist Jessica Bruder, titled bluntly enough ‘The Psychological Price of Entrepreneurship’, and written way back in September of 2013, took an in-depth look at a problem that was plaguing the Bay Area startup world back then. Starting up was brutal. Not on your finances, but on your peace of mind. The exaggerated and aggrandised hero worship of success stories such as those of Mark Zuckerberg or Elon Musk had meant that anything less stellar was failure. And for people used to success all the time, this hit hard. Now, three or four years after this phenomenon had peaked in the Silicon Valley, I am seeing it more and more in the Indian startup ecosystem. At this point, it remains anecdotal and not backed by any comprehensive data, but the volume of anecdata that I seem to have gathered rings many alarm bells.
So, before this actually becomes the sort of epidemic it played out in the Bay Area — and I personally know some half a dozen people who were affected by it — I hope that the structures that support the Indian startup ecosystem realise the danger of what such a breakout can do, and make sure that it has the right safety nets for those who fall off the tightrope walk that entrepreneurship often can be.

Move on from fake news, U.S. is fighting 'deepfake' "," Hey, did my congressman really say that? Is that really President Donald Trump on that video, or am I being duped? 
New technology on the internet lets anyone make videos of real people appearing to say things they’ve never said. Republicans and Democrats predict this high-tech way of putting words in someone’s mouth will become the latest weapon in disinformation wars against the United States and other Western democracies. 
We’re not talking about lip-syncing videos. This technology uses facial mapping and artificial intelligence to produce videos that appear so genuine it’s hard to spot the phonies. Lawmakers and intelligence officials worry that the bogus videos called deepfakes could be used to threaten national security or interfere in elections. 
So far, that hasn’t happened, but experts say it’s not a question of if, but when. 
“I expect that here in the United States we will start to see this content in the upcoming midterms and national election two years from now,” said Hany Farid, a digital forensics expert at Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire. “The technology, of course, knows no borders, so I expect the impact to ripple around the globe.” 
When an average person can create a realistic fake video of the president saying anything they want, Farid said, “we have entered a new world where it is going to be difficult to know how to believe what we see.” The reverse is a concern, too. People may dismiss as fake genuine footage, say of a real atrocity, to score political points. 
Realizing the implications of the technology, the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency is already two years into a four-your programme to develop technologies that can detect fake images and videos. Right now, it takes extensive analysis to identify phony videos. It’s unclear if new ways to authenticate images or detect fakes will keep pace with deepfake technology.
Deepfakes are so named because they utilize deep learning, a form of artificial intelligence. They are made by feeding a computer an algorithm, or set of instructions, lots of images and audio of a certain person. The computer program learns how to mimic the person’s facial expressions, mannerisms, voice and inflections. If you have enough video and audio of someone, you can combine a fake video of the person with a fake audio and get them to say anything you want. 
So far, deepfakes have mostly been used to smear celebrities or as gags, but it’s easy to foresee a nation state using them for nefarious activities against the U.S., said Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., one of several members of the Senate intelligence committee who are expressing concern about deepfakes. 
A foreign intelligence agency could use the technology to produce a fake video of an American politician using a racial epithet or taking a bribe, Mr. Rubio says. They could use a fake video of a U.S. soldier massacring civilians overseas, or one of a U.S. official supposedly admitting a secret plan to carry out a conspiracy. Imagine a fake video of a U.S. leader or an official from North Korea or Iran warning the United States of an impending disaster. 
“It’s a weapon that could be used timed appropriately and placed appropriately in the same way fake news is used, except in a video form, which could create real chaos and instability on the eve of an election or a major decision of any sort,” Mr. Rubio told The Associated Press. 
Deepfake technology still has a few hitches. For instance, people’s blinking in fake videos may appear unnatural. But the technology is improving. 
“Within a year or two, it’s going to be really hard for a person to distinguish between a real video and a fake video,” said Andrew Grotto, an international security fellow at the Center for International Security and Cooperation at Stanford University in California. 
“This technology, I think, will be irresistible for nation states to use in disinformation campaigns to manipulate public opinion, deceive populations and undermine confidence in our institutions,” Grotto said. He called for government leaders and politicians to clearly say it has no place in civilized political debate. 
Crude videos have been used for malicious political purposes for years, so there’s no reason to believe the higher-tech ones, which are more realistic, won’t become tools in future disinformation campaigns. 
Mr. Rubio noted that in 2009, the U.S. Embassy in Moscow complained to the Russian Foreign Ministry about a fake sex video it said was made to damage the reputation of a U.S. diplomat. The video showed the married diplomat, who was a liaison to Russian religious and human rights groups, making telephone calls on a dark street. The video then showed the diplomat in his hotel room, scenes that apparently were shot with a hidden camera. Later, the video appeared to show a man and a woman having sex in the same room with the lights off, although it was not at all clear that the man was the diplomat. 
John Beyrle, who was the U.S. ambassador in Moscow at the time, blamed the Russian government for the video, which he said was clearly fabricated. 
Michael McFaul, who was American ambassador in Russia between 2012 and 2014, said Russia has engaged in disinformation videos against various political actors for years and that he too had been a target. He has said that Russian state propaganda inserted his face into photographs and “spliced my speeches to make me say things I never uttered and even accused me of pedophilia.”

PSLV bags first Australian order ","The Indian PSLV launcher has broken into a rising Australian space market and bagged its first small but promising order from Down Under. Fleet Space Technologies, an IoT (Internet of Things) startup, disclosed last week that its first 10-kg nanosatellite Centauri I would fly to space on a PSLV later this year. 
The prospect for the PSLV is in the fact that Adelaide-based Fleet plans to put up a constellation of an unstated number of tiny satellites — all of which will need a suitable, timely launch vehicle to take them to space. 
Australia is in the throes of setting up its space agency and an industry around it. Adelaide in South Australia is the current hub of this activity. The second nanosat, Centauri II, is to be launched on the U.S. SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket later this year.
The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) has planned a part-commercial PSLV flight around August. Neither Fleet nor Antrix Corporation, ISRO's business arm, could immediately say if Centauri I would go on it.
For lighter payloads
The PSLV's three versions can lift satellites of 1,000-1,750 kg to distances of around 600 km in pole-to-pole orbits. A neat launch record has made the booster a trusted and affordable space vehicle for small satellites. Big rocket players are focussed on taking heavy, multi-tonne satellites to space.
Since its first commercial launch in 1999, the PSLV has put in orbit 237 small satellites of 28 countries, About half of them are from the US. Antrix recently said it has many more orders confirmed or under discussion.
Low-cost connectivity
A news release from the Australian company quoted its co-founder and CEO Flavia Tata Nardini and said it is developing a series of 10-kg nanosatellites about the size of a shoebox to enable low-cost connectivity for agriculture, logistics, mining and other industries.
""The first satellite,"" it said, ""will establish a global network that will connect [75 billion] sensors and devices, for free."" A single nanosat can apparently cover 90% of the globe.

Indian-origin scientist gets funding for project ","An Indian-origin scientist working on a project to create a robotic hand covered in so-called brainy skin that mimics the human sense of touch has won 1.5 million pounds in funding for the project.
Professor Ravinder Dahiya, a faculty at the University of Glasgow’s School of Engineering, said the futuristic “thinking skin concept” is inspired by the real skin. 
The super-flexible, hypersensitive skin may one day be used to make more responsive prosthetics for amputees, or to build robots with a sense of touch.
Brainy skin is critical for the autonomy of robots and for a safe human-robot interaction to meet emerging societal needs such as helping the elderly, said Professor Dahiya.
Along with his Bendable Electronics and Sensing Technologies (BEST) team, the scientist has plans to develop ultra-flexible, synthetic “Brainy Skin” that thinks for itself . Brainy Skin reacts like human skin, which has its own neurons that respond immediately to touch rather than having to relay the whole message to the brain.
This electronic thinking skin is made from silicon-based printed neural transistors and graphene — an ultra-thin form of carbon that is only an atom thick, but stronger than steel. 
The new version in the making is said to be more powerful, less cumbersome and would work better than earlier prototypes.
Mimics skin morphology
Professor Dahiya explains, Human skin is an incredibly complex system capable of detecting pressure, temperature and texture through an array of neural sensors that carry signals from the skin to the brain.
Inspired by real skin, this project will harness the technological advances in electronic engineering to mimic some features of human skin, such as softness, bendability and now, also sense of touch. This skin will not just mimic the morphology of the skin but also its functionality. 
The research, dubbed neuPRINTSKIN (Neuromorphic Printed Tactile Skin), received the latest 1.5 million pounds in funding from the Engineering and Physical Science Research Council (EPSRC).
The team’s work means tactile data is gathered over large areas by the synthetic skin’s computing system rather than sent to the brain for interpretation. 
With additional EPSRC funding, which extends Professor Dahiya’s fellowship by another three years, he plans to introduce tactile skin with neuron-like processing. This breakthrough in the tactile sensing research will lead to the first neuromorphic tactile skin, or brainy skin .
To achieve this, Professor Dahiya will add a new neural layer to the e-skin that he has already been developed using printing silicon nanowires.

Mbappé scores this World Cup; a Trump devotee wants a temple and more
","19 and thriving
French footballer Kylian Mbappé has levelled up with the legendary Brazilian Pelé for scoring at least twice in a World Cup match.
But what followed his triumphs is the realisation that he’s just 19, which was then followed by a vow to donate his match salary (roughly €20,000) to charity. If that doesn’t make the world clutch at their hearts, I don’t know what will.




But the rest of us, while totally impressed, found ourselves wondering what we were doing at 19, which heralded a slew of hilarious memes of existentialism.
Twitter user @holumiede shared “I was being sent to my room at that age,” while @TheHarryMcC added, “I am also 19 and today I am eating a ham sandwich while watching Netflix on the couch.” Same, Harry, same. 
Hare Trump?
Bussa Krishna; by now, the name is familiar to Indian netizens. The guy from Telangana who literally worships Donald Trump. 
The 31-year-old farmer has gone all out, making space in his home for his Trump shrine, to which he does regular aartis. I’m already starting to gag.
His justification? That after the tragic killing of engineer Srinivas Kuchibhotla in the United States, he hoped that the regimented prayers would change the situation for Indians living there.
It’s something of nightmares, but one can kind of see he has good intention, but he’s not necessarily gotten great press for it. He’s admitted that he’s been advised to see a psychologist, especially with his plans to build a Trump temple.
As Trump would say, “SAD!”

Technologies that lost the battle of time ","Over the weekend, there was a flurry of activity on the Internet as a large section of netizens witnessed the passing (or transition, depending on how you look at it) of StumbleUpon, one of the sites that defined how a large section of the online populace interacted with the web in the early 2000s. The announcement that the accounts on the site would be transitioned over to Mix, a similar content discovery platform, was met with an outpouring of nostalgia, prompting us to take a trip down memory lane to revisit some of the things from the realms of software, hardware and mobile, that were once dear but are no longer available in their original avatars.




Perhaps one of the original demonstrations of the Internet coming together to establish an alternative communication syntax; memes and rage comics were all over the Internet a few years ago, before things like Instagram filters and Animoji came along to divert people's attention. 9gag, one of the original hubs of meme-related humour, slowly transitioned to other popular content, introducing multiple new sections to aid content discovery. However, upon the website turning ten years old years old on July 1, a large section of users are trying to restore the content to that from the glory days, resulting in famous memes and rage comic storytelling making a reappearance, and dissuading unrelated posts with a cryptic 'This is not a meme' comment.




Even before 9gag's time, a large section of Internet users depended extensively on Yahoo's mail services and Messenger, the company's chat client, for communication. The rise of a new wave of Internet giants has seen Yahoo slowly fall from grace, before eventually being acquired by Verizon in 2017. Messenger itself has trudged along until now, but Verizon subsidiary Oath, which manages its digital divisions like Yahoo and AOL, has announced that the plug will be officially pulled on Messenger on July 17, striking the final nail in its coffin.




Started in 2001, StumbleUpon helped a generation navigate the Internet's murky waters long before personalised content recommendations and social media discovery pages. It used a selection of user-defined interests to constantly serve up interesting websites and content related to these interests at the press of the 'Stumble' button, leading to otherwise undiscovered spaces, like experimental music websites or mind-boggling HTML5 demos. As of June 30, StumbleUpon announced a transition to Mix, a social media-driven content discovery and recommendation platform made by StumbleUpon's co-founder Garett Camp's startup studio Expa.




In 2013, when almost every game developer from upcoming indie studios to gaming legends like Nintendo, were trying to crack mobile gaming, Vietnamese video game programmer Dong Nguyen launched a simple game about an odd flying bird trying to navigate a world similar to that of Super Mario. With a simple premise, unwieldy controls and an excruciating difficulty curve, Flappy Bird took the world by storm. By early January 2014, the game was topping app store charts and increasing Nguyen's wealth significantly, before the developer pulled the game over concerns of 'user addiction'. The game's popularity has died since, and while knockoffs exist aplenty, none of them have enjoyed the same fame as the original, with many blaming the controls or the implementation of the new titles.




Much like Yahoo, Pebble was the victim of acquisition by one of the giants in the wearable space -- Fitbit. Pebble proved that Kickstarter-funded projects can go on to be successful and that smartwatches were a niche worth exploring, with their own custom-designed OS featuring retro graphics, and promising great battery life thanks to E-ink technology. Even after Apple and Google got into the wearable space, Pebble enjoyed a solid following, but chose to be acquired by Fitbit in late 2016. Fitbit has since released its own fitness-focused smartwatches, the Ionic and most recently the Versa, but the quirky, irreverent charm that people saw in Pebble was lost in the acquisition.

ISRO’s first ‘pad abort’ test, critical for future human space mission, successful
","The first 'pad abort' test critical for a future human space mission was conducted successfully on Thursday morning, the Indian Space Research Organisation has announced. The test was conducted at the Satish Dhawan Space Centre, Sriharikota.
“The Pad Abort Test demonstrated the safe recovery of the crew module in case of any exigency at the launch pad,” the space agency said.
Describing it as a major technology demonstrator the space agency said the PAT (pad abort test) is the first in a series of tests to qualify a crew escape system technology of a manned mission in the future.
The Crew Escape System is an emergency escape measure to quickly pull the crew module — the astronaut cabin — along with astronauts out to a safe distance from the launch vehicle in the event of a launch abort.
ISRO Chairman K.Sivan said the teams also tried out at least five new secondary technologies related to satellite communication, navigation and telemetry during the test. A few more trials related to the safety of astronauts would be taken up later.
The countdown began at 2 a.m., five hours ahead of the test. At 7 a.m., the Crew Escape System with a simulated 12.6-tonne crew module lifted off from its pad.
It was propelled on its own seven specially made complex in-built rockets. In the next four-odd minutes, it reached a height of 2.7 km and curved down into the Bay of Bengal on parachutes. It landed in sea at a distance of 2.9 km from the launch centre.
Three recovery boats were sent out to retrieve the module.
The rockets are solid-fuel powered and specially designed for quickly ejecting the crew module and astronauts to a safe distance without exceeding the safe G-levels, an ISRO statement said.
Nearly 300 sensors recorded various functional aspects of the mission during the test flight.

Einstein’s gravity theory passes extreme test, says study published in Nature
"," Albert Einstein’s insights into gravity hold true even in one of the most extreme scenarios the universe can offer, according to a study.
Einstein’s understanding of gravity, as outlined in his general theory of relativity, predicts that all objects fall at the same rate, regardless of their mass or composition.
This theory has passed test after test here on Earth, but scientists have wondered whether it still holds true for some of the most massive and dense objects in the known universe, an aspect of nature known as the Strong Equivalence Principle.
The new findings, published in the journal Nature, show that Einstein’s insights into gravity still hold sway, even in one of the most extreme scenario.
To date, Einstein’s equations have passed all tests, from careful laboratory studies to observations of planets in our solar system.
 However, alternatives to Einstein’s general theory of relativity predict that compact objects with extremely strong gravity, like neutron stars, fall a little differently than objects of lesser mass.
That difference, these alternate theories predict, would be due to a compact object’s so-called gravitational binding energy - the gravitational energy that holds it together.
Withstanding tests
 In 2011, the National Science Foundation’s (NSF) Green Bank Telescope (GBT) discovered a natural laboratory to test this theory in extreme conditions: a triple star system called PSR J0337+1715, located about 4,200 light-years from Earth.
This system contains a neutron star in a 1.6-day orbit with a white dwarf star, and the pair in a 327-day orbit with another white dwarf further away.
“This is a unique star system,” said Ryan Lynch of the Green Bank Observatory in the US.
“We don’t know of any others quite like it. That makes it a one-of-a-kind laboratory for putting Einstein’s theories to the test,” he said.
Since its discovery, the triple system has been observed regularly by the GBT, the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope in the Netherlands, and the NSF’s Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico.
If alternatives to Einstein’s picture of gravity were correct, then the neutron star and the inner white dwarf would each fall differently towards the outer white dwarf.
“The inner white dwarf is not as massive or compact as the neutron star, and thus has less gravitational binding energy,” said Scott Ransom, an astronomer with the National Radio Astronomy Observatory in the US.
Through meticulous observations and careful calculations, the researchers were able to test the system’s gravity using the pulses of the neutron star alone.
They found that any acceleration difference between the neutron star and inner white dwarf is too small to detect.
“If there is a difference, it is no more than three parts in a million,” said Nina Gusinskaia from the University of Amsterdam in the Netherlands.
This places severe constraints on any alternative theories to general relativity, researchers said.
The result is ten times more precise that the previous best test of gravity, making the evidence for Einstein’s Strong Equivalence Principle that much stronger, they said.

TIFR researchers show how liver regulates outflow of fat
"," A grammar textbook example of a pun is the sentence “Life depends on the liver”. Indeed, the liver is a very important organ in the body since it regulates the metabolism of, among other things, fat in the form of lipid droplets.
Lipid droplets accumulate in the liver during “fasting, as in during sleep. Yet, the liver controls the release of these lipid droplets into the blood, thereby preventing excessive deposition of very low density lipids (VLDL) into the blood stream which could lead to heart disease. While this role of the liver is well known, the question of how it happens has not been addressed until recently. This question was taken up by Roop Mallik’s group at the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Mumbai.
In a paper published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, US (PNAS), the researchers led by Dr Mallik show that the motor protein kinesin transports lipid droplets to the endoplasmic reticulum within the liver cells, from where it is secreted into the blood. During fasting, kinesin is removed from the lipid droplets, and this ensures they do not reach the endoplasmic reticulum, nor are they secreted into the blood. This tempers the secretion of lipids from the liver during fasting and protects the organs.
In their first experiment, the group of researchers extracted lipid droplets from cells and watched them move in a test tube. There they found that when they added specific compounds that blocked the motor protein kinesin, the droplets stopped moving. “This is how we found for the first time that kinesin is a key factor,” says Dr Mallik. They published these results in the journal Nature Methods. Following this study, they experimented with rats and found the connection between regulation of lipid transport within the liver cells and that of the motor protein kinesin.
Reactive droplets
They found that the protein ARF1 (ADP-ribosylation factor 1) increased the breakdown of fats in the lipid droplets. It binds to the droplets and pinches off phospholipid molecules from their surface, thereby increasing their surface tension. This makes the droplets “reactive” and they interact more strongly with the endoplasmic reticulum. “We showed that high insulin in the fed state causes both ARF1 and kinesin to bind together to lipid droplets. This means that reactive droplets will be selectively transported to the smooth endoplasmic reticulum at the periphery of liver cells,” says Dr Mallik. Because of this, the reactive droplets can interact with the smooth endoplasmic reticulum and supply fat for the assembly of VLDL particles inside the endoplasmic reticulum. “These fatty VLDL particles will be subsequently secreted out from the liver into blood, and the fat inside will be used up in other tissues of the body to generate energy,” he explains. 
The research is relevant in times when heart disease, for instance, is such a common ailment, also aggravated by faulty diets. Revealing plans for the future, Dr Malik says, “We hope to find molecules which can change the affinity of kinesin to lipid droplets. These molecules are potential drugs that reduce fat secretion from the liver and therefore reduce the amount of fat circulating around in blood. This fat is a major cause of heart disease, diabetes and obesity.”

Protein’s novel role in embryo implantation studied
","A large number of couples are infertile and in many cases IVF is not successful and there are repeated failures. In a latest development, Mumbai-based researchers have shown the molecular features of embryo–endometrium crosstalk that helps in embryo implantation.
The team led by Dr. Deepak Modi from ICMR’s National Institute for Research in Reproductive Health (NIRRH) has discovered that the endometrium is not a passive tissue which readily promotes embryo implantation but undergoes extensive remodelling brought about by the embryo at the time of implantation.
They discovered that a protein OVGP1 is induced in the endometrium precisely at the time when the embryo has to implant. That the embryo can implant only during a narrow window is well known. Studies carried out in mouse models showed that OVGP1 protein is expressed for a brief period that coincides with the time of implantation. It is known that the pregnancy hormone — human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) produced and released by embryos is crucial for the implantation process.
The role of hCG hormone in inducing the endometrium to produce the OVGP1 protein became clear when the researchers studied the role of different hormones on endometrial cell lines. The cell lines were exposed to progesterone, estrogen and human chorionic gonadotropin hormone. “We found the hCG hormone induced the expression of OVGP1 protein. Progesterone and estrogen, too, had a role, though minor, whereas hCG had a major role in the expression of OVGP1. This tells that embryos signal the endometrium to express OVGP1,” says Dr. Modi, who is the corresponding author of a paper published in the Journal of Assisted Reproduction and Genetics.
To study how the protein helps in the implantation process, the researchers silenced the expression of the protein in the endometrium cell lines. They found that the expression levels of integrin proteins, which are essential for implantation, were significantly reduced in OVGP1 silenced cells. Similarly, homeobox protein HOXA10 levels too reduced significantly as did the cytokines, says Saniya Laheri from the Department of Biological Sciences, NMIMS Sunandan Divatia School of Science, Mumbai and first author of the paper.
“We found the OVGP1 protein is required for balancing the expression of genes required for implantation,” says Laheri. “We then wanted to test if the expression of the altered genes affects implantation.”
For implantation to take place the trophoblast cells (the outermost layer of the embryo) have to adhere to the endometrial epithelial cells. When the OVGP1 protein was silenced in the endometrium the adhesion of the trophoblast gets reduced. “This led us to conclude that OVGP1 in the endometrial epithelial cells is required for embryo implantation,” says Nancy Ashray from NIRRH, a co-author of the paper.
Women who had repeated IVF failure apparently had reduced levels of OVGP1 protein. “The levels of OVGP1 are reduced by 30% in women with repeated IVF failure,” Laheri says.
“This is a very fundamental research and we are now beginning to understand how the embryo and endometrium have to crosstalk. This work in long term might have implications in management of infertility,” says Dr. Modi.

Trees offer multiple benefits — don’t kill them, breed them
"," Officials in Delhi wish to fell about 17,000 fully grown trees in some parts of the city to make space for building housing colonies. And to “pacify” people who object to this tree destruction, they say that for every tree that will be felled, they will plant 10 saplings. Interesting — the minister knows it; the National Building Construction Corporation (NBCC) knows it and we all known it — that this is a stupid answer. “What you lose today, I will make up” (20 years from now? and if the saplings survive?) And this is not just in Delhi. Government and city planners in several other states do the same. This attitude shows not just ignorance but arrogance, disregard for trees and their value. It is time planners wake up and understand the value — economic, ecological, health-related and sociological — that trees offer.
Value of a tree
Way back in 1979, Dr. T.M. Das of Calcutta University estimated that the monetary value of a tree, during a life span of 50 years, amounted to about $2,00,000 (at 1979 rates). This was based on the amount of oxygen it produces, the fruit or the biomass and the timber it offers when felled and so on. For every 1 gram that a tree accumulates as it grows, it generates about 2.66 grams of oxygen. Dr Nancy Beckham of Australia, in her paper, “Trees: finding their true value”, points out that “trees and plants silently carry out their daily routine years after years, stabilizing the soil, recycling nutrients, cooling the air, modifying wind turbulence, intercepting the rain, absorbing toxins, reducing fuel costs, neutralizing sewage, increasing property values, promoting tourism, encouraging recreation, reducing stress and improving personal health as well as providing food, medicine and accommodation for other living things”. (Link: <https://www.uow.edu.au/~sharonb/
STS300/valuing/price/
pricingarticles.html>).
The Department of Environmental Conservation of New York State, USA offers numbers in this connection (see <http://www.dec.ny.gov/lands/40243.html>), along with references to scientific papers which estimate these numbers. It points out that (1) healthy trees mean healthy people: 100 trees remove 53 tons of CO2 and 430 pounds of other air pollutants per year; (2) healthy trees mean healthy communities: tree-filled neighbourhoods lower the levels of domestic violence and are safer and move sociable; (3) healthy trees mean healthy environment — 100 mature trees catch about 1,40,000 gallons of rain water per year; (4) healthy trees mean home-owner savings — strategically placed trees save up to 56% of air conditioning costs; evergreens that block winter winds can save 3% on heating; (5) healthy trees means better business — in tree-lined commercial districts, shoppers report more frequent shopping and spend 12% more for goods, and (6) healthy trees means higher property values.
The minister and the NBCC officials are smart people and they surely know all these facts. Yet for them, a mature tree is “dead urban space” and clearing 17,000 trees means real estate for building houses, colonies and shopping malls in a city that is gasping for clean air. (Delhi Greens, an NGO, estimated in 2013 that a healthy tree is worth Rs. 24 lakh a year, just with respect to its oxygen producing capacity). And for them a sapling occupies (today) about a hundredth (or even less) space. But where will they plant the saplings — where the trees were? How will they survive if construction starts already? Clearly the officials’ attitude is: ‘well, we will be gone (transferred/ retired) and do not need to answer’. What Gurgaon was then, and is now, makes the point.
Admire trees, don’t axe them
In stark contrast to their cruel attitude towards trees stand the examples of Sunderlal Bahuguna’s “chipko” movement, Saalumarada Thimmakka of Karnataka who has planted 398 banyan trees — each representing her own child, and Majid Khan and the team of biologists and horticulturists who are offering “intensive care” (injecting insecticide mix in to the phloem of each branch) to a 700 years old “pillalamarri” banyan tree near Mahabubnagar, Telangana, spanning a 4–acre canopy , which is being eaten up by termites, and bringing it back to life. (See: https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/a-tree-in-intensive-care/article24241462.ece). Should it have been cut and the 4 acre space used as real estate? 
Obviously trees offer emotional, even spiritual solace. Indian history is replete with examples — Lord Buddha, Emperor Ashoka, and the Tamil King Pari Vallal who left his chariot near a plant to help it spread its branches.
Should not Delhi then think of building houses and colonies elsewhere in the suburbs, saving these 17,000 trees? Or if at all it has to do it in Delhi, think new thoughts, but without cutting the trees (or at best sacrificing the smallest possible number)? This impossible-sounding scheme offers challenges to architects. Indeed, high rise apartments have been built elsewhere, saving trees and even including them as part of the building. Some examples are seen in Italy, Turkey and Brazil. 
India has been blessed with creative architects, both Indian and foreign, who have built houses and campuses, totally in harmony with the surroundings. The Indian Institute of Architects has about 20,000 members, we have about 80 institutions that teach architecture. Why not throw a challenge to them to come up with the best plan, offer a handsome award to the most suited and creative one, and use it to build the colony?

Human population, roads reduce effectiveness of protected areas
"," Designated protected areas such as wildlife parks and sanctuaries are effective at preventing forest loss — except when there are roads or more populous areas nearby, find scientists. 
Loss of forests is a worry in most tropical countries including India which is home to the Western Ghats, one of the world’s major biodiversity hotspots. To assess trends of forest loss in the Ghats, a team including Meghna Agarwala from Ashoka University, analysed high-resolution Landsat satellite imagery from 2000 to 2016. The teamexamined whether the forest loss correlates with factors including protection status of an area (protected area PA, versus non-PA) and proximity to roads and towns. They collected biophysical (slope, elevation etc, which play a role in patterns of forest loss), demographic (human population densities from census data) and administrative (protection status of an area) data from multiple sources, incorporating this into their spatial analysis.
The results, published in Biological Conservation, show that forest loss — though confined to only small patches — is higher in wetter areas, higher altitudes and near rivers and lakes across 89,681 sqkm of forests in the Ghats. Protected areas were 30% less likely to lose forest than non-protected areas, especially when forests were closer to roads and towns. However, the advantage of protection declined by 32% when local population densities increased.
“Interestingly, we found that the benefits of protection can be modulated by how close a forest area lies to a road or how dense the surrounding human populations are,” writes co-lead author Meghna Krishnadas of Yale University, U.S., in an email to The Hindu. “In the case of roads and protection, we found that protection reduced forest loss, but the benefit of protection diminished if the forest patch was within 4 km of a road.”
However, the results varied when the team analysed two smaller landscapes in Karnataka, hinting that local factors are important mediators of forest loss patterns. This could include how locals use forests in their vicinity and working with communities could improve long-term forest conservation, adds Ms. Krishnadas. 0“Larger studies like these can help scientists explore local degradation near roads,” says scientist P. Jeganathan of the Nature Conservation Foundation who was not part of the study but has studied wildlife roadkills in the Ghats. “It would have been interesting to explore how other linear infrastructure — like powerlines or canals — also impact forest loss. Translating this into policy would be crucial,” he adds.

IGIB find ways to reduce TB’s tissue-damaging effects
"," It is generally believed that TB bacteria make the host cells accumulate triglyceride and become lipid-rich as bacteria prefer lipids for their nutrition. Now, using human macrophage cells researchers at the Institute of Genomic and Integrative Biology (CSIR-IGIB) have shown that when TB-infected macrophages undergo necrosis (where the cell ruptures when it dies) lipids and bacteria contained in the cells are released. The neighbouring cells — both healthy and TB-infected — take up the lipids thus leading to lipid accumulation.
“Our study brings a new facet to the way the field has been thinking about pathogenesis where it was believed that because the bacteria prefer lipids for their nutrition, they make the host cell become lipid-rich. Our work points to the relevance of the incident pathology — necrosis in a granuloma result in the development of lipid-rich foamy macrophages [presence of cells with large lipid-filled vacuoles],” says Dr. Sheetal Gandotra from the Cardio Respiratory Disease Biology Unit at IGIB and corresponding author of a paper published in the journal Frontiers in Immunology.
The ability to induce necrosis is peculiar to virulent TB bacteria. The avirulent Mycobacterium bovis strain used in BCG vaccine is unable to cause necrosis; it triggers a programmed cell death (apoptosis) instead. Like the BCG strain, TB mutants that lack the capacity to induce necrosis also lack the associated capacity to induce necrosis-induced triglyceride accumulation in neighbouring cells.
When macrophages encounter TB bacteria they mount an inflammatory response wherein certain factors are secreted to help recruit other cells of the immune system to kill the bacteria. “For the first time we reported that foamy macrophages showed more inflammatory response than normal macrophages,” says Dr. Neetika Jaisinghani from IGIB and first author of the paper. As a result of the inflammatory response more macrophages are recruited to the site of infection thus exposing them to infection.
“So it sets off a positive feed-forward loop such that the inflammatory response gets amplified,” says Dr. Gandotra.
To understand the role of excess lipids in host defence strategies, the researchers added uninfected necrotic cells to macrophages that were not infected with TB bacteria. Even these healthy macrophages stored lipids from the dying cells in the form of triglycerides. The macrophages were foamy but not infected. “These macrophages did not show any inflammation till such time they were infected with TB bacteria,” says Dr. Gandotra. 
Human blood monocyte-derived macrophages, too, showed increased inflammatory response when triglyceride accumulation was increased. Central to the storage of triglycerides in macrophages is the DGAT1 enzyme (diacylglycerol o-acyltransferase). When the DGAT1 gene is silenced in the macrophage cell lines, the macrophages’ ability to accumulate triglycerides is compromised.
“Our studies show that macrophages made to store triglyceride in response to necrosis are able to mount a higher level of the inflammatory response, and if we deplete the levels of the DGAT1 enzyme, the inflammatory response of these macrophages to infection is suppressed,” Dr. Gandotra says. “Inhibitors are available against this enzyme and we plan to undertake preclinical studies.”
While the ability of the host to inhibit TB infection might not be compromised, the tissue-damaging effects of inflammation may be reduced by inhibiting the ability of the macrophages to accumulate lipids. “The work brings out the importance of the role of host lipid metabolism in increasing inflammation by foamy cells during infection, thereby bringing metabolism into perspective as a potential target for TB therapy,” Dr. Gandotra says.
“Currently, all anti-TB drugs are antimicrobials and don’t help in improving the respiratory health of TB patients, which is compromised. We are hoping that our research may help in finding a promising target to reduce inflammation in TB patients,” says Dr. Jaisinghani.
The role of lipids in altering the immune state in non-infectious metabolic disorders such as obesity is well known. But this study for the very first time reports the role of triglyceride metabolism in altering the immune state during infection.

NASA prepares to extract data as Kepler runs very low on fuel
","Scientists at NASA are preparing to download the latest bit of data stored in its plant-hunting Kepler space telescope as the spacecraft is now running “very low” on fuel.
The US space agency has placed the spacecraft in a no-fuel-use safe mode to save the remaining fuel so that data extraction can be completed, NASA said on Friday.
On August 2, the Kepler team will command the spacecraft to awaken from its no-fuel-use state and manoeuvre the spacecraft to the correct orientation and downlink the data.
Once the data has been downloaded, the expectation is to start observations for the next campaign with any remaining fuel.
But as of now, returning the data back to Earth is the “highest priority” for the remaining fuel.
 
We've paused science observations for @NASAKepler to download recent science data after receiving an indication that the spacecraft is very low on fuel as expected. Our team is monitoring the fuel closely as we expect to run out in the next few months: https://t.co/rES0NHRsmP pic.twitter.com/kthrcEiwjb

Since May 12, Kepler has been on its 18th observation campaign, staring at a patch of sky towards the constellation of Cancer it previously studied in 2015.
The data from this second look will provide astronomers with an opportunity to confirm previous exoplanet candidates and discover new ones.
To bring the data home, the spacecraft must point its large antenna back to Earth and transmit the data during its allotted Deep Space Network time, which is scheduled in early August.
Until then, the spacecraft will remain stable and parked in a no-fuel-use safe mode.
If the manoeuvre and download are successful, the team will begin its 19th observation campaign on August 6 with the remaining fuel, NASA said, adding that it will provide an update after the scheduled download.
The US space agency has been monitoring the Kepler spacecraft closely for signs of low fuel for quite some time now, and expects it to run out of fuel in the next few months.
Launched in 2009, the Kepler mission is specifically designed to survey our region of the Milky Way galaxy to discover hundreds of Earth-size and smaller planets in or near the habitable zone and determine the fraction of the hundreds of billions of stars in our galaxy that might have such planets.
Among other findings, recently 24 new planet discoveries were made using data from the 10th observation campaign, adding to the spacecraft’s growing bounty of 2,650 confirmed planets.
The Kepler space telescope, which is now 94 million miles away from Earth, has survived many potential knock-outs during its nine years in flight, from mechanical failures to being blasted by cosmic rays.
In 2013, Kepler’s primary mission ended when a second reaction wheel broke, rendering it unable to hold its gaze steady at the original field of view.
The spacecraft was given a new lease on life by using the pressure of sunlight to maintain its pointing, like a kayak steering into the current.
Reborn as “K2,” this extended mission requires the spacecraft to shift its field of view to new portions of the sky roughly every three months in what scientists refer to as a “campaign.”
Initially, the Kepler team estimated that the K2 mission could conduct 10 campaigns with the remaining fuel.
It turns out scientists were overly conservative in their estimate. The mission has already completed 17 campaigns, and since May 12, Kepler has been on its 18th observation campaign.
But scientists now know that its life is coming to end very soon.
NASA in April launched another planet-hunting spacecraft, the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (Tess).
After the Kepler space telescope, Tess is the second spacecraft which will search for planets outside our solar system, including those that could support life.

Heart of the matter
"," The house of HyperX has been cranking out some excellent hardware of late. We’ve been particularly impressed by the Cloud line of gaming headphones the company produces, like the Cloud Revolver and Stinger, which produced great sound in addition to being some of the most comfortable headphones we’ve tested. Today, we have the HyperX Cloud Stinger Core in the house, and it’s time to see if it is cut from the same cloth as its peers. 
The Stinger Core is advertised as a headset for console gamers, with the packaging declaring its affiliation with PlayStation boldly. The headset itself, which features a plastic construction, comes with blue accents that further emphasise this relationship. 
The Core features a rather short cable, clearly meant to plug into a DualShock controller and keep things neat and tidy, and the cable features volume controls and a mic mute switch. The mic itself is attached to the left earcup, and while it can swivel, it is not the detachable kind. 
The Core, while decently comfortable, is a far cry from the rest of the Cloud line-up in terms of comfort. The rigid plastic construction and foam earcups press down rather hard on the ears and the crown of the headset also features only a small, thin cushion, making this the least comfortable headset in the line-up. The fact that they do not fold up in any way means portability is not their strong suit either. 
Sound, on the other hand, is quite good, and the Core reproduced most of the media we threw at it well. It provides a decent soundstage for music playback and we found it competent while gaming, picking up little environment details and isolating sound direction well.
All things considered, while we were a little disappointed with it on the comfort front, the Cloud Stinger Core’s redeeming factor is its price. Compared to even the regular Stinger and higher variants like the Revolver, the Core is priced at a very aggressive ₹3,000 (approximately), which makes some of these trade-offs acceptable. On the whole, it is a very competent package, though we do urge that you try and get your hands on one and try it on for size before investing in it.

Wandering around the web ","A true hero 
The world has been watching with bated breath for the rescue of a Thai football team of kids trapped in the Tham Luang Nang Non cave; the reason I have been refreshing Twitter all weekend. Now, the first group of boys has been expertly pulled to safety. Support for the rescue (let’s call it slacktivism) poured in from various corners of the web predictably. As Harsh Goenka tweeted, “The first time the entire world is cheering for the same football team. The resilience of the young boys, the bravery of the divers, the prayers from all corners — this mission reignites my faith in humanity.” Agreed.
But one thread on Twitter from user @yvonelim9 went particularly viral about the backstory of the 25-year-old assistant coach, Ekapol Chanthawong. The thread, having been shared and liked over 13,000 times, speaks of the orphaned boy who grew up wanting to be a monk and then proceeded to use football as a means for children to excel academically. For those raising an eyebrow at the legitimacy, the thread was taken from The Straits Times piece, in which the coach was described as the life-force for the team during this unimaginably tough time.




People like Chanthawong remind us to keep the good people around, especially when life and the Internet are teeming with some seriously questionable personalities.
Speaking of heroes 
Plant for the Planet is a global project worth getting your gardening hands dirty with. The organisation was started in 2007 by 9-year-old Felix Finkbeiner — who was inspired by Wangari Maathai, who planted 30 million trees in Africa in 30 years. He hopes for the world to have planted a trillion trees to save what we have left of our ecosystems.




And so far, Finkbeiner has observed 15,21,46,92,757 trees planted. I bring this up now because our world isn’t exactly thriving and young minds like those of Finkbeiner help secure a part of our future.

Apping up Amit
"," Amitraj is a typical Bengalurean entrepreneur. Amitraj is also fictional, and someone I have made up for this column by agglutinating the personalities of some half a dozen people I know running startups in Bengaluru. 
Amit is a name used by many South Indians, especially those active on social media, to poke gentle fun at the North Indian stereotype of someone clueless about the non-Hindi environment he lives in. But do not let the Amit in the name of my made-up entrepreneur fool you. Amitraj is the best sort of Bengalurean entrepreneur there is. He can converse in half a dozen tongues. And because he can, he is constantly engaging in conversations with everyone he meets in the course of his daily life in Bengaluru.
His day sometimes starts with realising that he has run out of toothpaste. But hey, he is a startup guy. He immediately opens an app that will run tasks for him such as buying a tube of toothpaste at a kirana store nearby and then schlepping it to his doorstep. Amitraj is waiting eagerly. The eagerness is as much for the toothpaste as it is for engaging in small talk with the delivery guy who will bring the toothpaste to him. When he comes, Amitraj asks him about how the job is, what he likes about the job, what he does not. He tut-tuts along with the delivery guy when he cribs about how people just use him these days to get booze delivered and not important things like toothpaste. He sends the delivery guy off with a generous tip and much goodwill.
Shiny-toothed, and otherwise freshened up too, Amitraj is ready to head to his workplace, a co-working space, his sixth in as many months. This is because he wants to try them all out before he decides where he will work out of for a longer term. He tries to make ‘I change my workspace as often as I change my underwear’ his trademark joke, but it only draws him dirty looks and he cannot understand why.
Amitraj fires up the latest carpooling app, where he knows there is someone who will take him halfway towards his office, and confirms his ride. He knows that the car driver he is pooling with only sticks to the main roads and tends to get stuck in traffic jams that could have been easily avoided, but he does not mind. He likes it even, for it allows him longer conversations with the driver, and more importantly, the constantly changing set of others who hop on to the car pool. Every day, thrilled with a new nugget of information or lived experience that he has added to his collection, he gets off the car, and opens a bike taxi app with his office as the destination.
Presently, pleasantly even, his motorcycle pilot reaches him. Amitraj hops on, and tells him about the destination. And by the time the bike is on its way, somehow finds himself deep in conversation with the bike pilot. Amitraj is reluctant to end it, after all it has only been a dozen minutes of meaningful talk, but the bike has reached his office, the fancy co-working space.
Amitraj is there for the next twelve hours or more. Often more. But in that time, he has ordered food thrice. Once each from the three startups trying to win the food delivery opportunity. And two out of three times he has conversations with the chap bringing in the food. He could not do so the third time for he was on the phone with someone who was interested in buying a tiny piece of furniture that he put up for sale, more as an experiment, on the portal of a startup that allows people to sell used goods.
Amitraj works hard at his startup idea. Yet, the startup hasn’t made even the tiniest dent in the market it is operating in. Yet. But if I were a betting man (or as they like to call them these days, a venture capitalist), I will definitely put my money on Amitraj making it big.

Have you played these games before? "," What if we told you that a lawyer game or one where you process papers can be exciting? Welcome, intrepid reader, to the road that is not oft tread in video gaming. Where unusual ideas take you to brave, new territory. Here’s a list of games that are unlike any you’ve played before.
Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney series
A legend in gaming, the Phoenix Wright Ace case files are pure gaming caviar. Spanning several games, each one tells the story of the rise of an attorney Phoenix Wright, as he fights against all odds to win his cases. With a cast of colourful characters as well as worthy opponents, the cases are deviously planned with an excellent overarching story. The original trilogy is available on iOS and Android, as well as Ace Attorney – Dual Destinies. There is a latest game out — Spirit of Justice — but it’s only on the Nintendo 3DS for now. There’s even a crossover with Professor Layton vs Phoenix Wright, which combines two characters from two very unusual series.




Undertale
While using the same familiar garb of a classic 16-bit era top-down role-playing game format, Undertale is unusual and exciting because of its excellent characters, writing that will make you laugh in delight and monsters that will make you squeal in delight. Aping games from Dragon Quest to Final Fantasy, Undertale is just one of a kind. Now also available on Nintendo Switch.
Might & Magic: Clash of Heroes
You’ve seen this before — a classic tale of heroes versus monsters. Except this has a twist in the battle system. Offering a very familiar Tetris slash Candy Crush sort of mechanic, where you match up the monsters to send waves of them against the enemy to crush their defences. A very unusual game that tells a superb story that seems to slip into obscurity. Perfect if you want a puzzle game with more oomph in it.
Danganronpa series
Leaning deep towards the darker side of Japanese storytelling, Danganronpa is a visual novel that’s in the vein of Phoenix Wright. Except that you’re a student that’s been locked in a school with other students and an evil bear. The only way one can escape is to murder and get away with it — making it an investigation and courtroom-style drama. That pairs some intense storytelling, typography and design with some truly mad characters. Also worth exploring are the somewhat similar Zero Escape: The Nonary Games, which sort of deal with the same ‘escape a hopeless situation’ through a puzzles theme.




Gone Home
A first-person shooter, where you don’t shoot at all. Gone Home is a story exploration game that’s in first person, where you play a character coming home and finding traces of what happened to her family. A magic realist tale that spans decades across a family tree, as you’re drawn into the rabbit hole of stories as to how the denizens of this deserted house lived and died.




Dark Souls
The game that kickstarted the sub-genre ‘Masocore’ is exciting on many levels. With masochistic levels of difficulty, this game will twist your perception of game difficulty. The more it punishes you, the more you come back to defeat it. Spawning several sequels as well as other ‘Masocore’ games like Nioh and Bloodborne. Yet, what it does dazzle in is a deep medieval combat system and a grisly, magical and beautiful story you have to peel like an onion, complete with tears.
Papers, Please
The most unusual of the lot, this game has you playing a border checkpoint agent in some godforsaken country. The objective is to let the right people in, except how do you know who the right people are. Sometimes the innocent and those seeking help for real look like terrorists, while the real threats look like they couldn’t hurt a fly. A masterful game that keeps flipping the proverbial table so many times, your head will spin.




This War of Mine
In a world that’s dangerously close to careening towards a war, this is an important game you need to play. Where many games focus on the glory of a conflict, This War of Mine is a survival game that lets you play as civilians just trying to get by, while all hell breaks loose around you. If you thought this game was heart wrenching, The Little Ones downloadable content will completely tear it away — focusing on a bunch of children as they survive.

60% of Indian computers vulnerable
","India must go the Japanese way if it wishes to prevent cyber attacks on the country’s massive IT infrastructure, says Avast Antivirus chief technical officer and executive vice-president Ondrej Vlcek.
“Japan brought in a stringent regulatory mechanism last year to put its IT infrastructure under a protective shield. India can also follow that example considering the growing internet penetration in the country,” Mr. Vleck told The Hindu on the sidelines of RISE 2018, Asia’s largest technology conference which got underway here on Tuesday.
He said that over 60% of the personal computers in India were vulnerable to cyber crimes. As many as 18% of routers, 17% phones, 14% printers, 25% network associated storages, 4% security cameras and 2% media boxes too were vulnerable to threats in India. In comparison, only 9% of personal computers, 3% phones, 25% of routers, 16% of printers and 23% of security cameras in Japan were under threat.
The situation was not rosy in Hong Kong either, where about 45% of personal computers were vulnerable to cyber attacks. The percentage for China, the U.S. and Singapore were 39%, 38% and 33% respectively, he said.
“Already most countries are taking precautionary steps specially when it comes to hardware devices. But government-enabled regulations can prevent cyber crimes with the growth of Internet of Things (IoT),” he said. 
“Your smart home is only as secure as its weakest link. Personal data leakage and ransomware attacks lead to IoT botnets and physical security threats,” he said.
Incidentally, Artificial Intelligence (AI) will play a key role in IoT safety. In future, AI will identify malicious and legitimate behaviour, Mr. Vleck said.

Pigment in Goa mushroom may help fight cancer
","The mycological laboratory of the Department of Botany, Goa University on Wednesday reported the discovery of a new pigment from local wild mushrooms.
“We are proud to report a new suphur-rich melanin biopigment of immense bioindustrial, biomedical (anti-cancer, anti-tumour) and biotechnological potential from local Roen alamis (wild variety of Goan mushrooms that grows on termite hills) or Termitomyces species,” said Dr. Nandakumar Kamat, Assistant Professor of Botany, department of Goa University here on Wednesday.
“Our paper was published on July 9 in Mycology: International Journal Of Fungal Biology affiliated to Mycological Society of China, and published by Taylor and Francis, U.S.. This discovery shows the chemical nature of the brown or black colour that you see in these wild edible mushrooms,” explained Dr. Kamat, with more than two decades of research experience on mushrooms.
Dr. Kamat said that his Ph.D student, Rosy de Souza, who is a national scholar under DST INSPIRE, cracked the problem in three years, which had eluded scientific community from 40 countries for the past 100 years. 
“More than 50 teams are working on these mushrooms, globally, but we in Goa got the lead now. People of Goa who consume these mushrooms are actually eating sulphur-rich melanin. We declare it as world’s first sulphur-rich edible melanin. Its structure is similar to black pigment found in human hair,” said an excited Dr. Kamat. 
He said that the Chinese editors of their paper have advised them to continue their research on this pigment.

Partial solar eclipse visible in Australia, New Zealand "," The year's second solar eclipse occurred on July 13, 2018. The partial eclipse was seen only in parts of Australia and New Zealand as it took place almost entirely over open waters of Antartica. 
This partial eclipse began at 7:18 IST on July 13, reached its maximum magnitude of 0.3367 at 8:31 IST and ended at 09:43 IST. 
Solar eclipse is a natural phenomenon that occurs when the moon comes in between the sun and the earth. A partial eclipse occurs when the three celestial bodies are not exactly on the same plane. 
It is not advisable to look at the sun during the solar eclipse with naked eyes since the sunlight is not totally cut during the time. Only eclipse glasses that have a certification with ""ISO 12312-2 international standard"" are safe for use, according to NASA. Other options are number 14 welder's glass, or making a pinhole projector that allows a user to project the image of the sun on paper or cardboard.
The first solar eclipse of the year was observed on February 15, largely visible in South American nations.
The next solar eclipse, also a partial one, will be on August 11 and could be seen in parts of North America, Russia, eastern Europe, north and West Asia, and the Arctic region.
Skygazers in India will, however, get to watch the lunar eclipse on July 27, which is said to be the longest one of the century. The total lunar eclipse would last for one hour and 43 minutes while partial eclipses, which would precede and follow the total eclipse, would last more than an hour.

Space tourism may take-off in 2019
","The two companies leading the pack in the pursuit of space tourism say they are just months away from their first out-of-this-world passenger flights — though neither has set a firm date.
Virgin Galactic, founded by British billionaire Richard Branson, and Blue Origin, by Amazon creator Jeff Bezos, are racing to be the first to finish their tests — with both companies using radically different technology. Neither Virgin nor Blue Origin’s passengers will find themselves orbiting the Earth: instead, their weightless experience will last just minutes. It’s an offering far different from the first space tourists, who travelled to the International Space Station (ISS) in the 2000s.
Virgin Galacticcan take six passengers and two pilots aboard its SpaceShipTwo, VSS Unity. 
Mr. Branson in May said that he hoped to himself be one of the first passengers in the next 12 months. About 650 people make up the rest of the waiting list, the company said.
Blue Origin, meanwhile, has developed a system closer to the traditional rocket: the New Shepard. Six passengers take their place in a “capsule” fixed to the rocket. After launching, it detaches and continues its trajectory toward the sky. During an April 29 test, the capsule made it to 66 miles. 
Company officials were recently quoted as saying the first tests with Blue Origin astronauts would take place “at the end of this year.”

A device that attempts to plug pollution at source
"," Deadly carbon emissions need to be challenged with not just activism, but also innovation. Chakr Shield is a device that plugs pollution at source. It converts particulate matter emitted from diesel generators into non-toxic ink that can be used for sketching, textile and paper printing. While it was developed last year by Delhi-based startup Chakr Innovation, a hardware company working towards creating a sustainable environment, it is now getting into significant partnerships.
In Bengaluru, the technology giant Dell announced its partnership with Chakr Innovation, with an interesting line-up of events. Tahera Peeran showcased her khadi collection, hand-painted with POINK (Pollution into Ink), while artist N Ponnappa did a live cartooning session. “We have been using Chakr Shield since December 2017, and Dell has shipped 1,50,000 boxes with labels and packaging using POINK. It aligns with our philosophy of using technology for the benefit of society and giving back to nature,” said Rajeev Kapoor, India Vice President, Dell.
Chakr Shield is a retrofit which can be added to any diesel genset with a capacity ranging from 15 kVA to 2,000 kVA. It captures over 90% of the particulate matter emissions at source, with no impact on the genset. This is soot, or carbon black, which then goes through several processes, where carcinogens and heavy metals are removed. The result is a purified carbon-based pigment that is further processed into ink.
Arpit Dhupar, Kushagra Srivastava and Prateek Sachan, engineers from IIT Delhi, founded the company in 2016, and created Chakr Shield the same year. Currently at work in Dell India’s manufacturing units across India, Dell now intends to use it at all their units across the globe.
The company has been awarded for its innovation by the Department of Science and Technology, Government of India and FICCI, and has received a grant from Indian Oil for new technology development.
“We haven’t commercialised POINK yet, but have been partnering with companies. As of now, Dell consumes 600-800 litres of ink per month. It’s not possible to scale up the production without tie-ups, so we are exploring these with Mahindra, Infosys and Godrej. Tata group is already using our ink in their watches and jewellery,” says Akhilesh Ahirwal, DGM, Corporate Sales & Strategy, Chakr Innovation. The company is now moving on to capturing emissions from marine engines. Ponnappa, while drawing tongue-in-cheek representations of the harmful effects of diesel emissions, using POINK, said, “It can be diluted with water and the ink stays the same even after drying. It is as black as black can be.” He did wish it was sold commercially, so artists had access to it, or better still, be available in markers.
Dark days
A study by the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), says levels of dangerous particulate matter (PM 2.5 and PM10), rise by 30% to 100% in areas where diesel generators are operated. Last month, Gurugram recorded a significant increase in pollution levels, owing to the use of diesel gensets.

Seven free-to-play games that are worth your time
"," The very words ‘Free to Play’ in the context of video games is not necessarily a good thing. While everyone loves freebies, usually these games come with a lot of micro transaction baggage. In many cases, there are games that start out promising and end up becoming hives of toxic players and empty rooms. However, with innovative concepts unfettered by micro transactions and a strong focus on growing a community, there are some games that are really worth your time. Which is important, especially when these games demand the most important currency of all, time.




Warframe
This popular and innovative third person shooter/brawler has been around for a while. Warframe has recently got renewed popularity with a slew of new updates as well as an eventual release on Nintendo Switch. You play an ancient warrior called a Tenno, clad in an armour called Warframes, you are recently activated to save the universe from The Grineer. With shades of Destiny in it's sci-fi world, you and your friends can play through the storyline in Player vs Environment battles or take the fight to other players in the Conclave. 
Asphalt 9: Legends
The much awaited followup to the most popular racer on mobile and tablets is here. Though. Asphalt 9 is still in closed beta, you can try a few VPN tricks to get it working in India. The visceral speed, intensity and style of the original is back and amped up, Asphalt 9 brings power ups that are a lot like 2010's Blur and Mario Kart. Which grants you speed and other abilities. What we did notice too that Asphalt 9 borrows the whole action movie style collapsing environments factor from a fun game called Split:Screen. Making a fun frankenracing game of sorts that is absolutely fun. Also, the game looks amazing, especially those particle effects when you pick up powerups.




Brawlhalla
No one expected a fighting game from the house of Nintendo to be as much fun as Smash Bros. was. So much so that's it's become an e-sport with a strong following. Brawlhalla is a free to play Smash Bros. clone that's much more than just a clone. With retro looking pixel graphic background and handdrawn characters that fly around the screen hacking and slashing. The premise is simple, knock the other player off the stage.

Creating a visual map of monsoons and bird migrations
"," The pied cuckoo, sometimes called the rain bird, is a migrant, and much like migrants across the world, is seen as having mystical qualities. Every year, in a wide curve, the pied cuckoo follows the south-westerly winds that blow in across the Indian Ocean, leaving Africa for the Indian subcontinent. If you believe folklore, the bird brings the rains. 
Of course, we don’t care to any more, because, “We have systematically been educated out of our connections with nature,” says M D Madhusudan, Scientist and Co-founder at the Nature Conservation Foundation (NCF), a non-profit based out of Mysuru. 
Madhusudan himself is a bit of a storyteller, who talks of Kalidas’ Meghdoota, which tells of the long wait for the rain by everyone from the black-and-white bird to the poet with a pitcher. The scientist combines this with a recent interest in how data can be represented visually to communicate complex concepts to the layperson. He says he’s simply following through on an effort first initiated by his colleague, Dr Suhel Quader, in 2011.
The human connect
Legends, songs, parables, have all told of the migration of the pied cuckoo, some from within south India, some from Africa. But tracking the movement of birds is not easy. “If a single scientist were to track a bird species like the pied cuckoo across hundreds of thousands of square kilometres and over many years, can you imagine the number of people that would have to be employed to gather such data,” he asks. Instead, scientists have partnered with thousands of enthusiastic birdwatchers across the country to form a citizen-science network. Not only does such collaboration yield insights into the distribution and abundance of birds, it also helps in understanding large-scale phenomena, such as patterns of bird migration. “It is only with the data collected by thousands of citizen birdwatchers over many years, that such a visualisation on a continental scale is even possible.”


All you need to track birds is a pair of binoculars and a smartphone, with the eBird app. You get on a platform, provided in this case by The Cornell Lab of Ornithology, Cornell University, and start recording. This open-access global citizen-science project enables you to see your own data, plus country-wide and worldwide data, of all birds. You can look at hotspots and even donate to the cause. If you look for the pied cuckoo, you’ll see that its sightings in Delhi, for instance, peak in July and September. “When large numbers of people participate in such an effort regularly, it becomes possible even to track the timing and progress of bird migration,” he says.
The tech connect
Allison Lieber, Program Manager, Google Earth Outreach says that “Many natural phenomena and events remain understood only to people in specific regions, but with the interactive map stories published in Earth’s Voyager feature, anyone around the world can learn about the implications of such events.” It can be used by anyone from armchair travellers to educators and students who want to learn more about the world, but it is also useful for NGOs and journalists. 
Google Earth Engine is a planetary-scale remote-sensing analyses platform. In simple terms: “It is a huge archive of public data, co-located with powerful computing infrastructure, that can run complex algorithms efficiently on very large data sets just using the browser on your computer. Scientists today can access and analyse data without necessarily having to download a single file,” says Madhusudan. Put poetically, by Lieber, it is “a visualization and storytelling platform built to inspire curious minds to explore, learn and care about our vast, fragile planet.” 




The data of interest for the pied cuckoo project used 37 years of rainfall data from the Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station (CHIRPS) dataset from the University of California, Santa Barbara. The data is represented as an image for each day of the year, with each pixel in the image storing a value for the amount of rainfall that has fallen on a certain region on earth on a given day. Google Earth Engine is then able to perform computations on these values. So, for a given place, you can analyse 37 years of daily rainfall data and boil it down to an average value for each day of the year.




Madhusudan analysed the two data sets — of the monsoon, and of the pied cuckoo distribution. “The resulting map has two layers: the ‘blue’ layer of the monsoon leverages satellite technology and the formidable computing capabilities of Google Earth Engine, whereas the ‘red’ layer, depicting the pied cuckoo distribution comes from far humbler sources — thousands of birdwatchers around the country,” he says. 
So does the movement of the pied cuckoo coincide with the monsoon? The data speaks for itself. The answer is yes. What is it about the pied cuckoo though? Much like a migrant, it builds bridges — to a deeper understanding of life beyond ourselves, and yet, connected with us.

Google Doodle celebrates Georges Lemaitre, the founder of the Big Bang theory
","On Tuesday, Google celebrated the 124th birth anniversary of Belgian astronomer Georges Lemaitre with a doodle. Lemaitre is credited with what is popularly known as the Big Bang Theory, which says that the universe originated from a single atom, which he referred to as the Cosmic Egg. He is also believed to be the first to have come up with the theory that the universe is expanding.
Born in 1894, he served in the Belgian army during the First World War. He went on to study physics and mathematics and also trained to become a priest. He studied physics and astronomy in some of the world's most prestigious institutions, including University of Cambridge, Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. 
In 1927, he published the paper which theorised – one that was derived from General Relativity – that the universe is expanding. This theory was substantiated by Edwin Hubble two years later, and it would soon be known as Hubble's Law. 
Albert Einstein had initially rejected Lemaitre's theory, but he later changed his mind. Hubble furthered research on the theory of the Big Bang, and it led to a new branch of science known as relative cosmology.
In 1934, Lemaître received the Francqui Prize, the highest Belgian scientific distinction -- one of the proposers being Einstein. In 1953, he was given the inaugural Eddington Medal awarded by the Royal Astronomical Society. He died in 1966, shortly after having learned of the discovery of cosmic microwave background radiation.
The doodle website depicts Lemaitre “within the constantly expanding universe that he first envisioned, surrounded by galaxies expanding outward just as he said they would.”

In China, robots deliver snacks at home ","Along a quiet residential street in Beijing, a yellow and black cube about the size of a small washing machine trundles leisurely to its destination.
This “little yellow horse” is an autonomous delivery robot, ferrying daily essentials like drinks, fruit and snacks from the local store to the residents of the “Kafka” compound in the Chinese capital.
Equipped with a GPS system, cameras and radar, the robots are seen by their creator as the future of logistics in China. The company estimates that eventually one billion packages will be delivered every day.
At a less than overwhelming pace of 3 km per hour — a slow human walk — the robot has room for improvement, said one customer as she removed a packet of nuts from its bowels. “The weak point is that it cannot deliver directly to the door like a human,” said the customer, who does not live on the ground floor. “But it’s still quite practical. The robot delivers relatively quickly,” she said.
The robot takes advantage of Chinese consumers’ love of cashless payments and smartphone shopping. China is the world’s biggest online shopping market with more than half of its population making at least one smartphone purchase per month, according to professional services firm PricewaterhouseCoopers. This compares to 14% in the rest of the world.
The robots have four cameras that scan the world around them and a laser tele-detection system allowing them to avoid obstacles.

Nokia X5 launched in China: here’s the full specs, and price
"," Nokia launched the highly anticipated Nokia X5 in China on Wednesday. The 5.8-inch phone, which comes with Android Oreo, was sold out within two hours of its launch, according to the company’s Weibo account. 
The X5, with its face recognition and intelligent AI features, is priced at ¥999 (approx. Rs. 10186) for the 3GB RAM/32GB ROM. The phone also comes in a 4GB RAM/64 GB ROM version. 
Display and camera
The phone is encased in a double-sided glass body with an integrated polycarbonate frame. It is available in three colours - -Extreme Night Black, Glacier White and Baltic Sea Blue. The 5.86 inch phone has a 19:9 HD screen ratio, but it also has a notch at its top, reminiscent of the iPhone X. The Nokia X6 was the first Nokia phone to feature the notch
The display has a resolution of 1520×720 and has a 2.5D glass. The phone also features a 13 megapixel + 5 megapixel dual camera set up in the rear, with f/2.0 aperture, phase detection autofocus and an LED flash. The front is equipped with an 8 megapixel camera. 
The camera has several built-in features like the AI beauty blur -- the application of intelligent 3D blur algorithm -- smart portrait lighting, blurred pictures, application of depth of field among others. 
Tech specs
The X5 is powered by a MediaTek Helio P60 chipset. The 3,060 mAh battery, which is a built-in type, does not support fast charging, according to Tech Radar. It also has the standard 3.5 mm audio jack and the USB Type-C port. 
The specs, according to the Nokia website, give you 11 hours of video playback on 4G networks, 27 hours screen time on standby and a call duration of 17.5 hours. 
‘Intelligent’ features
The phone supports screen-off fingerprint payment, which lets users open up apps with their fingerprint even if the screen is off, making “fingerprint payment in the lock screen state more convenient and faster”. The phone also has features like intelligent screen recognition, double-finger long-press on the screen that lets you break down articles and conversations into easy-to-select, copy, and search-for words. 
Since the phone comes with the pure Android, it can be upgraded to the not-yet-released Android P.
The company launched the Nokia X6 in China earlier this year and reports say that it could be launched in India somewhere around August or September. The India launch date for the new X5 however, is unclear. Media reports also say that both phones could be marketed as Nokia 5.1 Plus and Nokia 6.1 Plus outside China.

NASA to launch probe into sun’s scorching atmosphere
","NASA is preparing to send a probe closer to the sun, enduring wicked heat while zooming through the solar corona to study this outermost part of the stellar atmosphere that gives rise to the solar wind.
The Parker Solar Probe, a robotic spacecraft the size of a small car, is slated to launch from Cape Canaveral in Florida, with August 6 targeted as the launch date for the planned seven-year mission. It is set to fly into the sun’s corona within 3.8 million miles from the solar surface, seven times closer than any other spacecraft.
“To send a probe where you haven’t been before is ambitious. To send it into such brutal conditions is highly ambitious,” Nicola Fox, a project scientist from the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, told a news conference on Friday.
The previous closest pass to the sun was by a probe called Helios 2, which in 1976 came within 43 million km.
The distance of the earth from the sun is approximately 149.6 million km.
Importance of study
The corona gives rise to the solar wind, a continuous flow of charged particles that permeates the solar system. Unpredictable solar winds cause disturbances in our planet’s magnetic field and can play havoc with communications technology on the earth. NASA hopes the findings will enable scientists to forecast changes in the earth’s space environment.
“It’s of fundamental importance for us to be able to predict this space weather, much like we predict weather here on the earth,” said Alex Young, a solar scientist at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland. 
“In the most extreme cases of these space weather events, it can actually affect our power grids on the earth.” The project, with a $1.5 billion price tag, is the first major mission under NASA’s Living With a Star programme.
The probe is set to use seven Venus flybys over nearly seven years to steadily reduce its orbit around the sun, using instruments designed to image the solar wind and study electric and magnetic fields, coronal plasma and energetic particles. NASA aims to collect data about the inner workings of the highly magnetized corona.
The probe, named after American solar astrophysicist Eugene Newman Parker, will have to survive difficult heat and radiation conditions. 
It has been outfitted with a heat shield designed to keep its instruments at a tolerable 29 degrees Celsius even as the spacecraft faces temperatures reaching nearly 21,370 degrees Celsius at its closest pass.

Mouse brain allows neuronal patchwork to succeed
"," Brain tissue can incur damage due to degeneration or injury, and one way to repair this is to transplant neurons which will merge with the surrounding tissue and connect with the other neurons in the neighbourhood to make up for the damage. A study carried out by an international collaboration determines the conditions under which neurons implanted in the brain of mice can successfully integrate with the surrounding tissue.
The researchers implanted newly born neurons, taken from the cerebral cortex of mouse embryos into brains of other newborn mice. The cerebral cortex is the region responsible for higher-level functions such as voluntary control of movement and cognition. These embryonic neurons are normally capable of maturing into adult neurons that form long distance connections between parts of the brain. “We optimized the method of transplantation and limited the number of cells that we injected into a recipient brain so that we can analyze these cells individually at a later stage,” Thomas Wuttke, first author of the paper published in Nature Neuroscience says in an email.
The transplanted neurons were labelled with a fluorescent protein (eGFP) which is derived from a species of jellyfish. “Due to labeling, we were able to visualize the transplanted neurons within the brains of the recipient pups and distinguish them from nearby recipient-derived neurons,” says Dr Wuttke.
Experiments showed that the transplanted neurons could form appropriate connections within the brains of the recipient mouse pups when analysed at the level of single cells. “This suggests that by transplanting appropriate types of immature neurons we can potentially reconstruct a neuronal circuitry, at least in the context of a newborn animal,” he adds.
Earlier, pioneering work had shown that neurons implanted in the brain could take root there and also send out long axons (wire-like extensions that help transmit signals) and connect to nearby neurons. However, those experiments were done with bulk transplantation of large numbers of neurons. “Bulk cell experiments are not appropriate for looking at transplanted neurons on a cell-by-cell basis to determine if they mature as required and form correct connections,” says Hari Padmanabhan, co-author of the paper, who is with the Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology, Harvard University.
“This has important implications when we consider transplanting new neurons for correcting diseases caused by neuronal loss that happens either through degeneration or via injury,” he explains.
“We reported, for the first time, that transplanted immature but developmentally ‘primed’ neurons of specific and distinct projection neuron subtypes can integrate cellularly and positionally into postnatal cortex; maintain remarkable fidelity of differentiation and maturation, establish subtype-specific and appropriate long-distance connectivity; and bi-directionally integrate electrophysiologically into local and long-distance circuitry,” says Jeffrey Macklis of harvard University who led the study.

IISc researchers find cholesterol helps bacterial toxins kill cells "," Researchers at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bengaluru, have found that cholesterol present in cell membrane plays a crucial role in stabilising and binding together the pore-forming toxin cytolysin A. The pore-forming toxins form the largest class of bacterial proteins causing virulence that kills human cells. The cytolysin A toxin is secreted by E. coli, Shigella and Salmonella.
The toxin secreted by E. coli bacteria is water-soluble and binds to the cell membrane. The binding of the water-soluble toxin to the cell membrane does not depend on cholesterol present in the membrane surface. In fact, the binding drops in cholesterol-containing membranes. “Binding is only a part of the pore forming process and cholesterol has no role to play,” says Dr. Rahul Roy from the Department of Chemical Engineering at IISc who led the team. 
Toxin movements
Once the toxin gets bound to the cell membrane, it does not stay in one place. Instead, it keeps moving around the cell membrane surface. Using a powerful microscope that allows them to look at single molecules tagged with a fluorescent tag, the researchers could actually see the toxin proteins moving around. 
Unlike the usually observed Brownian movement, these proteins tend to move around fast and then slow down before picking up speed and moving fast again. This happens even when no cholesterol is present. The structure capable of puncturing the cell membrane is supposed to slow down the protein movement. So this suggested that the structure of the bound protein is similar to the water-soluble protein and different from the structure that pierces the cell membrane. 
Cholesterol interaction
In the presence of cholesterol, the protein stops moving quickly. “Using molecular dynamic simulations, we found cholesterol interacting with the protein just as we suspected. The interaction was with the region on the protein that is responsible for forming the pore,” says Dr. Roy. 
Binding to cholesterol per se does not stop the motion of the protein. But on binding to cholesterol, the structure of the protein undergoes a change resulting in slowing down of the motion. 
The change in the speed of motion happens even in the absence of cholesterol due to the change in structure of the protein. But in the absence of cholesterol, the protein is unable to maintain the structure required for pore formation. 
“The structure of the toxin is stabilised in the presence of cholesterol and that is essential for pore formation,” says Pradeep Sathyanarayana from the Centre for BioSystems Science and Engineering at IISc and first author of a paper published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. “This is a clever strategy by the bacteria to use the toxin to specifically target only human/animal cells while the bacteria themselves are protected from the toxicity since cholesterol is absent in bacterial membranes.” 
To be able to rupture the cell membrane, the proteins bound to cholesterol have to come together to form a ring-like structure comprising 12 molecules. The coming together of the molecules to form the ring-like structure is also enhanced in the presence of cholesterol.
“Computer simulations showed that when two pore-forming protein molecules come together there is a small pocket where the cholesterol goes and interacts with the proteins. So cholesterol provides additional support to hold the two molecules together,” says Dr. Roy. 
Studies by other groups have shown that cancer cells in mice can be reduced dramatically by using cytolysin A toxin. 
“Based on our study, we can work on making the toxin target only the cancer cells. We can also use cholesterol-like molecules to prevent the toxin protein from changing its structure thereby prevent cell destruction,” says Dr. Roy.

IISER Pune uses nanovesicles to improve cancer drug delivery
"," By encapsulating the poorly water-soluble anticancer drug Alisertib in polysaccharide nano-sized balls or vesicles, researchers at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) Pune have been able to increase its uptake by breast cancer cells and achieve greater ability to restrict cancer cell growth. Better uptake of the drug when encapsulated meant lower concentration (0.02 microM) of the drug was sufficient to restrict cancer growth significantly better than the free drug.
The study, which was started about six years ago, gains importance as the drug by targeting AU`RKA now selectively inhibits RalA protein thereby disrupting cancer cells’ ability to grow without anchorage (anchorage independent growth). Anchorage independence in tumors is what allows cells to spread and grow at new sites in the body — metastasis.
Target protein
Since producing inhibitors against RalA protein is challenging and the existing inhibitor is not specific (targets both RalA and RalB), the researchers chose to target Aurora Kinase A (AURKA) instead. Aberrant AURKA activity has been implicated in cancer formation, and its inhibition could potentiate the effect of chemotherapies. When AURKA is silenced, RalA protein, which is present downstream, gets automatically (and selectively) inhibited.
The researchers embedded breast cancer cells in 3D gels (collagen or agarose) and incubated them with nanovesicles containing the drug and a florescent dye. In 15 days the breast cancer cells grew into a colony in the 3D gel. About 75% of the encapsulated drug was retained in the nanovesicle and carried into cancer cells during the 15-day period.
“While the free drug did not inhibit the colony forming ability of cancer cells, the number of colonies was significantly reduced in the presence of nanovesicles loaded with the drug,” says Prof. Nagaraj Balasubramanian from the Department of Biology who led the team along with Prof. Manickam Jayakannan from the Department of Chemistry, IISER Pune.
The encapsulated drug produced 94% inhibition of the target AURKA leading to 25% inhibition of RalA; the drug did not affect RalB. As a result, there was 38% inhibition of anchorage independent growth of cancer cells.
In comparison, at 50%, the Ral inhibitor achieved greater inhibition of RalA than the encapsulated drug but the inhibition was not specific — RalB was inhibited by 64%. The inhibition of anchorage independent growth was only 33%.
“What was interesting is that besides being specific to RalA, the encapsulated drug achieved greater inhibition of anchorage independent growth than the Ral inhibitor. This despite the Ral inhibitor achieving double the inhibition of RalA than the encapsulated drug,” says Prof. Balasubramanian. 
“So the Alisertib drug did better than the existing Ral inhibitor and led to better inhibition of anchorage independent growth. That’s the most striking observation of the study,” he says. The results were published in the journal Molecular Pharmaceutics.
For this study, the nanovesicles were encapsulated with only one drug (Alisertib) in the hydrophobic envelop while a fluroscent dye was loaded in the hydrophilic core. But the 2014 study (published in the journal Nanoscale) by the team showed that loading the nanovesicles with two drugs enhances the therapeutic efficacies against cancer cells.
Hydrophobic and hydrophilic anticancer drugs loaded in the envelop and core of the nanovesicle respectively performed better than free drugs and synergistically killed breast and colon cancer cells. The proof-of-concept study was published in 2012 in Biomacromolecules.
“We are aiming to start animal studies in mice to study how well the drug contained in nanovesicles is able to inhibit breast cancer tumours. We are also using this drug loaded in nanovesicle to inhibit and study the role of AURKA and RalA in normal and cancer cells. So it also becomes a tool to understand the role of these proteins in cells,” he says. 
Fabricating nanovesicles
“To make the nanovesicles self-assemble, we undertook some modifications to the dextran polysaccharide using a molecule from cashew nut shell extract,” says Prof. Jayakannan. “Since both are from bio-based nanosystems, the nanovesicles are not toxic to cells, and possibly human, and are biodegradable.”
Prof. Jayakannan and his team started working on making the nanovesicles self-assemble way back in 2008 and in 2012 they succeeded once they knew the structure that is required to make the nanovesicle with modification.
“The nanovesicle is bilayered and is held together to form a stable vesicle through hydrophilic-hydrophobic interactions,” Prof. Jayakannan says. Since the nanovesicles are about 120 nanometre in size, they are easily taken up by cancer tissue but not normal tissue. 
Also, nanovesicles with the drugs loaded become water dispersible thus increasing the uptake by cancer cells. “We are working to make the nanovesicles even more specific to cancer cells,” Prof. Jayakannan says. The drug-loaded nanovesicles are cleaved by esterase enzyme once inside the cell. “In spite of being cleaved, the drug is released slowly in a controlled manner over 8-10 hours” Prof. Jayakannan says. This would be important for how nanovesicles act in tumours.

Emerging antimicrobial resistance in leprosy
"," A six-year study carried out across 19 countries has now shown that antimicrobial resistance is emerging in leprosy cases. This global data shows that a total of 8% of the Mycobacterium leprae bacterial strains studied showed gene mutations conferring resistance towards drugs such as rifampicin, dapsone and ofloxacin. Rifampicin resistance was observed in about 5% of the relapse cases and in 2% of the new ones. India and Brazil topped the list with more than 10 rifampicin-resistant cases each.
Molecular methods
Assessing antimicrobial resistance has not been possible so far as M. leprae does not grow in vitro. “Currently, there are only two techniques for studying M. leprae - the mouse foot-pad technique and genetic analysis. As the former is time-consuming, we used molecular methods for detecting the resistance genes,” explains Dr. U.D. Gupta, National JALMA Institute of Leprosy and other Mycobacterial Diseases, Agra, and one of the authors of the paper published in Clinical Microbiology and Infection.
Global data showed that among the 1,932 (1,143 relapse and 789 new) cases studied, 3.8% showed gene mutations showing resistance to rifampicin. The number was 4.5% for dapsone and 1.1% for ofloxacin.
Certain cases showed resistance to more than one drug. Globally, 20 cases showed rifampicin and dapsone resistance, four showed ofloxacin and dapsone resistance. “Interestingly there were no cases of resistance to rifampicin and ofloxacin together. More studies are needed to know in depth about this,” he adds.
In India, the study was carried out in five laboratories across the country. Among the 382 cases studied from India, 4.7% showed resistance to rifampicin, 6.4% dapsone resistant and 4.4% ofloxacin resistant.
“In 1982, the multi-drug strategy was adopted to treat leprosy just when resistance to the then used drug, Dapsone was emerging. But now after almost four decades, we are noticing rifampicin resistance. Though the numbers are not alarming, it is essential to continue monitoring,” explains Dr. Joydeepa Darlong, Head of Research at The Leprosy Mission Trust of India. “Relapse cases may be under-diagnosed as we rely on self-reporting and there is decreasing leprosy expertise.”
“Unlike the routine regime (rifampicin, dapsone and clofazimine) administered once a month and given free of cost, the alternative drug regime (minocycline and ofloxacin) given to drug-resistant patients is a daily dose, prescribed for two years, and is very expensive. The government has no provision to provide this free of cost,” says Dr. Mallika Lavania from Stanley Brown Lab of The Leprosy Mission Trust of India and one of the authors of the paper. “Now, with the emergence of antimicrobial resistance, it also stresses the need for immediate notice, routine investigation and establishment of proper treatment guidelines by the government.”
“This is also a call for vigilance on the global use of antimicrobial agents, because ofloxacin resistance probably developed in relation to the general intake of antibiotics for other infections as it is not part of the multidrug combination used to treat leprosy,” adds the report. Ofloxacin resistant cases were found to be the highest in India among the 19 countries studied.
Antimicrobial resistance monitoring is now one of the core areas in the Global Leprosy Strategy for 2016–2020 and WHO has recently released an updated guide on surveillance of antimicrobial resistance in leprosy.

Gaps in India’s digital accessible information on bird occurrence
"," With citizen science, especially in bird sightings, taking off in the country, scientists tried to use these online data to study if bird occurrence has altered across India over time. Though a lot of information is available after the 2000s, they found very little data before 1980 has been made available digitally, making comparisons impossible.
Comparisons are crucial in science and tell us how natural systems change over time. The effects of climate change are also usually studied this way: comparisons of climate and bird occurrences in the past, for instance, can tell us how changing climates could have led to the avian patterns of the present.
It was with this in mind that scientists at the Wildlife Institute of India (WII) and the University of Kansas accessed more than 2 million bird occurrence data points from across India to evaluate the “digital accessible knowledge” of bird species occurrences. They explored two sources: the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF, a network funded by the world’s governments focused on making scientific data on biodiversity available online); and eBird, the world’s largest biodiversity-related citizen science project where users contribute information on bird sightings.
“Curating this data using multiple levels of filtering took a huge amount of time,” said Gautam Talukdar (WII), co-author of a study published in Current Science.
Gaps in data
Finally, making sure each record had all necessary information including correct species names, they obtained 16,510 records of 1,021 species for the pre-1980 period, and 9,01,658 records of 1,151 species for post-2000, clearly showing good coverage after 2000, but a paucity of data before 1980. Their maps reveal that the most spatially dense data after 2000 was from Kerala. Jammu and Kashmir, the higher elevations across the Himalayan front, and northeastern India had very sparse data.
Incorporating information from the several museum specimens – in foreign and Indian museums, as well as institutional collections (such as those in the Zoological Survey of India) – could be crucial to generate bird occurrence data before 1980, said Dr. Talukdar.
These gaps need to be addressed, agreed Praveen J. of Bird Count India (an Indian collective that coordinates several birding activities and encourages using eBird for documentation).
“Old papers may now be online but their data are not in searchable databases yet,” Praveen said. “Even the field notebooks of some of India's birding pioneers are still in private shelves and not digitised.”

What is a voltage fade?
It is the bane of batteries, including phone batteries, and is said to be a key reason for lowering their performance. Voltage fade reduces the energy density of a battery which in turn limits the practical applications of these materials despite their high energy density in the initial charge-discharge cycles. Voltage fade is of concern now as it affects a promising class of cathode materials called Lithium-rich NMC (nickel magnesium cobalt) layered oxides. These cathode materials have drawn attention to their potential as components for better rechargeable batteries for electric vehicles. Researchers have now identified nanoscale defects or dislocations which result in voltage fade. There is hope, though. The team in the U.S. has showed that heat treatment eliminated most of the defects and restored the original voltage.The findings have been published in the journal, Nature Energy. — Science Daily

'Octopath Traveler' review: Brand new retro
"," The Japanese Role-Playing Game has been reinvented in several ways. From the open-world extravaganza of Final Fantasy XV and Ni No Kuni, to the high school social simulator slash dungeon crawler of Persona 5. Several games have stayed true to the formula and expanded those familiar turn-based battles into some incredible stories with superb world building. Though there is a special place in our collective hearts for the retro JRPG and the days of the Super Nintendo. Something along the lines of Chrono Trigger, Final Fantasy VI, has stayed to this day with their amazing level of storytelling in the form of games like To the Moon and Undertale — which is exactly where Octopath Traveler lies, the latest JRPG from veterans Square Enix.


What’s it about?
As the title suggests, Octopath Traveler is eight stories, told from the perspectives of eight strangers from across the land, as they come together. Much like Dragon Age: Origins, you start off the game as one of these characters and experience the world through their eyes and their stories, as they meet the other characters along the way. Rather than tell one overarching story of good souls versus some dark lord, Octopath instead transcends this, telling separate stories that masterfully intertwine.




While each character’s story is quite humdrum with its moments, it’s the presentation and combat that make you want to replay the game from another character’s perspective. You can choose from Ophelia a cleric, Cyrus the scholar, the merchant Tressa, Olberic a warrior, the beautiful dancer Primrose, Alfyn the apothecary, Therion the Thief and H’aanit the hunter. Each of their stories functions as a whole, and while the stories are quite expected, they are entertaining. The best part is, once you finish one character’s journey, you really do want to spend time experiencing the world through the perspectives of the other characters.
How does it play?
Each character has a unique ‘job’ which in most games is ignored, save for battle. In Octopath, each of the characters has path abilities that help them through the story. Like Alfyn and Cyrus can glean important information. Primrose can bewitch and charm NPCs, while Therion can steal from them. You will constantly use these abilities in the world, as well as in battle.




One of the best parts of Octopath Traveler, that will keep you coming back for more, is the battle system. These too make use of characters’ abilities, like H’aanit can recruit wild animals and use them in battle, while Olberic challenges NPCs to duals, allowing you to fight them for experience. In addition to that, Octopath adds a layer of strategy across the well-oiled bones of the familiar turn-based battle system paradigm. 
With a risk/reward boost system that allows you to save up an attack boost point per turn, allowing you to unleash large attacks or healing abilities, if you’ve saved them up. Battle is so much fun and Octopath throws some fiendish enemies your way, to strategically dispatch off, perfect for the Switch.
Octopath Traveler is a beautiful-looking game. Taking the top-down perspective and pixel art of JRPGs and transforming it into a 3D game. So the textures are actually pixel art, yet the game moves and scales effortlessly. While there’s a prevalent tilt shift blur around the edges, allowing for sparkling bokeh of sunlight shimmering off a distant water body. The lighting effects are nothing short of sublime. While the entire ambience of the game is wonderfully down-to-earth fantasy, rather than something straight out of The Lord of the Rings. 
Should you get it?
The Nintendo Switch has finally got a role-playing game worth playing. Taking that spirit of Super Nintendo JRPGs and transforming it into something worthy of any modern RPG that you can octo-replay.

Geeknight Hyderabad on being ‘geek and proud’
"," 

Scrounging YouTube and Twitch, we often see what our role models in technology are up to. But what of our very neighbours? That’s where Geeknight by Thoughtworks steps in.
The community-oriented event is a source of pride for Office principal Kashi Reddy who explains, “Thoughtworks is essentially into a lot of sharing and learning; we are always thinking about social responsibility. We have always been pro-open source, meaning software should be free for people to use. When we say free, it’s open freedom, not cost.” On that note, the concept of Geeknight opens the floor to people outside the international development to come to the events which often take place on the first Wednesday of every month, and further the sharing of technical knowledge and increase collaboration within the ‘geek community.’ 
Of course, Geeknight isn’t a new concept but it’s providing age-old avenues for newer topics of conversation. According to Ujjavala Singh, a developer at Thoughtworks and one of the organisers of Geeknight, the news around these themes evolve daily if not hourly and finding topics to discuss can be a fun task. She adds, “I see a great variation of people coming in, in regards to their years of experience in relevant fields, from university students to people who are at top-tier positions at development firms. That helps bring in diverse views which is really interesting and useful.” 




Their first ever event in Hyderabad remains a truly memorable one for Kashi; it was about microservices. “A luminary called Sam Newman, who used to be a Thoughtworker, was in Hyderabad,” he recalls, “We invited him to our office and about 40 to 50 people from outside came for the event. Back then, we had a very small office with barely 10 people. The attendance of 40 to 50 was a big number to me because we obviously didn’t have the presence we do now.” 
But there’s plenty to still achieve for Geeknight. Kashi adds, “Yes, we do get great turnouts for umbrella topics with certain jargon like virtual reality or Internet of Things or Artificial Intelligence. But I’d like to see deeper engagement on smaller and more refined topics. Even if the turnout isn’t huge, I know we can’t keep doing ‘baahubali’ topics, we have to attract people who are in specialist positions and mindset… topics like ‘scaling continuous integration pipelines in a really complex environment.’” He observed that not many did turn up for this event, as predicted, but the engagement was in the right direction.
According to Thoughtworker and Geeknight organiser Mahitha Arveti, they’ve enjoyed the insights of some remarkable moderators, like software architect and author Neal Ford, who’ve enriched the conversation as well as inspired developers.
Geeknight always communicates directly with each and every person who steps into their offices for their events, taking feedback meticulously and carefully all to stay on their A-game. 
And it helps to have a fun and quirkily-designed office in the bustling area of Gachibowli, close to institutes like IIIT as well as big firms too.

Japan firm to fly wedding plaques into space
","The sky is no longer the limit for lovers looking for unusual ways to commemorate their nuptials, with a Japanese company now offering to blast commemorative wedding plaques into space.
Warpspace, a start-up based in Tsukuba City outside Tokyo, is introducing the new service in partnership with a local hotel popular for wedding banquets.
For about 30,000 yen ($270), newly-weds marrying at the hotel will be able to emboss their names and design elements on 16-by-eight-millimetre titanium plates that will be loaded onto a tiny satellite. The satellite will be taken up to the International Space Station on a supply ship, and then released by astronauts.
Customers will receive photos of the craft carrying their plaques as it swirls among the stars, Warpspace chief executive Toshihiro Kameda said. “I want them to spread their happiness across the sky,” he said.

Watch: Origami-inspired underwater trap helps study delicate marine creatures
","Studying soft-bodied deep sea creatures like jellyfish and squid have been a difficult task for marine biologists as existing underwater tools cause damage or even kill them.
Now, researchers from Harvard University’s Wyss Institute have developed an origami-inspired sampler using folding polyhedral sides that can trap deep sea soft creatures without causing them any harm. The research was recently published in Science Robotics.
 

 
“Origami, the Japanese art of folding, is used as an inspiration to help us build 3D objects from 2D sheets.We have developed a way to fold 3D shapes from its 2D net using only one actuator [component responsible for movement],” explains Dr. Zhi Ern Teoh from the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences at Harvard University in an email to The Hindu. “Minimizing the number of actuators is key because incorporating actuators is a relatively more complex engineering task and you have to figure out ways of attaching, powering, sensing and coordinating the folds. Therefore even though the system of linkages looks more complex, it consists entirely of revolute joints which are mechanically much simpler.”
The device — named Rotary Actuated Dodecahedron (RAD) — can be attached to any remotely operated vehicle (ROV). The pilot of the ROV uses cameras to position the sampler near a sea creature of interest and then tells the operator of the sampler to close the sampler, entrapping the creature. The device was tested in the open ocean at a depth of 1,600 to 2,300 ft and the researchers say that it can be modified to withstand higher pressures at increasing depths.
“We approach these animals as if they are works of art: would we cut pieces out of the Mona Lisa to study it? No – we’d use the most innovative tools available. These deep-sea organisms, some being thousands of years old, deserve to be treated with a similar gentleness when we’re interacting with them,” adds collaborating author David Gruber from City University of New York in a release. “We’d like to add cameras and sensors to the sampler so that, in the future, we can capture an animal, collect lots of data about it like its size, material properties, and even its genome, and then let it go, almost like an underwater alien abduction.”

Why do we have technology addictions?
"," In May 2016, Tristan Harris published an influential essay titled ‘How technology is hijacking your mind — from a magician and Google design ethicist’, describing the many ways by which smartphones suck people into their vortex and demand constant attention. Harris traced the lineage of (both inadvertent and intentional) manipulation common in the design of technology products directly to the numerous techniques that slot-machine designers use to entice gamblers to sit for hours losing money.
Inspired by Harris and other advocates of more-mindful technology product design, a small but growing Silicon Valley movement in behavioural design is advocating greater consideration of the ethics and the human outcomes of technology consumption. (After leaving Google, Harris launched a website, Time Well Spent, that focuses on helping people build healthier interactions with technology.)
Harris, New York University marketing professor Adam Alter, and others have criticised the various techniques that product designers are using to encourage us to consume ever more technology, even to our own clear detriment. Tightly controlling menus to direct our attention is one common technique (one that is not as easily available to offline businesses). For his part, Harris suggests that we ask four questions whenever we’re presented with online menus: (1) What’s not on the menu? (2) Why am I being given these options and not others? (3) Do I know the menu provider’s goals? (4) Is this menu empowering for my original need, or are the choices actually a distraction? We assure you, once you start asking these questions, you will never look at the Internet or at software applications in the same light again!
Another technique, alluded to in the title of Harris’ slot-machine article, is the use of intermittent variable rewards: unpredictability in the rewards of an interaction. The first behaviourist, psychologist BF Skinner, introduced this concept with his ‘Skinner box’ research. Skinner put rats into boxes and taught them to push levers to receive a food pellet. The rats learned the connection between behaviour and reward quickly, in only a few tries. With further research, Skinner learned that the best way to keep the rats motivated to press the lever repeatedly was to reward them with a pellet only some of the time — to give intermittent variable rewards. Otherwise, the rats pushed the lever only when they were hungry.
The casinos took the concept of the Skinner box and raised it to a fine art, designing multiple forms of variable rewards into the modern computerised versions of slot machines. Those machines now take in 70 to 80% of casino profits (or, according to an industry official, even 85%). Players not only receive payouts at seemingly random intervals, but also receive partial payouts that feel like a win even if the player in fact loses money overall on a turn…
The brain’s pleasure centres do not distinguish well between actual winning and the techniques that researchers call losses disguised as wins (LDW). The machines are also programmed to highlight near misses (nearly enough of the right numbers), since near misses actually stimulate the same neurons as real wins do.
Machine designers use myriad other clever sensory tricks — both visual and auditory — to stimulate our neurons in ways that encourage more playing… What helps these techniques entice humans to keep playing is that our brains are hard-wired to become easily addicted to variable rewards. This makes sense when you think that finding food in prehistoric, pre-agricultural times was a perfect example of intermittent variable rewards. According to research by Robert Breen, video-based gambling games (of which slots represent the majority) that rely on intermittent variable rewards result in gambling addiction three to four times faster than betting on card games or sporting events.
Smartphones were not explicitly designed to behave like slot machines, but their effect is nearly the same. As Harris writes, “When we pull our phone out of our pocket, we’re playing a slot machine to see what notifications we got. When we pull to refresh our email, we’re playing a slot machine to see what new email we got. When we swipe down our finger to scroll the Instagram feed, we’re playing a slot machine to see what photo comes next. When we swipe faces left/right on dating apps like Tinder, we’re playing a slot machine to see if we got a match…”
Through this lens we can see how many actions deeply embedded in the technology we use are acting as variable rewards systems, and when we look at the technology in our lives, we can find intermittent variable rewards in nearly every product, system, or device.

World’s fastest man-made spinning object developed
","Scientists have developed the fastest man-made rotor in the world, which they believe will help them study quantum mechanics. At more than 60 billion revolutions per minute, this machine is more than 100,000 times faster than a high-speed dental drill.
“This study has many applications, including material science. We can study the extreme conditions different materials can survive in,” said Tongcang Li, an assistant professor at Purdue University in the US.
The team synthesised a tiny dumbbell from silica and levitated it in high vacuum using a laser. The laser can work in a straight line or in a circle – when it is linear, the dumbbell vibrates, and when it is circular, the dumbbell spins.  A spinning dumbbell functions as a rotor, and a vibrating dumbbell functions like an instrument for measuring tiny forces and torques, known as a torsion balance.
 




These devices were used to discover things like the gravitational constant and density of Earth, but Li hopes that as they become more advanced, they will be able to study things like quantum mechanics and the properties of vacuum.
Quantum mechanics is a fundamental theory in physics which describes nature at the smallest scales of energy levels of atoms and subatomic particles.
“People say that there is nothing in vacuum, but in physics, we know it’s not really empty,” Li said. “There are a lot of virtual particles which may stay for a short time and then disappear. We want to figure out what’s really going on there, and that’s why we want to make the most sensitive torsion balance.”
By observing this tiny dumbbell spin faster than anything before it, Li’s team may also be able to learn things about vacuum friction and gravity. Understanding these mechanisms is an essential goal for the modern generation of physics, Li said.

Underground lake detected on Mars ","Using a radar instrument on an orbiting spacecraft, scientists have spotted what they said on Wednesday appears to be a sizeable salt-laden lake under ice on the southern polar plain of Mars, a body of water they called a possible habitat for microbial life.
The reservoir they detected — roughly 20 km in diameter, shaped like a rounded triangle and located about 1.5 km beneath the ice surface — represents the first stable body of liquid water ever found on Mars.
Whether anywhere other than Earth has harboured life is one of the supreme questions in science, and the new findings offer tantalizing evidence, though no proof. Water is considered a fundamental ingredient for life.
The researchers said it could take years to verify whether something is actually living in this body of water that resembles a subglacial lake on Earth, perhaps with a future mission drilling through the ice to sample the water below.
“This is the place on Mars where you have something that most resembles a habitat, a place where life could subsist,” said planetary scientist Roberto Orosei of Istituto Nazionale di Astrofisica in Italy, who led the research published in the journal Science.
“This kind of environment is not exactly your ideal vacation, or a place where fish would swim,” Orosei added. “But there are terrestrial organisms that can survive and thrive, in fact, in similar environments. There are microorganisms on Earth that are capable of surviving even in ice.”
The detection was made using data collected between May 2012 and December 2015 by an instrument aboard the European Space Agency's Mars Express spacecraft that transmits radar pulses, which penetrate the Martian surface and ice caps.
“This took us long years of data analysis and struggles to find a good method to be sure that what we were observing was unambiguously liquid water,” said study co-author Enrico Flamini, chief scientist at the Italian Space Agency during the research.
The location's radar profile resembled that of subglacial lakes found beneath Earth's Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets.
Mars long ago was warmer and wetter, possessing significant bodies of water, as evidenced by dry lake beds and river valleys on its surface. There had been some signs of liquid water currently on Mars, including disputed evidence of water activity on Martian slopes, but not stable bodies of water.
Orosei said the water in the Martian lake was below the normal freezing point but remained liquid thanks in large part to high levels of salts. Orosei estimated the water temperature at somewhere between 14 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 10 degrees Celsius) and minus 94 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 70 degrees Celsius).
It remains to be seen if more subsurface reservoirs of water will be found or whether the newly discovered one is some sort of quirk, Orosei said.
If others are detected and a network of subglacial lakes exists like on Earth, he said, that could indicate liquid water has persisted for millions of years or even dating back to 3-1/2 billion years ago when Mars was a more hospitable planet.
The question would be, Orosei added, whether any life forms that could have evolved long ago on Mars have found a way to survive until now.
“Nobody dares to propose that there could be any more complex life form,” Orosei said.

Improving the stability, bioavailability of TB FDC drug
"," The physical stability and bioavailability of a fixed-dose combination (FDC) drug containing four anti-TB medicines — rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide and ethambutol — has been vastly improved from 3-4 days (at 40 degree C and 75% relative humidity) to over 30 days by turning to crystal engineering.
The use of FDC containing two, three and four anti-TB drugs for the treatment of TB was recommended by the World Health Organisation in 1994. The four-drug FDC was included in the WHO Model List of Essential Drugs in 1999. 
The four-drug FDC suffers from stability and quality issues. The FDC tablets tend to undergo discolouration and become sticky, gummy mass thereby affecting its quality. The use of poor quality drugs can lead to treatment failures and development of drug resistance.
A team led by Dr. Ashwini Nangia from Pune’s National Chemical Laboratory addressed the problem of stability and poor bioavailability by making cocrystals (hydrogen-bonded multicomponent crystal) of isoniazid with either caffeic acid or vanillic acid. The results of the study were published in the Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences.
“Rifampicin tends to cross react with isoniazid and this leads to changes in colour and composition of the four-drug FDC drug, and erratic bioavailability and therapeutic action,” says Dr. Nangia. By using caffeine and vanillic acid to form cocrystals with isoniazid, the researchers were able to inhibit cross-reaction between isoniazid and rifampicin.
While FDC tablets used as control turned to liquid-like state within one week, the FDC containing isoniazid cocrystal remained stable for up to 30 days.
Whereas the cocrystal formed using vanilic acid showed slight colour change within one week and became dark brown at the end of four weeks, caffeic acid cocrystal showed slight change in colour after one week but remained in solid form for up to four weeks. As a result, caffeic acid cocrystal showed better stability.
“The reason why caffeic acid cocrystal performs better than vanilic acid cocrystal is due to better and strong hydrogen bonding in the crystal structure. This is absent in the vanillic acid cocrystal,” he says. 
“We have tested the stability for one month. We expect the stability to be much longer because excipients [substances included for the purpose of long-term stabilisation] and additives will be added which make the formulation stable. Secondly, the tablet will be in closed strip and so the degradation will be much slower. The cocrystal FDC is much more stable than the drug mixture and hence should be explored in further formulation development,” says Dr. Nangia.
The researchers plan to test the stability of the four-drug FDC cocrystal for longer term and in new environments. “It is expected to perform superior to the drug combinations,” he says.

'Amazing dragon' fossils rewrite history of long-necked dinosaurs ","Fossils unearthed on a hillside in northwestern China are forcing scientists to rethink the history of a dinosaur lineage that produced the largest animals ever to walk the planet.
Scientists on Tuesday announced the discovery of Lingwulong shenqi, an early member of the well-known group of plant-eating dinosaurs called sauropods with long necks, long tails, small heads and pillar-like legs. Lingwulong lived 174 million years ago during the Jurassic Period.
Its name means “amazing dragon from Lingwu,” the closest city to the site where a farmer spotted the fossils while herding sheep.
The scientists excavated bones from at least eight to 10 Lingwulong individuals, the largest of which was about 57 feet long, said paleontologist Xing Xu of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, who led the study published in the journal Nature Communications.




 
Lingwulong represents the earliest-known advanced member of the sauropod lineage, as defined by anatomical traits that distinguish them from primitive sauropods that first appeared tens of millions of years earlier. The discovery pushes back by 15 million years the appearance of advanced sauropods, a lineage that later would include Jurassic giants like Diplodocus and Brontosaurus as well as Cretaceous Period behemoths like Argentinosaurus, Dreadnoughtus and Patagotitan that were the largest land animals on record.
“Previously, we thought all of these advanced sauropods originated around 160 million years ago and rapidly diversified and spread across the planet in a time window perhaps as short as 5 million years,” said University College London paleontologist Paul Upchurch, a study co-author. “However, the discovery of Lingwulong means that this hypothesis is incorrect and we now have to work with the idea that, actually, this group and its major constituent lineages originated somewhat earlier and more gradually.”
Lingwulong lived in a warm and wet environment with lush vegetation including conifers, ferns and other plants. Its neck was not as long as some other sauropods, and it may have grazed on low, soft plants with its peg-like teeth. Because so many individuals were found together, the researchers suspect Lingwulong, like other sauropods, lived in herds.
Lingwulong belonged to a sauropod subgroup that previously was thought to have been absent from East Asia because it evolved after that land mass split from the rest of Pangaea, an ancient supercontinent. “Our discoveries indicate that eastern Asia was still connected to other continents at the time,” Xu said.

More than 1,000 gene variants linked to educational attainment identified
","Scientists have identified nearly 1,300 genetic variants associated with how much education someone may complete – far more than the 74 variants initially discovered in a smaller study two years ago.
The research, published in the journal Nature Genetics, is one of the largest genetics studies to date. It is based on genetic information from over one million individuals with European ancestries – more than three times the size of the 2016 study.
The total influence of the genetic variants is small, explaining about four per cent of the variation in educational attainment across individuals, the scientists said. They found that genetic variants on the X chromosome explain virtually identical amounts of variation in men and women. This finding lends support to the hypothesis that there are no genetically based sex differences in the amount of variation in educational attainment, the researchers said.
“Even variants with the largest effects predict, on average, only about three more weeks of schooling in those who have those variants compared to those who don’t,” said Daniel Benjamin, an associate professor at the University of Southern California in the US. “Yet when we analyse the combined effects of many genetic variants, taken together they can predict the length of a person’s formal education as well as demographic factors,” Benjamin said.
Scientists have known for many years that demographic factors are associated with educational attainment, including household income and maternal education.
To assess the importance of the gene variants in educational attainment, the scientists established a “polygenic score” that captures the predictive power of a combined one million genetic variants – including those specifically linked to educational attainment and the other remaining variants that the scientists had measured across the genome. The scientists found that the predictive power of the score is as large as that of demographic factors.
“The very small effects of individual genetic variants confirms what we have seen in our earlier work, and it’s an important finding in itself,” Benjamin said. “It would be completely misleading to characterise our results as identifying ‘genes for education.’ Yet the polygenic score is useful for research because it combines the effects of a very large number of genetic variants,” he said.
For the latest study, the scientists analysed a combined 71 data sets comprising over 1.1 million participants with European ancestry from 15 different countries and who were at least 30 years old. Educational attainment is primarily influenced by environmental and social factors, but it is also influenced by genes associated with, for example, cognitive function such as memory and personality traits such as conscientiousness.
“We found that many of the genes associated with educational attainment are influential in virtually all stages of brain development and in neural communication within the brain, said Peter Visscher, a professor at the University of Queensland in Australia.

Boys have more tightly knit band of friends than girls: study
","Boys in schools may be more ‘cliquey’ than girls, forming the most tight-knit friendship groups often structured around gender, a study has found. A clique describes group of individuals who exclusively interact with one another, and are often not welcoming to outsiders.
The findings, published in the journal PLOS ONE suggests that factors such as location and timetable may have an impact on the social networks that children develop.
Social mixing patterns are commonly used in mathematical models of infectious disease which can play a vital role in public health planning, such as determining effective vaccination strategies. Children’s mixing patterns are recognised as particularly important, as they represent a key risk group for disease transmission. As school is the primary location for many of their interactions, understanding how children socialise there is vital.
Researchers from the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine and the University of Cambridge in the UK, examined the features and structure of children’s social networks within different schools.
Previous research on social interactions among children has generally focused on just a single day. The team surveyed the self-reported contacts of 460 year 7 pupils across four UK secondary schools over a five month period (between January and June 2015). In total pupils completed 1,254 surveys, reporting contact information such as who they spend the most time with. The schools in the study were selected to be representative of different geographical and socioeconomic settings, for example including rural and urban and single-sex and mixed-sex schools.
Researchers found that while the overall structure of contacts within children’s networks was generally consistent within schools, the patterns of interactions varied considerably between each school. In most schools, children formed well-defined groups, whereas in one school, children interacted more widely.
Interestingly there were only small differences reported in individuals’ contacts and networks over the five months, suggesting that well connected and weakly connected, ie popular or less popular – children remain that way over time.
The characteristics of social networks were found to be mainly dependent on gender and to a lesser extent on other factors, such as school class. In particular, males tended to cluster together more in each mixed-sex school in the survey.
“Previous studies have typically looked at social interactions over a single day, so there has been limited information available on how much variation there might be in social mixing patterns over time in schools,” said Adam Kucharski, lead author at London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine. “Showing boys are potentially more cliquey than girls, perhaps going against gender stereotypes, and that popular children remain popular over time, is an interesting social insight but for mathematical modellers this type of information is also extremely valuable.”
“Understanding age-specific social mixing patterns is vital for studying outbreaks of infectious diseases like flu and measles which can spread rapidly, particularly among children,” he said. “It’s useful to find that mixing patterns are fairly consistent, as this suggests it will be easier to analyse social interactions among children than was previously thought. It also shows the value of working directly with schools to study these questions.”

Kolkata Museum celebrates early tool-makers of T.N., A.P.
","One of the earliest stone tools from the region, discovered by Robert Bruce Foote almost 150 years ago from various sites of Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh, have been put on display for the first time at the Indian Museum in Kolkata.
“Forty-two stone tools, which include hand axes, scrapers, mullers, corn crushers, pounders and celt, are being displayed at the Indian Museum’s temporary exhibition room. These tools, discovered by Foote, are the first technology developed by hominoids for sustenance as hunter gatherers,” Indian Museum director Rajesh Purohit said.
While a large number of the tools collected by Foote, considered the ‘Father of Indian Prehistory’, is with the Madras Government Museum, about 200 stone tools are in the collection of Indian Museum, which is the oldest in Asia.
The exhibition sought to highlight that the tool-making technology of the prehistoric times was one of the oldest in the world, Dr. Purohit added.
He referred to recent research publications by archaeologist Shanti Pappu, which established that tools discovered at Attirampakkam in Tamil Nadu and the adjoining areas, used by the Palaeolithic population, could be dated to 1.5 million years ago.




There is also an interesting story as to how the tools landed in Kolkata, almost 1,600 km from Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh, where they were discovered.
Professor K. Paddayya of Deccan College, who inaugurated the exhibition, said Foote came to India in 1858 as an assistant geologist with the Geological Survey of India (GSI).
It was during his visit to Kolkata to meet his superior, Thomas Oldham, who was heading the GSI then, that Foote brought these stone tools to Kolkata.
The first tool, a hand axe was found on May 30, 1863, from the Parade Ground at Pallavaram in Chennai. The discovery led Oldham to announce at a meeting of the Asiatic Society in August 1864 that his colleague had discovered stone implements from the prehistoric times from Tamil Nadu, Prof Paddayya recalled.
“These are the stone tools which Robert Bruce Foot took to Vienna from Calcutta in 1873 and they were displayed at an international exhibition of science and scientific instruments,” said Prof. Paddayya, who has done extensive research on the Palaeolithic and Neolithic cultures.




Authorities at the Indian Museum, after a painstaking search of their collection, confirmed that the GSI had donated these stone implements, discovered in batches in 1883.
Sayan Bhattacharya, education officer, said that along with the exhibition, the Museum also organised a stone tool making workshop by Aviek Biswas, a fellow at the Centre for Archaeological Studies and Training.
The workshop not only demonstrated techniques of tool-making but also explained to the participants the importance of these stone tools.

Taxonomy on the verge of extinction: Ministry
","When P.T. Cherian started working on the group of Chrolopidae, commonly called grass flies, there were only about seven species from the group known in the country. At present, the family is known by 1,100 species from India and adjacent countries.
Conferred the E. K. Janaki Ammal award for Animal Taxonomy, the highest award in the field of taxonomy by the government earlier this month, Dr. Cherian is credited with the discovery of about 700 new species, 20 new genera from the Chloropidae, a family from Diptera, in his career spanning five decades.
Speaking to The Hindu, the 75-year-old taxonomist referred to his discovery of four new species of Siphunculina genus of Chloropidae flies responsible for spreading eye diseases in humans.
Majority undiscovered
Dr. Cherian, however, said there was a need to look beyond his achievements. and there was a lot of work pending as far as animal taxonomy, particularly taxonomy of insects was concerned.
“About 88% of the insects are yet to be discovered and named. If these insects are not discovered, many will become extinct before they are even known to us,” Dr. Cherian, a visiting faculty at the University of Kerala said.
Like Dr. Cherian, S.R.Yadav, is the E. K Janaki Ammal award winner for Plant Taxonomy for 2017. Dr. Yadav, who established the School of Angiosperm Taxonomy at Shivaji University, Kolhapur, Maharashtra, is credited with the discovery of about 60 species of plants. They include Trithuria Konkanensis, a very ancient group of angiosperms found in the Konkan region along with Crinum Malabaricum, a species with largest leaves in the genus Crinum known for its medicinal properties in the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease.
Echoing Dr. Cherian’s thoughts, the plant taxonomist described taxonomy as the “mother branch of biology”. “If the country does not have enough taxonomists, will scientists from abroad come to identify plants in India?” he said. If proper studies are undertaken, scientists can discover 5,000-10,000 plants across the country in the next few decades, he said.
Another taxonomist S. Shivaji, who is credited with the discovery of 82 new species and eight new genera of extremophilic micro-organisms (microbes that are found in very severe conditions), is the recipient of the E.K. Janaki Ammal award in the area of taxonomy of micro organisms.
Dr. Shivaji, who has done most of his work at the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology, Hyderabad, said that while researchers these days like to play around with genes, taxonomy is a basic science and if there is any problem in identification of a species it will have a lot of downstream effect on other areas of science as well.
The solution is that universities, other than the Zoological Survey of India and the Botanical Survey of India, will have to train taxonomists by encouraging students to take up field work.
Interestingly, India is a mega biodiversity country. So far, 1,01,167 faunal species have been recorded in the country, which is about 6.45 % of faunal species found in the world. Similarly, about 49,003 floral species, which is 11.4 % of the world flora, is found in India.
No takers
The Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, in response to a question in the Lok Sabha in April 2018, admitted that this traditional science is on the verge of extinction.
“It is mainly due to lack of interest among students in the discipline and significantly lower career prospects. The science of taxonomy has been declining for several years now, with very few qualified practising taxonomists and teachers in lndia,” was the response of the Ministry to a question.

Star watchers count black holes in globular clusters
"," The universe is strange and fascinating because it holds many a glittering clue to its secrets — bright and dark. To follow the clues and unravel these secrets is the astrophysicist’s privilege. In a recent paper published in The Astrophysical Journal, Sourav Chatterjee of Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR), Mumbai, and a team of international collaborators, trace such clues to estimate the number of black holes in globular clusters.
Globular clusters
Globular clusters are massive bunches of stars that are typically about 9-12 billion years old. While the Milky Way has about 150 globular clusters, their number could go up to a few thousands in other galaxies. They are densely packed with stars. Within the distance equal to that between the Sun and its nearest star neighbour, a globular cluster would have about a million stars. “Due to the high stellar densities, the stars interact with other stars frequently. These dynamical interactions are key to understanding how black holes form binaries that may be detected via gravitational waves, X-ray or radio emission,” says Sourav Chatterjee in an email to The Hindu.
Recently, astronomers have detected black hole candidates in four globular clusters in the Milky Way. “They are either discovered via X-ray or radio emissions or by monitoring the radial velocity of a companion star,” Dr Chatterjee explains. Among these, the team studied three globular clusters within the Milky Way: 47 Tuc, M 10, M22. These three globular clusters have candidates identified to be black holes through radio and X-ray observations. “The observations were done using archival data from the ACS survey done using the Hubble space telescope. All theoretical models and data reduction software were built by us,” he adds.
This has sparked interest in understanding how these black holes evolve and estimating how many black holes are there within a globular cluster. The team shows that the clue to knowing the number of black holes in the cluster lies in the mass segregation observed between the giant stars and the less massive main sequence stars. They find that the measure of mass segregation is related inversely to the number of black holes in the cluster. According to Dr. Chatterjee, this can be an effective probe to indirectly estimate the number of black holes in a globular cluster aided by calibrations from numerical models.
Milky Way
The team has estimated that 47 Tuc, M10, and M22 globular clusters within the Milky Way contain 150, 50 and 200 black holes, respectively.
Not all black holes that form in a cluster are retained. Some of them are ejected at birth and some are forced out later. Once this has stabilised, the galaxy or cluster acquires a stable retention fraction.
“Newlin [N. Weatherford, a collaborator from North Western University, USA] and I will use the same method to constrain the number of retained black holes in all globular clusters for which the necessary data is available,” Says Dr Chatterjee.
“These constraints will help us understand the retention fraction of black holes in globular clusters. This has wide implications. For example, the rate of black hole mergers observable by LIGO is dependent strongly on this [constraint],” he adds.

Novel method developed to measure protein digestion
"," By labelling spirulina and two legumes (chick pea and mung bean pea) with stable, nonradioactive isotopes of carbon (13C) and hydrogen (2H) respectively, researchers at St. John’s Research Institute have found a new way to accurately measure the digestibility of dietary proteins.
In the six adults who consumed the labelled proteins, 85% of the spirulina protein was absorbed while only about 57% was absorbed in the case of both chickpea and mung beans. The results were published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition.
The research team led by Anura V Kurpad from the Institute’s Department of Physiology found that removing the hull or skin of mung bean before ingestion increases the average digestibility of essential amino acids by 10%. There are two ways by which the hull reduces digestibility. While anti-proteases present in the hull block the action of intestinal digestive enzymes, the polyphenols in it reduce the activity of the digestive enzyme.
“We knew the hull has anti-nutrition factors that hinder digestion and that dehulling will increase amino acid digestibility. But the 10% increase in digestibility when dehulled was not expected,” says Sarita Devi at the Institute’s Division of Nutrition and first author of the paper.
“The hull has less effect in the case of chick pea whereas it is a substantial problem in mung bean,” says Prof. Kurpad.
In another study, which will soon be published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, the team used stable isotopes to label and measure protein digestion in meat (chicken) and egg. At 92%, the essential amino acid digestion was highest in cooked chicken, followed by whole boiled egg at 89% and egg white protein at 86%.
“The amount of essential amino acid digested and absorbed is far higher in animal-source protein than plant-based protein,” says Prof. Kurpad. “In contrast, one has to consume about 40% more dal to get the same amino acid into the body as animal source protein. On the other hand, legumes are good for the environment and land and offer many other beneficial nutrients and so a balance has to be reached when deciding on the source of high quality protein foods in the diet.”
Of the 20 amino acids that we need, the body cannot synthesise nine; dietary protein is the only source of these essential amino acids. But till now there was no way to know how well the protein consumed is digested and absorbed by the body.
The crude method adopted so far was to feed protein-rich food and measure the nitrogen content in the faeces. “But protein is only digested and absorbed in the small intestine. In the large intestine the microbiome takes away or adds nitrogen. So measuring nitrogen in the faeces as an index of what has been digested and absorbed can be misleading,” says Prof. Kurpad. “If you have wrong information about digestion, we will end up with wrong recommendation for the quantity of specific food-based protein to be consumed.”
The team has been working for over 15 years on a stable carbon isotope (13C) method that they developed to measure the true amino acid requirement in humans. These studies have defined the requirement of amino acid has to be consumed every day to meet the protein requirement, and formed the primary evidence for the 2007 WHO/FAO/UNU Expert Committee Recommendations. These recommendations were very important since they overturned the earlier values for amino acid requirements set by the WHO/FAO/UNU in 1985, which was based on the nitrogen balance measurements from urine and faeces, and were inaccurate. 
“Since even digestion measurement was not correct, owing to difficulties in accessing small intestinal events, we devised the dual-isotope method to measure digestion in the small intestine,” he says. These results, while setting up a new method, will inform policies on feeding populations and individuals the appropriate amounts and types of food.

AIIMS-led team develops highly sensitive, portable test for TB meningitis
"," A diagnostic test for TB meningitis (the most severe form of TB) with nearly 100% sensitivity and about 91% specificity has been developed by a multi-institutional team led by Prof. Jaya Sivaswami Tyagi from the Department of Biotechnology at AIIMS. The performance of the diagnostic test was evaluated in 87 cerebrospinal fluid samples obtained from paediatric subjects (39 TB meningitis patients and 48 controls). The results of the study were published recently in the journal Tuberculosis.
The diagnostic test is based on a derivative of a DNA aptamer (a small single-stranded DNA molecule that binds to a specific target molecule and is a chemical rival of antibodies) that shows high binding affinity in nanomolar range and high specificity to a TB antigen (HspX). Besides higher binding affinity, there is significantly higher load of the HspX antigen in cerebrospinal fluid samples, leading to higher sensitivity. 
A rapid, point-of-care diagnostic test for TB meningitis that uses the DNA aptamer has already been adapted to a sensor format and is being evaluated on clinical samples. “It takes all of 30 minutes to get the result as we are using an electrochemical sensing platform,” says Prof. Tyagi.
“While antibodies have to be generated in animals and so will not be of uniform quality, aptamers can be produced in the lab,” says Dr. Tarun Kumar Sharma from the Centre for Biodesign and Diagnostics at Translational Health Science and Technology Institute (THSTI), Faridabad and the other corresponding author of the paper.
The aptamer-based diagnostic test for TB meningitis has been patented by AIIMS and THSTI and licensed to AptaBharat Innovation Pvt Limited, a THSTI spinoff founded by Dr. Sharma.
The currently used diagnostic methods — microscopy and culture of cerebrospinal fluid — suffer from huge limitations in terms of poor sensitivity and long turnaround time of up to eight weeks. Even GeneXpert has only 55% sensitivity. In settings such as India, where the prevalence of TB meningitis is high, one in six patients tested by Xpert will be missed.
 
Ten-year journey
It has taken the team about 10 years to reach this stage of developing a diagnostic test. Since there are very few bacteria in TB meningitis samples, the researchers wanted to evaluate the utility of using TB DNA for the diagnosis using PCR. In a paper published in 2009 in the Journal of Medical Microbiology, the researchers filtered 167 cerebrospinal fluid samples using a filter paper and studied the filtrate that contains the DNA of TB bacteria. DNA and other components of TB bacteria are present in the filtrate due to disintegration of the bacteria.
“We studied TB bacteria present on the filter paper and the TB DNA present in the filtrate and found TB DNA yielded significantly higher sensitivity of detection (88%) than the whole bacteria (53%). When we saw the filtrate had more DNA we wanted to check for antigens of TB bacteria,” recalls Dr. Sagarika Haldar from the Centre for Biodesign and Diagnostics at THSTI and first author in two papers. She is currently at the Department of Experimental Medicine and Biotechnology,
PGIMER, Chandigarh.
In a paper published in 2012 in PLOS ONE, the team studied 532 cerebrospinal fluid samples collected from children and looked for five TB antigens. “Though DNA and antigen were significantly higher in the filtrate compared with TB bacteria, the amount of TB antigens was far higher than DNA,” Dr. Haldar says. Using DNA for diagnosis would involve sophisticated instrument and amplification while antigen detection will be straight forward. 
The team found the sensitivity of both tests — DNA and antigen — was similar. Of the five antigens, two were found to be excellent in terms of sensitivity and specificity. “We would need an ELISA reader to detect the antigens. Since we wanted to make a point-of-care diagnostic test for TB meningitis, we turned out attention to DNA aptamers,” says Dr. Haldar.
Using a DNA aptamer to bind to the TB antigen makes ELISA reader redundant in a portable assay format. The aptamer is also more sensitive, specific and stable compared with the antibody. Since the antigen is directly detected, only 5 microlitre of the sample is required.
Twenty-one aptamers were selected from the aptamer libarary and based on specificity one was chosen. Since all the 44 nucleotides of the aptamer don’t interact with the HspX TB antigen, the size of the aptamer was reduced to 28 nucleotides. Reducing the size of the aptamer will in turn reduce the cost of the diagnostic test.
“Once the mutation was done to reduce the size we found the binding improved. The mutant aptamer showed 2.5-fold higher binding than the parent aptamer,” says Abhijeet Dhiman from the Department of Biotechnology, AIIMS and first author of the 2018 paper. The optimised aptamer was tested on 87 cerebrospinal fluid samples and found to have nearly 100% sensitivity and about 91% specificity.

Novel biomarkers for gastric cancer progression
"," With stomach cancer figuring as the third leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide, researchers from University of Delhi and National Institute of Cancer Prevention and Research, Noida have identified two proteins — survivin and STAT3 — that can be potential markers of the disease. According to them, these proteins could also be suitable therapeutic targets in preventing gastric cancer progression.
From 2007-2012, in all 156 gastric samples were collected from a hospital in Allahabad and studied. Of these, 30 were precancerous tissues, 65 were in the advanced stage of stomach cancer (adenocarcinomas) and the rest were normal healthy tissues. Protein expression studies revealed that survivin and STAT3 were produced in abundance (overexpressed) during gastric tumour progression.
“Survivin plays a dual role. Normally, it is in the nucleus and is associated with cell proliferation, whereas in advanced tumours it has been observed in cytoplasm and mitochondria, which is linked to chemoresistance. This means that in patients, when it is overexpressed in cytoplasm, it can inhibit cell death,” explains Prof. Alok C. Bharti from the Molecular Oncology Laboratory at the University of Delhi and corresponding author of the work published in Cancer Reports. “Therefore, the protein can help cancer cells to survive in harsh toxic conditions and to withstand chemoradiation, causing the patient to not respond or poorly respond to chemotherapy.”
Genetic analysis
The researchers also looked at the presence of key pathogenicity inducing gene cagA of Helicobacter pylori and identified strong correlation between presence of the gene and increased expression of survivin and STAT3.
Lifestyle habits like smoking and alcohol consumption were also found to be the causes for increase in the expression of these proteins. But when these habits came together along with H. pylori infection, the expression of survivin was characteristically very high. These molecular markers can be present even when the lesion is small and have larger implications as they point to future progress of the disease.
“It is a very simple, easy test to detect the level of these molecular markers. Detection of cagA gene is done by standard PCR and the immunohistological analysis for the proteins could be performed in a lab and does not require sophisticated infrastructure. The reagents required are also generic and not expensive, and the analysis can be done by any expert pathologist,” says Dr. Arvind Pandey, first author of the study who did his PhD at the institute.
Currently there is no specific clinically-available method to study gastric cancer progression. Further standardisation is needed to translate it into clinical reality.

Pushing bats off their holy roosts
"," It is not just thousand-year-old deities that dwell in the ancient temples of southern Tamil Nadu. Bats too make their home in the little nooks and high ceilings that these stone structures offer. However, temple renovations could be lowering bat numbers in these sacred spaces, suggests a preliminary, yet-to-be-published survey.
The sight of bats inside some temples in Tirunelveli district piqued the interest of T. Ganesh (Senior Fellow, Ashoka Trust for Research in Ecology and the Environment; ATREE) and his students. How many bat species dwell in these temples and what makes them suitable bat homes?
The team, which began studying these bats since 2011, visited 22 temples across three towns (Kallidaikurichi, Ambasamudram, Alwarkurichi) in May 2018. They found 37 bat roost sites of seven species (including the Leschenault’s rousette Rousettus leschenaultii and the Lesser mouse-tailed bat Rhinopoma hardwickii) in 18 temples. They also noted temperature, humidity, light and noise at these roost sites; basic analyses show that higher roost height and a combination of both noise and low light played a crucial role in bats selecting specific roost sites.
The team also noticed that temple authorities used several methods to prevent the mammals from roosting: they blocked bat entrances using nets and logs, filled up existing cracks, added lights, reconstructed temple towers and painted the old dark stones white. Six temples implemented some of these renovations in the later half of 2014. 
Dropping numbers
The numbers of Schneider's leaf-nosed bat (Hipposideros speoris) dropped from 211 in May 2014 to 26 this year. However, a more detailed and robust study would be required to understand this better, says Chetan Misher, one of the research students at ATREE who conducted the study. 
Temple renovation is indeed a main cause of disturbance to bats, according to D. Paramanantha Swami Doss (assistant professor at St. John's College, Payalamkottai), whose team has also been studying these temple bats for the last 15 years. Bat diversity could also be decreasing here, he adds.
“We recorded a [member of] Tadarida species [free-tailed bats] for the first time in Tirunelveli district from the Brahmadesam temple, but when I went there a few days ago, there were none left,” he added.
While Dr. Doss hopes to focus on bat awareness sessions for local residents, Dr. Ganesh and his team hope to provide bat houses outside temples that the bats could use if renovations drive them out of their holy roosts.

Scientists confirm Einstein's supermassive black hole theory ","A team of international scientists observing a star in the Milky Way have for the first time confirmed Einstein's predictions of what happens to the motion of a star passing close to a supermassive black hole.
Einstein's 100-year-old general theory of relativity predicted that light from stars would be stretched to longer wavelengths by the extreme gravitational field of a black hole, and the star would appear redder, an effect known as gravitational red shift.
“This was the first time we could test directly Einstein's theory of general relativity near a supermassive black hole,” Frank Eisenhauer, senior astronomer at the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics, told journalists. “At the time of Einstein, he could not think or dream of what we are showing today.”
A team of scientists at the European Southern Observatory started monitoring the central area of the Milky Way using its Very Large Telescope to observe the motion of stars near the supermassive black hole 26 years ago. The black hole is 26,000 light years away from Earth and has a mass 4 million times that of the Sun. The scientists selected one star, S2, to follow. With an orbit of 16 years, they knew it would return close to the black hole in 2018.
Over 20 years, the accuracy of their instruments has improved and so in May 2018, they were able to take extremely precise measurements in conjunction with scientists from around the world.
This showed the star's orbital velocity increasing to more than 25 million kph (15.5 million mph) as it approached the black hole. The star's wavelength stretched as it sought to escape the gravitational pull of the supermassive black hole, shifting its appearance from blue to red, Odele Straub from the Paris Observatory said. The scientists now hope to observe other theories of black hole physics, she said.
“This is the first step on a long road that the team has done over many years and which we hope to continue in the next years,” Reinhard Genzel, who led the international team, said.

Twitter may block account for abusive chats during live broadcasts
"," Twitter is getting tough on those who send abusive comments on its live-streaming platform Periscope as the microblogging site said it would suspend the accounts of such habitual offenders from August 10.
The company will enforce its Periscope Community Guidelines more aggressively by reviewing and suspending accounts of repeat offenders, TechCrunch reported on Saturday. 
“As part of our ongoing effort to build a safer service, we are launching more aggressive enforcement of our guidelines related to chats sent during live broadcasts,” according to a Periscope blog post.
The Periscope Community Guidelines apply to all broadcasts on both Periscope and Twitter, the post added.
Currently, Periscope’s comment moderation policy involves group moderation to determine if someone can continue chatting. 
So when someone reports an abusive comment, Periscope randomly selects a few other viewers to review the comment to determine if it is spam, abuse or appears alright. 
“Starting on August 10, we will also review and suspend accounts for repeatedly sending chats that violate our guidelines. If you are in a broadcast and see a chat that may violate our guidelines, please report it,” the Periscope blog post said.

A look at the history of female video game protagonists "," They have been objectified, relegated to the background, been one-dimensional love interests and damsels in distress. The last few years, however, have seen a change in how women are depicted in video games. We decided to map the long route they took to reach the centre stage of interactive entertainment.
Suited beginnings
When Metroid first débuted in 1986, you got to fight space pirates and monsters as a hero in an androgynous space suit. In a master move by Nintendo, it was a surprise twist at the end that revealed that the character was female. Thus, Samus Aran became one of the first playable female heroes in the gaming world, and she continues to don her iconic suit and kick ass as a galactic hunter for hire to date.




Then came the stoic, strong and super-focused Chun Li, who made her début in Street Fighter II, as one of the first fast fighters. At the same time, Mortal Kombat gave us Sonya Blade. However, these two were just two characters in an ensemble. This would change with the arrival of Tomb Raider.
The Rise of the Tomb Raider
One of the most recognisable female characters in gaming today, Lara Croft was the de-facto sex symbol of the ‘90s. While the first few games were excellent, somehow her depiction was as more of an object than a strong-willed woman. This set in motion a chain reaction of using female protagonists as fuel for prepubescent gamers. The ‘90s, incidentally, also marked a rise in female antagonists, namely SHODAN from System Shock and Ultimecia from Final Fantasy VIII.
As gaming grew up with the times, so did the role of the central female characters. Jill Valentine of Resident Evil fame was one of the first heroes to emerge, as did Aya Brea, Yuna and Aerith from Squaresoft’s iconic games. Lara Croft’s popularity was still undeniably strong, with the character undergoing a successful reinvention. The reboots of the franchise over the last decade have changed our hero into a vulnerable, yet iron-willed individual with purpose, thrown into the dark and gritty world of relic hunting.
To the forefront
In the last few years, games with female protagonists have been etched in our memory. The Uncharted series, despite having an iconic male lead, made room for Elena, Chloe and Nadine to steal the show, with Chloe eventually taking the starring role in The Lost Legacy, widely accepted as one of the best Uncharted games. The traditionally male-dominated Assassin’s Creed also saw the stealthy style of Evie Frye used as a counterpoint to her brash brother in Assassin’s Creed Syndicate.
2017 saw Wonder Woman in theatres, but it also saw Aloy in Horizon Zero Dawn, breaking that stereotypical perfection heroines have to have. Her visual flaws did nothing to take away from her lovable character, great attitude, and excellent robot fighting skills. 




While they have been doing their fair share of shooting and slugging, female leads have been vehicles for some great emotional storytelling as well. The Last of Us let you play as Ellie, a small girl, as she makes her way across zombie-infested cities, surviving not only monsters, but all manner of madness. In the upcoming sequel, we see that she has grown into a formidable fighter, and in a beautiful narrative choice, identifies as gay. Max from Life is Strange is also a similar character, who takes players on a journey where several subjects from sexuality to suicide are maturely tackled.
Smarts and sass
Several games have chosen to go down a more stereotypical route, but have gone to great lengths to add depth to the characters. One example is Bayonetta, a sassy, sexy, fashionista witch, who wears clothes made of her own hair and prefers to accessorise with guns on her hands and feet. She occasionally breaks into over-the-top pole dancing moves, but is always a compelling character, who is not only strong but also highly individualistic, with a serious set of principles. From the same studio as Bayonetta, there is also Nier: Automata, featuring the blindfolded android 2B, a perfect woman made to make jaws drop. However, her personality constantly questions her very existence, making you stop and ponder this very ‘Ghost in the Shell’-like existence and the perversion of creation in her world.




Identify yourself
The upcoming Assassin’s Creed Odyssey lets you choose your own sex, with both sides properly voiced and fleshed out, a trend that was previously reserved for massively multi-player online games and role-playing games.
While we would love to see more games starring characters like Ellie, 2B or Aloy, the prospect of choosing what sex we want to play as or identify with, is refreshing, and takes the experience in a body positive direction, where we have female role models our sons and daughters can respect. After all, it is them who will be playing these games.

Indian-origin mathematician Akshay Venkatesh gets prestigious Fields Medal ","Akshay Venkatesh, a renowned Indian-Australian mathematician, is one of four winners of mathematics’ prestigious Fields medal, known as the Nobel prize for math.
New Delhi-born Venkatesh, 36, who is currently teaching at Stanford University, has won the Fields Medal for his profound contributions to an exceptionally broad range of subjects in mathematics.
The Fields medals are awarded every four years to the most promising mathematicians under the age of 40. The prize was inaugurated in 1932 at the request of Canadian mathematician John Charles Fields, who ran the 1924 Mathematics Congress in Toronto. Each winner receives a 15,000 Canadian-dollar cash prize. At least two, and preferably four people, are always honoured in the award ceremony.



The Hindu Quiz: How well do you know the Fields medal?


The citation for Venkatesh’s medal — awarded on Thursday at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Rio de Janeiro — highlights his profound contributions to an exceptionally broad range of subjects in mathematics and his strikingly far-reaching conjectures.
The other three winners are: Caucher Birkar, a Cambridge University professor of Iranian Kurdish origin; Germany’s Peter Scholze, who teaches at the University of Bonn and Alessio Figalli, an Italian mathematician at ETH Zurich.
Upsetting the celebration, someone stole Birkar’s medal after the awards ceremony. Organizers said they were cooperating with authorities to retrieve the prize.
Birkar, a Kurdish refugee from Iran teaching at Cambridge University, put the gold medal, worth around $4,000, in a briefcase and soon afterward realized that it had been stolen, according to event organizers.
Security officials at the Riocentro venue, Riocentro, found the empty briefcase in a nearby pavillion. Police reviewed security tapes and identified two potential suspects.
“The International Congress of Mathematicians is profoundly sorry about the disappearance of the briefcase belonging to mathematician Caucher Birkar, which contained his Fields Medal from the ceremony this morning,” organizers said in a note.
From being a child prodigy to becoming one of the most renowned researchers in the field of mathematics, Venkatesh’s journey has been full of achievements and accolades.
He moved to Perth, Australia, with his parents when he was 2.
He participated in physics and math Olympiads — the premier international competitions for high school students — and won medals in the two subjects at ages 11 and 12, respectively.
He finished high school when he was 13 and went to the University of Western Australia, graduating with first class honours in mathematics in 1997, at the age of 16.
In 2002, he earned his PhD at the age of 20. Since then, he has gone from holding a post-doctoral position at MIT to becoming a Clay Research Fellow and, now a professor at Stanford University.
Venkatesh has worked at the highest level in number theory, arithmetic geometry, topology, automorphic forms and ergodic theory.
His research has been recognized with many awards, including the Ostrowski Prize, the Infosys Prize, the Salem Prize and Sastra Ramanujan Prize.

A new study of the roundworm (Caenorhabditis elegans) and fruitfly (Drosophila) shows that such traffic jams can be due to purely physical constraints, not involving any chemical signalling processes. Such stalling of cargo can happen in neurons afflicted by neurodegenerative diseases.
A recent study shows that it can happen even in normal cells. This could be a method adopted by the neuron to regulate the flow of mitochondria, vesicles containing neurotransmitters, and the like, along the length of its axon. The axon is the long arm of the neuron, which reaches out to the synapse or nerve endings. The study is published in the journal Traffic.
The researchers compare this to Indian roads. On the road, there are vehicles of several sizes and people walking, all moving on the same narrow lane. If one of these vehicles should stop for some reason, traffic tends to pile up temporarily. It eases out once the vehicle moves on and the traffic jam is cleared. Similar traffic jams of cargo happen in the axon.
Eureka moment
“It was really exciting to see that such traffic jams can happen among the tiny cargo in the brain,” says Parul Sood, first author of the paper, who is a research scholar at Tata Institute of Fundamental Research in Mumbai. When the team was brainstorming to find a way of demonstrating this, she had a “Eureka!” moment: “I quickly went through my data to see if vesicles rushed through the location from where a stationary cargo — the presumed physical block — mobilised, and they did, showing that indeed vesicle motion was physically blocked at that location!”
Apart from the cargo, there are bits of cytoskeleton floating in the body of the axon. This includes microtubules, which are like roads for the cargo to move along. The cargo can halt for any reason, it could be that it has fallen off a microtubule or that it has arrived at the end of the microtubule, or some other reason, leading to an accumulation of cargo.
Dr Sandhya Koushika of TIFR, Mumbai, a co-author, and in whose lab the experiments were performed, explains, “We found that there were particular locations in the cell which were susceptible to forming these accumulations. The most susceptible regions were those that were actin-rich. When you have concentrations of actin, in this region when the cargo stalls, it’s a double whammy. The amount of space allowed for the cargo to move has really shrunk.”
This could be a way to regulate the traffic down the axon. Dr Gautam Menon, from The Institute of Mathematical Sciences, a co-author of the paper, draws an analogy to the Mumbai-Chennai highway. “Suppose you are making things in Mumbai and sending them down to Chennai. Now suppose you want more stuff, you don’t want to send a signal all the way up to Mumbai,” he says. An efficient way to regulate this is to park it along the way in different locations, and summon the cargo when needed. This is not a static accumulation but dynamic.
“Many people, especially biologists, are not greatly attracted to the idea that you may not have classical regulation… [where] something turns on, something turns off and there are changes in levels of protein etc. Here we show it can happen in perfectly healthy neurons with no changes in levels of proteins,” adds Dr Koushika.

Mcr-1 gene seen in K. pneumoniae bacteria
"," Increased prevalence of mcr-1 gene that confers multidrug-resistance has now been reported in Klebsiella pneumoniae bacteria, increasing the fear of infection by pan drug-resistant bugs. This gene endows resistance against last hope antibiotic — colistin. A study published in Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy found that about 10% of the K. pneumoniae bacteria studied were resistant to colistin. 
During January–February 2016, a total of 200 K. pneumoniae isolates from pus, blood, sputum, and urine were studied. Of this, 21 were resistant to colistin, and further screening revealed that four harboured mcr-1 gene.
“This gene was first reported in December 2015 in E. coli isolated from chicken in China, and by 2017 it had spread to all continents and [is] seen in bacteria isolated from humans, chicken and environment,” says Prof. Kashi Nath Prasad from the Department of Microbiology at Sanjay Gandhi Postgraduate Institute of Medical Sciences, Lucknow, and the corresponding author of the work. “Evidence suggests that the overuse of colistin in farm animals has given rise to the emergence of mcr-1 gene. Since this gene is present on a mobile genetic element (plasmid) of bacteria such as E. coli and K. pneumoniae, the frequency of transmission to other bacteria is likely to be very high.”
Molecular studies revealed that one particular isolate carried mcr-1 gene and blaNDM-1 gene. “The blaNDM-1 encodes for a protein that gives resistance to all beta-lactam antibiotics. This shows that the particular isolate was resistant to carbapenems, third-generation cephalosporins, aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin) making the treatment very difficult,” says Sanjay Singh, research scholar at the institute and first author of the work.
Evolved gene
Interestingly, mcr-1 gene was seen in the chromosomal DNA of the bacteria. “The mcr-1 gene is usually found in the plasmid (small DNA in the cytoplasm) and the resistance gene is transmitted among different species. But now we have found this gene in the chromosome showing that it has evolved and stabilised. Whole genome sequence studies are needed to understand the exact location of this gene to decode how they are transmitted from one bacterial species to another,” adds Mr Singh. “The presence of the gene in the chromosome also means that Indian population may be harbouring mcr-1 gene for a longer period of time and it remained undetected.”
Further studies by the group also found that mcr-1 gene was more prevalent in K. pneumoniae than E. coli, which is in stark contrast to findings from other countries. While less than 1% of the E. coli studied was resistant to colistin, it was about 10% in the case of K. pneumoniae. More studies are needed to understand this contrasting behaviour. The team is also looking for this gene in other bacteria causing human infection and its mode of dissemination. 
 “As such K. pneumoniae is considered more notorious and difficult to treat bacterium; hence emergence of mcr-1 gene in this bacterium is a major health-care threat. Adequate measures like total ban on colistin use in veterinary practices as growth promoter and its judicious use in human medicine may prevent the emergence and dissemination of this resistance gene among the bacteria. Preservation of the efficacy of colistin is the need of the hour to treat patients who are infected and likely to be infected by multidrug resistant bacteria,” adds Dr. Prasad in an email to The Hindu.

Dire times for coastal fisheries?
"," The fishing industry along a portion of India’s east coast could be on the brink of a collapse. This dire warning comes as scientists find that fisheries in coastal Tamil Nadu and Puducherry use destructive methods and do not comply with existing regulations, which could stress the already over-exploited fish resources here.
Regulations are crucial in India, the world's second largest fish producer, where large scale motorisation of traditional fishing crafts began since the 1950s. Different categories of crafts – traditional catamarans, fibreglass boats, trawlers – have specifications, from the fishing gear they should employ to the distance they should head out into the sea. But are these rules followed?
GPS data
To generate baseline information on who fishes where in the sea, scientists from the Foundation for Ecological Research, Advocacy and Learning mapped and quantified fish catch, fishing gear, craft and crew details along 120 kilometres of the coasts of Puducherry, Villupuram and Cuddalore districts of Tamil Nadu. They attached global positioning systems to vessels; these, as well as field teams gathered information of over 3,427 fishing trips over 7,945 square kilometres of fishing grounds between June 2012 and June 2013. Their results, published in PLOS ONE on July 11 this year, reveal that there are distinct high-pressure fishing zones and overlapping fishing territories between traditional, motorised and mechanised crafts. Violations of the Marine Fisheries Regulations Act (including not adhering to fishing limits and using illegal fishing gear) are also frequent. The team also presented these results to the fishing community leaders of each village.
“We wanted to initiate discussions among the fishing communities regarding their role in fisheries management, for they adhere to decisions made by their community leaders,” said Tara Lawrence, lead author of the study.
Some of the recommendations made by these communities are listed in the study – such as suggesting that boats stick to their nautical mile limits – and can be achieved with enforcement and could potentially help the marine ecosystem recover, she adds.
According to marine biologist Divya Karnad who was not involved in this study, this work is a critical contribution to the study of small-scale fisheries in India. However, the data is a bit dated; since fisheries are ever-changing, comparisons with the present could offer better insight into change and adaptation in these fisheries, she wrote in an email.
“We need many more such systematic studies that collect long-term data,” she added.

IISER Pune find species can turn invasive in the same ecosystem
"," Invasive species are normally considered to come from outside a given ecosystem. But a study by researchers from the Indian Institute of Science Research and Education (IISER) Pune have shown that selection process for dispersal in fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) can lead to evolution of traits related to invasive potential. So a native species can become invasive in the same ecosystem.
Though the team led by Sutirth Dey from the Institute’s Biology Division did not specifically study for invasion potential of the flies, the experiments they conducted did show the flies acquiring three important traits — increased aggression, exploration and activity — which together is more likely to make them more invasive.
“Faced with vagaries of climate change and habitat destruction, there is an increasing possibility for the evolution of these traits in many mobile organisms,” says Prof. Dey. If dispersal to safer environments is the “first line of defence” for organisms to cope with adversities, becoming an invasive species even within the same ecosystem might be the ugly fallout.
In a study published in June 2017 in Oikos, the researchers subjected four populations, each containing about 2,400 flies, to artificial selection for increased dispersal over 33 generations. This was done by placing the flies in a bottle and connecting it to another using a long pipe. Only the first 50% of flies that moved to the second bottle were allowed to breed. Thus there was a direct selection for dispersal propensity — ability to leave the source area. And every 3-4 generations, the distance between bottles was increased by using a longer tube. This was done to mimic increased habitat fragmentation.
Dispersal traits
Within 10 generations of selection, the dispersal propensity and ability to travel long distances was significantly greater in the selected flies than the controls. The selected fruit flies displayed the similar characteristics after 20 generations.
“We checked for dispersal propensity in the 10th and 20th generation without food and water, which was similar to the selection procedure. The absence of food and water acted as drivers and led to increased dispersal propensity in the flies,” says Sudipta Tung. “Then we became more ambitious and wanted to check whether the flies dispersed even in the absence of an external driver for dispersal. Even in the presence of food and water, we found that after 33 generations, the selected flies still displayed greater propensity and ability to disperse.”
“Even when there was no reason for selected flies to disperse [due to presence of food], they were still dispersing. So dispersal had become constitute,” he says.
The propensity to disperse was same in both sexes but males dispersed to longer distances than females. They also found that the selected population had larger number of flies that travelled long distances.
When organisms evolve in response to selection for greater dispersal the body size tends to become bigger. But in a paper published two days ago in Evolution, they found that selection did not lead to any increase in body size in both sexes. The studies were carried out using flies from 49-69 generations.
Selection for dispersal is likely to be at the expense of fecundity and longevity, but neither was observed. 
Behavioural traits
“But we observed distinct changes in three behavioural traits — activity, exploration and aggression. And these three traits are closely related to the invasive potential of a species,” says Tung. “Other research groups have shown that these behaviours are found associated with invasive potential in some species.”
The selected flies exhibited greater activity than the controls and this increased activity was seen in the absence and presence of food. After 24 hours, the activity of the selected flies was significantly more than the control males but the time spent resting and quality of rest/sleep were the same in the selected flies and controls.
The selected flies also exhibited greater exploratory tendency. This tendency helps the species to survive in a new environment. In many species, there is a strong relationship between exploration and invasion.
The selected flies exhibited greater aggression. Aggression helps species to retain resources and mates or gain new ones. But in the experiments carried out by the researchers, the flies exhibited elevated aggression even though there was no obvious fitness advantage. The selected flies did not have to compete with native flies either. “In our experiment, aggression has likely evolved as a correlated response of dispersal evolution,” they write. 
In collaboration with Dr. Kavita Dorai from the Department of Physical Sciences at IISER Mohali, the researchers looked at what was responsible for the change in behavioural traits. “Since dispersal is a complex process, it is difficult to figure out the genes responsible for it. So we looked at the changes in the levels of the underlying metabolites,” says Prof. Dey.
Octopamine, a neurotransmitter, was significantly elevated — 2.2 fold higher — in the selected flies. “The elevated octopamine level explains the underlying mechanism behind the observed changes in behavioural traits in the selected flies,” Prof. Dey says. 
Dispersal is an energy intensive process. The selected flies showed increased levels of cellular respiration to meet increased energy demand. There was increase in the levels of Adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is the energy currency for cells. Other energy-related molecules too were elevated in the selected flies.

NASA names Sunita Williams, 8 others, for first space flights on commercial spacecraft
"," Indian-origin U.S. astronaut Sunita Williams is among the nine astronauts named by NASA who will fly the first missions into space on commercially provided rockets and capsules, starting next year.
 After years of vehicle development and building anticipation, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has now put the crew in commercial crew spacecraft.
The space agency announced on Friday that the nine astronauts will launch on the first crewed test flights and missions of new commercial spacecraft built and operated by The Boeing Company and SpaceX.
“Future Commercial Crew astronauts will be riding to space on partner vehicles built by SpaceX & BoeingSpace,” NASA said in a tweet.
“We are on the brink of launching American astronauts on American rockets from American soil,” said NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine during the ‘Launch America’ announcement.
 The eight active NASA astronauts and one former astronaut-turned-corporate crew member will launch on Boeing CST-100 Starliner and SpaceX Dragoncapsules to the International Space Station beginning in 2019.
 The missions will mark the first crewed launches from U.S. soil since the end of the space shuttle programme in 2011.
“Today, our country’s dreams of greater achievements in space are within our grasp. This accomplished group of American astronauts, flying on new spacecraft developed by our commercial partners Boeing and SpaceX, will launch a new era of human spaceflight,” Mr. Bridenstine said. 
He said the announcement advances “our great American vision” and strengthens America’s leadership in space.
 NASA has worked closely with the companies throughout design, development and testing to ensure the systems meet its safety and performance requirements.
“The men and women we assign to these first flights are at the forefront of this exciting new time for human spaceflight,” said Mark Geyer, director of NASA’s Johnson Space Center in Houston.
“It will be thrilling to see our astronauts lift off from American soil, and we can’t wait to see them aboard the International Space Station,” Mr. Geyer said.
 In addition to naming the crews of the test flights, NASA also announced the four astronauts who will fly aboard the first operational Starliner and Dragon missions to the space station. Both vehicles were developed in cooperation with NASA to deliver crew members to and from the orbiting laboratory.
 Josh Cassada, 45, will fly with Sunita (“Suni”) Williams, 52, aboard NASA’s first contracted Starliner mission. It will be Mr. Cassada’s first spaceflight. Ms. Williams previously logged 321 days in orbit on two stays aboard the space station, most recently returning to the Earth in 2012.
 The commercial crew members took to the stage during an event led by Bridenstine at the agency’s Johnson Space Center in Houston.
 NASA astronauts Robert Behnken, 48, and Douglas Hurley, 51, will fly together as SpaceX’s first Dragon crew.
 Veterans of two spaceflights each, Mr. Behnken and Mr. Hurley will lift off atop a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from the Kennedy Space Center’s Pad 39A — the same Florida launch pad where the space shuttle left Earth for the last time in July 2011 with Mr. Hurley as pilot.
 NASA astronauts Eric Boe, 53, and Nicole Mann, 41, will join the commander of that same final space shuttle mission, former astronaut and now Boeing executive Christopher Ferguson, 56, as the crew of the Starliner test flight, launching atop a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket from Complex 41 at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida.
 Mr. Ferguson, who has been involved from the start in the Starliner’s development, flew three shuttle missions as a NASA astronaut. Mr. Boe piloted two shuttle flights. This will be Ms. Mann’s first launch, having joined the astronaut corps in 2013.
 Mr. Behnken, Mr. Hurley, Mr. Boe and Ms. Mann are NASA’s first astronauts to be named to the test flights of new U.S. spacecraft since the March 1978 announcement of the space shuttle’s first orbital flight test crews. Mr. Ferguson will become the first former NASA astronaut to return to orbit as a company’s crew member when he flies.
 Prior to their maiden crewed missions, both Boeing and SpaceX plan uncrewed test flights in late 2018 or early 2019.
 Both companies will also conduct abort system test flights to ensure the astronauts can safely escape should their rockets go awry.
 Victor Glover, 42, and Michael Hopkins, 49, will fly on the first operational mission of SpaceX’s crewed Dragon. It will be Mr. Glover’s first time in space. Mr. Hopkins logged 166 days aboard the space station in 2014.
 The two pairs of NASA crewmates will fly to the station with Russian cosmonauts and international astronauts to be announced at a later date. Between the end of the space shuttle program and the start of commercial crew operations, NASA’s crew members have and are continuing to launch to the space station on Russian Soyuz spacecraft.
Mr. Behnken, Mr. Boe, Mr. Hurley and Mr. Williams were named in 2015 as NASA’s “commercial crew cadre” and have been working with Boeing and SpaceX on the development of the spacecraft and the simulators that will be used to train astronauts to fly.
 Boeing’s and SpaceX’s commercial spacecraft may also open the space station — and more broadly, Earth orbit — to more privately-funded visitors and spaceflight participants from countries that do not have their own domestic crewed spacecraft and rockets.

E-tattoos to help monitor health "," Chinese scientists have developed skin-like electronic tattoos, that can be used to monitor health parameters such as blood pressure and body temperature in real time.
 The graphene-based electronic tattoo, developed by scientists from the Tsinghua University in China, can be easily transferred onto various surfaces such as the human skin, leaves and silk. Graphene, a super thin material with excellent flexibility and conductivity, is an ideal material for electronic skin, researchers said.
 It could also be attached to masks and throats to measure body signals such as breathing, heartbeat and voice, according to the research published in the journal ACS Nano.
The electronic skin exhibits high sensitivity and long-term stability. It can withstand higher temperatures and is comfortable to wear, ‘Xinhua’ reported.
 With laser scribing technology, the pattern of the graphene-based electronic skin can be personalised, a feature that will help future commercialisation.
 The electronic skin has huge potential in health care and intelligent systems, scientists said.

Centre mulls ways to block mobile apps
","The Centre has asked telecom service providers to explore possible ways to block mobile applications such as Facebook and WhatsApp “as per the provisions of the IT Act, 2000.”
In a letter dated July 18, the Department of Telecom “once again requested” operators and Internet service providers “to explore various possible options and confirm how Instagram, Facebook, WhatsApp, Telegram and such other mobile applications can be blocked on the Internet.” Without clarifying the reason for the request, the DoT has said, “Issues have been raised by MeITY (Ministry of Electronics and IT) and LEAs (Law Enforcement Agencies) for blocking certain mobile apps like Instagram/ Facebook/ Whatsapp/ Telegram.”
“This issue was also raised during the meeting on July 4, 2018, wherein technical inputs were sought from TSPs/ISPs to explore possibility of certain mobile applications,” the letter said. The July 4 meeting, according to an industry representative present, was mainly on putting a stop to child abuse/pornography and to curb the spread of fake news. An industry source said the discussions centred around blocking these applications in an emergency, rather than blocking access to the Internet as a whole. “For example, in Jammu & Kashmir, we have Internet blackout. So, there was a discussion on whether just some social media applications could be blocked instead.”
A source in the DoT said that there is no move to block any apps. ""MeitY has informed DoT that blocking such apps during emergency situations are difficult as they work through multiple IP addresses and on different protocols, and hence there is a need for a reasonable good solution to protect national security."" 
The source added, ""Being the licensing authority DoT has initiated the discussion based on a letter received from the Group Coordinator, Cyber Law Division (MeitY) during the second week of July.""

The Banner Saga 3: Viking goodbye
"," 

While the giants of gaming usually play it safe, it’s the small studios and development teams that are brave enough to try something outrageous and magical. Stoic Studio is one such outfit. Comprised of former BioWare employees, they released the incredible Banner Saga. A hand-drawn epic that captured everyone’s hearts, so much so they released a sequel, and now the end to the trilogy. The Banner Saga 3 is a triumph in gaming, and a slap in the face to anyone who scoffs at gaming not being an art form.
What is it about?
For a game that is as story-heavy as The Banner Saga is, you’ll need to start from part one to make any sense of the third. Fortunately, Stoic has re-released the other games on all systems, but the game is especially good on the portable Nintendo Switch.
The Banner Saga is set in a Viking world that’s stuck in perpetual twilight. As the game drives you through the story, everything gets darker, and the narrative convincingly makes you feel like you are at the very edge of utter extinction. 
You truly feel for your band of characters, where every decision is well-placed and carries definitive weight. 




Once you start off on the story of one, there’s no way you can stop until you reach the end of three. Each loss hits hard, and every win tastes great, but is short-lived. The games are not too long, understandable, considering each story vignette is beautifully hand-crafted and acted out. The story is well-paced, and there’s almost no filler or bloat content employed to cheaply increase game length.
How does it play?
If you’ve played tactical RPG games like Final Fantasy Tactics, Disgaea or Tactics Ogre, then you will be at home with the mechanics of The Banner Saga 3.
Essentially, battles take place on a chess-like grid, where you move your heroes around and execute attacks. While it’s slow-paced, the incredible animated characters as well as the rich strategy of The Banner Saga will keep you hooked. It is tough though, and with each game up until 3, there are new mechanics and new enemy types to contend with.
The story puts you not only as a tactician in battle, but you also play a pivotal role as the leader of the factions. You will need to make decisions that impact the lives of people and push you along different paths in the story. The pace is relentless and The Banner Saga 3 stacks a palpable tension of battles and decisions that is worthy of a final act in the epic.
Now for the best part of the game, the art style. The Banner Saga series is hand-drawn, with beautiful character art which is inspired from the work of Ralph Bakshi, who attempted an animated The Lord of the Rings in the 70s, and Don Bluth, a prominent animator at Disney. Known for their unique styles, which are captured beautifully with Viking-like backgrounds. Every frame looks breathtaking and like it belongs in an art book. The sound design is incredible and the soundtrack by Austin Wintory is haunting. The Banner Saga is a breath of fresh winter air in an industry of same old, same old.




Should you get it?
It’s rich in story with an unforgiving tactical combat mechanic that may not appeal to everyone. Though if you want something deep to keep you company on your morning commute on the Switch, or challenges you while playing on your HDTV or PC, then you’re in for a real treat with The Banner Saga 3. Whatever you choose, just make sure you choose to play the entire trilogy, or you will end up not liking it.

The JBL Go 2: A functional tool
"," On first look, the JBL Go 2 speaker appears like a box of mints and also reminds us of the small plugin radio sets of the early 2000s. The kind of devices that were cheap and offered a chance to browse through FM channels and check the occasional cricket score. However, the speaker is well-designed, sturdy and small enough to easily fit into the pocket of your jeans or backpack. It also looks good, and remained steady on different kinds of surfaces without giving any trouble. A small blue light on top flashes when the device is switched on. We also liked the design elements, like the gently-curved edges.
The power button, Bluetooth switch and volume controls are on the top of the device and are fairly user-friendly. A flap on the right-hand side covers the micro USB charging port and an audio input, presumably as part of the water-resistance function.
The music test
The key test for any speaker is good audio quality. On this front, the Go 2 performs much better than average. The audio quality does well for most forms of movies, music and podcasts and worked much better than standard laptop speakers. The vocal quality is clear and can be easily heard in a large room. However, the speaker does not work too well with songs that have a lot of bass, especially at higher volumes. The functional built-in microphone is an added bonus.
On battery life, the device lasts for approximately five to six hours at low and moderate volume levels. It does take three hours to completely recharge. Syncing to devices is smooth and the review device hardly gave us any trouble on that account. The audio cable should help in case of any issues with syncing.
The verdict
If you are someone who loves watching movies on tablets or listening to podcasts, this device would be a great companion. 
It does its work with ease and does not give the user much reason to complain on the performance front. At ₹2,999, it is affordable as well.

IIT-Madras powers up a desi chip
","These are the kind of chips that India always wanted, but could not make. Now, computer scientists and a student team from the IIT- Madras have developed the first of a family of six industry-standard microprocessors.
The initial batch of 300 chips, named RISECREEK and produced under Project Shakti, have been fabricated free at Intel’s facility at Oregon, U.S., to run the Linux operating system.
The IIT team says its microprocessors can be adapted by others, as the design is open source. They optimise power use and compete with international units such as the Cortex A5 from Advanced RISC Machines (ARM).
On the test bench, the IIT design fared better than the A5, measured in terms of the DMIPS per megahertz rating, scoring 1.68 against the competition’s 1.57. At a frequency of 350 MHz, RISECREEK can meet the demands of defence and strategic equipment such as NAVIC (Indian Regional Navigation Satellite) and Internet of Things (IoT) electronics, its developers say. “Our process helps us develop the processor three times sooner than industry standards,” says Kamakoti Veezhinathan, Professor of Computer Science at the IIT- Madras, who led the project.
What makes RISECREEK different is the open source nature of the designs. “This is made in India, but even if it were made in the U.S., it would be contemporary,” says G.S. Madhusudan, project adviser from the IIT- Madras.
The team, led by Dr. Neel Gala, an alumnus of the IIT- Madras, is thrilled, not just because it developed a viable industry grade chip, but also because the process can be tapped for future efforts in semiconductors. “The Shakti plan started in 2014 as an IIT-M initiative. Last year, the Union Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology funded a part of the project,” says Dr. Kamakoti.
The plan includes a family of six types of microprocessors. The first to be ready is the C class, RISECREEK. The E class of microprocessors that can be used in smart cards, IoT devices, fan/motor controls, etc, is almost ready and the I class, which can be used for mobile phones, desktops and mobile phones is soon to follow. The design for the S class which can be used for enterprise class servers is underway, and the H class, which will be used for building High Performance computers with a massive parallel processing capacity.
The H Class is part of the next phase of development, which the team calls the Para-SHAKTI (parallel SHAKTI) project. Para-SHAKTI will make microprocessors for indigenous high-performance computers with over 32 SHAKTI cores.
“The Shakti project is not aimed at only building processors. It also aims to build high speed interconnects for servers and supercomputers based on variants of the RapidiIO and GenZ standards. These are key to build large clusters of processors to get Petaflop and Exaflop level supercomputers,” says Mr. Madhusudan.
With a team of about eight students and three computer scientists, the team used BlueSpec System Verilog language to capture the processor functionality. Everything from that to making the final chip layout was done within the campus. The chip layout was sent to Oregon, to be fabricated by Intel. Once that was done, mounting the chip on a 10-layer verification board and bringing up the chip was done again at IIT Madras. The board bring- up and booting Linux was done in four days. “There are 70 million instructions from the point we switch on the system till the prompt comes. The chip executed these instructions without any bug at the first shot. This gives a lot of confidence to move ahead,” says Dr. Kamakoti.
Intel has fabricated the chip free of cost, and the team incurred a development cost of about ₹1.2 Crore. Regarding vulnerabilities due to outsourcing the fabrication of the chip, he says, “Since the entire design has been developed in-house, it is extremely difficult for a foundry to add backdoors or security vulnerabilities. But yes, an external fab can always induce vulnerabilities. A probable solution for this is to move towards a controlled fab.”

“ We are also working with a number of other partners to launch or upgrade devices to Android 9 this year,” he added.
“We’ve built Android 9 to learn from you — and work better for you — the more you use it. From predicting your next task so you can jump right into the action you want to take, to prioritising battery power for the apps you use most, to helping you disconnect from your phone at the end of the day, Android 9 adapts to your life and the ways you like to use your phone,” Google said.
Smart settings
The Android 9 comes with features like adaptive battery, which learns the apps users’ use most and prioritises battery use for them, and adaptive brightness, which learns how users like to set the brightness in different settings.
“Making your phone smarter and more adaptive is important, but we also want Android to be easier to use and more approachable. In Android 9, we’ve introduced a new system navigation featuring a single home button.” Mr. Samat said.
This is especially helpful as phones grow taller and it is more difficult to get things done on the phone with one hand, Google added.

‘Primitives enjoyed scent of early flowers’
","The flower-based compounds behind the perfumes and colognes you enjoy have been eliciting olfactory excitement since dinosaurs walked the Earth, a study has found.
Researchers at Oregon State University in the U.S. found evidence that floral scents originated in primitive flowers as far back as 100 million years ago as pollinator attractants. They still play the role even though today’s flowers also have colourful petals for luring pollinators, according to the study published in the journal Historical Biology.
“I bet some of the dinosaurs could have detected the scents of these early flowers,” said George Poinar, an entomologist at Oregon State University. “In fact, floral essences from these early flowers could even have attracted these giant reptiles,” said Mr. Poinar.
The researchers examined amber flowers from Myanmar, including the now extinct glandular laurel flower (Cascolaurus burmensis) and veined star flower (Tropidogyne pentaptera).
Without colourful petals, flowers from early period had to rely solely on scents to attract pollinators. “You can’t detect scents or analyse the chemical components of fossil flowers, but you can find the tissues responsible for the scents,” said Mr. Poinar.
The study also found that secretory tissues of these Cretaceous flowers are similar in structure to those of their modern descendants. That suggests modern and ancient flowers of the same lineages produced similar essences.
Some of flowers studied were even in the process of emitting compounds at the time they were engulfed by the tree resin that later became amber.

Forty-five new exoplanets discovered
"," Scientists have discovered a trove of forty-four planets in solar systems beyond our own in one go, dwarfing the usual number of confirmations from extrasolar surveys. 
The findings will improve existing models of solar systems, and may help researchers investigate exoplanet atmospheres.
 Novel techniques developed to validate the find could accelerate the confirmation of more extrasolar planet candidates.
 Astronomers pooled data from NASA’s Kepler and the ESA’s Gaia space telescopes. They confirmed existence of these 44 exoplanets and described various details about them.
A portion of the findings yield some surprising characteristcs.
“For example, four of the planets orbit their host stars in less than 24 hours,” said John Livingston, a graduate student at the University of Tokyo in Japan.
“In other words, a year on each of those planets is shorter than a day here on Earth,” said Livingston, lead author of the study.
 These contribute to a small but growing list of “ultrashort-period” planets, suggesting that they could be more common than previously believed.
 

What are exoplanets?


“Sixteen were in the same size class as Earth, one in particular turning out to be extremely small - about the size of Venus - which was a nice affirmation, as it’s close to the limit of what is possible to detect,” said Livingston.
 Scientists hope to understand what kinds of planets might be out there, but can only draw valid conclusions if there are enough planets for robust statistical analysis.
 The addition of a large number of new planets, therefore, leads directly to a better theoretical understanding of solar system formation, researchers said.
 The planets also provide good targets for detailed individual studies to yield measurements of planetary composition, interior structure and atmospheres - in particular, the 18 planets in several multi-planet systems.
“The investigation of other solar systems can help us understand how planets and even our own solar system formed. The study of other worlds has much to teach us about our own,” said Livingston.

Docile or hostile?: 'Domestication' genes found in foxes
","A six-decade breeding experiment with foxes designed to shed light on how wolves became dogs has led to the discovery of genes that favour tame or aggressive behaviour, scientists said on August 6.
Comparing the sequenced genomes of foxes selected across 50 generations for their friendliness towards people with another group bred for hostility uncovered dozens of telltale differences, including one gene in particular, they reported in the journal Nature Ecology & Evolution.
""We were able to show that a specific gene"" — known as SorCS1 — ""does have an effect on behaviour, making foxes more tame,"" lead author Anna Kukekova, an assistant professor at the University of Illinois, told AFP. ""That's a big result — it's hard to make that connection.""
The findings are also relevant to human behaviour. Some of the genetic regions identified, for example, correspond to autism and bipolar disorders, while others are associated with William-Beuren syndrome, which causes pathologically outgoing, friendly behaviour.
The backstory to the fox study begins more than half a century ago, when the origins of animal domestication were poorly understood and hotly contested. In 1959, Russian biologist Dmitri Belyaev decided to test his theory that genes played a more important role than human interaction in the gradual metamorphosis of wolves into the man's-best-friend subspecies we call dogs.
At the same time, Nobel laureate Konrad Lorenz, a pioneer in the study of aggression in animals and humans, argued that new-born wolf puppies raised with tender loving human care would become docile and domesticated. Belyaev suspected otherwise, and choose Vulpes vulpes — a.k.a. the red or silver fox — to make his case. Russia was full of fox farms which raised and harvested the animals for their fur, offering the perfect opportunity for a large-scale experiment, he reasoned.
""Farm-bred foxes were not domesticated,"" said Kukekova, an evolutionary geneticist who began studying the animals 16 years ago. ""If you try to touch them, they show fear and aggression,"" much as in the wild.
Belyaev found a large farm willing to cooperate, and began to systematically select foxes that exhibited the least stress and fear around people, repeating the process with each new generation. ""After only 10 generations, they got a few puppies that wagged their tail just like dogs when they saw people, even when there was no food,"" Kukekova said. ""They were just happy to see humans.""
Today, all of the 500 breeding pairs in the tame group are at ease in the presence of humans, even if they are not as domesticated as dogs.




Around 1970, Belyaev's team at the Russian Institute of Cytology and Genetics added a group of foxes, selected for their aggressiveness, and a third control group with a random mix. For the new study, Kukekova and two dozen colleagues sequenced the genomes of 10 foxes from each of the three groups.
""The game changer for us was the development of next-generation sequencing technology,"" she said.
Earlier genetic sweeps yielded chunks of code with dozens or hundreds of genes, making it impossible to isolate those that mattered. This time, the researchers pinpointed 103 relevant genetic regions.
Significantly, more than 60 % of the tame animals — including those in the control group — shared the same variant of SorCS1. Among the aggressive foxes, that variant was entirely absent.
The study also revealed that different genes are responsible for very specific behaviours. ""For example, when foxes greet people by wagging their tail, it seems to be determined by different genes than those responsible for allowing a human to touch a fox's belly,"" Kukekova said.
And whether a fox wants to prolong an interaction with a human is governed by yet another bit of genetic code.

NASA counts down to launch of first spacecraft to ‘touch Sun’ "," NASA counted down on Friday to the launch of a $ 1.5 billion spacecraft that aims to plunge into the Sun’s sizzling atmosphere and become humanity’s first mission to explore a star.
The car-sized Parker Solar Probe is scheduled to blast off on a Delta IV Heavy rocket from Cape Canaveral, Florida early on Saturday.
 The 65-minute launch window opens at 3:33 am (local time), and the weather forecast is 70 percent favorable for takeoff, NASA said.
 The probe’s main goal is to unveil the secrets of the corona, the unusual atmosphere around Sun.
 Not only is the corona about 300 times hotter than the Sun’s surface, it also hurls powerful plasma and energetic particles that can unleash geomagnetic space storms and disrupt Earth’s power grid.
“The Parker Solar Probe will help us do a much better job of predicting when a disturbance in the solar wind could hit Earth,” said Justin Kasper, one of the project scientists and a professor at the University of Michigan.
 The probe is protected by an ultra-powerful heat shield that is just 4.5 inches thick (11.43 centimeters).
 The shield should enable the spacecraft to survive its close shave with the center of our solar system, coming within 3.83 million miles (6.16 million km) of the Sun’s surface.
 The heat shield is built to withstand radiation equivalent up to about 500 times the Sun’s radiation here on Earth.
 Even in a region where temperatures can reach more than a million degrees Fahrenheit, the sunlight is expected to heat the shield to just around 2,500 degrees Fahrenheit (1,371 degrees Celsius).
 Scorching, yes? But if all works as planned, the inside of the spacecraft should stay a cooler 85 F (29 C).
 The goal for the Parker Solar Probe is to make 24 passes through the corona during its seven-year mission.
“The sun is full of mysteries,” said Nicky Fox, project scientist at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Lab.
“We are ready. We have the perfect payload. We know the questions we want to answer.” 
The tools on board will measure the expanding corona and continually flowing atmosphere known as the solar wind, which solar physicist Eugene Parker first described back in 1958.
 Parker, now 91, recalled that at first, some people did not believe in his theory.
 But then, the launch of NASA’s Mariner 2 spacecraft in 1962 - becoming the first robotic spacecraft to make a successful planetary encounter - proved them wrong.
“It was just a matter of sitting out the deniers for four years until the Venus Mariner 2 spacecraft showed that, by golly, there was a solar wind,” Parker said earlier this week.
 He added that he is “impressed” by the Parker Solar Probe, calling it “a very complex machine.” Scientists have wanted to build a spacecraft like this for more than 60 years, but only in recent years did the heat shield technology advance enough to be capable of protecting sensitive instruments, according to Fox.
 Tools on board will measure high energy particles associated with flares and coronal mass ejections, as well as the changing magnetic field around the Sun.
“We will also be listening for plasma waves that we know flow around when particles move,” Fox added.
“And last but not least, we have a white light imager that is taking images of the atmosphere right in front of the Sun.” When it nears the Sun, the probe will travel rapidly enough to go from New York to Tokyo in one minute - some 700,000 km per hour, making it the fastest human-made object.

Indian telescope spots distant radio galaxy
","Astronomers have used an Indian telescope to discover the most distant radio galaxy ever known, located at a distance of 12 billion light-years.
 The galaxy, from a time when the universe was only 7% of its current age was found using the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) in Pune.
 GMRT is an array of thirty fully steerable parabolic radio telescopes of 45-metre diameter. It is operated by the National Centre for Radio Astrophysics.
 The distance to this galaxy was determined using the Gemini North telescope in Hawaii and the Large Binocular Telescope in Arizona.
 The galaxy is perceived as it looked when the universe was only a billion years old, according to the study appearing in the journal Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society.
 This also means that the light from this galaxy is almost 12 billion years old.
 “It is very surprising how these galaxies have built up their mass in such a short period of time,” said Aayush Saxena from Leiden Observatory in the Netherlands.
 “Bright radio galaxies harbour supermassive black holes. It is amazing to find such objects as early in the history of the universe; the time for these supermassive black holes to form and grow must have been very short,” said Huub Rottgering, also from Leiden Observatory.
Black hole at the centre
 Radio galaxies are very rare objects in the universe. They are colossal galaxies with a supermassive black hole in their centre that actively accretes gas and dust from its surroundings.
 This activity initiates the launch of high-energy jet streams, which are capable of accelerating charged particles around the supermassive black hole to almost the speed of light.
 The discovery of such galaxies at extremely large distances is important for our understanding of the formation and evolution of galaxies, researchers said.

Nanoparticles therapy a double blow to cancer ","A new cancer therapy using nanoparticles to deliver a combination therapy direct to cancer cells could be on the horizon, scientists say. 
The therapy, which has been shown to make breast cancer and prostate cancer tumours more sensitive to chemotherapy, is now close to entering clinical trials, said researchers from the University of East Anglia in the U.K.
A study, published in the journal Scientific Reports, confirmed that it can be mass-produced, making it a viable treatment if proved effective in human trials.
The technology is the first of its kind to use nanoparticles to deliver two drugs in combination to target cancer cells.
The drugs, already approved for clinical use, are an anti-cancer drug called docetaxel, and fingolimod, which is used to treat multiple sclerosis.
 “So far nobody has been able to find an effective way of using fingolimod in cancer patients because it’s so toxic in the blood,” said Dmitry Pshezhetskiy from UEA.
 “We have found a way to use it that solves the toxicity problem, enabling these two drugs to be used in a highly targeted and powerful combination,” he said.

Actual problems are solved only by ‘whole men’ ","“If you have ever had a medical procedure, chances are you are benefited from the arts. The stethoscope was invented by a French flautist–physician named Rene Laennec who recorded his first observations of heart sounds in musical notation”. Thus begins an article by the physiologist Dr Robert Root-Bernstein in the July 6, 2018 issue of Science. He discusses how incorporating the humanities, arts, crafts and design into curricula makes better scientists. He points to the recent report released by the Board on Higher Education and Workforce of the US National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine (NASEM), which has recommended that humanities, arts, crafts, and design (HACD) be integrated with science, technology, engineering, mathematics and medicine (STEMM). Dr Root-Bernstein quotes the developmental biologist Conrad Waddington, who said: “The acute problems of the world can be solved only by whole men, not by people who refuse to be, publicly, anything more than a technologist or a scientist or an artist”; and Professor Charles West, President of the US National Academy of Engineering, who says: “Engineering systems cannot be wisely envisioned, designed or deployed without an understanding of society, culture, politics, economics, and communications - in other words, the very stuff of the liberal arts and also of the social sciences”.
India produces over 1.5 million engineering graduates every year, from 3,345 colleges and institutes. Sadly, a major portion of these graduates are not employable. As Ms. Maria Thomas wrote in the Economic Times last year, the rapid growth of India’s IT industry during the last three decades had led thousands of students, often pushed by their parents, to pursue a profession that often guaranteed wealth, status - and with same luck, a one way ticket out of the country. Likewise India produces 52,000 doctors (MBBS degree) every year from about 1,700 medical colleges. Over 6.3 lakh students take the pre-medical entrance tasks, and a significant number among them manage to get into private colleges, paying hefty sums. Here again, it is the parental push for better future for their children. The quality of most doctors, particularly in small towns and rural areas is well known. Most of them are ignoramuses when it comes to HACD. These are not what Dr Waddington termed as “whole men”.
Where does the deficiency lie? Right at the school level. Over the last seven decades, governments - both central and state - have abused the school system by fiddling around with the curricula, depriving schools of much needed money, appointing ill-qualified teachers through quota systems (many of them not bothering to come to schools), playing with the syllabus and myriad other modes of interference. Education analysts such as Pratham have shown that the government school system is so bad that an eighth class student cannot solve a fifth class problem, and a fifth class student is unable to answer a third class question. People have preferred sending their children to private schools, and these are money-making machines, not easily affordable by the lower middle class families. This, combined with the need for steady jobs and income for the child once he/she graduates, has played havoc with our education system, Thus were born coaching centres, run by the politically connected, which take students right at the secondary school level and send them through tortuous courses so that they may pass engineering and medical entrance examinations. And in none of these coach centres, nor in the schools, are students taught HCAD at any level, and those who successfully come out of these mechanised teaching factories are absorbed in the NITs, IITs or medical colleges, but with no ‘soft skills’. It is high time that the school system is revamped and HACD introduced from the very beginning.
It is with this deficiency in mind that the IITs, BITS Pilani, Manipal Academy of Higher Education, and a few others, have tried to make up through the introduction of ‘core courses’ in the first few semesters, where the students are taught language, literature, humanities and social sciences, arts and crafts, and design. Happily enough, several IITs now have actual departments in some of these subjects (besides technology and science departments) where faculty members teach and also do research in areas of HACD. (One beautiful example of this was the design of the convocation robes designed at the IIT Hyderabad last week, using Ikat stoles made by local weavers). These core courses at IITs and BITS are of some help. Similarly Christian Medical College at Vellore requires their graduating doctors to spend a year in rural India. Working in villages gives the young scholar a perspective of the community, its needs and its talents and enriches the mind. And professional IT companies offer months-long sessions to their trainees in generic and stream learning plus “soft skills”. What about the other technological and medical institutions?
Sadly, the Central Ministry of Higher Education does not appreciate the value of liberal arts and HCAD. A glaring display of this has been the identification of four institutions of technology, and one “green field” institute yet to be made, as Institutions of Eminence. Tellingly, not one university or institute devoted to HACD was thought of as eminent! What the government decides is eminent is at variance with what the professional scholars think.
Given this disconnect, here is one suggestion: why should some of these ‘green field’ institutes not concentrate on HCAD rather than more technology-based ones? Better yet, rather than start institutes, establish Trusts that catalyse and promotes HCAD?

Paleo-rivers predated Harappans by 35,000 years
","A recent study on direct dating of sediments extracted from paleochannels close to Harappan sites in the region of Sutlej-Yamuna interfluve by a team of scientists from the Physical Research Laboratory, Ahmedabad (PRL) and CNRS, France, indicate that these rivers changed their course nearly 35,000 years before the Harappans came to settle there.
Along with a 2017 paper in Nature Communications by A. Singh from IIT Kanpur and others, this study now provides scientific evidence that contradicts the suggestions on Harappans flourishing on the banks of the mythical Vedic rivers, Sarasvati and Drishadvati. These studies provide evidence that these rivers changed their course much before the time of Harappan settlements about 5,000 years ago. The study was published recently in Quaternary Geochronology.
The discovery of several hundred Harappan sites in the Sutlej–Yamuna interfluves led archaeologists to infer that like other ancient civilisations, Harappans too flourished on the banks of mighty rivers. Presence of ephemeral rivers Ghaggar-Hakra and Chautang in this area led people to suggest that these were vestiges of the once mighty glacial rivers on whose banks the Harappan civilisation was established. This gained popularity when a paleo-channel (ancient remains of rivers) was discovered in this region.
The naming of a paleo-channel and associating it with archaeological sites irked the curiosity of Prof. A.K. Singhvi from PRL. “To me this appeared unrealistic and far-fetched. A ballpark analysis of Harappan site per unit time indicated that the numbers of settlements to be supported [by a large river] were too few and the need to invoke a mighty river was somewhat misplaced,” he says.
For over three decades many papers were written but this premise was not tested scientifically using modern dating techniques till now.
This study analysed the distribution of Harappan sites along the two main rivers in the region – the Indus, which is perennial, and the Ghaggar-Hakra, which is ephemeral; examined the mineralogy of river sediments to establish their source and dated the entire sediment succession of the region using dating technique to establish the event chronology of the evolution of the region.
The authors conclude thus: “Settlement patterns and other analysis suggest that factors other than perennial rivers dictated their [Harappan’s] settlement” and that, “Major change in the river dynamics occurred between 24,000-45,000 years ago (most likely around 40,000-45,000 years ago), and since 25,000 years the landscape has not changed significantly.”
Prof Singhvi, who led the study, states that ipso-facto this study implies that so called paleo-river features are far too old to be associated with Vedic times.
“Care should be taken in making a linear association of river hydrology with abundance of archeological sites,” he says.
He points out that this inference is also buttressed by the evidences of water harvesting techniques of Harappans, the cropping patterns suggesting their dependence on seasonal monsoon rather than constant supply of water.

IGIB team finds a new target to reverse iron overload disease ","Using zebrafish, researchers at the Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (CSIR-IGIB) have successfully discovered a pathway that regulates hepcidin hormone production. The hepcidin hormone, released by the liver, is a central regulator of iron in the body. Dysregulation of the hormone leads to anaemia on one hand and excess iron accumulation in organs such as liver and heart leading to multi-organ failure.
Hemochromatosis is a rare hereditary disease that is characterised by iron accumulation or overload in various tissues. The symptoms are non-specific and hence difficult to diagnose. Current options only manage the disease by removing excess iron. “One method is to bleed the patients and the other is to absorb iron using iron chelation, which is toxic to liver and kidney and may also cause hearing problems. There is no therapy currently available,” says Sandeep Basu from CSIR-IGIB and first author of a paper published in ACS Chemical Biology.
Mutations in about six genes are known to cause reduction in hepcidin hormone production thereby causing excess iron accumulation. But for the study, the research team led by Chetana Sachidanandan created a disease model in zebrafish (a fish exhibiting similar characteristics of the human disease) by mutating one of these genes (TFR2). Mutations in the TFR2 gene cause a severe form of the disease.
The zebrafish with the mutant gene showed excess iron accumulation in organs, quite similar to what is seen in humans.
In the conventional drug discovery approach, the target protein and even the pathway are already known and molecules that would either inhibit or overproduce the target protein are screened for. But the researchers adopted a different approach for this study.
“Hepcidin gene is controlled by many factors, many of them not well understood. So, instead of picking one target for our drug screen, we focused on the symptoms of the disease — excess accumulation of iron,” says Dr. Sachidanandan. “We knew that hepcidin hormone is low in the hemochromatosis patients, and that this causes iron overload.”
Since the researchers knew hepcidin production is regulated by many signalling pathways, they selected 80 compounds that specifically target signalling pathways in zebrafish. Of the 80 compounds tested, eight were found to induce the production of hepcidin hormone in the fish. “One of these compounds is a blocker of NFkB signalling pathway. This pathway was not known to be important in hepicidin regulation in the liver.” This is the first time that researchers have been able to identify and tell that the NFkB pathway regulates liver hepcidin production.
“It was not a blind screening, but rather we used our existing knowledge about hepcidin regulation. When we don’t have a deep understanding of a disease, but need to discover drug candidates, this kind of unbiased strategy is more efficient,” she says.
The researchers tested the ability of this compound to regulate hepcidin production. “The small molecule targets and inhibits the NFkB pathway signaling thus increasing hepcidin production and reducing iron overload,” says Basu. They tested three more compounds that target the same pathway to confirm that the NFkB pathway is indeed a key to regulating hepcidin production. “There are other signalling pathways that regulate hepcidin production but our discovery places NFkB pathway as an important negative hepcidin hormone production,” Basu says.
When the pathway in the zebrafish model of Hemochromatosis was inhibited using the four compounds, the hepcidin production was restored and iron overload was reduced, thus reducing the severity of the disease.
To further reconfirm the role of the NFkB pathway, the researchers removed it in zebrafish. This led to overproduction of hepcidin hormone in the fish, confirming that the pathway negatively regulates the production of the hormone.
None of the four compounds tested in zebrafish is approved for use in humans; one compound tested is approved for use in poultry. “The target pathway has been identified even though the tested compounds cannot be used as drugs. What is important is that we have found a strategy for therapy,” says Dr. Sachidanandan. “Now that we know the pathway to be targeted, it’s easier to discover drug molecules.”
“In India, Hemochromatosis is still not commonly seen, perhaps because of our underlying iron deficiency. But Thalassemia, is a serious problem where iron overload is very common. We are now working to see if we can apply this therapeutic strategy for Thalassemia patients,” Basu says.

Gecko species split into three
","Termite hill geckos are all chocolate-brown, banded and small enough to fit into your palm. But the finer physical details and genetic differences reveal that what was believed to be one species is now three: the Whitaker’s, Sahgal’s and southern termite hill geckos.
In the past, scientists depended solely on physical differences to describe new species. Now, researchers can use genetic techniques to identify a new species. Many researchers also use a combination of these to tap into the strengths of both methods and obtain more robust results.
This is precisely what Zeeshan Mirza, of Bengaluru’s National Centre for Biological Sciences (NCBS), and his colleagues did when they suspected that there could be “hidden” species amongst termite hill geckos (lizards which are widely distributed across India, Sri Lanka and Pakistan; their taxonomy has been confusing in the past).
The team collected termite hill geckos across Maharashtra, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu and Pondicherry and extracted genetic data from these samples.
The four genes they studied reveal that all these geckos separated neatly (and robustly) into three different ‘clades’ or branches.
Samples from Nellore, Pondicherry and Sri Lanka (recognised as a sub-species till now) grouped as one, proving that they were one species; the team designated this as the southern termite hill gecko (Hemidactylus triedrus). Samples from south Karnataka and the Nilgiris district in Tamil Nadu formed a separate clade, distinct enough to be a separate species; the researchers named it Hemidactylus whitakeri (in honour of herpetologist Romulus Whitaker’s contributions to the conservation of India’s reptiles). Geckos from Maharashtra, Gujarat and parts of Pakistan clustered together and Mirza and colleagues have named it Hemidactylus sahgali, after Bittu Sahgal, the editor and founder of Sanctuary Asia magazine.
Detailed examinations of the physical features of the geckos from existing literature and by comparing both the newly collected specimens and museum specimens also complemented the genetic descriptions. Small pores on its thigh demarcate the Sahgal’s gecko clearly from the other two; however, identifying and comparing many of these features on field takes a trained eye.
According to Mirza, lead author of the study published in PeerJ, using numerous methods together has helped solve the taxonomy of a species that has been debated for two centuries and also reveals that we do not know enough about the distribution of the Whitaker’s and southern termite hill geckos.
“More studies in India’s arid habitats could reveal more ‘hidden’ species,” he adds.

NASA’s car-sized, $1.5 billion Parker Solar Probe was scheduled for launch on a Delta IV Heavy rocket from Cape Canaveral, Florida, during a 65-minute launch window that opened at 3.33 am EDT (1.33 pm IST).
By coming closer to the Sun than any spacecraft in history, the unmanned probe’s main goal is to unveil the secrets of the corona, the unusual atmosphere around the Sun. “We are going to be in an area that is so exciting, where solar wind — we believe — will be accelerating,” said NASA planetary science division director Jim Green.

“Where we see huge magnetic fields that are passing by us, as coronal mass ejections make their way out into the solar system.”
Not only is the corona about 300 times hotter than the Sun’s surface, it also hurls powerful plasma and energetic particles that can unleash geomagnetic space storms, wreaking havoc on the Earth by disrupting the power grid.
But these solar outbursts are poorly understood.
“The Parker Solar Probe will help us do a much better job of predicting when a disturbance in the solar wind could hit the Earth,” said Justin Kasper, a project scientist and professor at the University of Michigan.

When it nears the Sun, the probe will travel rapidly enough to go from New York to Tokyo in one minute — some 430,000 miles per hour, making it the fastest human-made object.

ISRO set to launch its TV channel
"," The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) will have an year-long Vikram Sarabhai centenary celebration starting in August 2019 to honour the visionary scientist and its legendary founding father.
 In a few months’ time, it plans to roll out a dedicated ISRO TV channel showcasing space applications, developments and science issues, targeting young viewers and people in remote areas in their language. 
Series of events
Sarabhai, the architect of the Indian space programme, the first ISRO chief and renowned cosmic ray scientist, was born on August 12, 1919.
ISRO’s tributes to Sarabhai start with naming the first Indian moon landing spacecraft of the Chandrayaan-2 mission ‘Vikram’. The mission is planned for early 2019. A chair each at Sarabhai's two alma maters, Cambridge University and Gujarat University, as also at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), would be set up, apart from giving awards, scholarships and fellowships in the country and abroad, ISRO Chairman K. Sivan said at a news conference on Sunday, the 99th birthday of the legend.
Sarabhai was only 28 when he sowed the seeds of a space agency around the late 1940s and 1950s. “We have planned an year-long centenary of the visionary architect of the space programme and our first Chairman, Dr. Sarabhai, during 2019-20. A series of activities will be organised nationally and internationally to commemorate the great international scientist,” Dr. Sivan said.
The events are being taken up with an initial outlay of ₹ 50 crore. 
Earlier, former Chairman of ISRO K. Kasturirangan unveiled a new bust of Sarabhai at the remodelled atrium of ISRO headquarters, Antariksh Bhavan.
Dr. Sivan said 100 lectures by science luminaries would be held across the country and in association with the International Astronautical Federation, the global space networking body. Space clubs, knowledge centres and talk shows are also among the plans.
Public satellite launches
As it strengthens its public outreach, ISRO will shortly start allowing the public to watch satellite launches from its Sriharikota launch centre. “We are opening our space port to visitors just as NASA (the U.S.’ National Aeronautical and Space Administration) does,” Dr. Sivan said.

Small launcher will have a big impact
"," A small Indian satellite launch vehicle that was made in three days by a handful of people at about 10% of current costs looks set to revolutionise the global satellite launch industry.
The SSLV (small satellite launch vehicle) is being developed at a furious pace at ISRO’s Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre. The SSLV will be an on-demand rocket for small satellites weighing about 500-700 kg. It will be autonomous and highly intelligent, versatile and capable of adapting to different launch situations and requirements. 
Its first test launch is planned for mid-2019. Once proven, the SSLV’s production would be offered to industry through Antrix Corporation, according to ISRO Chairman K. Sivan. 
The SSLV is said to be Dr. Sivan’s dream concept for a quick-response space vehicle, and the project was initiated when he was the Director of the VSSC until January this year.

World’s first mission to touch the Sun lifts off: NASA ","NASA’s Parker Solar Probe, mankind’s first mission to ‘touch’ the Sun, has been launched today on a seven-year long journey to unlock the mysteries of our star’s fiery outer atmosphere and its effects on space weather.
Liftoff took place from Space Launch Complex 37 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in the US early today.



3-2-1… and we have liftoff of Parker #SolarProbe atop @ULAlaunch’s #DeltaIV Heavy rocket. Tune in as we broadcast our mission to “touch” the Sun: https://t.co/T3F4bqeATB pic.twitter.com/Ah4023Vfvn


The launch of the United Launch Alliance Delta IV Heavy rocket carrying the spacecraft was scrubbed yesterday due to a violation of a launch limit, resulting in a hold.
The car-sized spacecraft will travel directly into the Sun’s atmosphere, about four million miles from its surface - and more than seven times closer than any spacecraft has come before, thanks to its innovative Thermal Protection System. The USD 1.5 billion mission will perform the closest-ever observations of a star when it travels through the Sun’s outer atmosphere, called the corona.
It will make 24 passes through the corona during its seven-year mission. The mission will rely on measurements and imaging to revolutionise our understanding of the corona and how processes there ultimately affect near-Earth space.
The Parker Solar Probe carries a lineup of instruments to study the Sun both remotely and in situ, or directly. Together, the data from these instruments should help scientists answer three foundational questions about our star.
Parker Solar Probe will explore the corona, a region of the Sun only seen from Earth when the Moon blocks out the Sun’s bright face during total solar eclipses. The corona holds the answers to many of scientists’ outstanding questions about the Sun’s activity and processes.

Like it or not, Google tracks your movements ","Google wants to know where you go so badly that it records your movements even when you explicitly tell it not to.
An Associated Press investigation found that many Google services on Android devices and iPhones store your location data even if you’ve used privacy settings that say they will prevent it from doing so.
Computer-science researchers at Princeton confirmed these findings at the AP’s request.
For the most part, Google is upfront about asking permission to use your location information. An app like Google Maps will remind you to allow access to location if you use it for navigating. 
If you agree to let it record your location over time, Google Maps will display that history for you in a “timeline” that maps out your daily movements.
Storing your minute-by-minute travel details carries privacy risks and has been used by police to determine the location of suspects- such as a warrant that police in Raleigh, North Carolina, served on Google last year to find devices near a murder scene. So the company will let you “pause” a setting called Location History.
Google says that it will prevent the company from remembering where you’ve been. Google’s support page on the subject states: “You can turn off Location History at any time. With Location History off, the places you go are no longer stored.” That isn’t true. Even with Location History paused, some Google apps automatically store time-stamped location data without asking.
For example, Google stores a snapshot of where you are when you merely open its Maps app. Automatic daily weather updates on Android phones pinpoint roughly where you are. And some searches that have nothing to do with location, like “chocolate chip cookies,” or “kids science kits,” pinpoint your precise latitude and longitude — accurate to the square foot — and save it to your Google account. The privacy issue affects some two billion users of devices that run Google’s Android operating software and hundreds of millions of worldwide iPhone users who rely on Google for maps or search.
Storing location data in violation of a user’s preferences is wrong, said Jonathan Mayer, a Princeton computer scientist and former chief technologist for the Federal Communications Commission’s enforcement bureau.

Okami HD and Dead Cells: Fun on the go
"," Several games have tried to replicate the soul of Nintendo’s Zelda series and Okami is one game that has come close to that formula. A unique game that not only bags several awards, but is a modern-day classic, making it to the hall of fame of the best games ever made. Recently re-released in HD for the Playstation 4, the same HD treatment makes its way to Nintendo’s spunky handheld, the Switch, and it is the perfect home for Amaterasu. 
Okami HD


What’s it about?
Amaterasu is a Japanese sun goddess, and the main character of Okami, who appears in the game as the white wolf Shiranui. Based on folklore, Amaterasu appears to cleanse the land consumed by a dark curse laid down by Orochi. Accompanied by a tiny artist known as Issun, you get to use the celestial brush to draw out evil, pun fully intended.




Released in 2006, Okami proved to the world that games can be works of art. The Playstation 2 sang as it churned out a beautiful world that was one large Sumi-e (a Japanese woodcut watercolour brushwork technique) painting come to life. An art style that has had an impact on Capcom’s games to this day, very evident in Street Fighter IV and V, adding movement via ink and brush strokes.
While the art style will leave your jaw on the floor, Okami does drag a lot in places. From its beautiful but annoying intro that you have to sit through, to a few pacing problems in the story. These are minor quibbles though, in comparison to the incredible world that is waiting for you to explore. So all you need to do is just survive that intro.
How does it play?
Made by legendary game designer Hideki Kamiya, the brains behind Devil May Cry and Bayonetta, Amaterasu’s fighting technique has flair and speed. In addition to that, a press of the button brings the celestial brush, which is perfect for the Switch in handheld mode, as you use the touchscreen to draw across enemies. It seems as though the game has been made for a console that launched almost 10 years later.




Exploration and puzzle-solving is a lot better with the touch celestial brush. Though in docked mode, you will need to use the JoyCons. The handheld mode is recommended though, not only because you get to take Amaterasu on your work commute, but also because it addresses one of the biggest problems we had with the HD remake. Due to the art style, on large TVs, the graphics look a bit like you are seeing double, with the cel shading and the brush work adding a bit of a second image. On the handheld screen of the Switch, we did not notice this phenomenon and were able to enjoy the game to its fullest.
Should you get it?
If you own a Nintendo Switch and you’re feeling that void after completing Breath of the Wild, then Okami is one game you should dive right into.
While Okami was inspired by Zelda, Dead Cells is an Indie game that’s inspired by Nintendo’s Metroid, combining two enthusiast sub-genres, Metroidvania — games that are like Castlevania and Metroid — and Roguelikes, games that have random generated elements that power their gameplay systems. Add to that a large dollop of Dark Souls, which has an enthusiast genre of its own known as Masocore, masochism+hardcore, and you have quite an interesting formula, and one helluva game.
Dead Cells


What’s it about?
In Dead Cells, you play a collection of cells. A blob of sentient goo with one purpose, to escape this convoluted, ever-changing prison. After an experiment gone wrong, you take over the nearest dead host body, and have to keep killing other monsters to recover cells that are lost.
Story takes a backseat to a game that is all about its gameplay systems. Dead Cells thinks differently, which is not surprising, coming from Motion Twin, a small game studio that also thinks differently, and recently announced that they are an equal pay worker cooperative. This shows in every cell of Dead Cells.




How does it play?
Dead Cells is the most fun I have had in a side-scroller since Contra or Castlevania or even Metroid. These added subgenres just make this game all the more interesting and fun to play. Usually dying and starting over is perceived as a negative thing in games, but here it is the only way to progress. Every time you die, you may have to start at the beginning, but the entire dungeon has changed and new paths have opened up. The same goes for the weapons and powers you collect along the way. 
The action is definitely Dark Souls-like, with its rolling evasion and pattern-based enemies and bosses. It’s Souls-Lite though, a lot more enjoyable and less punishing. The best part though, is the action, which is satisfying. The quick sword slashes and the sheer amount of power-ups and weapons make you want to come back to the game again and again. Things do get a bit repetitive in a rinse-and-repeat way, but the developers have got the action right, making it the perfect game to play on-the-go. 
The retro pixel graphics and animations are superb and there is a lot on the screen at one time. From enemies exploding in globs of gore, to sparkles off the items and other particle effects, there is a lot going on, but it adds to the sheer energy of the game.
Should you get it?
Dead Cells is an addictive game that is best played in short bursts, and perfect if you have a laptop and want something quick. It’s great on the Nintendo Switch also, if you happen to own one.

Dell G7 7588 laptop: Stealth attack
"," 

A couple of years ago, the term ‘gaming laptop’ was better suited to marketing brochures than as part of a gamer’s daily set-up. That said, the advances in chip technology — which have enabled manufacturers to produce smaller processors which use less power and therefore produce less heat — have improved the amount of performance that can be crammed into a device that does not look and weigh as much as an average wardrobe. The biggest beneficiary of this trend has been, no prizes for guessing — the gaming laptop.
All this modern technical wizardry is in full display in Dell’s new G7 7588 gaming laptop, which complements the company’s Inspiron Gaming series, but brings in the added firepower of Intel’s 8th-generation processors.
On the outside
The G7 is clearly intended for the gamer with sophisticated taste. Our review unit came finished in white, with a sharp blue accent (there is also a black version available). The outer cover is all white, save for the blue Dell logo, while the keyboard and base are black, with the keys also getting a blue accent as well as blue backlighting. The backlight has only two brightness settings and no fancy lighting modes, and the only other indication of this laptop’s gaming credentials is the subtle marking on the W, A, S, and D keys. The trackpad has ample room and the small round power button also has a fingerprint sensor compatible with Windows Hello.
The G7’s 15.6-inch Full HD screen does not have touch support, and has a substantial amount of bezel, but the panel is a sharp IPS set-up with an anti-glare coating, which produces crisp images and very little colour shift. The back of the device has a couple of exhaust vents with a subtle blue accent within, as well as a G7 badge, and a small white light on the front indicates the laptop’s status.
The G7 is well-specced in the connectivity department too, with its left side housing the power input, card reader and USB port, while the right side gets two more USB ports, a Thunderbolt 3-capable USB-C port, a headphone jack and a full-size HDMI port.
A modern heart




Underneath the unassuming exterior, the G7 packs some of the latest hardware from the houses of Intel and Nvidia. The 8th-generation i7-8750H is from the six-core Coffee Lake family, making the G7 more than competent at handling demanding multi-core applications, which has been the Achilles Heel for laptops in the past. Add an Nvidia GTX 1060 with 6GB memory and an efficient Max-Q design, and you have a potent powerhouse, the results of which show in real-world scenarios as well. 
The G7 happily waltzed through everything we threw at it, making short work of some of today’s most demanding AAA titles, as well as multi-player games and less-optimised indie titles, while keeping temperatures within acceptable levels. The display is not a high-refresh rate affair, but we suspect that will not be a deal breaker for most. 




Who is it for?
At an asking price of ₹1,05,924, on Dell’s website (exclusive of taxes), the G7 technically undercuts the pricier version of the Inspiron Gaming line (which also has a GTX 1060 Max Q) by around ₹7,000, though the latter has a 256GB SSD out of the box, compared to 128GB on the G7. This, combined with the newer processor, makes the G7 ideal for performance-hungry gamers and anyone who works with resource-heavy applications, like video editors, who are also likely to appreciate the subtle design of the laptop. 




For more firepower, Dell also has a version of the laptop with a Core i9 8950HK processor, though we did not get to test that version. For those interested in gaming only, the 1060 Max Q Inspiron gaming with the last i7 generation processor is a good buy if it can be found cheaper, but at the current price point, the G7 is one of the lowest entry points for a GTX 1060-powered configuration, and the newer processor makes it an excellent value-for-money recommendation.

Bang & Olufsen’s H9i headphones: In your own little world
"," At first glance, the Beoplay H9i over-ear Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) headphones appear to be the ideal lifestyle gadget, with soft-to-the-touch accents and clean lines. 
The unboxing itself is a pleasurable experience; with ribbon pull-ups and velvet lining of the panels. 
Given the Danish brand’s minimalist aesthetic, the H9i is no exception to their design philosophy. Available in two colours — black and natural — the headphones designed by Jakob Wagner comprise polished and anodised aluminium detailing with soft lambskin and leather for that cushioned comfort, making them slightly heavier than current Beats and Bose models. Obviously not ideal for a workout, the H9i are ideal for kick-back sessions. If you’re looking for such, I’d recommend their Beoplay E8 wireless set. Frankly, I was worried about keeping the material clean, but a gentle wipe down is enough, and worry not, a plush bag is offered to home your headphones when you’re not using them. 
Promising an 18-hour battery life, charging this gadget up is quick and easy using the 1.25m USB-A to USB-C cable provided. B&O don’t want their travelling clientèle to settle for the in-flight headphones, offering up a flight adapter which can be connected to the AUX cable provided. The light on the right ear-cup flashes orange when charging and turns green when the battery is full. 
However, connecting with devices isn’t always seamless and it takes a couple of tries at times. The white light indicates the device and the ANC are on, blue indicates pairing is underway and red alerts that pairing is unsuccessful. The H9i is equipped with an on-device touch interface that takes a little getting used to. Swiping in certain directions across the right ear-cup controls volume, track, ANC and Transparency Mode. 




Soul-stirring sound
In terms of comfort, those with more sensitive ears may feel a cabin-like pressure on the ears when first putting these on, due to the ANC. And the adjusting functions for fit are smooth. But overall, the H9i makes a strong case for quality listening, and is a major sound upgrade with memorable punches in certain songs and tracks. 
Downloading the Beoplay app to your phone lets you control the equaliser and create your own audio presets through a feature called ToneTouch. This is certainly quite the add-on and pretty ideal for those switching between podcasts, audiobooks, music and other media.
So what’s new with the H9i? B&O have upped their game with Transparency Mode, which enables listeners to tune into ambient sounds. Plus it’s also got proximity sensors for automatic play or pause when you put your headphones on or take it off.
Surprisingly, calls were clear and crisp on the H9i, something not so common among high-end headphones.
Retailing at around €499 (roughly ₹40,000) the H9i is an investment piece that can stick around in your listening arsenal for the future to come.

‘Gradient Descent’: when Artificial Intelligence meets art
"," 

Thanks to technology, the roles of the artist and the scientist, as well as their creative processes, are melding and the rigour of the resulting works is unbelievable. Our creativity has allowed our species to thrive, and now with machines having their own concepts of aesthetics, perception and creativity, it poses some important questions to artists. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is bridging the gap between technology and fine art by challenging creative intelligence and sensorial experiences, integrating networks known as GANs and cGANs, and changing how artists interact with their so-to-speak canvases. 
And with India as an AI capital, there’s endless scope to explore this realm. In fact, ‘Gradient Descent’, the country’s first AI creative showcase in Delhi, will be exhibiting this far-reaching evolution.
Assembled by brothers Raghava KK and Karthik Kalyanaraman, co-founders of art curation and research collective 64/1, the show unites an international group of artists who have melded various nodes of AI into riveting artworks which vary across the scale of immersion; building public understanding of how artists and Artificial Intelligence can come together to create art for the post-human age.
The works




Bengaluru-born Harshit Agrawal’s works, titled ‘The Anatomy Lesson of Dr Algorithm’, appears to be a disturbing look at surgical procedures. MIT graduate Harshit explores how something that’s so fundamentally human can be performed by something mechanical, like an algorithm he uses to map out a surgery. By varying the amount of training the algorithm gets, Harshit generates vivid abstract painterly images. At the same time, he refuses to erase the pixellations and digital mediation in the artwork — helpful to those who’d be a bit queasy.




Mario Klingemann from Germany will be presenting a jarring video of image distortions by AI’s sometimes-unpredictable tendencies. Using AI that has been trained on portraits of the Old Masters, Mario presents a bizarre take on how AI can build upon images. Because he’s continuously adding noise to this image, the portrait, which is morphed, starts to become more and more bizarre.




Now what about AI’s perception as artwork? A pioneer of AI and art, Tom White from London will be presenting two provocative series. The first series starts from a simple drawing made by an algorithm. Then, an AI algorithm which was trained on photographs from ImageNet, slowly transforms the initial sketch into an abstract representation of a physical object. This painting will not necessarily be recognisable to humans. The second series, a little more provocative, uses the same systems, but instead produces images that will generally be categorised as ‘inappropriate’ or ‘having explicit content’ by online image analysis AIs.




Grasping the potential of film and power, Anna Ridler from London uses the first 4 minutes of the 1928 film The Fall of the House of Usher by James Sibley Watson, handpaints every frame as a painting and feeds them into a cGAN, a type of AI algorithm that can link the frame from the film and Ridler’s artwork. Then she can generate a whole film using those paintings.
 Jake Elwes from London explores the power of language as an art, stringing together sentences and using that language to create an image. Elwes then puts an AI that interprets images in words in conversation with another AI that interprets words in images. A simple concept, the resulting interaction and interpretations made by the two AIs is celebrated for its impact on the viewer.




Turkish artist Memo Akten brings over his the investigation, ‘Learning To See’, of how the experience or memory of the machine affects what and how it sees. He describes it as “an artificial neural network making predictions on live webcam input, trying to make sense of what it sees in context of what it has seen before.” He’ll also be unveiling ‘Deep Meditations’, an extension of the aforementioned works, using machine-learning algorithms to create a two-hour meditative channel video and sound installation.




Taking AI perception to the next level, Nao Tokui from Japan will be exhibiting ‘Imaginary Landscape’. As various objects are manipulated in front of a camera, the machine, trained only on specific sets of images (for instance of beaches, or flames) reinterprets these objects as instances of categories it knows. The eerie effect of seeing a mobile phone power adapter reinterpreted by the algorithm as a cliff by a beach is not one a viewer is likely to forget, perhaps causing her to wonder whether this is all of nature that will be left for the future.
Through 64/1’s eyes
Karthik and Raghava share that finding work that is conceptually rich was key, adding, “This is the first time we are actually focussing on AI art as art — usually AI art has been treated as a step to talk about AI in society, but we do need to speak about it as art too, because that brings up the essence of creativity and the role of the human. Stylistic sensibilities across the spectrum were also key here, as well as the spectrum of algorithms they were using. The show serves as a manifesto saying ‘we really care about this and this is how artists can engage with the future’.”
For those overwhelmed by the tech-talk, the exhibition will also feature some workshops and engaging talks about AI, so even those unfamiliar yet curious people can immerse themselves into a new genre of art. Running till September 15, the show at Nature Morte gallery is open to all.

Madurai ryot hits bumper crop
","Amidst sob stories of crop failure from farmers and signs of an impending drought, a Madurai farmer has blended ingenuity with scientific techniques to produce a bumper harvest.
While the yield per hectare in the past in Madurai’s rural areas was not more than 10 tonnes, S. Sethumadhavan, a farmer in Alanganallur near here, has harvested a record yield of 24 tonnes of paddy per hectare — highest in the State.
Taking to farming 15 years ago, Sethumadhavan, from what he says, has mastered the techniques that have come with the introduction of System of Rice Intensification (SRI) over the past few years.
Here is his secret: as a part of the SRI, he used the CR 1009 variety of paddy seeds. First, he got the soil in his land tested and adopted the best-suited practices to maximise yield. The planting of ‘Daincha’ as a green manure crop, before sowing seeds, added to the soil quality.
“Instead of limiting to one type of fertilizer, a mix of organic and chemical fertilizers was used. Then, the use of simple machinery such as the kono-weeder helped me increase the yield three fold,” Mr. Sethumadhavan says.
When he told the Agriculture Department officials that he wanted to participate in the competition for high yield, they guided him about the use of technology, type of seeds and techniques to be followed.
“Selection and testing of soil are extremely important if farmers want to maximise their yield,” says R. Sridhar, an agriculture officer who guided the farmer . “Though the region has a lot of wells and the farmer had copious water supply, it was effective water management that contributed to the high yield,” the officer says.
“The yield is the highest in the State,” Jaisingh Gnanadurai, Joint Director, Agriculture, announced on Thursday. Proper handling of the over 10 techniques that encompass SRI proved highly beneficial , said R.M. Lakshmanan, assistant director, Agriculture, Alanganallur.
It can be recalled that Periasamy Solaimalai, a farmer from Madurai, bagged the “Krishi Karman” award in 2013 for a yield of more than 20 tonnes of paddy per hectare. Knowing well that his was a success story, Mr. Sethumadhavan says, “I’m confident of winning a national award.”

Green energy boost for Africa
","Sub-Saharan Africa’s lack of electricity is hindering development but this can be reversed if countries turn to ambitious, large-scale renewable energy projects, an environmental think-tank suggests.
The region — home to 41 per cent of the world’s energy-poor people, with 65 per cent of primary schools and 30 per cent of health centres having no access to electricity — faces an energy crisis that development models are not addressing, according to a report by the Green Alliance.
“Even with robust economic growth, [the region’s] existing energy infrastructure is a brake on progress. With population growth continuing to outstrip electrification, the number of people without energy access is only projected to grow,” say the authors. “This has significant implications for development, with impacts on health, education and household economy. Disproportionate amounts of time and income are spent securing energy by other means, such as gathering wood, which also has detrimental impacts on the natural environment.
Low carbon, decentralised energy can reach communities much faster than expanding existing, inefficient central grid systems. And it offers immediate improvements to people’s lives. Projections for achieving universal energy access in sub-Saharan Africa acknowledge this potential and assume that just over half the provision will need to be mini and off-grid solutions. Such options will also be more resilient in the face of climate changes.”
The study was launched as the Labour party pledged to back clean power for Africa. Chuka Umunna MP, the shadow business secretary, said: “The green economy presents huge opportunities for dynamic and innovative British businesses to export overseas and increase energy access in regions such as sub-Saharan Africa through renewable technology. We are clear that Britain must be a world leader in the low-carbon economy. This is key to growing the high-skilled, better-paid jobs we need as well as powering development across the globe that benefits all.”
“Yes, there is still poverty, disease and conflict in Africa. But the fact is that in the last 15 years, the African continent has been fired by the spirit of progress. We can see it in the technology hubs of Lagos and Nairobi, the successes in fighting diseases, the number of kids going to school, the burgeoning, emerging middle classes. Consider Nigeria, with its population of 170 million. It currently has the same grid power as Bradford — a city of half a million people. As Nigeria makes those investments, there will be lots of opportunities for British businesses. So we need to wake up to what is happening in Africa.”

‘New spinal surgery will cause less tissue damage’
","The new method, minimally invasive spine surgery (MISS), ensures less damage to the surrounding muscle, less pain and faster recovery after surgery, according to Dr. M.J. Naidu of Naidu Hospitals.
Sunshine Spine Centre director G.P.V. Subbaiah and M.J. Naidu Hospitals head M.J. Naidu jointly inaugurated the new centre for minimally invasive spine surgeries on Friday.
Explaining about the concept, Dr. Naidu said that spine surgeries were traditionally administered as open ones. In MISS there were no long incisions that involve significant damage to the muscles surrounding spine, he said.
The two hospitals have jointly launched ‘My Spine Centre’ here.
Open spine surgery was typically recommended only when non-surgical treatment — medication and physiotherapy — did not relieve pain and doctors were able to pinpoint exact source of pain.
MISS, however, is being used for a wider range of spinal procedures and some common procedures like decompression and spinal fusion.
In decompression, a portion of the bone was removed and in spinal fusion small bones (vertebrae) of the spine were fused.
The centre was being established to provide all medical services to the patients, Dr Naidu said.

Tamil publishers yet to wake up to e-book market potential
","Tamil readers using a Kindle or a tablet to read books will now be familiar with the woefully inadequate number of titles available in the electronic format.
From ignorance of technology, and insecurity stemming from fear of loss of control over content to the absence of a unified platform to host the books, the Tamil publishing industry faces an array of issues in transiting to the digital version.
According to G. Olivannan of the Bookseller’s and Publishers’ Association of South India, the experience of the music industry has remained a bitter lesson for anyone moving to the digital format.
“In the music industry, copyright no longer has any value. The moment someone uploads a song on the internet, you virtually lose control of the content. This is what publishers also fear given the small market,” he states. This reluctance, he says, also comes from ignorance about the technology itself.
“Some publishers still adhere to obsolete techniques of printing. How do you expect them to embrace e-books?” he wonders.
Noted author S. Ramakrishnan agrees on the ignorance part. Which is why, he has now embarked on a mission to develop his own cross-platform application to sell electronic versions of his books.
The author says that publishers have failed to grasp the market potential of e-books.
“As matters stand, they also don’t have the expertise. I feel there is no point in waiting for any publisher to start the process. I have taken the expertise of developers in London and will launch the app in August,” he says, adding that opening up to digital versions would augment his profits multi-fold.
Managing Director of New Horizon Media Badri Seshadri says the issues are much more complicated.
In the English books world, there are ready-made platforms like Amazon which provides the expertise and facilitates easy hosting of e-books. Such a forum does not exist in Tamil.
Amazon, he says, does not support Tamil language at the moment and lack of technical knowledge of converting the books into electronic format discourages publishers from using other platforms such as Google Play Books.
In this regard, Mr. Badri says his company is in the process of putting out an app that will, in a much smaller scale, replicate the Amazon Kindle model.
“Through the app, called the NHM Reader, we want to provide all the expertise necessary to host an e-book. This includes the process of conversion and we are keeping this open to all publishers and not just ‘Kizhaku’, our publishing house,” he says. The app is likely to be launched next month.

What do you do with a whale that won't explode?
","The residents of Trout River in Newfoundland, Canada have a stinking whale of a problem. What to do with the 81-feet-carcass of Balaenoptera musculus on their shore?
While such an occurrence is not uncommon, the blue whale of Trout River is a worry because some dead marine mammals can explode. In 2013 an >exploding sperm whale was recorded on camera.
In 2004, in the hope of studying it, Chinese scientists decided to move the carcass of a 60-ton sperm whale through the city of Tainan, Taiwan. While on the tractor-trailer, the sperm whale exploded, showering stores, cars and onlookers >with whale insides.
Whales explode because of gas buildup in their abdominal cavity. When mammals die, their last meals start to rot. For the gut bacteria digesting that rot, it provides a tasty meal. But the digestion process releases methane gas, which makes the whale bloat and sometimes explode.

Gut reaction

I have a vexed relationship with exploding whales. On the one hand, I have a visceral disgust for mammal anatomy, to a near debilitating degree. I walked an extra block in college just to avoid going through the vertebrate anatomy lab. I had to leave the only mammal dissection I ever attended because I couldn’t stop gagging. And yet, despite all this, I will stop whatever I am doing to watch an exploding whale video, with disgust and fascination.
And I am not alone. Millions of people worldwide are obsessed with this cetacean time bomb. To capitalise on this, scientists decided to create a very different kind of whale watching experience. >HasTheWhaleExplodedYet.com allows you to receive regular updates on the state of the ballooning carcass.
I, like many others, want so badly for the whale to explode. But sadly, it doesn’t look like it will happen. The carcass has begun to deflate. This is because, unlike the exploding sperm whale of 2013, blue whales are built for this.
As lung-filter feeders, blue whales make a living by withstanding massive internal pressure. When blue whales find a school of krill, they open their jaw wide-open, and fill a specialised abdominal cavity at a rate of 20 tonnes of water per second. This makes the blue whale, unlike the exploding sperm whale, a tough balloon.

Post-mortem

Something needs to be done about the carcass to stop the stench. In 1970, when faced with the same problem, the Orgeon State Highway Division decided to blow up the whale with dynamite. The event cannot be termed a complete success. Onlookers hundreds of feet away were showered with whale blubber and a car was destroyed. But the >TV news coverage of the event is probably some of the best ever produced.
So, given the lessons of the past, the residents of Trout River should be pleased by the Royal Ontario Museum’s decision to >remove the carcass for study. If successful, they will get rid of the stink without a whale-blubber shower.

Astra successfully test-fired from Sukhoi-30 MKI 
","Marking an important milestone, for the first time an Indian missile, Astra, was successfully test-fired from a fighter aircraft — the Sukhoi-30 MKI — from a naval range in the Western Sector on Sunday.
The test-firing met all the mission objectives and the air-launch was captured by side and forward looking high-speed cameras and the separation was exactly as per simulation, according to a press release from the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO).
Astra is India's first Beyond Visual Range Air-to-Air missile and has been designed and developed indigenously by the DRDO. The 60-km plus range missile possesses high Single Shot Kill Probability (SSKP) making it highly reliable.
Astra is an all-weather missile with active radar terminal guidance, excellent ECCM (electronic counter-counter measures) features, smokeless propulsion and process improved effectiveness in multi-target scenario, making it a highly advanced state-of-the-art missile, the release added.
Congratulating the team, Avinash Chander, Scientific Advisor to Defence Minister and DG, DRDO, observed that the launch was a major step in missile aircraft integration.He said this would be followed by launch against actual target shortly. “Many more trials are planned and will be conducted to clear the launch envelope. Weapon integration with 'Tejas', Light Combat Aircraft will also be done in the near future”, he added.
V. G. Sekaran, Director-General (Missiles and Strategic Systems), who chaired the Flight Readiness Review Committee, described it as one of the proud moments for DRDO and the entire country. Dr.K. Tamilmani, Director-General (Aeronautics), who oversaw the entire flight safety in the program, said the quality of integration and performance was of high standard. This was the beginning of the phase for demonstration of launch over a wide air-launch envelope.
Director, DRDL, S. Som, said “it is a first of its kind and a good achievement”.
Astra's project director, S. Venugopal said the missile was comparable with the best in the world. He said that to completely clear the launch envelope about 20-30 trials would be carried out in a continuous fashion. The air-launch envelope would cover various aspects including altitude, speed and the angle of attack. He said Sunday's test-firing from Su-30 MKI was preceded by several weapon integration trials conducted between November 2013 and February this year. The missile underwent rigorous testing on Su-30 in captive mode for avionics integration and seeker evaluation.
He said the Mk-II variant of Astra with a range of 100 km is planned to be tested by this year end.
He said the air launch was the culmination of effort by a dedicated team from the Missile Complex, Hyderabad, EMILAC (Centre for Military Airworthiness and Certification) and the IAF. HAL carried out modifications in Su-30 along with IAF specialists, while many Indian industries played an important role in the production of reliable avionics, propulsion system, materials, air-frame and software passing stringent airworthiness requirements for the missile.

Real-time monitoring of KSRTC schedules begins
","The Kerala State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) has started keeping tabs on its fleet and collection of each schedule and that of depots on real-time basis with General Packet Radio Service (GPRS)-enabled Electronic Ticketing Machines (ETMs) carried by the conductors.
The supply of 2,000 new-generation ETMs in the Thiruvananthapuram zone of the transport utility has been completed.
With this, the corporation is in possession of information such as number of tickets sold between bus stops, frequency of the service, and running time of the buses operating from the 21 depots in the zone.
Training for ATOsTraining has been provided to Assistant Transport Officers (ATOs), who have been entrusted with the task of monitoring the services at the depot level.
The bus crew have started rising to the occasion after some were pulled up for bunching of services and tailing parallel services when the training of the ATOs was on.
“We have provided another 300 ETMs across the State till date. The remaining 1700 ETMs will be supplied to the other four zones — Kollam, Ernakulam, Thrissur and Kozhikode — to complete the project by June,” a top official of the KSRTC told The Hindu here.
The ETMs feed a wealth of information to allow effective planning of schedules and cater to the needs of commuters.
As real-time data transfer takes place from the ETMs directly to the control room, the authorities can keep tabs on the collection of each schedule at the zonal level and at the control room too.
The authorities can text messages to the ETMs that are equipped with the SIM of Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd. The mobile number of the crew is fed into the system so that they can be contacted in case of emergency or to pass on information while the bus is running.
The new ETMs were initially used on the Pampa-Nilakkal chain services during the last Mandala-Makaravilakku season at Sabarimala to check operational efficiency and overcome teething problems.
The facility will help avoid bunching of services and trip curtailment. Each ETM, supplied by a Bangalore-based firm, costs Rs.9,500, and the corporation has spent Rs.3.8 crore from the Plan fund for replacing the old ones, which are over five years’ old.
The introduction of the ETMs is part of a technology upgrade being worked out to streamline services and tide over financial crises.

Over 100 million duplicate accounts likely: Facebook
","Social networking website Facebook on Sunday said it had over 100 million “duplicate” registered accounts on its user base, as per its estimations. Besides the nearly 5 to 15 million “undesirable” accounts registered with it worldwide, the percentage of such false accounts, including “user-misclassified” ones, may be higher in developing markets such as India, the company said.
At the same time, the company admitted that its estimated figures “may not” accurately represent the actual number of such accounts and it was continually seeking to improve its enumeration methodology.
“There may be individuals who maintain one or more Facebook accounts in violation of our terms of service. We estimate, for example, that ‘duplicate’ accounts [those that users maintain in addition to their principal account] may have represented between approximately 4.3 per cent and 7.9 per cent of our worldwide MAUs [Monthly Active User] in 2013,” Facebook said in the SEC filing.
According to the latest quarterly report, Facebook said the percentage of duplicate or false accounts is higher in developing markets such as India and Turkey.
As of March 31, 2014, the site had 1.28 billion MAUs, an increase of 15 per cent from last March 31. Users in India and Brazil represented key sources of growth in the first quarter of 2014 relative to the same period in 2013, the filing with SEC said.
In all regions, an increasing number of MAUs are accessing Facebook through mobile devices, with users in India, Brazil, and the United States representing key sources of mobile MAU growth over the first quarter of 2014, as compared to the same period in 2013.
“In 2013, for example, we estimate user-misclassified accounts may have represented between approximately 0.8 per cent and 2.1 per cent of our worldwide MAUs and undesirable accounts may have represented between approximately 0.4 per cent and 1.2 per cent of our worldwide MAUs,” it further said.

Of mobile revolution and its impact
","The mobile technology, a disruptive force in the country, also brought a negative impact on the environment, Robin Jeffrey, co-author of the book ‘Cell Phone Nation’, said at a lecture in the city on Monday.
At the Computer Society of India Education Directorate, Taramani, Mr. Jeffrey, a visiting research professor at the Institute of South Asian Studies of National University of Singapore, delivered a lecture titled ‘Cell phone nation : How mobile phones changed India’.
Recalling the days when the telegram was more popular than the telephone, Mr. Jeffrey said it was in 1986, with the advent of the PCO booths, that the telephone became more accessible.
Until the late 1990s, mobile phones were unattainable to the common man.
Mr. Jeffrey argued that mobile technology was a tremendous disruptive force, both politically and socially.
“The technology put knowledge power in the hands of hundreds of millions of users who had previously lacked the same. This transformed the everyday way of life of millions and granted an autonomy which allowed individuals to challenge long established conventions in society,” he said.
Mr. Jeffrey also went on to discussing some of the negatives of this otherwise liberating technology.
While acknowledging that anxiety over the impact of the technology was only natural, he declared himself a cyber optimist with the view that the future was favourably disposed to mobile technology.
The lecture, chaired by Ashok Jhunjhunwala, professor at the department of electrical engineering at IIT-Madras, and organised by IEEE Madras Section, Cellular Operator Association of India, Telecom Centers of Excellence India, IEEE Computer Society, IEEE Communications Society, IEEE Communications Society and the Computer Society of India, ended with an interactive session with the audience.

Scientists develop bacteria-killing fabric
","An antibacterial fabric with an ability to kill off two of the most infectious and lethal pathogens — E.coli and Staphylococcus aureus — has been developed by researchers in Australia.
Both the pathogens were shown to die off within 10 minutes of contact with this newly created fabric, which utilises the antibacterial properties of silver, according to media reports. The study was conducted by the Australia-based university RMIT in collaboration with Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation and a paper on the new material was recently published in the prestigious journal Advanced Functional Materials.
“It has been known for the last hundred years that silver is anti-bacterial,” said Vipul Bansal, Associate Professor from RMIT University’s School of Applied Sciences.
“Silver metal, when it comes into contact with body fluids, releases silver ions and these ions are actually toxic and have anti-microbial and antibacterial properties,” Bansal said.
“Instead of using silver metals, we developed a new material called silver TCNQ which releases these silver ions quite slowly so the antibacterial effect is long term,” he said.
Potential applications of this fabric include bandaids and wound dressings, surgical gowns and bed sheets as means to reduce hospital-acquired infections.

Modified paddy cultivation method seems to hold better promise
","Rice, a major crop in Andhra Pradesh, is cultivated using water from borewells, tanks or open wells. Since the crop grows in standing water ground water depletion is usually high especially during summer.
In addition to the water shortage, non-availability of labour on time is also increasing the cost of production, forcing farmers to give up rice cultivation citing low productivity and high labour costs as reasons.
A different look at newer production methods that are relatively cost effective and use water more productively becomes imperative against the backdrop of the deepening water crisis and dwindling productivity under the inundation method of rice cultivation.
SRI (systematic rice intensification) is a proven methodology for comprehensively managing resources — changing the way land, seeds, water, nutrients and human labour are used.
“But in present times even SRI has some practical problems. The cono weeder which is an important tool in the cultivation practices is too heavy for pulling in the fields by the farmers. The other problem area is transplanting the seedlings from the nursery to the main field, which is quite labour intensive. With these in mind the Rashtiya Seva Samithi (Rass) — Krishi Vigyan Kendra in Chittoor district has slightly modified the practices using a fibre-bodied 8-rowed paddy seeder (drum seeder) for sowing the seeds and modified the weeder in such a way that it runs between the space in (20 cm) between the two paddy rows,” says Mr. C.Manohar, Programme Coordinator at the institute.
With the assistance of NABARD the institute organised capacity building activities like training programmes on modified practices to create awareness and motivate farmers to adopt the technology.
Exposure visits and field days were organised to showcase the performance of the technology and finally to disseminate the same among the farming communities in different parts of the district.
“About 60 eight-rowed paddy seeders and 300 conoweeders were purchased and kept in the homes of master trainers in the villages and at the office of the agricultural officer. Farmers who wanted to take up this cultivation could contact the agricultural officer or facilitator for the drum seeder and weeder and return them after completion,” says Mr. Manohar.
“Timely availability of the drum seeders and weeders are an important step in this practice. Farmers should be able to source the machines on time. That is why we have ensured that apart from the agriculture office the machines are also available in their respective villages. Otherwise it becomes a problem for the grower to get a good yield. Growers were also supplied with pre-emergence herbicide for weed management,” he adds.
The institute published a pamphlet on direct seeding technology in Telugu and distributed it to farmers to get their feedback on this. Five facilitators were recruited in this project. In addition to this, KVK also trained ten master trainers and their services were utilized for sowing, weed management etc in the project area.
“Both facilitators and master trainers not only helped the farmers with modified technology but also provided other advisory services like weather, pest and disease management, water management, weed management etc. through the Kissan mobile service of the institute. We started the project during rabi 2010 season and completed it in kharif 2013 season,” says S. Sreenivasulu, subject matter specialist. Demonstrations of this modified SRI method were conducted in 140 villages in the district. Results from the data of three previous years collected showed that the average yield obtained in modified SRI method was 2,574 kg per acre, whereas it was 2,325 kg in the traditional method. About 11 per cent yield increase was observed in the modified SRI method than in the traditional method.
An additional advantage was reduction in cultivation cost. It is also observed that the cost of cultivation is reduced by about Rs.4,000-5,000 per acre in this method due to skipping of practices like nursery raising and manual transplanting. Duration of the crop is also reduced by 7-10 days in modified SRI method compared to conventional practice.

Integrated farming model for wetlands
","A multi-commodity farming system consisting of rice, fish, broiler duck and male buffalo was evaluated at the Regional Agricultural Research Station, Kumarakom, under the Kerala Agricultural University for productivity, income, cropping intensity and generation of employment.
The study revealed that a one hectare paddy holder in kuttanad has the carrying capacity of a minimum of 5,000 fishes, 750 broiler ducks and 3-5 male buffaloes in addition to rice. In this system paddy is grown during June- October season.

Fish varieties

Fish fingerlings are stocked simultaneously in nursery ponds dug near the rice fields. A species composition of grass carp, rohu and catla at 2:1:1 at10,000 fingerlings per ha is advisable. Broiler duckling varieties like vigoa at 125-150/ha are grown simultaneously in duck houses erected over the fish pond.
Ducklings are fed with formulated feed. Spilled over feed and excrements of duck fertilize the fish ponds. It increases the primary productivity and growth of algae and higher plants.
Fishes feed on them and some of them consume duck droppings directly. The ducklings are sold after 45-50 days when they attain 2.1 – 2.5 kg body weight. In a year 5-8 batches of broiler ducks can be reared. Duck excrements to the tune of 9-10 tons are recycled for manuring the fish ponds
Paddy harvest gets over in 120-125 days and the fields get inundated after rice harvest. The nursery ponds are broken open and the fishes are released into the expanded water body.

Food material

The leftover paddy straw on decomposition generates abundant food material in addition to the duck manure flowing down from the nursery pond.
The fish species composition of grass carp, rohu and catla are capable of feeding on aquatic weeds and straw. The field bottoms are tilled by fishes during foraging.
Fish harvest is done prior to the next paddy season. Rice fields require no land preparation and preliminary weeding if the plant stand establishment is done within one week after the fish harvest.
At the present market rates the over all income will be Rs. 5.4 to 6.8 lakhs per /ha.

The way forward for Citizen Science
","“Citizen science in India is still in its infancy, but it is the way forward,” says Mohammed Dilawar who runs the Common Bird Monitoring of India, programme from Nashik. This programme, started in 2012, now has over 2,000 citizens, from 34 states, involved in observing and making notes about the common birds in their locality. The organisation is now in talks with Wildlife Institute of India to validate the data using statistical tools.
While it is not new that amateur scientists have made scientific observations that mattered, Internet usage and the ensuing possibility of involving huge numbers of citizens in data collection and analysis is relatively new in India. Mr Dilawar’s belief that Citizen Science (CS) is the way forward is echoed by the scenario in the West, for instance, where the situation is quite mature. CS initiatives like Zooniverse, eBird, etc, have participation that runs into tens of thousands, and what’s more, the databases built up by these have found their way into numerous peer-reviewed publications.
In an article published in the journal Science in April, authors Rick Bonney, Jennifer L. Shirk, Tina B. Phillips et al discuss this phenomenon and outline a future course for CS initiatives. Expressing the desire that the term citizen science, regardless of size of the project, will grow to refer to those programmes that truly do science, they emphasise the importance of developers employing “sound research or monitoring design.” This cannot be overemphasised in a climate where critiques of CS are many times based on the contention that untrained personnel cannot come up with data that is of the quality equal to that obtained by professionals.
There is a recent instance where this contention has been proved wrong. Studies involving monitoring of sharks have shown that quality of data collected by citizen scientists can be as reliable as that collected using automated tools (Gabriel Vianna, PLOS ONE, April 23). This is just one instance, and increasingly, Citizen Science initiatives are being treated with the seriousness due to scientific study.
Meanwhile, Bonney, Shirk, Phillips et al stress upon the importance of organising existing CS projects for maximum impact. Project redundancy and repetition being a danger of such large projects, project developers could “adapt, adopt or collaborate with already-proven projects.” They also suggest that developers can look at new possibilities and opportunities for data collection, for instance during natural and manmade disasters, such as oil spills, wild fires or earthquakes. They moot the important idea of networking CS projects around the world so that the research can contribute to a better understanding of phenomena like climate change.
But in India, where the numbers are still small and this concept is yet to catch on, there are obstacles still. While technology need not pose a problem anymore given the ubiquity of mobile apps and even the Internet, there are practical difficulties.
“Sometimes, some scientists like to mark out certain species and areas as their domain. Citizen Science will neutralise this monopoly,” says Mohammed Dilawar. According to him, while a collaboration with larger CS projects worldwide is welcome, the projects should also retain the local nature to some extent to be beneficial in inculcating in the people the culture of doing science.

Indian role in producing super-heavy element 117
","On May 1, 2014, Physical Review Letters confirmed the existence of a new super-heavy element 117. Super-heavy elements are elements beyond atomic number 104. They do not exist in nature.
It is a memorable day for scientists in India. Drs Susant Lahiri and Moumita Maiti from the Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics (SINP) joined the other international collaborators led by Professor Christoph Duellmann at GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research, in carrying out the historic experiment. Presently, Dr Maiti works in the Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee.
A few atoms of the super heavy element emerged when calcium-48 ions at high energies impinged on a specially prepared target of berkelium-249 (Bk). Presently, researchers call the element ununseptium for its 117 protons (20 protons of calcium and 97 from Bk). An atom of element 117 is 40 per cent heavier than an atom of lead.
The international team consisted of 72 scientists and engineers from 16 institutions in Australia, Finland, Germany, India, Norway, Poland, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States.
Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) in the U.S. produced 13 mg of berkelium-249 (half life of 330 days), a heavy element over an 18- month campaign by neutron irradiation at its High Flux Isotope Reactor. ORNL chemically separated and purified the isotope before shipping it to Mainz University which made the special target assembly that could withstand the intense calcium ion beams from the GSI accelerator.
Drs.Maiti and Lahiri estimated that the cost of 33mg of Bk is about $ 7.4 million. They also revealed that it was loaned to GSI.
How many of these nuclei have been produced to date? Is there a scientific need for producing more of these nuclei?
“Previous to our experiment, experimenters working at the accelerator laboratory in Russia, Dubna, have reported the observation of four atoms of the nuclei of the element 117 isotope with a mass number of 294 ....The main interest in the current generation of experiments lies in the proof that an atomic nucleus with 117 protons can exist, which means that element 117 exists,” said Prof. Christoph Duellmann, the group leader of the team and Professor at Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz. “Whether more data are needed for such a proof, will be decided by the joint working party of the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry and the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics, which reviews claims for the discovery of new elements and makes a judgment if the presently available data are sufficient or not.”
About any practical applications if follow up research leads to the discovery of more super-heavy elements, Prof. Duellmann said: “This cannot be foreseen at the moment. The study of super-heavy elements is currently a purely fundamental research topic. If future generations of scientists will succeed to synthesize much more stable super-heavy elements, maybe even in larger quantities, new materials would naturally be found: for example a solid block of element 117?
What will its properties be? Will it be more useful for certain applications than other known materials? “While I do not expect that the possibility of producing such quantities in the next decades, new avenues for the production of super-heavy elements may eventually be found and open these exciting prospects. If we look back only 100 years, the expectation to ever study element 117 did not yet exist.
“Hundred years later, we study its production and some of its properties. For other super-heavy elements, like flerovium (element 114), first chemical studies are conducted, with single atom quantities. The prospect that in the future it may be possible to find new materials is very fascinating.” Dr Duellmann hoped.
“The Indian team shared significantly and with responsibility, five and half months-long round the clock beam time at GSI, Darmstadt, Germany.” Dr Lahiri stated.

The Sydney Morning Herald claimed that the Australian researchers have co-created element 117; it is legitimate to call Lahiri and Maiti also the co-creators of the element.
So how did the collaboration between SINP and GSI Helmholtz Centre start? “On my personal endeavour, I started this collaboration with GSI Nuclear chemistry group, whose present spokesperson is Professor Christoph E. Duellmann” Dr Lahiri said. The Department of Atomic Energy funded SINP to carry out this and similar projects.
“It is now for more than 10 years that we are involved in the Super-Heavy Element (SHE) research (chemistry and physics of SHEs). The present result is a part of our continuous endeavour,” he added.

What makes stainless steel non-magnetic whereas ordinary steel and iron are magnetic?


S.P.S. JAIN


Greater Noida, Uttar Pradesh

We have to first understand how magnetic fields are generated around magnetic metals to answer this question. We know that within each atom, electrons spin on their axis that, in turn, causes magnetic field around them. Some electrons spin clockwise, some counter-clockwise. Generally they are paired so that the magnetic fields are cancelled. Iron which is a magnetic substance has three unpaired electrons. Each electron generates a magnetic field of its own.
If all the fields pull in the same direction then you have a magnet. In other words, the magnetic fields are aligned in a magnet. In the case of stainless steel, there are several types of them. In general they are made of iron (Fe), carbon (C), and about 10 per cent chromium (Cr). Some contain Nickel (Ni).
But other metals are added to obtain different properties. As stainless steel contains iron, a magnetic metal, one it would seem that it would be magnetic. However, when nickel (Ni) is added to stainless steel the result is a non-magnetic form of stainless steel, called austenitic stainless steel. At the atomic level, all the iron atoms act as mini magnets that are aligned in the same direction.
The net effect of this is that collectively the magnetic properties of all the iron atoms add up to produce the overall magnetisation of the material. This is known as ferromagnetism. But the addition of other elements to iron changes the properties. For instance, when chromium and nickel are added, the arrangement of atoms changes completely and this, in turn, affects the magnetic properties of iron. The nickel and chromium that are added to iron tend to cancel the magnetic fields and the net outcome is that stainless steel becomes a non-magnetic substance.

44 Indians shortlisted for one-way trip to Mars
","Forty-four Indians, including 17 women, are among 705 aspirants shortlisted for an ambitious private mission to send four people on a planned one-way trip to Mars in 2024 to colonise the red planet.
The Netherlands-based non-profit organisation Mars One announced that 353 hopefuls from around the world have been eliminated from the selection programme to become the first human Mars colonists.
The number of people remaining in this “once in many lifetimes opportunity” is now just 705, including 44 Indians of whom 27 are men and 17 are women.
The Indian aspirants come from cities such as New Delhi, Hyderabad, Mumbai, Kolkata, Pune and Thiruvananthapuram.
The applicants came from over 140 countries and more than 20,000 Indians had applied for the first round.
The remaining candidates will be interviewed by the Mars One selection committee.
“We’re incredibly excited to start the next phase of Round 2, where we begin to better understand our candidates who aspire to take such a daring trip. They will have to show their knowledge, intelligence, adaptability and personality,” Mars One Chief Medical Officer Norbert Kraft, said.
In December 2013, Mars One announced the selection of 1058 candidates, including 62 from India, from the original pool of over 200,000 applicants.
Mars One asked them to complete two tasks by March 2014: to provide a medical statement of health from their physician and open their on-line Mars One applicant profile to the public.
The 418 men and 287 women who successfully completed both tasks will be invited for a personal interview. 313 candidates originally come from the Americas, 187 from Europe, 136 from Asia, 41 from Africa, and 28 from Oceania.
The group of candidates that will not continue to the interview round dropped out due to personal reasons and medical reasons.
“The withdrawals due to personal reasons were mostly in the age group 40-50. Candidates who had to withdraw from their dream due to medical reasons were mostly in the age group of 20-35,” Mars One said.
“What really left an impression with us is the fact that the medical tests turned out to have a major impact on the candidate’s lives, as some of them found out that they needed to undergo an operation, were sick and needed medical attention, or even had a malignant form of cancer that otherwise would not have been detected in such an early stage,” Kraft said.
After the interview round, the group of candidates will be narrowed down to several international teams consisting of two women and two men.
These teams of prospective Mars settlers will be prepared for the mission by participating full time in an extensive training programme.
Training to go to Mars will be their full time job. Whole teams and individuals might be selected out during training when they prove not to be suitable for the mission.
Mars One will repeat the selection process regularly to train additional teams to replace eliminated teams and crews of settlers that have successfully left Earth to live on Mars.
Ultimately, six teams of four people will be selected to train from 2015 to 2024, leading up to the final four who will make the historic one-way trip to Mars.

Universe evolution recreated in laboratory
","Scientists have come up with the best computer model yet of the universe. This new virtual cosmos created by U.S., German and English researchers includes details never before achieved in a simulation.
Called Illustris, the numerical-based model covers the 13 billion-year evolution of the universe beginning just 12 million years after the Big Bang, or creation. The model accurately depicts the distribution and composition of various types of galaxies.
Illustris was developed by a team led by astrophysicist Mark Vogelsberger of Massachusetts Institute of Technology. It’s described in Thursday’s issue of the journal Nature.
The Illustris creators say it represents “a significant step forward in modelling galaxy formation.” They attribute their success to advanced computer power.
Previous attempts have broadly reproduced the web of galaxies, but failed to create mixed populations of galaxies or predict gas and metal content

Supercapacitor built from discarded lithium ion batteries
","Used old batteries can now help create supercapacitors, which can in turn create better long-lasting batteries.
Scientists from CSIR–Central Electrochemical Research Institute (CSIR-CECRI) in Karaikudi, Tamilnadu, and CSIR–Central Salt and Marine Chemicals Research Institute (CSIR-CSMCRI) in Bhavnagar, Gujarat, collected discarded lithium-ion batteries and created reduced graphene oxide from them. This new material showed high specific capacity at low current making it an ideal material for next generation high-performance supercapacitor.
“The specific capacity was found to be 112 farad per gram from fundamental evaluation, which is almost equal to the commercially available ones. Also the ones available in market today are created using activated carbon which is expensive and environmentally hazardous while our method is cheaper and fully environmental friendly” explains by Sivasankara Rao Ede, Ph.D scholar from CSIR-CECRI and one of the first authors of the paper published in Colloids and Surfaces A: Physicochemical and Engineering Aspects.
The new electrodes made using the reduced graphene oxide showed high stability even after 20,000 cycles. They also had high retention capacity where 70% of the efficiency was retained even after 85 cycles. The efficiency slowly increased and reached 108% after 20,000 cycles. The long-term stability and robustness of the capacitor are the key parameters for qualifying as suitable candidates for commercial application.
“Today lithium-ion batteries are used widely and disposed after they run out, leading to mounting e-waste. We tried a new method and succeeded in recycling and reusing these batteries,” says Dr Subrata Kundu, from CSIR-CECRI and one of the corresponding authors.
The graphite anode and aluminium and stainless steel from dismantled batteries were used. The graphite was converted into graphene oxide by oxidation and subsequent exfoliation. Graphene oxide was further reduced to reduced graphene oxide.
Supercapacitors are now being used explicitly in wind turbine pitch control, rail (on-board or wayside), automotive (including hybrid vehicles), heavy industrial equipment, UPS and Telecom systems for power delivery and memory backup. “We are further evaluating the capacitive nature of our prepared electrode in two electrode system and hope to bring it out soon for large scale commercial applications,” says H. C. Bajaj, emeritus scientist at CSIR-CSMCRI and the other corresponding author.

Oldest family tree built up from citizen science data
"," Columbia University researchers have identified a huge family tree spanning 11 generations based on data from a collaborative genealogy website. This is the largest single-family tree established so far. With 13 million people under its canopy, it is of the order of the population of Bengaluru. Though the researchers would need to go back 65 generations further to get the whole tree and converge on a single ancestor, the existing data is good enough to indicate some factors. By comparing each individual’s lifespan to that of their relatives, and looking at their degree of separation, they find that good longevity genes can extend a person’s lifespan by just 5%, indicating the slight role of genes in affecting lifespan.

Dual mechanism for embryonic stem cells to maintain pluripotency
","Embryonic stem cells are capable of generating all the cell types that compose the organs and systems of the human body. Now, researchers at Pune’s National Centre for Cell Science (NCCS) have found a dual mechanism that keeps specific genes off, which helps the embryonic stem cells maintain pluripotency — their ability to give rise to all the cell types. The dual mechanism functions in such a way that even if one mechanism fails, the other can function as a back-up and help the embryonic stem cells maintain pluripotency.
Embryonic stem cells contain multiple endocytosis-associated genes whose expression is suppressed unlike in the case of the specialised or differentiated cells. Some of the genes are directly responsible for or involved in the regulation of the transport of molecules present on the cell surface membrane to the interior of the cell. The precise mechanism by which the expression of endocytosis-associated genes are turned off in embryonic stem cells and the role of endocytosis (transport of molecules from the membrane surface to inside the cell) in maintaining pluripotency was not known. A team led by Dr Deepa Subramanyam from NCCS has deciphered them. The results were published in the journal Scientific Reports.
“We attempted to identify and ascertain if certain genes that are associated with endocytosis have their expression kept under check or not in stem cells, and if these genes had any role in maintaining the stemness of embryonic stem cells,” says Dr Subramanyam.
The team identified two pathways — polycomb repressive complex (PRC2) and embryonic stem cell-specific cell cycle (ESCC) regulating microRNAs — that suppressed the expression of the endocytosis-associated genes in embryonic stem cells but not in cells that have already differentiated. While the expression of 50 endocytosis-associated genes is kept under check by one pathway (PRC2), the expression of a smaller subset of 12 genes is also reduced by the action of the second pathway (ESCC).
The PRC2 complex has four subunits, and when one particular subunit (Ezh2) was knocked down it led to significant increase in the expression of endocytosis-associated genes. Similar results were obtained when another subunit (Suz12) was knocked down.
Stem cells have a class of small non-coding microRNAs called the ESCC-family of microRNAs. The microRNAs work by binding to the complementary sites seen on messenger RNA (mRNA). “Of the 50 endocytosis-associated genes, 21 genes had complementary sites for the microRNA, indicating that these 21 could potentially be controlled by microRNAs,” she says.
“The function of the PRC2 complex is to suppress the expression of the 50 endocytosis-associated genes. And the microRNAs function as a back-up, in case the expression of some of the genes is not completely shut down by the action of the PRC2 complex,” says Dr Subramanyam. The stem cells will continue to exhibit pluripotency as long as the expression of the endocytosis-associated genes is turned off.
To confirm that the genes have to necessarily be turned off for pluripotency to be maintained in stem cells, the researchers introduced the genes into stem cells in such a manner that the expression of these genes was not turned in the stem cells. “We introduced only one gene at a time and we tested a total of two genes. In both cases, the embryonic stem cells began losing their pluripotency and there was an upregulation of differentiation markers,” says Ridim Dadasaheb Mote from NCCS and first author of the paper.
“Our work will be helpful in regenerative medicine. Understanding the pathways and mechanism of endocytosis can now give us a handle to try and convert induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells, which are pluripotent, into specialised cells, such as neurons, by altering the expression of the endocytosis-associated genes,” says Dr Subramanyam.

JNCASR’s novel material to convert waste heat into electricity ","A novel compound that exhibits poor thermal conductivity in the 25-425 degree C range but shows good electrical conductivity has been developed by a team of researchers led by Dr Kanishka Biswas from Bengaluru’s Jawaharlal Nehru Centre for Advanced Scientific Research (JNCASR). The compound, silver copper telluride (AgCuTe), shows promise as a thermoelectric material for converting waste heat into electricity.
Since nearly 65% of utilized energy is wasted as heat, the focus is on developing materials that exhibit good thermoelectric property with both glass- and metal-like properties. Potential applications of the thermoelectric technology are in automobile industry, chemical, thermal and steel power plants where large quantities of heat are wasted.
Due to the low thermal conductivity of the material developed by JNCASR, one end of the 8 mm-long rod that is contact with waste heat remains hot while the other end maintains cold temperature. The temperature difference is essential for the generation of electrical voltage. At the same time, the material exhibits good electrical conductivity like metal. The results were published in the journal Angewandte Chemie.
In the AgCuTe material, the silver atoms (cation) are weakly bound, giving rise to poor thermal conductivity due to the slow vibration of the lattice (soft lattice). At high temperatures, copper in the material further lowers the thermal conductivity along with silver. “Since the silver lattice vibrates slowly, it provides record low thermal conduction of 0.35 W per metre per kelvin, which is actually close to the glass,” Dr Biswas says.
“Both cations [silver and copper] contribute to low thermal conductivity but silver contributes more. Over 170 degree C, both silver and copper ions flow like liquid within the rigid tellurium sublattice, thereby reducing the thermal conductivity to the level of glass without affecting the hole (electrical carrier) transport,” says Subhajit Roychowdhury from JNCASR and first author of the paper.
In contrast, the tellurium atoms (anion) are strongly bound and the lattice is very rigid. The strongly bound tellurium provides a conduction channel for holes thus rendering good electrical conductivity as seen in metals.
“By combining silver and copper with tellurium we have made our material as a combination of glass and metal — poor thermal conductivity and good electrical conductivity,” Dr Biswas says.
“Silver telluride does not have good thermoelectric property because it has higher thermal conductivity than our material,” says Roychowdhury.
It is a challenging task to have glassy and metallic properties in a single material, which is the fundamental challenge in the field of thermoelectrics. “We addressed this challenge through structural chemistry by creating a bonding hierarchy in the material,” Dr Biswas says.
The calculated efficiency to convert heat into electricity is 14% for the new material developed by JNCASR researchers. The lead telluride (PbTe) has higher efficiency of 18%. “But unlike lead telluride that contains lead, which is toxic, our material is lead-free,” he adds. The theoretical calculation to know the electronic structure was done in collaboration with Prof. Umesh V. Waghmare of JNCASR and coauthor of the paper. “We are trying to increase the efficiency by doping with different cations and anions,” Dr Biswas says.

Mobile nanotweezers can pick, drop live bacteria
","A team from Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru, has succeeded in designing a new class of mobile nanotweezers that can pick up, hold and move tiny cargo, the size of molecules, in a fluid. The work by Souvik Ghosh and Ambarish Ghosh of Centre for Nanoscience and Engineering, IISc, overcomes the earlier limitation of nanotweezers that were only able to trap and hold the molecules. Apart from nanoscale assembly – where tiny objects such as nanodiamonds or quantum dots need to be picked up and moved to a desired location — this has applications also in microfluidics, where live bacteria need to be manipulated and in biomedicine.
Picking up and moving molecules suspended in a fluid, such as a colloid, is a busy area of research. Plasmonic nanotweezers — nanosized tweezers made of noble metals, which have been studied so far to trap cargo, have the limitation that they are fixed in position. When they are illuminated by light, they develop a ‘potential gradient’ around them. This is like a slope, and nearby particles get attracted to the potential’s minimum just as things roll down a slope. However, the limitation is that it can only capture particles that are within the range of the field.
In the new work, the robotic, mobile nanotweezer can pick up tiny particles and move them over a short distance when the microrobots are subjected to an external magnetic field. “We can tune our trapping and releasing mechanism by subsequently turning the incident illumination on and off. To move these nanotweezers, we use a rotating magnetic field which rotates the helix [of the nanotweezer] and [moves it] like a cork-screw,” says Souvik Ghosh, first author of the study published in Science Robotics.
The colloidal particles move due to thermal fluctuations, therefore it is very difficult to manipulate the nanoparticles. Also as the size of the particles decreases, so, too, does the trapping force. The researchers’ main challenge was to overcome this and generate sufficient trapping force using a small amount of laser power. To achieve this, small helical structures are grown on a pre-patterned substrate by electron beam evaporation of silicon dioxide (made of mostly glass). “The substrate is kept at an extreme angle to the incoming vapour flux and rotated slowly to achieve the helical shape. Apart from glass, we also combine silver (plasmonic properties) and iron (magnetic properties) nanostructures at appropriate places on the helical body,” explains Souvik Ghosh, in an email to The Hindu.
As a next step, the team is working on parallelising the process. Thus, a series of microrobots will work together like an assembly line. “This will allow us to scale up our technology and will surely have commercial impact, and initial results are promising,” says Mr Ghosh.

Roadkills of wild animals in the Ghats
"," The roads that Valparai’s tourists love driving through to spot wildlife also see numerous animal deaths. Road surveys show that almost 3,000 animals died on approximately 1,500 km of roads in Tamil Nadu's Valparai plateau in 2011-12 alone.
Valparai’s road network meanders through rainforest fragments and tea, coffee, cardamom and eucalyptus plantations in the Anamalai Hills of the Western Ghats. Along with people, animals – including endangered Asian elephants and lion-tailed macaques – also live on this high-elevation plateau. However, fragmentation of habitats ensures that wildlife have to cross roads when they move about. A study recorded 73 reptile deaths on the Valparai roads in 2001; mammal and insect deaths are also frequent here.
Scientists of the Nature Conservation Foundation (NCF) walked along eleven road sections passing through various habitats in the Valparai plateau. They noted roadkills of all animal taxa across seasons (surveying totally1473.4 kms, including a State Highway) in 2011-12.
Their results, published in the journal Current Science, show that 2,969 animals died on Valparai’s roads during this time, which translates approximately to an average of 21 animals per 10 km of road. Almost 50% of these kills comprised amphibians — toads, frogs and caecilians (limbless, snake-like amphibians). Rodents and shrews comprised a majority of the 148 mammal kills. The Indian crested porcupine, the brown palm civet (a fruit-eater endemic to the Western Ghats), larger mammals like sambar deer and endemic lion-tailed macaques also figured in the list of mammal roadkills.
When the team compared deaths across seasons, they found that roadkill rates were 2.4 times higher during the monsoons than during summer. This could be because many amphibians breed and move across land during the monsoon, write the authors. What habitat the road passed through also mattered; roads passing through tea plantations, followed by forests habitats, saw the highest deaths at 1,402 and 948, respectively. Forest patches had the highest mammal roadkills.
The team’s findings could help identify specific management measures for different habitats to prevent or reduce roadkills in Valparai and similar places. According to the authors, roads through forest patches need urgent attention because forest-dependant and endemic species died most here. Drains along roadsides with underpasses at regular intervals can also provide safe passages for small-sized taxa like amphibians.
“But mitigation measures have to be taxa- and habitat-specific, and should be implemented on road stretches which see a lot of roadkills,” said P. Jeganathan (NCF), lead author of the study.

NASA launches advanced weather satellite for western U.S. ","NASA launched another of the world’s most advanced weather satellites on Thursday, this time to safeguard the western U.S.
The GOES-S satellite thundered toward orbit aboard an Atlas V rocket, slicing through a hazy late afternoon sky. Dozens of meteorologists gathered for the launch, including TV crews from the Weather Channel and WeatherNation.
GOES-S is the second satellite in an approximately $11 billion effort that’s already revolutionising forecasting with astonishingly fast, crisp images of hurricanes, wildfires, floods, mudslides and other natural calamities.
The first spacecraft in the series, GOES-16, has been monitoring the Atlantic and East Coast for the past year for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration . The same first-class service is now coming to the Pacific region.
Besides the West Coast, Alaska and Hawaii, GOES-S also will keep watch over Mexico and Central America. It will become GOES-17 once it reaches its intended 22,000-mile-high orbit over the equator in a few weeks, and should be officially operational by year’s end.
“We can’t wait!” tweeted the National Weather Service in Anchorage just before the rocket soared from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station.
The weather service’s Jim Yoe said on NASA TV that he was “really excited” to see his first launch in person.
“I’m even more excited about the work that’s coming up for me and my colleagues, putting these new data to work for better forecasts and warnings for the American public,” said Mr. Yoe, an official at the Joint Center for Satellite Data Assimilation.
With these two new satellites, NOAA’s high-definition coverage will stretch from the Atlantic near West Africa, a hotbed for hurricane formation, all the way across the U.S. and the Pacific out to New Zealand.
It’s the third weather tracker launched by NASA in just over a year- “three brilliant eyes in the sky,” as NOAA satellite director Stephen Volz puts it. GOES-16 launched in late 2016 and an environmental satellite rocketed into a polar orbit from California last November.
These next-generation Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites, or GOES, are “a quantum leap above” the federal agency’s previous weather sentinels, Mr. Volz said. This is the 18th launch of a GOES since 1975; one was lost in an explosion during liftoff and all but three of the satellites already up there are retired. Rockets by United Launch Alliance, a venture between Lockheed Martin and Boeing, carried all those GOES.
Even as it was still being checked in orbit, GOES-16 provided invaluable data to firefighters battling blazes in Texas, Oklahoma and elsewhere last March and to Houston-area rescue teams in the flooded aftermath of Hurricane Harvey last August, according to officials. GOES-16 also observed the uncertain path of Hurricanes Irma and the rapidly intensifying Hurricane Maria in September.
GOES-16 “turned out to be better than we expected it to be,” said National Weather Service director Louis Uccellini, on hand for Thursday’s launch. The satellite wasn’t officially on duty yet, “and we were just standing there gawking at the imagery,”
As Hurricane Harvey approached the Texas coast, the satellite revealed the clouds sinking in the eye and the eye expanding as the storm morphed from a category 2 to 4, Mr. Uccellini said. Those images helped determine when it was safe for rescue teams to go out and save stranded residents, he added.
The satellite also alerted authorities in Texas and Oklahoma to the eruption of new blazes even before the 911 calls came in, Mr. Uccellini said. He said the satellite also tracked the direction of the fires like never before, prompting first responders to later tell NOAA, “You saved lives.”
Two more are planned in this four-satellite series- GOES-T in 2020 and GOES-U in 2024. The $10.8 billion cost includes the development, launch and operation of all four satellites as well as ground systems through 2036.

1.5 million penguins discovered on remote Antarctic islands
","A thriving “hotspot” of 1.5 million Adelie penguins, a species fast declining in parts of the world, has been discovered on remote islands off the Antarctic Peninsula, surprised scientists said Friday.
The first bird census of the Danger Islands unearthed over 750,000 Adelie breeding pairs, more than the rest of the area combined, the team reported in the journal Scientific Reports. The group of nine rocky islands, which lie off the northern tip nearest South America, in the northwest Weddell Sea, housed the third- and fourth-largest Adelie penguin colonies in the world, they found.
 




“It is certainly surprising and it has real consequences for how we manage this region,” study co-author Heather Lynch of Stony Brook University told AFP. Just 160 kilometres away on the west of the peninsula — a thin limb jutting out of West Antarctica — Adelie numbers have dropped about 70 percent in recent decades due to sea ice melt blamed on global warming.
“One of the ways in which this is good news is that other studies have shown this area (the eastern side of the Antarctic Peninsula) is likely to remain more stable under climate change than the western Antarctic Peninsula,” said Lynch. “So we end up with a large population of Adelie penguins in a region likely to remain suitable to them for some time.”
Adelies are one of five penguin species that live in and around the Antarctic continent. A medium-sized penguin, they grow to about 70 centimetres (almost 28 inches) tall, and weigh three to six kilogrammes (about seven to 13 pounds). They are identified by a white ring around the eye.
They are carnivores, and krill — shrimp-like creatures that are commercially fished in the area — is an Adelie staple.




 
The Danger Islands group was discovered thanks to Earth-monitoring satellites, said the research team from America, Britain and France. “This is called the Danger Islands for a reason,” said Lynch. “The area is covered by heavy sea ice most of the year, and even in the height of summer it is difficult to get into this region to do surveys.”
Even the most visited of the isles, Heroina Island at the chain’s northeastern tip, receives only about one ship landing per year. Evidence of the previously-unknown penguin colony first emerged in data from the Landsat Earth-monitoring satellites run by NASA and the US Geological Survey.
Lynch and her team “then went and looked at higher resolution commercial imagery to confirm the guano staining that our algorithms had picked up in the Landsat imagery,” she said. When the Landsat data originally suggested the presence of hundreds of thousands of penguins on the islands, she thought it “was a mistake”.
“We were surprised to find so many penguins on these islands, especially because some of these islands were not known to have penguins.” Then followed a field expedition for a census using a combination of drone footage, pictures taken on the ground, and an old fashioned walk-about headcount.
“We were... very lucky to have a window of time where the sea ice moved out and we could get a yacht in,” said Lynch. The Danger Islands, said the team, has felt the ravages of climate change less than the western peninsula, and knew very little human activity.
Now it turns out, the area may need stronger protection from overfishing. “The most important implication of this work is related to the design of Marine Protected Areas in the region,” said Lynch. “Now that we know this tiny island group is so important, it can be considered for further protection from fishing.”
In addition to Adelies, the team also found about 100 nests of gentoo penguins, and about 27 nests of chinstrap penguins. The polar regions are warming more rapidly than the rest of Earth as heat-trapping greenhouse gasses from fossil fuel-burning build up in the atmosphere.

Scientists discover tattoos on Egyptian mummies
","Researchers have discovered the oldest figurative tattoos in the world on the upper arms of two ancient Egyptian mummies, the British Museum said on Thursday. A male mummy was found to have tattoos depicting a wild bull and a Barbary sheep on its upper arm, while a female has linear and S-shaped motifs on its upper arm and shoulder.
The artworks appeared as dark smudges in natural light but researchers at the British Museum and Oxford University's Faculty of Oriental Studies found the tattoos in 2017 with infrared photography.
“It's actually providing completely new insights into the use of tattooing,” Daniel Antoine, curator of physical anthropology at the British Museum, told Reuters.
“The location of these tattoos suggests they were designed to be highly visible on the upper arm and the shoulder,” he said, adding that the discoveries push back by 1,000 years evidence for tattooing in Africa.
The mummies were unearthed 100 years ago in the Egyptian town of Gebelein, around 40 km (24 miles) south of modern-day Luxor. They date to 3351 to 3017 BC, which is the Predynatic period before Egypt was unified by the first Pharaoh.
Researchers said the female tattoos may have denoted status, bravery or magical knowledge, while the male's were likely symbols of virility and strength. Prior to the discovery, archaeologists believed tattooing in Egypt was only performed on women, as tattoos were only depicted on female figurines of the period.
The oldest surviving tattoos are geometric designs on a mummified corpse known as Otzi, who lived around 5,300 years ago and was discovered preserved in the Italian Alps in 1991. The research, lead by Antoine and Oxford University's Renee Friedman, was published in the Journal of Archaeological Science on March 1.

When less is more
"," Let’s do a small thought exercise. What are some of the things that come to mind when you think of how startups work? Fast, agile, nimble, constantly trying out 10 different things at the same time, unafraid to take risks and failures, an always-on mindset, and many more such qualities.
Each one of these is an excellent quality to have. But I will say something that may sound slightly unintuitive here. These are all excellent qualities for larger organisations to aspire to, but not necessarily excellent qualities for smaller startups to have.
Let’s rewind to our thought exercise. Now, think of some qualities that come to mind when you think of how successful startups work. A thorough understanding of the problem that they are trying to solve, an unwavering focus on solving said problem in the best way possible, and importantly, the confidence and patience to give the solution as much time as it needs. None of this means that they have been slow, or have had stunted growth. It just means that doing too many things is not the route for maximum growth, but doing the right things the right way is.
There is a very basic problem with doing too many things. You will never do a good job of any of those things. And this problem gets exacerbated when you are a startup always low on resources, and faced with various constraints. Do not put 50 buggy products, or features, or services out there. You will never get a medal for 50 failures. Instead work on getting 10 really good things out into the market, and then watch the accolades roll in.
The reason startups fall into this trap of doing too many things is because a certain idea of “growth hacking” has taken root in the startup scene both here in India, and elsewhere. To the extent that a lot of founders have swapped the sounder idea of doing what’s strategic with just doing more. And that idea flows down the organisation from there. Employees are encouraged and empowered to just do more, and rewarded too. And while it is easy to get convinced that it is the right goal to have, it is very hard to notice that doing the right things often falls by the wayside in this quest to do more.
So how does a founder look out for this trap? For one, if you are doing too many things to solve some problem, and yet the customers are not adopting it, there is a good chance that the problem itself may not be pressing enough. Stop before you do even more things, and look at whether you are solving the right problem even. Next, avoid just validating every idea you are executing in isolation. Validate it against what your business is, and what gives you money. If it is not making business sense, drop it. And related to this, even before you start building something, make sure you know how to sell it. This way, your startup can avoid wasting time working on a lot of cool things that suck a lot of time and make you no money. 
Over and above all this, and this is a mantra that all my years of product management have taught me: Prioritise. Prioritise. Prioritise. At every step of the way. This automatically enables the discipline of working only on the most important things. Do less. That really is the best way of doing more.

Human ubers and viral videos - ramblings from the web "," 
Not quite laziness 2.0
Why leave the comfort of your home when you can just strap a live feed of yourself to another human being’s face and have them be your puppet? On that note, last month the concept of a ‘human uber’ went wild. In his quest to merge computer-augmented interaction with real-world environments, University of Tokyo’s Professor Jun Rekimoto breathed life into his telepresence project ChameleonMask.
Now the concept is making rounds on the net again, compelling some serious chat about getting this off the ground for real. 
According to Rekimoto Lab, “a surrogate user wears a mask-shaped display that shows a remote user’s live face, and a voice channel transmits a remote user’s voice,” while being careful to “eliminate many difficulties of teleoperated robots wandering in the environment.” Dystopian and thoughtful.
I don’t want to decrease the potential value of this project to people’s laziness; those who can really benefit from such a project include people with autoimmune diseases who’d love to step out, even if it’s virtual, or even those with crippling social anxiety who want to take small steps towards interactions.
Worth the wait?
For the past few months, WhatsApp has let us cover up our mistakes by pushing out a ‘delete after sent’ feature, which has honestly saved us from so much trouble — the catch was that one would have a seven-minute window to delete such a mistake, unless the receiver checks their messages frantically. Now, the messaging platform has extended that window to 68 minutes.
Available to a handful of Android users for the time being, the feature is being tested in beta version 2.18.69. So, yes, testing doesn’t mean confirmed implementation. So we’ll wait... for an hour, maybe. Seriously, WhatsApp, do you know how much help that would be to a sometimes-irresponsible texter?




Old school, new mindset
I’m not very good at writing in straight lines across guideline-less surfaces; so naturally, when I watched videos of Ghanaian teacher Richard Appiah Akoto conjuring a word processing program on a blackboard for his students, my jaw was on the floor and my mouth was catching flies. 
The genius was teaching IT to his students at Betenase M/A Junior High School in Sekyedomase, and when his Facebook post of this particular educational escapade went viral, he was immediately dubbed ‘Owura Kwadwo’, until he was finally identified. 
Detailed labelling of the various task bars and the shortcuts are seen, and the whole experience gave us serious pause, as a majority of the schools in third-world and developing countries don’t have computers and ready Internet at their disposal. It gave Microsoft pause too; they reached out to Akoto and offered him solutions to these logistical challenges: computers and software.
It’s nice, to say the least, that when matter goes viral, it’s not just the trolling that captures attention, but resulting helpful collaborations.

'Metal Gear Survive' review: potential let down by dull game mechanics "," After the public breakup between legendary game designer Hideo Kojima and Konami, the fate of the illustrious Metal Gear Solid, a series that Kojima has been synonymous with for decades, lies in the balance. While we do know the series will probably never have that cinematic flair and breath of life that Kojima’s signature style is known for, a return to the world of Metal Gear was inevitable. After the success and brilliance of Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain, Konami has a tough act to follow with Survive.


What’s it about?
Those who have played a Metal Gear Solid game will know the game is packed with lots of acronyms, secret organisations, code words, technologies and more, making it impossible to condense the story into a small space as this. Survive is sort of a standalone game like Metal Gear Rising, which takes place directly after the events of Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes. Taking place in a parallel dimension, where a portion of Motherbase gets sucked into a vortex, you play a soldier sent by a scientist known as Goodluck through the wormhole, to find out what happened. Except you’re infected by some sort of virus, and you’re surrounded by mysterious zombies.




In an attempt to continue what fans expect from a Kojima project, Survive continues the tradition of long cinematics, with an intro that tries so hard it turns out boring. This sets the precedent for the rest of the game, which has a story that has the makings of an exciting one, but ultimately fails on so many levels. Chief of them being the fact that it fails to arouse any interest beyond the interesting premise of a parallel universe, which is just a drab excuse of reusing The Phantom Pain’s maps.
Even the radio conversations, which serve for excellent story exposition and give you the perfect break in letting you get to know the characters, are boring in Survive. There is nothing memorable about the game.
How does it play?
Survive takes the series into new Survival Horror territory, with the signature stealth elements. The survival layer is admittedly fun, as you balance your water and food intake and relentlessly scavenge for ammo, food or materials to build your base. Making things worse, you are also on a time limit, as the infection takes hold, which means you need to scavenge more to stave that off. You can only achieve this by exploring more, and Survive takes great pains in making the process painful and arduous. As your hunger and thirst constantly slow you down, diverting your attention to constantly appease those.




The grinding elements are what bog the game down, though it is oddly relaxing with that whole find, rinse, repeat gameplay of finding resources. In addition to the survival, the game is about building and maintaining your base in a sort of a tower defence gameplay. Something like what Fallout 4 achieves, complete with surviving humans toiling to keep the base alive, as you scavenge for resources to keep everything running and the monsters out of your space. This is the most fun you will have in this game, after you have spent hours scavenging to make those brief moments happen.
Metal Gear Survive uses the same maps and resources as The Phantom Pain. Not to mention the game has an annoying micro transaction element, which would be all right if it didn’t charge you money to start a new character, while keeping your last one. In a world where games encourage you to replay the game with a new character, Survive should rethink this strategy. Even the enemy types are all the same, and there is no variation in their attack patterns to make the game challenging. Instead, the challenge comes from navigating the multitudes of menus micromanaging your base or your stats.
Should you get it?
At its core, Survive is a collection of some great ideas built by a passionate team. The execution though is a boring, uninspiring and uninteresting game that takes itself too seriously, resulting in a series of tiring chores. Survive is a game meant for ardent Metal Gear enthusiasts and those who want a serious survival horror sim.

Prysm technology: Starship enterprise
","These days, sophisticated networking platforms interconnect employees of an organisation so well that it doesn’t matter where people work from. However, there are occasions when a project demands the active collaboration of external subject experts, who are not employees. When the success of a project could hinge on how well these experts are integrated into the internal business ecosystem, you need something more.
One of the leading providers of collaborative workplace solutions is Prysm. On the ‘Prysm screen’, any type of content can be projected at the same time: Word, PDF, PPT, worksheet, video, and more. They can all be mirrored on different devices, moved around on the screen, edited by people at different places simultaneously in real time, making it a digital visual workplace that is a platform of platforms.




The key component of this technology is Laser Phosphor Display, patented by Prysm. Light from ultraviolet lasers is directed onto a screen that is coated with colour phosphor stripes. Phosphors are activated by the energy of the lasers, thereby producing an image.
The advantages of this system are: the screen is made up of tiles, so it can be easily customised; there is no distortion of images if you change their original size; images are clearly visible when viewed from any angle; and the system consumes very low amounts of power.
Guest mode
One of the new features is the ‘guest mode’. Imagine that a bank is using Prysm technology. The guest mode allows a person who is not an employee, to join the organisation’s internal system using an access code. The guest will be able to perform most functions that the employees can, except download content. The guest will have access, until it’s revoked, says GB Kumar, Vice President, APAC, Prysm Inc, while explaining the new features of the technology, at the company’s Bengaluru office.
Another update is ‘live source’ video streaming from any number of sources. “Ten screens can open up on the Prysm screen showing video content. Anyone can edit or annotate any of the screens,” said Kumar.
One of the big pluses of the Prysm technology is that it is third-party agnostic. It is compatible with existing collaboration platforms as well as video conferencing solutions from Cisco, Polycom, Skype for Business or Lifesize.
‘Co-browsing’ is another feature recently added. It allows different people in different locations to interact with the same web page or browser session simultaneously. In other words, all team members have the same view of the web content, and they work collaboratively on the same project. This is similar to what Microsoft OneDrive or Google Drive does, but on a much bigger scale, at an enterprise level.
Flexible system
Prysm technology powers many Fortune 1000 companies, and its customers belong to different industries including technology, energy, finance, healthcare, media and education. The company recently partnered with Vega Global for the APAC region. It has also tied up with Dell EMC for technology solutions for smart cities in India. Recently, it acquired Kaybus, a startup which is into the enterprise knowledge automation software.
The flexibility of the system — which provides the same laser phosphor display experience on an ordinary touch display system — is an advantage that is fuelling wide adoption of the technology. “It works for organisations like banks that have many branches across the country. The customer needn’t buy our screen. They get the collaboration appliance from us, which provides the same experience on the screen they have. So, the cost comes down drastically,” says Kumar.
He says customer experience centres have seen good deployment of this solution. “This is a new way of storytelling. It’s not like running just a PPT. We allow multiple collaborative applications to run simultaneously on a single platform accessible from anywhere on any device,” he said.
Other segments that have deployed the solution are global companies that have a base in India, Indian MNCs that have global operations, banking and financial companies, innovation centres, command and control centres of large Indian conglomerates, smart campuses, manufacturing and automobile companies, operations centres where brainstorming is key, and television studios.

What is cryptojacking and how can it infect your computer?
","The transition to a digital economy has rendered financial services more dependent on technology, and the maintenance of a robust framework to protect personal information has acquired greater importance. The already difficult task of keeping pace with hackers trying to access online finances has become even more complicated with the emergence of cryptocurrencies. It has spawned a new breed of hackers – cryptojackers. To understand cryptojackers, however, you need to understand cryptocurrency miners.
Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are based on a technology called blockchain, which involves maintaining a digital ledger to publicly record transactions.
A blockchain is reliant on the network of computers that run the software for the cryptocurrency. The computers participate in the relay of information regarding transactions made between holders of the currency. These computers, called nodes, can be operated by anyone who downloads the bitcoin software available for free online. When a transaction is initiated, encrypted details are transmitted among all nodes.




This web of nodes includes those operated by miners, whose objective is to group the outstanding transactions into blocks and then add them to the blockchain, since doing this involves a reward. Adding encrypted transactions to the blockchain is accomplished by the miner's cryptocurrency software solving a complex mathematical puzzle involving the numerical keys to the encryption.
Once a node has hit upon the right combination, it conveys its success to other nodes. Subsequently, other miners drop processing that block and move on to the next. The winning node that registers a transaction by adding it to the blockchain is rewarded in Bitcoin.
Often, the cost of mining becomes prohibitive since high-end machines with substantial computing power are required to solve the puzzle in a timely manner. The electricity required to power the hardware is also considerable, adding to the cost.
Cryptocurrencies are a boon for individuals or corporations which seek financial anonymity. The lack of a central regulatory authority has made it possible for trade in illegal goods to happen through the virtual currencies. However, exchanges that trade bitcoin have witnessed massive fluctuation in prices owing to speculation. The trade in bitcoin remains lucrative.
The valuation of a single bitcoin was ₹65,693 on January 1, 2017. Its value had peaked at ₹12,59,942 in December 2017, before conceding gains owing to factors such as governments proposing laws to outlaw cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin was valued at ₹7,40,376 at the time of writing. This implies that if a lakh of rupees was invested in bitcoin in January 2017, it would have yielded ₹19.17 lakh at the end of the calendar year.




Another way to have to a piece of the cryptocurrency pie is by leveraging hardware assets to mine for coins. The software for mining cryptocurrencies like bitcoin are open source and are available online. Applications that can be used for the same include Bitcoin Miner (which is available for free download on Windows through the Microsoft Store) and Easy Miner, among others. However, the hardware processing speed required to make mining a feasible are found only in high-end workstations that are powered by GPUs. Hence lone-wolf miners are a rare tribe in the sooty underbelly of the dark web.
The latest threat to computers worldwide is the rise of cryptojacking. The phenomenon is not restricted to the miniscule minority that trades in cryptocurrencies or uses their systems to mine for coins. All users who browse the internet are vulnerable to their systems being ‘cryptojacked’.
To work around the cost overruns that diminish the lustre of mining as a lucrative proposition, attackers have taken to employing malware to force an entry into the computers of remote users, and then using their hardware to mine for coins. This form of distributed computing can be profitable since it eliminates the cost burden of owning a mining rig with hundreds of processors. With more people on the Internet than ever before, there is greater computing power -- be it through desktops, laptops, tablets, or even mobile devices -- that can be maliciously subverted without the knowledge of their owners.
Cryptojackers usually target popular websites which draw audiences numbering in the millions every day. Once the malware patch has been embedded on a website, it infects the web browsers of visitors, slowing down their machines, often causing them to overheat.
Websites and apps which do not seemingly charge a fee for your consuming their content survive on revenue from digital advertising. However, websites like the file-sharing platform Pirate Bay have been found to be employing code which hijacks your system and uses it for mining Monero – a cryptocurrency whose value has almost increased fivefold in the past six months.
Many websites view this as an alternative source of revenue, bypassing intrusive advertisements. In return for content and services, proprietors of websites farm out processors located in disparate geographic locations to mine cryptocurrencies. Coinhive is a tool that allows companies to ‘monetize their digital business with their users’ CPU power.’ The tool patches the JavaScript for the website’s pages, enabling it to stealthily access the hardware of its users without their knowledge.
According to digital security firm Wandera, scripts like Coinhive can be embedded on to any app or website, and that users of social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and Pinterest are exposed to links containing malicious scripts. The increase in number of mobile devices which are being used to access the internet has also put a large segment of devices running on relatively open environments such as Android at risk of being infected. Wandera found that mobile devices that fell prey to cryptojacking websites and apps increased by 287% between October and November 2017.
Apple’s iPhones are also vulnerable to being cryptojacked. Wandera researchers found that an iPhone 7 which had a browser tab infected by Coinhive open for two hours, would result in the battery being completely depleted. It was also found that the temperature increased by 20 degrees Celsius from the ambient core temperature when the processor was used for mining at the behest of cryptojackers.
Most of the websites that have been found to use staelth to mine bitcoins on remote systems, use Coinhive. Despite the burgeoning processing power of handheld devices, laptops and desktops possess greater muscle to cruch the numbers required to solve hash functions for mining. Here is a list of applications that could protect your computer from attacks by cryptojackers.
1. NoCoin




It is an extension that can be loaded on web browsers like Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Opera. In addition to Coinhive, it provides security against other mining software which mine for bitcoin, ethereum, and ripple. However, it also allows users to turn off protection for certain websites. This provision gives users the authority to wilfully trade their processing power for the services offered by a particular website. NoCoin is an open source tool, the code to which is available on Github.
2. MalwareBytes




Unlike NoCoin, this a software package that acts as a bulwark against a wide variety of malware, and also hackers who try to breach private networks. It is an enterprise software with versions for both personal and professional use. The company boasts that its product detected and quarantined 1,30,000 WannaCry ransomware infections in the first week of its outbreak. Corporate networks are at greater risk to cryptojacking since the the terminals are usually interlinked and possess advanced hardware. MalwareBytes also allows users to remove particular domains or IP addresses from its block list.
3. minerBlock




minerBlock is another anti-mining browser extension that can block cryptojacking attempts by software patches on websites. It maintains a blacklist of compromised websites, and lets users manually add to this list. It is particularly effective in combating code snippets that may be hidden inline in web pages. This extension can block, as well as defuse attacks that have previously breached a system's firewall.
While these tools are not completely infallible, they provide a first line of defence against potential security breaches. Given the dependence of critical personal information on technology, the consequences of voluntarily, or involuntarily letting cryptominers trespass on your computing real estate can be far-reaching.

Linking Aadhaar with digital wallets: It's not all black and white!
"," Digital sustenance was familiarised or rather enforced upon the common man, which is still one of the foremost advantages to emerge out of demonetisation and ATMs perennially running out of cash (which still continues in major parts of Hyderabad). The dependence on digital wallets henceforth has been immense. PayTM’s first-mover advantage in this arena was of great benefit to the firm but the list of its counterparts are impressively long too-Freecharge, Airtel Money, Idea Money, Amazon Pay, Ola Money, Lazy Pay and the latest entrant Tez by another major Google has brought a lot of renewed excitement into this space. However, nearly all of them have put up a united front in pushing their alert button hard to customers on linking wallets with Aadhaar, even when the March deadline seemed a fair distance away. And now, users aren’t even given the benefit of choice if they’re to add cash into their wallets — the KYC enforcement has put many users in a spot of bother.
Some haziness
 Even as the haziness surrounding the security norms of the Aadhaar-link up prevails, most of the wallets have brought in a series of tough-to-resist cashbacks and offers to lure the user into parting with his/her KYC number. PayTM now provides a voucher facility for those who wouldn’t want to force the link-up, however the simplicity surrounding money transfers cease to exist anymore. PayTM users have an advantage of adding money through their Uber accounts — which still is oblivious to the Aadhaar-drama. Amazon Pay has time and again induced users with gift vouchers for every minimum sum they add on to the wallet, the most recent one being the ₹100 flat cashback to an addition of ₹300. Ola Money and Airtel Money have been on the forefront to provide temporary monetary advantages to those who adhere to the KYC with similar offers too.




To fall for the trap or not is something the user has to decide. Another way to look at it is the inevitability of the link-up — just that it has come earlier than needed. Most of these majors play up with the fact that there’s little else choice. 


Although the Aadhaar tie-up here is to ensure accountability to all the purchases, why is anonymity a tough bargain? ‘Why would a regular citizen who may use the wallets merely for mobile recharges’ even bother about accountability? It’s something they come prepared with when they enter the online space. With/without the link-up too, a transaction is recorded on the digital wallet for future reference. Another option that majors can consider is to involve the link-up is with purchases of higher order, where the danger surrounding authenticity/accountability can sometimes be high.
The other side
An advantage that these moves have brought in-is the trust of Unified Payments Interface (UPI)-oriented purchases, which involves a unique number authorised by a bank account holder. Though the KYC connection still exists with the bank, Tez, the Google-based payment app has made impressive use of the facility. That a major like Google is taking this forward has ensured a trust factor unlike the other apps. The user-friendly interface coupled with its right timing into the market will very likely give a tough competition to PayTM in the coming months.

A new state of matter created ","An international team of physicists have successfully created a “giant atom” and filled it with ordinary atoms, creating a new state of matter termed “Rydberg polarons”. These atoms are held together by a weak bond and is created at very cold temperatures.
“For us, this new, weakly bound state of matter is an exciting new possibility of investigating the physics of ultracold atoms,” says Joachim Burgdörfer, theoretical physicist from TU Wein and one of the authors of the paper published in Physical Review Letters.
Dr.Ganesh Ramachandran from the Condensed Matter Group at Institute of Mathematical Sciences, Chennai explains the new Rydberg polarons
How was the new polaron created?
This is an intricate experiment that builds upon several advances that were achieved over the past two decades.
It uses ideas from two different fields: Bose Einstein Condensation and Rydberg atoms.
A BEC (Bose Einstein Condensate) is a liquid-like state of matter that occurs at very low temperatures. A BEC can be perturbed to create excitations which are akin to ripples on a lake. Here, the authors have used a BEC of strontium atoms.
Electrons in an atom move in orbits around the nucleus. A ‘Rydberg atom’ is an atom in which an electron has been kicked out to a very large orbit. These have interesting properties and have been studied for a long time.
In this work, the authors used laser light on a BEC of strontium atoms so that it impinges on one strontium atom at a time. This excites an electron into a large orbit, forming a Rydberg atom. This orbit is large enough to encircle many other strontium atoms inside it.
As the electron moves around many strontium atoms, it generates ripples of the BEC. The Rydberg atom becomes inextricably mixed with these ripples and forms a new super-atom called a ‘Rydberg polaron’.
What will be the use of these Rydberg polarons?
A particularly interesting implication is for cosmology. Our universe is believed to be filled with a mysterious ‘dark matter’ which exerts a gravitational force on other matter.
Some theories of dark matter postulate that it is a cosmic Bose Einstein Condensate, perhaps composed of an as-yet-unknown type of particle. If we are indeed living in an invisible all pervading Bose Einstein Condensate, this experiment can suggest ways to detect it.

‘Hyper social’ tendencies behind smartphone addiction "," Humans are addicted to continuous social interaction, and not to their smartphone devices, a study of dysfunctional use of smart technology has found.
 The findings, published in Frontiers in Psychology, suggest that smartphone addiction could be hyper-social, not anti-social.
“There is a lot of panic surrounding this topic. We’re trying to offer some good news and show that it is our desire for human interaction that is addictive - and there are fairly simple solutions to deal with this,” said Samuel Veissiere, from McGill University in Canada.
 We all know people who, seemingly incapable of living without the bright screen of their phone for more than a few minutes, are constantly texting and checking out what friends are up to on social media.
 These are examples of what many consider to be the antisocial behaviour brought on by smartphone addiction, a phenomenon that has garnered media attention in the past few months and led investors and consumers to demand that tech giants address this problem.
 Veissiere said that the desire to watch and monitor others - but also to be seen and monitored by others - runs deep in our evolutionary past.
 Humans evolved to be a uniquely social species and require constant input from others to seek a guide for culturally appropriate behaviour.
 This is also a way for them to find meaning, goals, and a sense of identity. Researchers reviewed current literature on dysfunctional use of smart technology through an evolutionary lens.
 They found that the most addictive smartphone functions all shared a common theme: they tap into the human desire to connect with other people.
 While smartphones harness a normal and healthy need for sociality, Veissiere agrees that the pace and scale of hyper-connectivity pushes the brain’s reward system to run on overdrive, which can lead to unhealthy addictions.
 Turning off push notifications and setting up appropriate times to check your phone can go a long way to regain control over smartphone addiction. Research suggests that workplace policies “that prohibit evening and weekend emails” are also important.
“Rather than start regulating the tech companies or the use of these devices, we need to start having a conversation about the appropriate way to use smartphones,” said Veissiere.
“Parents and teachers need to be made aware of how important this is,” he said.

App helps monitor blood pressure using smartphone
","Scientists, including those of Indian-origin, have developed a new smartphone app and hardware that could help measure blood pressure more accurately than existing cuff devices.
The team, from Michigan State University in the U.S., also discovered a more convenient measurement point. “We targeted a different artery, the transverse palmer arch artery at the fingertip, to give us better control of the measurement,” said Anand Chandrasekhar, doctoral student at MSU.
“We were excited when we validated this location. Being able to use your fingertip makes our approach much easier and more accessible,” said Chandrasekhar, lead author of the study published in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
The approach uses two sensors: an optical sensor on top of a force sensor. The sensor unit and other circuitry are housed in a one centimeter-thick case attached to the back of the phone.
Users turn on the app and press their fingertip against the sensor unit. With their finger on the unit, they hold their phone at heart level and watch their smartphone screen to ensure they are applying the correct amount of finger pressure.
“A key point was to see if users could properly apply the finger pressure over time, which lasts as long as an arm-cuff measurement,” said Ramakrishna Mukkamala, professor at MSU.
“We were pleased to see that 90 per cent of the people trying it were able to do it easily after just one or two practice tries,” said Mukkamala.
While high blood pressure is treatable with lifestyle changes and medication, only around 20% of people with hypertension have their condition under control.
This invention gives patients a convenient option, and keeping a log of daily measurements would produce an accurate average, discounting an occasional measurement anomaly, Mukkamala said.
The research team will continue to improve accuracy and hopes to pursue more comprehensive testing based on the standard protocol of the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation.

An update for Apple users and more ","Flat-earthers, beware
I can’t find more than five people who dislike Neil deGrasse Tyson, but somehow, in the past 24 hours, that number has increased. The sassy astrophysicist has managed to tick off flat-earthers by giving a thumbs down to their beliefs in the latest instalment of his YouTube show, StarTalk, owing the falseness and ridicule of it all to a bad education system, coupled with the very-well-used freedom of speech.
In typical Tyson fashion, he introduces several pieces of evidence throughout history, be it from the time of the ancient Greeks or from far more recent research done by our fellows, adding, “That’s okay, as long as you don’t run NASA.”
Twitter, Tyson’s watering hole, was flooded with various opinions, most sarcastic. RealityCheck46 says, “I’m appalled that in the 21st century anyone would actually believe the earth is flat. Oh right, one of those alternative facts. #nonsense,” while user GenXMedia adds, “Well done. Too bad, the people who need this the most probably won’t see it or believe it.” I’m asking anyone out there with a friend or colleague who’s a flat-earther — show this to them, flood their messengers, spam their email inboxes, reverberate the facts in a verbal fashion until they don’t want to be friends with you any more... excessive?




Apple users, get updated
When our iPhone or iPad cables do that annoying bit where they start to fall apart, we venture out into the world to the nearest uncle’s mobile accessory shop and ask for the longest cable that will help us recharge while staying comfortably nestled in bed.
But now, Apple has released a new ‘Made for iPhone, iPad, iPod’ logo, where users can now know which products made by third parties are 100% compatible with their standards and specs...
But isn’t that kind of easy for cheapskate third parties to copy? Also, who out there still uses an iPod?

All about the idea
"," Successful startups come out of big ideas, great ideas. When Bill Gross, someone who is considered a startup guru, studied 200 different startups to understand factors most crucial to success, ‘Ideas’ made the top 5, at number 3. Behind ‘Timing’ and ‘Team’, but above ‘Business Model’ and ‘Funding’.
But a lot of the ideas that startups grapple with tend to be unproven, and thus laden with a lot of risk. The sensible thing to do is to validate them before work can be started in full earnest to bring those ideas into fruition, as either products or services. How does one do it? Even though hypothesis testing is a mature-enough science, startups do not often have the wherewithal for the time or effort that any such data-gathering exercise would take. 
Building a prototype or an MVP (minimum viable product) is often the correct thing to do to test hypotheses, but for most startups, the prototype is often the product, and entrepreneurs will be loath to spend resources and effort, with the knowledge that they may have to ditch what they have built. In a sense, this is a variant of that old problem of entrepreneurs loving their solution too much, something we have talked about in the past in this column. This is why we often have solutions that startups are very taken in with, but are not really solving any problem. Detaching themselves from the solution and attaching themselves much more strongly to the problem instead, is therefore, a great first step for any entrepreneur wanting to validate their ideas.
There is another big advantage that comes from worrying about the problem more than the solution. If one studies the problem comprehensively enough, it makes it easier for the entrepreneurs to find parallels in either a different problem, or a different market. And importantly, they can find such problem parallels where there are proven solutions. It allows you to abstract out the problem and its ecosystem, instead of trying to solve for the specifics right away. For example, if you are trying to come up with a solution for last-mile connectivity from Metro railway stations in Bengaluru, you can study how this problem was similarly solved in other Bengaluru-like cities around the globe, when the Metro first came to their cities. And then see how similar the solution hypothesis that you are testing is, to the solution that has successfully worked in the parallel problem ecosystem.
Of course, a crucial follow-up step after finding appropriate parallels for the problem ecosystem, where a solution already exists, is to be complete in understanding how the two ecosystems are different. For this determines how the solutions vary too.
Like any heuristic or thumb rule, this method of validating ideas does not guarantee complete success. However, it will definitely be more fruitful than jumping into a solution completely unvalidated, and takes far lesser time and effort than any sort of rigorous hypothesis testing of the ideas. In other words, perfect for entrepreneurs.

Far Cry 5 preview: Guns, gangs and gore
"," We buy into countless stories built around heroes and villains, but in games especially, we see the same thing over and over, served differently. Rarely do we face a disturbing reality that is uncomfortably within reach of regular people, led astray to perform unspeakable acts. Far Cry 5, plays on this reality. 


A new game, a new world
A family of religious zealots, led by Joseph ‘The Father’ Seed, has established a community of god-fearing cultists in Hope County, Montana. There are four siblings (including Joseph), the so-called Heralds, overseeing the Project at Eden’s Gate, which distorts the Bible to suit the group’s perverse wants and needs. Each sibling has a speciality role within the organisation: Jacob, the eldest, is ex-army, with an army of his own; the younger brother John is the lawyer and money man; and Faith, the kid half-sister captures hearts and minds with her charisma.
Not everyone is willing to sing ‘Kumbaya’ with a barrel of a gun stuck to their heads, in Seed’s worship-or-be-killed regime. A resistance has formed, as small pockets of the Hope County community are fighting back. Spurred into action by a handful of their very own charismatic leaders, you play a young deputy sheriff who has his commander murdered, leading you on a path of revenge. This makes things personal against Joseph Seed and his ilk.




Enforcing a divide-and-rule policy, the Seeds have carved Hope County into four main territories, with Jacob in the Whitetail Mountains of the North, Faith luring followers to the Henbane River in the East, and John nestled in the Holland Valley out West. So you have to take them down one by one to weaken The Father’s hold.
Paws for hire
We got our hands on the same build that was shown at the Paris Preview Event, and the signature Far Cry brand of first-person open-world shooter gameplay remains intact. This time around though, the mission structure of Far Cry 5 is much more organic, and story-focused. Instead of climbing untold radio towers to reveal sections of the map, routes and waypoints are unlocked after talking to non-player characters, or upon spying notes on tables or tucked between files. Side-quests shouldn’t mean being side-tracked.




All your activities are tracked by a nifty Resistance Meter, which balances your influence among the rebels with the level of attention being raised to the cult leaders. Any time you rescue civilians, destroy cult property, complete a mission, or liberate cult outposts, this counts in your favour, and frustrates the hell out of Joseph Seed. Good performance also has the benefit of rewarding experience points used to develop skills such as swimming, fishing and foraging, alongside fun stuff like additional equipment slots and becoming more powerful.
It is terrific fun, and challenging, to take on Seed’s army all by yourself, but you can sort of phone a friend with the upgraded ‘for hire’ system to include Friends for Hire and Fangs for Hire, in addition to the Guns for Hire perk that you may already know. Friends bring specialist tactics to the battle, while Fangs, which include a faithful dog, a grizzly bear, and a wildcat, can be called upon to use their animal agility and instinct to unsettle the opposition. Players may also invite a real-world friend to complete objectives in co-op mode, or just wreak havoc in the beautiful world.




Why should you care?
The game is an open-world first-person shooter set in rural America, where you, a bunch of friends and fangs for hire get to practise your First Amendment rights, usually with a plethora of guns and vehicles. 
Above all, you get to lead a resistance against a mad cult. It does help that the game looks drop-dead gorgeous and there are no loot boxes.

Five ways 3D printing is changing our lives ","The genesis of 3D printing technology can be traced back to 1986, when an American engineer, Chuck Hull, created a prototype for a process called stereolithography. Often referred to as ‘the father’ of 3D printing, Hull laid down the foundation on which the modern 3D printing technology is built upon. From increasing cost-effectiveness and efficiency to spurring innovation, the technology has made a significant impact on the manufacturing industry in the past couple of years. Here are five revolutionary applications of 3D printing technology and how they are transforming our daily lives.
In the first-of-its-kind concept restaurant in London, 3D printing specialist Food Ink introduced a three-day dinner pop-up series in 2016, where everything, from the food to the restaurant’s furniture and even the cutlery were all 3D-printed. The eatery conducted live sessions for its guests, offering a uniquely immersive experience of witnessing the printing in action and tasting some 3D-printed food. The food items on the menu were all prepared using the company’s ByFlow Focus 3D-Printers and fresh natural ingredients. The food printers use pureed ingredients filled in bags, which are squeezed and guided by its robotic arms to create aesthetically spectacular dishes.




Porsche recently announced that its Porsche Classic division has started using the technology to 3D-print obscure parts for its vintage cars. Using traditional production methods to manufacture these rare parts in limited quantities would otherwise be an extremely expensive affair. However, 3D printing has allowed the company to make cost-effective replacement parts to order, which also eliminates storage overheads. Porsche is currently 3D-printing nine such replacement parts, using steel or plastic to keep rare and valuable classic cars on the road.




GE was one of the first to introduce the technology into the aviation industry. The company, which built the first American jet engine in 1942, created a working mini jet engine made entirely out of 3D-printed parts back in 2015. While it was an experimental project, the company now uses the manufacturing technology to make engine components for commercial planes. In 2016, GE started testing its new engine, the GE9X, which has a sizeable number of 3D-printed parts. The GE9X is also the world’s largest jet engine ever, which has been designed for the upcoming Boeing 777X commercial aircraft. 3D-printing technology has helped the company to render parts once impossible to make, using conventional methods.




Scientists have been working on human capability-enhancers, such as robotic prosthetic limbs that can be controlled by the brain and provide sensory feedback. Additive manufacturing technology plays an important role in turning this dream into reality. Youbionic is a company that was started in 2014 with the sole purpose of creating an augmented human. The company has introduced a unique 3D-printed two-handed prosthetic, which can be controlled by flex sensors on the human operator’s fingers. Although the current functionality of the wearable is limited, it gives us a peek into the future, where capability-enhancing prosthetics will become a part of our daily lives.




3D-printing human organs for transplants may soon become a reality. BIOLIFE4D, a biotech startup, is soon going to open a lab in Chicago and begin perfecting the process of 3D-printing human hearts, that could eventually be used in transplants. Working with researchers in university labs, the technology will use the patient’s own cells, in what is called bioink, to produce a patient-specific, fully-functioning heart.

Over 500 genes linked to intelligence identified "," Scientists have identified over 500 genes linked to intelligence after comparing DNA variations in more than 240,000 people from around the world.
 The study, published in the journal Molecular Psychiatry, sheds new light on the biological building blocks of people’s differences in intelligence. Researchers from Harvard University in the US, University of Edinburgh and University of Southampton in the UK identified 538 genes that play a role in intellectual ability.
 They also found 187 regions in the human genome that are linked to thinking skills. Genes found to be linked to intelligence also appeared to influence other biological processes, researchers said. Some genes linked to intellectual ability are also associated with living longer, scientists found. They also found that genes linked with problem solving powers were associated with the process by which neurons carry signals from one place to another in the brain.
 Using these genetic discoveries, scientists predicted seven per cent of intelligence differences in an independent group of individuals using their DNA alone.
“Our study identified a large number of genes linked to intelligence,” said David Hill from University of Edinburgh. “We were also able to identify some of the biological processes that genetic variation appears to influence to produce such differences in intelligence, and we were also able to predict intelligence in another group using only their DNA.” 
“We know that environments and genes both contribute to the differences we observe in people’s intelligence,” said Ian Deary, from University of Edinburgh. “This study adds to what we know about which genes influence intelligence, and suggests that health and intelligence are related in part because some of the same genes influence them.”

Want your name to go to the Sun? NASA gives you a chance! "," If you want your name to travel through the Sun’s atmosphere, braving brutal heat and radiation conditions, here comes your chance. NASA is inviting people around the world to submit their names online to be placed on a microchip aboard its historic solar probe launching this summer.
“This probe will journey to a region humanity has never explored before,” said Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator for the Science Mission Directorate at NASA Headquarters in Washington. “This mission will answer questions scientists have sought to uncover for more than six decades.” 
In May 2017, NASA renamed the spacecraft from the Solar Probe Plus to the Parker Solar Probe in honour of astrophysicist Eugene Parker. The US space agency on Tuesday said it would accept submissions till April 27, 2018.




The spacecraft, about the size of a small car, will travel directly into the Sun’s atmosphere about four million miles from the star’s surface. The primary science goals for the mission are to trace how energy and heat move through the solar corona, and to explore what accelerates the solar wind as well as solar energetic particles. 
The mission will revolutionise our understanding of the Sun, where changing conditions can spread out into the solar system, affecting Earth and other worlds, NASA said. The spacecraft speed is so fast, at its closest approach it will be going at approximately 430,000 mph. That’s fast enough to get from Washington DC to Tokyo in under a minute, NASA said.
“Parker Solar Probe is, quite literally, the fastest, hottest — and, to me, coolest — mission under the Sun,” said project scientist Nicola Fox of the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in Maryland, US. “This incredible spacecraft is going to reveal so much about our star and how it works that we’ve not been able to understand.”

IIT Kanpur researchers find why babies need to move in the womb
","Formation of joints in the developing embryo and their maintenance after birth is sensitive to mechanical movement. Now, researchers at Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kanpur have deciphered the molecular mechanism underlying this phenomenon. They have demonstrated how permanent cartilage is formed in an embryo due to mechanical movement. They also found out how permanent cartilage is lost and temporary or transient cartilage is formed in its place in the absence of movement.
While permanent cartilage lines the joint, the transient cartilage is a bone-forming one. Earlier this group demonstrated that during embryonic development, a bipotential cartilage population gives rise to both permanent and transient cartilage. BMP and Wnt are two major signals regulating this process. While BMP promotes transient cartilage formation, Wnt promotes permanent cartilage formation.
In patients with osteoarthritis, the permanent cartilage acquires all the characteristics of a temporary cartilage, which affects joint function. Currently, in people with osteoarthritis, it is not possible to reverse the fate of permanent cartilage that has become a temporary-like cartilage. The work done by a team led by Prof. Amitabha Bandyopadhyay from the Department of Biological Sciences and Bioengineering at IIT Kanpur suggests that it might be possible to prevent osteoarthritis from worsening if intervened at an early stage. The results were published in the journal Development. The work was carried out in collaboration with the laboratory of Prof. Paula Murphy of Trinity College Dublin.
BMP signaling — which helps in the formation of transient cartilage — is normally not present in permanent cartilage cells in a joint. That transient cartilage forms in the place of permanent cartilage due to joint immobilisation was already known. And independently, the team had shown that BMP signalling promotes transient cartilage formation. “So we wanted to find out if immobilising the joints in a chick embryo allows the BMP signaling to come up in the joint cartilage cells. We did find that happening,” Prof. Bandyopadhyay says.
The investigation into what causes the BMP signaling to be present in future permanent cartilage cells when the joint is immobilised led them to a surprise finding. The lead author, Pratik Singh, found out that an inhibitor of BMP signaling (Smurf1) is absent in the joint that is immobilised resulting in increased BMP signaling. “The role of the Smurf1 inhibitor is to maintain a BMP-free area thereby enabling the progenitor cells to become permanent cartilage. But due to increased BMP signaling the permanent cartilage gets converted into transient-like cartilage,” says Prof. Bandyopadhyay.
The Smurf1 inhibitor is not directly involved in joint cartilage formation but creates an environment that permits the formation of permanent cartilage by keeping the BMP signalling under check. Mechanical movement seems to act like a toggle switch. In the presence of it, Wnt – the signal that promotes joint cartilage – is on and BMP signalling is off in the joint cartilage cells. The opposite is true when the joint is immobilized. This is the reason why immobilisation of joints causes greater disturbance to permanent cartilage than even inhibition of Wnt signalling.
“We are now investigating if osteoarthritis is also associated with appearance of BMP signalling in the wrong place. If so, we can block the BMP signaling in these cells during the early-stage of osteoarthritis to possibly prevent the condition from worsening,” he says.

NASA probe set to uncover mysteries of rare ‘relic galaxy’ ","NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope is set on an Indiana Jones-type quest to uncover a rare ancient “relic galaxy” hidden in our cosmic backyard that has remained unchanged for the past 10 billion years.
The wayward stellar island may provide valuable insights into the origin and evolution of galaxies.
The galaxy, NGC 1277, started its life ferociously churning out stars 1,000 times faster than seen in the Milky Way today.
However, it abruptly went quiescent as the baby boomer stars aged and grew ever redder.
Though Hubble has seen such “red and dead” galaxies in the early universe, one has never been conclusively found nearby.
Where the early galaxies are so distant, they are just red dots in Hubble deep-sky images. NGC 1277 offers a unique opportunity to see one up close
“We can explore such original galaxies in full detail and probe the conditions of the early universe,” said Ignacio Trujillo, at the University of La Laguna in Spain.
The researchers learned that the relic galaxy has twice as many stars as our Milky Way, but physically it is as small as one quarter the size of our galaxy.
Perhaps like all galaxies it started out as a compact object but failed to accrete more material to grow in size to form a magnificent pinwheel-shaped galaxy.
About one in 1,000 massive galaxies is expected to be a relic galaxy, like NGC 1277, researchers have said.
Massive galaxies tend to have both metal-poor (blue) and metal-rich (red) globular clusters.
The red clusters are believed to form as the galaxy forms, while the blue clusters are later brought in as smaller satellites are swallowed by the central galaxy.
“I’ve been studying globular clusters in galaxies for a long time, and this is the first time I’ve ever seen this,” said Michael Beasley, from University of La Laguna.
The red clusters are the strongest evidence that the galaxy went out of the star-making business long ago. However, the lack of blue clusters suggests that NGC 1277 never grew further by gobbling up surrounding galaxies.
By contrast, our Milky Way contains about 180 blue and red globular clusters.
It is a markedly different environment for NGC 1277. The galaxy lives near the centre of the Perseus cluster of over 1,000 galaxies, located 240 million light-years away.
NGC 1277 is moving so fast through the cluster, at two million miles per hour, that it cannot merge with other galaxies to collect stars or pull in gas to fuel star formation. In addition, near the galaxy cluster centre, intergalactic gas is so hot it cannot cool to condense and form stars.
The upcoming NASA James Webb Space Telescope - scheduled for launch in 2019 - will allow astronomers to measure the motions of the globular clusters in NGC 1277.
This will provide the first opportunity to measure how much dark matter the primordial galaxy contains.

4 tiny U.S. ‘rogues’ rode on PSLV in January?
","Four tiny experimental U.S. satellites that shot to space on an Indian PSLV rocket on January 12 seem to have suddenly got “high visibility” and become the talk of global space circles.
Their regulator, the FCC or the Federal Communications Commission, had in last December reportedly refused to authorise their space ride.
The four SwarmBEEs were put up by the California-based start-up Swarm Technologies to show its technology for a space-based Internet-of-Things communications network. Or two-way satellite communication and rekay, as ISRO described ahead of the launch.
Now the satellites measuring 10 cm x 10 cm x 2.5 cm centimetres are dubbed the first rogues from Earth. And as objects that cannot be easily tracked by the U.S. Space Surveillance Network because of their small size. The FCC fears that they may pose hazards to other satellites in space.
On Tuesday, Antrix clarified that a customer satellite’s getting the licence from its government was not its lookout. However, it advised future customers to adhere to the requirements of their respective regulators.
The FCC mandates that artificially launched space objects must measure a minimum of 10 cm x10 cm x10 cm on all sides; the BEEs were wanting on one side and hence did not get the approval, according to a December 12, 2017 letter written by Anthony Serafini of the FCC’s Experimental Licensing Branch to Swarm chief Sara Spangelo.
FCC has also put on hold its approval for launching the California-based Swarm’s next four satellites — this time through Rocket Lab, New Zealand.
The PSLV launch was signed by Antrix Corporation Ltd. and a U.S. intermediary company Spaceflight Industries, Seattle, which did so on behalf of Swarm. The BEEs 1, 2,3 and 4 (‘Basic Electronic Elements’ ) were part of the 28 customer satellites that were launched on the PSLV-C40 along with Cartosat-2 series Earth observation spacecraft and two small Indian satellites.
A statement issued by the Antrix Chairman and Managing Director said, “As per commercial launch services agreement of Antrix, the customer shall be responsible for obtaining all permits, authorisations and notices of non-opposition from all national and international authorities who have jurisdiction over the customer spacecraft mission. Since this is an internal matter of the U.S., Antrix has requested its U.S. clients to cross-check with the FCC for compliance of regulations before exporting future satellites to India.”
U.S. companies have turned out to be the biggest customers of the light-load lifting PSLV launcher — in particular for their small piggybacks or co-riders that go to space with a bigger primary satellite.
Of the 237 foreign satellites launched by the PSLV, more than half are from the U.S.

Chennai tops in broadband speed
","At 32.67 Megabits per second (Mbps), Chennai clocks the highest fixed broadband download speed among cities, according to a study titled ‘India’s digital divide: how broadband speed splits the nation’ by Seattle-headquartered firm Ookla. Globally, India is ranked 67th with an average speed of 20.72 Mbps.
“Of the 20 largest cities in India, Chennai’s download speed of over 32.67 Mbps for fixed broadband is 57.7% faster than the average for the rest of the country,” the analysis said. The analysis is based on February 2018 data from real consumer-initiated tests taken using Speedtest.
Speedtest by Ookla provides independent insight into the speed and quality of mobile and fixed broadband connections.




Fixed broadband speeds in metros including Delhi, Bengaluru, Hyderabad and Visakhapatnam were also higher than the country’s average of 20.72 Mbps.
Bengaluru follows Chennai in terms of fixed broadband speed with reported average speeds of 27.2 Mbps, while Delhi ranked fifth with average speeds of 18.16 Mbps. Mumbai was the lowest among the four big metros with an overall ranking of eight and broadband speeds averaging 12.06 Mbps.
The study also revealed that Patna is by far the slowest city compared to the rest of the country, with average speeds 62.4% slower than the country’s average.
A quick scan of the States shows that residents of Karnataka enjoyed the fastest broadband in India, with a mean download speed of 28.46 Mbps during the month of February, which is 37.4% faster than the rest of the country.
Tamil Nadu is a close second at 27.94 Mbps. Mizoram is the slowest with a mean download speed of 3.62 Mbps.
