CPI inflation quickens to 4-month high
","Retail inflation accelerated to a four-month high in May as quickening food and fuel costs lifted the Consumer Price Index (CPI) based reading to 4.87%, official data released on Tuesday showed.
The acceleration in price gains in May, a second straight month when the headline reading has risen, followed April’s 4.58% pace. 
The food and beverages segment saw inflation accelerating to 3.37% in May, from 3% in April, while inflation in the fuel and light segment at 5.8%, compared with 5.16% in the previous month.
“Retail inflation took another leap on anticipated lines and realised RBI fears of a further upswing, basis which the key policy rate was hiked by 25 basis points in the latest monetary policy meet,” Anis Chakravarty, Lead Economist and Partner at Deloitte India, wrote in a note.
 “Pass through of fuel prices largely led to surge in inflation while core inflation added to pricing pressures with broad based movement recorded across miscellaneous category, especially across travel expenses, education, and health.”
The overall miscellaneous segment in the CPI saw inflation quickening to 5.35% in May, from 4.96% in April.
Monsoon rains crucial
“Food prices also showed some increase... especially fruits and vegetables,” Mr. Chakravarty wrote. “However, they can be expected to stabilise on monsoon cues while core inflation can be expected to see further expansion if input costs remain on elevated levels.”
Oil prices are also expected to remain elevated for some time, which will continue exerting upward pressure on inflation, he added.
“In the immediate future, oil prices are expected to move between $80-85 a barrel,” D.K. Srivastava, Chief Policy Advisor at EY India, said. “So, they will be under pressure for at least one quarter, and this will have an effect. Food inflation is seasonality bound. Once the rains start, vegetable prices will come down and I would expect this inflation to moderate from mid-July onwards.”
Inflation in the pan, tobacco and intoxicants category quickened marginally to 8% in May, from 7.91% in April. 
The clothing and footwear segment saw inflation accelerating to 5.47%, from 5.11% in the preceding month.
Housing was the sole category where inflation reflected a deceleration, albeit marginally, from April’s 8.5% pace to 8.4% in May.

Low recoveries of NPAs: RBI data
","While public sector banks have claimed a ₹1,50,960 crore reduction in their non-performing asset (NPA) levels over 2017-18, about 55% of this was due to write-offs and only 27% was actual recoveries, according to data provided by RBI Governor Urjit Patel to the parliamentary Standing Committee on Finance.
According to the data reviewed by The Hindu, public sector banks saw a ₹1,50,960 crore reduction in their NPA levels from the start of financial year 2017-18 till December 31, 2017. However, the data also showed that the same period saw ₹2,37,475 crore of loans being added to the NPA list, thereby leading to an overall worsening of the NPA situation. Further, within the ₹1,50,960 crore ‘reduction in NPAs’, about 55% or ₹84,272 crore was due to write-offs. The data shows that only ₹41,391 crore, or 27%, of the reduction in NPA levels was due to actual recoveries. In addition, ₹25,297 crore worth of loans were upgraded from NPA status.
 

Urjit Patel assures parliamentary panel of steps to strengthen banking system


Private sector banks saw a reduction of ₹46,091 crore in their NPA levels by December 31, 2017 compared with what they were as of April 1, 2017. But, fresh additions to the NPA list amounted to ₹60,800 crore.
For private sector banks, about 40.2% of the reduction in their NPA levels was due to write-offs. Actual recoveries accounted for 34.2% of the reduction, while upgrades accounted for 24.1% of the reductions. Gross NPAs with public sector banks stood at ₹7,77,280 crore at the end of December 2017, up from ₹5,39,968 crore as on March 31, 2016. For private sector banks, gross NPA levels grew to ₹1,07,796 crore by December 31, 2017 from ₹55,853 crore as on March 31, 2016.
The data also showed that bank frauds increased in both number and value over the last three years.
While 4,693 frauds of more than ₹1 lakh were reported in 2015-16, this increased to 5,904 in 2017-18, an increase of about 26%. Over the same period, the value of these frauds increased from ₹18,698.8 crore to ₹32,361.27 crore.

RBI blames PNB board for fraud
","Blaming the board of directors of the Punjab National Bank for the embezzlement of over ₹13,000 crore by jeweller Nirav Modi and his uncle Mehul Choksi, the Reserve Bank of India on Tuesday, in a written reply to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Finance, said all “three lines of defence” built in the banking system failed in this case.
RBI Governor Urjit Patel deposed in front of the panel, headed by Congress leader Veerappa Moily. The Hindu has reviewed the two documents submitted by the RBI to the panel.
The central bank said all financial institutions were adequately warned about dealing with Letters of Undertaking (LoUs), the primary tool of embezzlement by Nirav Modi. The RBI said it was the primary responsibility of the PNB board to understand the risks in issue of LoUs without collateral and to manage them through controls. It said each bank should have three lines of defence: first, the officer sanctioning the loan; second, at the managerial level; and third, the internal audit. “In the case of PNB, there seems to have been failure of all the three lines of defence.”
The RBI told the panel that its supervisory process does not constitute an audit of banks.
“With the number of commercial bank branches being more than 1,16,000 in the country it would be impossible to cover each and every branch under the RBI’s supervisory process,” the central bank said.
It also accused PNB of submitting a factually incorrect compliance report with regard to LoUs.
In its reply to the panel’s questionnaire, the RBI complained that it does not have regulatory powers over public sector banks (PSBs) which have the greater share of non-performing assets.
As on December 31 last year PSBs had NPAs worth ₹7,77,280 crore while the private sector banks had NPAs worth ₹1,07,796 crore.
The RBI said the main constraint was that public sector banks are “corporations” and not a “banking company” — so they do not come directly under the ambit of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949.
The central bank has asked for nine additional powers with regard to the public sector banks including the ability to “remove the Chairman and Managing Director and appoint them.” It also wants powers to grant and impose conditions on licences.
The RBI wants a say in appointment of managerial positions, including the power to supersede the Board of Directors and make application for winding up the errant banks.
Parliamentarians questioned Mr. Patel on the recent reports of ATMs running low on cash and the big question of exactly how much currency returned to the banking system after demonetisation. “Mr. Patel was not exactly forthcoming. He did not answer many of these questions. He insisted that steps taken to bring down the non- performing assets are bearing fruit and the NPAs are going down,” a senior Opposition MP who attended the meeting said.

","Aditya Birla Fashion and Retail Ltd (ABFRL) has introduced the American Eagle casual denim brand in India and plans to open 30 exclusive stores in three years. The company has opened the first outlet in Delhi and plans to focus on the top five metros to begin with.
In the mid to premium denim clothing segment, the brand is eyeing a market share of 18% to 25% in seven years, top company officials said.

Amazon India unveils Seller Lending Network, uses machine learning to facilitate loans
","Amazon India on Wednesday unveiled its ‘Seller Lending Network,’ further scaling its ‘Seller Lending program’ introduced in 2016. This would offer sellers on Amazon.in loan options from multiple third-party lenders.
The online retailer said the network would provide wider selection, wherein sellers can choose loan offers tailored for their business needs from multiple lenders and loan types. Amazon India said sellers stand to save about 150-250 bps (basis points) on interest rates due to competitive rates offered by the lenders.
Amazon also said sellers can now avail loans via an online application process with minimal documentation. This includes a very quick loan approval process of 2-3 days for new loans and intra-day approval for existing loan renewals.
“What we wanted to remove is a lack of working capital [for sellers] as a reason not to start selling online. We started this programme in 2016. Two years later we noticed there is an opportunity to make this programme even better,” said Gopal Pillai, general manager and director, seller services, Amazon India.
Machine learning
The Seller Lending Network also has Lender Central, a portal for lenders (similar to Seller Central for sellers), to facilitate exchange of information between lenders and Amazon. This facilitates information about seller performance data, loan application status and loan portfolio details. In addition, lenders can track the performance of a seller on Amazon.in real-time, thereby allowing lenders to better assess the sellers and make loan-decisioning models more comprehensive.
Lenders also benefit from Amazon’s machine learning models that provide early warning signals and help them maintain a high-quality loan book, the company said.
“We have a very proven algorithm that predicts the seller's capability to repay based on their historical performance,” said Mr. Pillai.
Currently, Aditya Birla Finance, Bank of Baroda, Capital First, Capital Float, Flexiloans, and Yes Bank are part of the lending program, offering loans to thousands of sellers through Seller Lending Network. Amazon said the lending partners benefit from access to a pool of customers, seamless data exchange and loan repayment, thereby simplifying and reducing their operational overheads. Mr.Pillai said the banks and non-banking financial companies don’t see Amazon as a competitor.
“They are our partners [and] also our customers. What we are able to transform is the intelligence we can give to the banks based on the seller’s historical performance in the marketplace… for them to get the confidence to give it [loan],” he said.
Since its launch in June 2013 with a few hundred sellers, Amazon India said there are over 3,40,000 sellers selling on its marketplace. These sellers have listed more than 170 million products on Amazon.in.

Bajaj Allianz Life to add focus on big cities, unveil two ULIPs
","Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance Company Ltd. plans to increase its focus on large cities, changing a hitherto pursued strategy of selling insurance to a mass-based population mainly in the non-metro cities.
MD & CEO Tarun Chugh said in an interaction that the company was unveiling two Unit Linked Insurance Plans (ULIPs) with features like “return of mortality charges”, which would enable a policyholder to get back this charge, which is the cost paid by the insured towards the life cover. 
In ULIP, such ‘cost of life’ cover is called mortality charge and is deducted for all customers through the policy term, according to the company. Indicating that such ‘returns’ were unique in the industry, Mr. Chugh said: “We are making our ULIPs more attractive with very strong value proposition for our customers.” Mortality charge is typically linked with a policyholder’s age, gender and sum-at-risk. 
Similar to bonus
The firm will add these amounts (like bonuses) to the customer’s maturity amount, encouraging them to stay invested. 
Mr. Chugh also announced a goal-based savings policy — a ULIP for customers with an appetite for the equities market. With these products targeted at city-based equity-savvy people, the insurer aims to increase its presence in cities. “While earlier we were present in rented and owned properties in 632 branches, we have now begun buying properties in metros,” he said adding that the company already held properties in Kolkata, Mumbai and Delhi among other cities. 
The company is a JV of Bajaj Finserve Ltd. and Allianze SE. It started operations in 2001 and has 3.4% share of the market.

Trade deficit widens to $14.62 billion
"," India’s merchandise trade deficit widened to $14.62 billion in May 2018, official data released on Friday showed. The shortfall was $13.72 billion in April 2018 and $13.84 billion in May 2017.
“Exports during May 2018 were valued at $28.86 billion as compared to $24.01 billion during May 2017 exhibiting a positive growth of 20.18%,” the government said in a release. “Imports during May 2018 were valued at $43.48 billion which was 14.85% higher in dollar terms.”
Smart uptick
In contrast, merchandise exports in April had grown by only 5.17%, while imports grew 4.6%. The export growth in May 2018 was better than that seen in May last year, while the import growth was slower. Exports grew 8.32% in May 2017, while imports grew 33.1%.
The major export groups that witnessed strong growth in May 2018 included engineering goods (14.8%), petroleum products (104.5%), organic and inorganic chemicals (34.2%), drugs and pharmaceuticals (25.7%), and cotton yarn/fabrics/made-ups and handloom products (24.7%).
“Exports growing by 20% is certainly good news but the challenge is to keep the momentum,” said Ravi Sehgal, chairman, Engineering Export Promotion Council of India. “While a growing U.S. economy would help, the U.S.-China trade war must be watched. Back home, rising raw material costs will be a challenge.”
‘Vigil needed’
“Escalating trade war between the U.S. and China would vitiate the global trading environment, making it imperative for India as well to keep a vigil on the fast-moving developments,” Mr. Sehgal added. “With the U.S. confirming 25% tariffs on $50 billion Chinese imports and the Chinese stating they would retaliate, it is time for India to keep engaged with both the U.S. and China to safeguard our own interest.”
The government said, “Cumulative value of exports for the period April-May 2018-19 was $54.77 billion as against $48.65 billion registering a positive growth of 12.58% in dollar terms and 16.37% in rupee terms over the same period last year.”
“Oil imports during May 2018 were valued at $11.5 billion which was 49.5% higher in dollar terms and 56.7% higher in rupee terms compared to $7.69 billion in May 2017,” the government said. 
“Oil imports during April-May 2018-19 were valued at $21.91 billion which was 45.6% higher in dollar terms and 50.5% higher in rupee terms compared to $15.05 billion in the corresponding period last year,” the government added in the release.
The government, however, did mention that global Brent prices had increased by 50.7% in May 2018 compared with their levels in May 2017, as per commodity price data from the World Bank.

Dr.Reddy’s to sell generic version of opioid addiction treatment Suboxone in U.S. ","Shares of Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories (DRL) surged on Friday after the company said it planned to start selling in the U.S. a generic version of British drugmaker Indivior Plc’s Suboxone (buprenorphine and naloxone) sublingual film used in the treatment of opioid dependence.
The Hyderabad-based firm said it had received approval from the U.S. FDA for buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual film, 2 mg/0.5 mg, 4 mg/1 mg, 8 mg/2 mg, and 12 mg/3 mg and would be introducing the product in the U.S. with an approved risk evaluation and mitigation strategy programme.
DRL climbed 3.65% on the BSE to ₹2,351.10, the stock’s highest close in more than four months. Indivior plunged by more than 20% in London after the USFDA approved the first generic versions of Suboxone Film, an opioid addiction treatment that generates 80% of the company’s revenue.
White House economists said in a report in November that opioid drug abuse, which has ravaged parts of the U.S. in the recent years, cost the economy as much as $504 billion, or 2.8% of the GDP, in 2015.
‘Critical time’
Suboxone had sales of about $1.86 billion in the U.S. for the 12 months ended April 2018, DRL said, citing IMS Health.
“With opioid addiction becoming increasingly prevalent in America, the full approval and launch of our generic equivalent of Suboxone could not have come at a more critical time to help patients,” DRL’s CEO (Developed Markets) Alok Sonig said in the statement.
Shares in Indivior, which was spun out from Reckitt Benckiser in 2014, were down 22.7% at 0925 GMT and the biggest loser on the FTSE midcap index.
Mylan NV also received approval to market the substitute drug.
One analyst said the at-risk sudden introduction was a surprise and could threaten Indivior’s 2018 guidance.
Indivior could seek an injunction to try to halt a launch of the generics or launch its own authorised generic, analysts at Jefferies wrote in a note.
“If Indivior was to prevail in any of its on-going legal challenges then Dr. Reddy’s would be liable for damages,” Jefferies said, estimating that Indivior’s 2018 earnings per share could be hit by as much as 50%t if Dr. Reddy’s has sufficient inventory and launches by July 1.

Indian LPG, kerosene cheapest in subcontinent
"," Even as petrol and diesel prices in the country shoot up and decline in tune international crude prices, Indian consumers may take some solace from comparisons of prices of cooking gas and kerosene in India with its neighbours. Prices in the country for these two cooking fuels is still the cheapest in the subcontinent, according to data compiled by Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell (PPAC).
India has a total of 22.43 crore active liquefied natural gas (LPG) customers in the domestic category, according to government data, of which more than 18.11 crore, or greater than 80%, avail the subsidy. The LPG coverage of the country estimated on the basis of active domestic connections and estimated households as on April 1 is about 80.9%. 
Consumers in India paid ₹493.55 for an LPG cylinder weighing 14.2 kg, averaging ₹34.76 per kg for a subsidised cylinder and ₹671 or ₹47.25 for a non-subsidised cylinder as on June 1. 
Comparatively, consumers in Pakistan pay ₹1039.52 for a domestic LPG cylinder weighing 11.8 kg or ₹88.95 per kg, making it the highest in the Indian subcontinent.
Users in Sri Lanka and Nepal pay ₹815.30 and ₹867.11 for 12.5-kg and 14.2-kg cylinders, respectively. This translates to a price of ₹65.22 per kg in Sri Lanka and ₹61.06 per kg in Nepal.
Consumers in Bangladesh pay ₹643.79 for 12.5 kg LPG cylinders, translating to price of ₹51.5 per kg.
Indians began paying ₹25.03 per litre for kerosene from June 1. Comparatively, consumers in Pakistan pay ₹46.78 per litre, while those in Bangladesh pay ₹52.62 per litre. Consumers in Sri Lanka have to pay ₹43.25 per litre of kerosene and Nepal charges ₹58.02 per litre.

India hits back at the U.S. with tariffs ","In what could signal escalating trade tensions between New Delhi and Washington, the Centre has written to the World Trade Organisation (WTO) notifying its decision to increase import tariffs on 30 items from the U.S. amounting to $240 million, in retaliation against tariffs imposed by the latter on aluminium and steel imports.
The move is significant as it comes a day after Commerce Minister Suresh Prabhu returned from the U.S. and just weeks ahead of further talks between the two countries on the issue.
“India hereby reiterates its decision to suspend concessions or other obligations notified to the Council for Trade in Goods on 18 May 2018… that are substantially equivalent to the amount of trade affected by the measures imposed by the United States,” the Centre said in the notification to the WTO’s Council for Trade in Goods. “The proposed suspension of concessions or other obligations takes the form of an increase in tariffs on selected products originating in the United States, based on the measures of the United States.”
“India reserves its right to further suspend substantially equivalent concessions and other obligations based on the trade impact resulting from the application of the measures of the United States,” the notification added.
U.S. President Donald Trump, in March, signed an order imposing a 25% tariff on steel imports and a 10% tariff on aluminium imports, citing national security as one of the key reasons behind the move. The Indian government repeatedly requested an exemption from these tariffs as India did not pose a security threat to the U.S., but to no avail. India has also taken the U.S. to the dispute settlement mechanism in the WTO over the matter.
Surprising move
The decision to begin retaliatory measures against the U.S., however, is particularly surprising because Commerce Minister Suresh Prabhu, on his return from the U.S. on Friday, indicated that the two countries would try to resolve their issues through dialogue.
“If they wanted to take fresh action, they would not agree to talks and we would not either do the same,” Mr Prabhu told reporters on Friday. “Instead of measures and counter-measures, we decided to talk and resolve it out.”
The notification to the WTO was, however, dated June 13, before the Minister made his comment.
“The situation between the U.S. and India should not be viewed as a trade war just yet,” Rishi Shah, Economist at Centre for Digital Economy and Policy said. “A possible continuation of such steps from both sides may result in more friction on the trade front. However, it must be kept in mind that the last fortnight has seen ratcheting up of trade tensions in the West and also with China as the US has imposed tariffs. Given the less than optimal nature of such policies, it must be assessed how sustainable they may be.”
$240 million in duty
The removal of concessions on U.S. imports — on items such as chickpeas, lentils, almonds, apples and some metal products — will likely result in a duty collection of $240 million, according to the Centre. This, according to the government, was in keeping with the duty increase of $241 million due to the U.S.’ actions.
“India wishes to clarify that suspension of concessions shall be equivalent to the amount of trade affected by the United States’ measures,” the notification said. “To this end, India reserves the right to adjust the specific products for which suspension of concessions is effectuated, and its right to adjust the additional rate of duty imposed on such products.”
Notably, one of the items on which the import concessions have been dropped pertains to high-capacity motorcycles such as those manufactured by Harley Davidson, duties on which were one of the sore points mentioned by Mr. Trump about India’s tariff policy.
“It’s some bit of posturing and some amount of negotiation will happen,” Abhishek Jain, Tax Partner at EY India said. “I don’t think it is as big as what is happening between the U.S. and China. Of course, this move will make these items more expensive for Indian importers.”

Fund managers turn to tech, financials as trade worries rise ","The rising tensions over global trade policy are prompting some top-performing international fund managers to look for the companies that can emerge as winners.
Fund managers from firms including AllianceBernstein, Causeway Capital Management and Janus Henderson are adding to positions in companies ranging from Italy’s largest bank to China’s largest e-commerce company, all in hopes of avoiding the fallout from a global trade war.
Chief among the corporate attributes fund managers are now looking for are either a strong domestic business that would not be significantly affected by import tariffs, or a dominant market position, or intellectual property that would prompt customers to continue to buy its goods regardless of additional taxes.
‘Growth stories’
“The impact of a tariff is becoming a bigger factor in our decision-making,” said George Maris, a portfolio manager of the $2.2 billion Janus Henderson Global Select fund. Mr. Maris has increased his position in companies such as Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holdings that are dominating their domestic markets.
“Secular growth stories overwhelm the threat of increased trade frictions every time,” he said.
 U.S. President Donald Trump said he was pushing ahead with tariffs on $50 billion of Chinese imports on Friday, and the smouldering trade war between the world’s two largest economies showed signs of igniting. 
Mr. Trump laid out a list of more than 800 strategically important imports from China that would be subject to a 25% tariff starting on July 6 including cars, the latest hard-line stance on trade by a U.S. president who has been wrangling with allies.
The European Union, meanwhile, has challenged aluminium and steel tariffs imposed by the Trump administration at the World Trade Organization and has drawn up a list of goods it would hit with retaliatory measures.
The threat of tariffs, along with rising U.S. interest rates, helped sink global stock markets in February. Since then, major stock indices have recovered most of their gains, with the U.S. S&P 500 index up 4.9% for the year to date and the Stoxx 600 index of companies in the European Union up 2.5% over the same time.
Conor Muldoon, a portfolio manager of the $8.7 billion Causeway International Value fund, said that trade and other macroeconomic concerns are “presenting short-term opportunities.” The fund has been increasing its position in Italian bank UniCredit SpA, for instance, after its shares sold off in March following elections that renewed concerns about whether the country could exit the eurozone.
Mr. Muldoon’s fund is also increasing its position in durgmakers such as GlaxoSmithKline and Japan’s Takeda Pharmaceutical that have strong drug pipelines, he said. Shares of GlaxoSmithKline are up 19.5% year to date, while shares of Takeda are down 32% over the same time after it raised its $62 billion bid for Shire Plc.
Sammy Suzuki, a co-portfolio manager of the $77 million AB International Strategic Core fund, said that the threat of technological disruption in some markets was just as pressing a concern for some global firms as the impact of higher tariffs. As a result, his fund is focusing more on what he calls the “enablers”, which are back-end tech firms that do not trade at as high valuations as companies like Amazon.com and Netflix.
‘Tariff-resistant business’
Spanish firm Amadeus IT Group, for instance, provides the technology backing the reservation systems used by airlines including British Airways, Southwest, and Lufthansa Group. Shares of the company are up 20% for the year to date.
“Even if you wanted to, it’s difficult to rip them out of these companies,” he said.
Mr. Suzuki has also been increasing his position in European luxury goods makers such as Italian apparel firm Moncler and British alcoholic beverage company Diageo, both of which make products that should not be significantly affected by rising trade costs, he said.
“You can find tariff-resistant businesses that are in niches, but it takes work to find them,” he said.

Oil slumps 3% on OPEC supply, China’s tariffs plan
","Oil prices fell more than $2 a barrel Friday after two of the world’s biggest producers indicated they might increase output at next week’s OPEC meeting, while U.S. exports were threatened by potential Chinese tariffs on crude oil and refined products.
Oil investors have been nervous ahead of the coming OPEC summit in Vienna. Saudi Arabia and Russia have already boosted production modestly, and have indicated they were prepared to increase output at that meeting.
Brent crude oil fell $2.50, or 3.29% to settle at $73.44 a barrel. U.S. crude settled $1.83 lower at $65.06 a barrel. In post-settlement trading, U.S. crude retreated further, falling 2.25, or 3.4%, to $64.64 a barrel.
After settlement, China announced $50 billion in retaliatory tariffs, in response to a series of levies by U.S. President Donald Trump earlier.
Some investors were surprised when crude oil and other energy products were included for tariffs at a later date, the official Xinhua news agency reported, citing the Tariff Commission of the State Council.
Over the past six months, the U.S. has exported an average 363,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil to China, which along with Canada is the biggest buyer of U.S. crude.
“They were a big outlet, and we’re going to notice it,” said John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital. “It’ll take time for other buyers to absorb that crude.” U.S. crude’s discount to Brent widened after China announced the planned tariffs. 
Rising U.S. crude output
Both contracts have drifted lower since hitting 3-1/2-year highs in May. Prices have been pressured by rising U.S. crude production, while the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, Russia and others look poised to increase output in their meeting in the Austrian capital on June 22-23.
“We’re going into an OPEC meeting where everyone is talking about raising production — the only question is by how much,” said Bob Yawger, director, energy at Mizuho. On Thursday, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after talks with Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih in Moscow that both nations “in principle” supported a gradual increase in production after restricting output for 18 months.
 Mr. Novak said one option would involve gradually raising output by 1.5 million bpd, possibly starting July 1. Mr. Falih said “I think we’ll come to an agreement that satisfies, most importantly, the market.”
Greg McKenna, chief market strategist at futures brokerage AxiTrader, said Russia seemed to want a bigger rise in production than some other producers.
“My guess is the increase will be something less than the 1 million bpd that the U.S. is supposed to have asked the Saudis for,” Mr. McKenna said.

Argentina’s road to economic normality hits more zigzags ","Sigmund Freud wrote of transforming pathology into common unhappiness. Since 2015 President Mauricio Macri has been trying something similar with the Argentine economy. It’s an uncomfortable zigzag ride.
The country’s peso currency fell more than 6% against the dollar on Thursday, leading to the departure of the central bank chief. Federico Sturzenegger will be replaced by Luis Caputo, previously finance minister and an ex-JPMorgan banker. 
The shake-up, together with a larger-than-expected $50 billion assistance package from the International Monetary Fund announced last week, should help stabilize the roughly $500 billion economy, though the peso sold off further after an initial rebound on Friday.
Mr. Macri cant hark back forever to the mess he inherited from his predecessor Cristina Fernandez, a spendthrift populist enamoured of statist policies, and her late husband Nestor Kirchner. But it was a big one, all the same. The Peronist pair left Argentina a pariah in international credit markets and freighted public finances with subsidies and social spending that were unsustainable, however desirable.
Mr. Macri has ground through two-and-a-half years of gradual adjustment, trying to balance the pain of cuts against the prospects of renewed growth. Still-fragile results were appearing until Argentina was sideswiped in recent weeks by a downturn in investor sentiment toward emerging markets.
It’s worth keeping faith. The first tranche of the IMF help, called upon by Mr. Macri as prevention for trouble more than treatment, should arrive next week. Argentina may keep part of the rest in reserve as a defensive bulwark. Shrinking the fiscal deficit, as required by the IMF, looks feasible. The terms of the agreement still rightly allow for protecting the most vulnerable in society.
If Mr. Macri and his team can make enough progress to win a second term in 2019 — and he’d be the first non-Peronist since the 1983 restoration of democracy even to finish his first — he’d have a chance of establishing a welcome new normal.

Trump tariffs a rounding error for U.S. economy so far, that may change
","U.S. President Donald Trump’s new trade tariffs will lop at most a couple of tenths of a percentage point off U.S. growth and add a similar amount to inflation, small fry for a $19 trillion economy that is experiencing its second longest economic expansion on record.
On Friday, Mr. Trump imposed tariffs on $50 billion of imports from China, a move that came on top of hefty duties on steel and aluminum imports implemented at the start of June. American consumers and businesses have taken the tariffs in their stride and the growing economy has brought in more workers, pushing unemployment down to levels not seen since the 1960s.
The costs have been manageable so far, with Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross saying the metals tariff, for example, will add a few hundred dollars to the cost of a car.
Trade retaliation from China has so far been mainly confined to the farm sector, a small part of the U.S. economy. That could change if Mr. Trump pushes ahead with more protectionist measures, possibly triggering a stock market sell-off that would damage business and consumer confidence, argues Michael Gapen, Barclays chief U.S. economist. The Dow industrials fell almost 1% on Friday.
The risks come at a time when the Federal Reserve has pushed interest rates into positive territory adjusted for inflation for the first time in over a decade, a move that will raise borrowing costs for consumers.
The President has already threatened to annul the North American Free Trade Agreement after a year of inconclusive talks with Canada and Mexico, and ordered an investigation into whether the U.S. should impose tariffs on auto imports because he says they threaten American economic security.
“Anti-trade policies, particularly tariffs, act like a tax on consumers and businesses by raising the cost of trade. By creating uncertainty, they also weigh on asset valuations, which could weaken households’ ability to sustain spending and reduce the incentive for businesses to invest,” said Mr. Gapen. 
Mr. Trump’s expansion of unilateral trade action goes well beyond recent actions from the U.S. Before Mr. Trump acted, the biggest measure was imposed in the 1980s when Washington forced Japan to limit exports of cars. Mr. Trump’s top trade negotiator, Robert Lighthizer, was instrumental in that deal, which helped shield Detroit automakers from Japanese competition, but at a cost.
‘A war of each against all’
According to an estimate from economic think tank PERC, the additional sticker price cost to U.S. consumers from those measures was $1,200 per car. Overall consumer losses from the restrictions amounted to $13 billion, PERC said in 1999.
China, Europe, Canada and Mexico have not folded in the same way that Japan did in the 1980s, and have set their own tariffs in response to Mr. Trump’s moves.
U.S. allies have been exasperated by Washington’s refusal to negotiate exemptions for steel and aluminum tariffs and the issue boiled over at a G7 meeting where Mr. Trump was left isolated.
“With regards to our allies in Europe, Japan, Canada, and elsewhere, there are real dangers in engaging in a ‘war of each against all,’ which could reduce the welfare of the entire world, including the U.S.,” Jeffry Frieden and Joel Trachtman of Harvard University and the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University wrote in a report.

India to defend GSP benefits at USTR
","India is expected to challenge charges levelled against it by the U.S dairy and medical devices industries at a hearing before the United States Trade Representative (USTR) office scheduled for Tuesday and defend its eligibility for benefits under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) programme.
The GSP programme provides for the duty-free treatment of designated articles when imported from beneficiary developing countries to America. What is at stake is exports worth about $5 billion annually, of 1,937 products from India. The USTR is reviewing India’s eligibility under the programme, after complaints from bodies representing the dairy and medical devices industry. The USTR had accused India of implementing “a wide array of trade barriers that create serious negative effects on U.S. commerce,” in April, announcing the review. The petitions calling for a review of India’s GSP benefits, “based on concerns that India has allegedly created trade barriers for these industries,” are “without substantive merits,” Indian embassy official Puneet Roy Kundal said in a written submission to the USTR. Mr. Kundal was also scheduled to participate in the hearing.
“India requires that dairy products [be] derived from animals which have never consumed any feeds containing internal organs, blood meal, or tissues of ruminant origin.
“In this regard, India has explained to the U.S that India’s position is based on religious, cultural and moral grounds. India is committed to respect the religious and cultural beliefs of its people and it will be inappropriate to impute any other considerations to this decision,” India told the USTR, pointing out that several countries export dairy products to India, meeting these requirements.
India imports dairy products from countries such as Australia and Switzerland. India will tell the USTR that this is not a question of market access but of certifications. “If several countries can meet this certification requirement, how can’t the U.S?” wondered an Indian official.
Defends price control
Defending India’s measures to control prices of the medical devices, the submission said, the country was committed to providing its citizens with equitable and affordable access to essential medicines and medical devices. But this is a huge business opportunity for American companies, the submission argues. “The large size of the Indian population…is likely to benefit U.S and other multinational companies involved in manufacturing of such devices,” it said.
Indian submission also seeks to address the Donald Trump administration’s protectionist political platform. “..An examination of the top GSP benefiting imports into the U.S shows that Indian products receiving GSP benefits are intermediary goods which are not bound to cause any injury to domestically manufactured goods in the U.S.,” it said. Of the total value of merchandise imports of the U.S. approximately $2.36 trillion only $5.6 billion, it pointed out. A USTR delegation will be travelling to India next week for further negotiations on a host of trade issues between the countries, which remained inconclusive after Commerce Minister Suresh Prabhu’s visit to the U.S. last week.

Centre shelves Air India privatisation plan
","After it failed to get any buyers for the debt-ridden national carrier, the government has shelved its plan to privatise Air India exactly a year after the Union Cabinet gave its nod for the disinvestment process.
“Now is not the right time to privatise Air India. We received no bids. We will look at improving efficiencies by bringing private people to work with the airline’s top brass,” the source told The Hindu.
He added that measures such as cutting down costs as well as monetisation of Air India’s assets will be adopted in order to run the airline.
The source attributed the lack of interest in the disinvestment process to rising fuel prices and hinted that the government could revisit the plan to offload its stake in Air India at a later stage.
The decision was taken at a meeting convened by senior BJP leader and Union Minister Arun Jaitley on Monday.
The broad contours of Air India’s privatisation were made public in March-end and interested players were invited to place initial bids.
However, when the deadline to submit the bids ended on May 31, no player came forward to express its interest in buying the airline.
The government had offered to sell 76% of its stake in Air India, along with low-cost subsidiary Air India Express and its 50% share in ground handling arm AISATS as a single entity. The buyer would have to take on the debt and current liabilities of ₹33,392 crore.
Many players had raised questions about the huge size of the debt, the government’s refusal to exit completely from the airline as well as sought clarity on the benefits and obligations towards more than 15,000 permanent and contractual employees.
However, the government had said that continuing to hold some stake in Air India would help it to service the share of the debt of approximately ₹25,000 crore it was not passing on to the new buyer.
Aviation think-tank CAPA says the government’s decision does not bode well for the beleaguered airline.
“We are disappointed with the government’s decision not to go ahead with AI’s divestment. Continuing government ownership and the lack of a clear road map will lead AI to extreme insignificance and possibly closure. There will never be a perfect timing for AI divestment as conditions for divestment have to be structured by some bold decisions,” said Kapil Kaul, CEO & Director, CAPA South Asia.
He said the government will have to focus on comprehensive restructuring of the airline under a special administration to scale down losses significantly.
The airline has already sought short-term loans of ₹1,000 crore after it was unable to pay the salaries of its employees earlier this month.
A turnaround plan approved by the UPA-2 government in 2012 provided for financial assistance to the tune of ₹30,000 crore over a 10-year period for the carrier. Of this, the airline has received more than ₹26,000 crore. It was also required for the airline to monetise its land assets and generate ₹5,000 crore over a 10-year period until 2021 but the airline has only been able to garner a mere ₹445 crore, as per the government in Parliament in February.

On Wednesday, six officials of the bank were arrested on allegations of misuse of powers in extending loan to real estate developer — D.S. Kulkarni Developers. 
“What is surprising is that these executives, who as per information, are not connected with the cheating by DSK, and hence arresting them at this stage is unwarranted,” the general secretary of the All India Bank Employees’ Association (AIBEA) wrote in a letter to Financial Services Secretary Rajiv Kumar.

“If, according to government, Bank of Maharashtra executives are involved in the scam and are part of any fraudulent activity, their arrest is justifiable. Otherwise, the government should step in and take up the matter with Govt. of Maharashtra and Pune Police for necessary correction and remedy,” AIBEA wrote.

“We serve our internal stakeholders and work on finance, information technology, human resources, transportation and logistics and source to pay functions,” Lalitha Indrakanti, managing director of the centre, said in an interview. “Bengaluru is a global center for Cargill.”
Cargill, headquartered in Wayzata, Minnesota, is a provider of food, agriculture and industrial products and services. Cargill started Indian operations in 1987 and the Bengaluru facility, its biggest business service centre globally, was opened 2015.
India’s outsourcing industry helped Indians prepare for dealing with global stakeholders and markets, she said. 
“If you are trying to cater to an Australian farmer or a trucker in U.S….the interaction depends on the kind of work they do. If at all anyone is equipped to do that it is India. Historically, the outsourcing industry has prepared us so much that we found change management tougher at the other end,” Ms. Indrakanti said. 
“If you pick up anyone here [Cargill Business Services], especially the lateral hires, they have worked with global stakeholders. So our experience of working with global stakeholders is far more than others. That talent exists in India,” she added.
Cargill Business Services, after four years of its operations in Bengaluru, is looking for new sectors to ramp up growth.
“Now, we are looking at the next strategy to grow. What are the new things we should be doing... As part of this, we have been doing a strategy project for the last five to six months to identify areas of growth for the next two years. What we are trying to look at is what has been the industry historically doing….whether we have a similar organisation like us….and what are the functions they are supporting, what are we doing and where are the gaps,” she said.
“We believe that as a result of this, new functions will emerge like environment, health and safety, corporate ethics and compliance. There are various other core corporate functions that exist today that could be probably done from here.“

Atul Gawande to lead health firm jointly formed by Amazon, Buffett, JPMorgan
"," Three corporate giants seeking to attack rising health care costs have turned to a Harvard professor who has written books about the system’s many flaws. 
Amazon, JPMorgan Chase and Berkshire Hathaway have named Dr. Atul Gawande CEO of a venture the companies announced earlier this year- an independent company focused on improving the care delivered to their employees while doing a better job of managing the expense. 
Berkshire Chairman and CEO Warren Buffett has described health costs as a “hungry tapeworm on the American economy.” And the leaders of the three companies see a lot they want to fix, even though they have said little yet about how that will be done. 
“We said at the outset that the degree of difficulty is high and success is going to require an expert’s knowledge, a beginner’s mind, and a long-term orientation,” Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos said in a statement Wednesday. “(Gawande) embodies all three, and we’re starting strong as we move forward in this challenging and worthwhile endeavor.” 
JPMorgan Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon outlined several priorities for the new venture in an April letter to shareholders. He said it will look for ways to help employees make better choices for their care and give them the best options available. It will develop better wellness programs, particularly focused on obesity and smoking, which account for chronic diseases like cancer, heart disease and depression. 
Mr. Dimon said the new company also will study why some costly and specialized medicines are often over- or under-utilized and the “extraordinary” amount of money spent on often unwanted care at the end of a patient’s life.
Mr. Gawande wrote a 2014 book, “Being Mortal,” that focused on aging and death. In it, he noted that people “live longer and better than at any time in history.” 
“But scientific advances have turned the process of aging and dying into medical experiences, matters to be managed by health care professionals,” he wrote. “And we in the medical world have proved alarmingly unprepared for it.”
Mr. Gawande is surgeon at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and a professor at both Harvard’s medical school and its school of public health. He said in a statement Wednesday that he has devoted his career in public health to building solutions for better care delivery, and that while the current system is broken, “better is possible.” 
Employer-sponsored insurance covers about 157 million people, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. That’s nearly half the total U.S. population and the biggest slice of the country’s patchwork health insurance market. 
Neither the companies that offer health coverage nor many of the employees that use it are happy with how the system currently works. Rising costs have pushed employers to hike deductibles and other costs for their workers. Companies are asking them to pay more of their care bills and to shop around for better deals. Many patients, especially the sickest, struggle with that. 
Amazon, JPMorgan and Berkshire said in late January that the initial focus of their new company will be on technology that provides simplified, high-quality and transparent care “at a reasonable cost.” 
Amazon’s participation and customer-first focus will be crucial, according to Brian Marcotte, CEO of the National Business Group on Health, a nonprofit that represents large employers. 
That could change if they go through a well-known platform like Amazon, which could then reach into its vast trove of customer data to personalize the shopping, Marcotte said. If, for instance, you are a runner considering knee surgery, Amazon could lay out the best or common practices for your condition and maybe show that surgery isn’t your only option. 
“It’s not only reaching people in the moment, it’s the possibility to reach people with relevant personalized messaging that will engage them,” Marcotte said. 
Mr. Gawande starts his new role July 9. His company will be based in Boston.

WhatsApp updates privacy policy, terms of use ahead of payments service launch "," WhatsApp, which is testing its payments services in India, on Saturday said it is updating its terms of service and privacy policy to “reflect the addition of payment interoperability features” ahead of the full-fledged launch of the service.
 Almost one million people are “testing” WhatsApp’s payments service in India, which is the largest base for the Facebook-owned company that has over 1.5 billion users globally. WhatsApp has over 200 million users in India.
“We’ll be updating our WhatsApp payments Terms of Service and Privacy Policy to provide simpler language on how the payments feature operates. It also reflects the addition of payment interoperability features we’ve added since the beta started,” a WhatsApp spokesperson told PTI.
 The spokesperson added that the company has worked closely with National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), bank partners, and the Indian government on these details of how its service works.
 WhatsApp had received permission from NPCI to tie up with banks to facilitate financial transactions via Unified Payments Interface (UPI).
“We still do not have a launch date but this terms and policy update bring us one step closer to full launch,” the spokesperson said but declined to comment on the launch date of the service.
 WhatsApp payment service, which rivals the likes of Paytm, has been in beta testing over the last few months. Industry watchers expect the full-fledged launch in the next few weeks.
 As part of the updated terms, WhatsApp said it may collect additional information when payments service is used.
“We’ve added new features like interoperability that request additional information (related to) WhatsApp payments user and user of any BHIM UPI-enabled app,” the spokesperson said.
 The terms state that WhatsApp collects information “when you send, receive, or request a payment, including the date and time and reference transaction number”. Also, when someone makes a payment to a WhatsApp contact, the company collects the sender and receiver’s names and BHIM UPI IDs.
 The company added that it uses “all the information we have to operate, provide, improve, understand, customise, support, and market our services.”
“This includes using the information to provide payments and customer support, to protect you and others using our services from fraud, abuse, or other misconduct, and to review your account activity to determine whether you continue to meet our Terms and Payments Terms,” it added.
 It also outlined that the company works with “the other Facebook companies to provide payments, including to send payment instructions to PSPs (payment service providers)“.
Paytm founder Vijay Shekhar Sharma had earlier this year alleged that WhatsApp’s UPI payment platform has security risks for consumers and is not in compliance with the guidelines.
 The Reserve Bank of India has mandated all payment system operators to ensure that data related to payments is stored only in India giving firms six months to comply with it.
 According to sources, the ministry of electronics and IT has asked NPCI to check if WhatsApp’s payments service conforms with the RBI rules and data security of customers.
 They added that NPCI has been asked to check that all compliances are in place before the US-based messaging app is allowed to scale up its services.
 WhatsApp had stated that sensitive user data such as the last 6 digits of a debit card and UPI PIN are not stored at all.
 While it admitted to using the infrastructure of Facebook for the service, it asserted that the parent firm does not use payment information for commercial purpose.
“Facebook processes UPI transaction data as a service provider for WhatsApp, and does not use WhatsApp payments transaction data for commercial purposes,” the spokesperson had clarified.
 Concerns have been growing around security of consumer data on various online social media platforms, especially after the data breach incident at Facebook where data of about 87 million users globally (rpt) globally were harvested illegally by data analytics and political consultancy firm Cambridge Analytica.

As trade war looms, China cuts some banks’ reserve requirements ","China’s central bank said on Sunday it would cut the amount of cash that some banks must hold as reserves by 50 basis points (bps), releasing $108 billion in liquidity, to accelerate the pace of debt-for-equity swaps and spur lending to smaller firms.
The reserve reduction, the third by the central bank this year, had been widely anticipated by investors amid concerns over market liquidity and a potential economic drag from a trade dispute with the U.S.
Bigger than expected
But the 700 billion yuan ($107.65 billion) in liquidity that the central bank said will result from the reduction in reserves was bigger than expected.
Expectations of a cut had risen after the State Council, or cabinet, said on Wednesday monetary policy tools including targeted cuts in banks’ reserve requirement ratios will be deployed to strengthen credit flows to small firms and keep economic growth in a reasonable range.
Economists are not ruling out further reserve requirement reductions for the rest of the year as borrowing costs rise due to Beijing’s clamp-down on leverage in the financial system, a campaign now in its third year, while uncertainty over Sino-U.S. trade ties persists.
The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) said that the latest targeted cut in some banks’ reserve requirement ratios (RRRs) - currently 16% for large banks and 14% for smaller banks - will take effect on July 5.
The PBOC said the cut will release about 500 billion yuan ($77 billion) for the country’s five large state banks and 12 national joint-stock commercial banks. Lenders are encouraged to use the money to conduct debt-for-equity swaps.

Of banks and ebbing deposit flows
","Of late, Indian banks have come up against a problem that they’ve seldom had to face over the last two decades — having too few takers for their fixed deposits. 
RBI data showed that in the financial year ended March 2018, aggregate deposits of scheduled commercial banks expanded by 6.7%. That’s the lowest annual growth rate recorded in over five decades. Over the last two decades, banks have been able to expand their deposit base at an average rate of 16% a year. 
It would be tempting to attribute the ultra-low growth in FY18 to the high base effect caused by demonetisation. After all, the second half of FY17 saw an unusual deluge of deposits into banks triggered by the ban on high-value currency notes. This propped up bank deposit growth to 15.3% in FY17. But if you exclude this as an aberration, new deposits flowing into banks have been on a decline since FY15. 
RBI data showed that in the nine years from FY05 to FY14, bank deposits saw a massive surge in their popularity. Net inflows into banks grew more than four-fold during this period, from ₹1.95 lakh crore in FY05 to ₹9.55 lakh crore in FY14. But the juggernaut was halted in FY14. New deposit mop-ups dipped to ₹8.27 lakh crore in FY15 and further to ₹7.94 lakh crore in FY16. The note ban offered a temporary breather by drawing back ₹14.3 lakh crore into banks in FY17. But the flows have ebbed quickly thereafter, to just ₹7.17 lakh crore in FY18. 
Why the decline 
What has caused Indian savers to lose their long-held affinity for bank deposits? Well, one obvious reason is diminishing returns. Historical trends suggest that inflows into bank deposits carry a high correlation with interest rates. FY05 marked a low point in interest rates in the economy, with 1 to 3-year bank deposits offering 5.25%-5.75%. Rates climbed steadily to 9.25% by FY12 and stayed put until FY14. Thereafter, as a slowing economy forced RBI to prune policy rates, deposit rates slumped to 6.75% in FY18. Deposit mop-ups by banks have followed a similar trajectory. 
The hunt for better returns has prompted savers to actively seek out market-linked alternatives to bank deposits. Savers have upped their allocations to NBFC deposits, which have seen a fourfold rise in their deposit base in the last four years. More significantly, with the stock markets taking wing from FY14, retail savers have been making a beeline for equity mutual funds which delivered a 15-20% return between FY13 and FY18. 
From pull-outs of ₹11,000 crore in FY14, equity funds attracted more than ₹80,000 crore in net inflows in FY15 and went on to amass ₹2.6 lakh crore in new flows in FY18. A rising number of those investors are also signing up for monthly investments with systematic investment plans (SIPs) now funnelling over ₹7,000 crore a month into mutual funds. Debt funds have emerged as more tax-efficient alternatives to bank deposits too. 
PSBs hit most
But a third and far more disturbing reason for savers shying away could be the relentless adverse news flow about bad loans, capital adequacy woes and multi-billion rupee frauds, that have kept bank depositors on the tenterhooks in the last three years. 
It is public sector banks (PSBs) — the most hit by these problems — that have seen their deposits dry up the most. In FY18, PSBs managed a minuscule 3.1% growth in their aggregate deposit base. But private banks saw a brisk 17.4% growth in deposits while regional rural banks managed a 7.2% increase. Newbie small finance banks, which offered high rates, managed a fourfold jump in deposit base in one year. With consistently better deposit growth, private banks have seen their share in aggregate deposits shoot up from 21 to 27% in the last four years while PSBs have seen their share plummet from 73 to 67%. 
Dwindling deposit flows into banks have significant repercussions for the economy and banks themselves. 
One, it is credit that oils the wheels of the economy and as the economy revives from its slumber of the last three years, banks may find it difficult to bankroll the credit needs of industry. This may impede industrial revival. In the ten years to FY17, the annual increase in deposits for banks easily outpaced additional demand for credit each year. In FY17, thanks to the riches from demonetisation, new deposit flows exceeded the incremental loan offtake by a massive ₹8.4 lakh crore. But in FY18, the tables turned drastically, with deposit flows falling short of incremental credit demand by about ₹91,000 crore. While deposit growth has slumped lately, credit growth has accelerated from the single to double digits. Yes, as banks have scrounged for funds to lend, bond markets have stepped in to bankroll industry. But given the lack of breadth in the Indian bond market, the market route is open only to large corporates with high credit ratings. For lower-rated companies, MSMEs and sundry small borrowers, a cutback in bank lending usually means a squeeze on credit availability.
Two, the funds crunch has forced banks to step back from lending to the government too. Domestic banks, to fulfil their statutory liquidity ratio (SLR) requirement, are required to compulsorily park 19.5% of their deposits in government securities. This requirement allows the Central and State governments, which survive on deficit financing, to periodically dump gilts on banks to raise money. But after indulging in a gilt buying binge in FY17 and overshooting their SLR requirements, banks have found no reason to buy more gilts in recent months. This has this sent borrowing costs for the Centre shooting up (it topped 8% recently), and raised concerns about how the Centre or the States will successfully complete their borrowing programmes this year. 
Three, banks have also been constrained by their rising stockpile of non-performing loans. With ₹10 lakh crore of bank funds locked up in NPLs and sluggish recoveries, banks’ hands have been further tied in expanding their loan book. 
This poses a Chakravyuha-like problem for banks. Expanding their loan book of healthy borrowers is the fastest way for beleaguered banks to ‘grow’ out of the NPL mess. And, it is by lending to non-government entities, that they can earn the high yields that cushion their profits from the rising bad loan write-offs. But both of these require healthy deposit flows, which are eluding the needy banks the most. 
The way out
So, can banks now woo back savers with higher deposit rates? They have certainly been trying in the last six months, by pegging up their deposit rates far more rapidly than RBI’s policy rates. Conveniently for them, the stock markets have also lost some steam, sharply pruning equity fund returns. But RBI data for the first two months of FY19 doesn’t indicate a material turnaround in deposit flows. 
It is too early to conclude that domestic savers, vexed with the adverse news flow from PSBs, have shifted their loyalties for good. But given that market conditions are now favouring banks over equity avenues, this is the time for both banks and the government to try their level best to woo back skittish depositors and rebuild the domestic savers’ confidence in the banking system. Else, PSBs may permanently lose out on the precious deposit base that is the bread and butter of their existence.

The two facets of NPA management
"," The phenomenal increase in non-performing assets (NPAs) and wilful defaults over the last three years raises serious concerns about the effectiveness of NPA management and its mechanisms. Given the potential adverse impact that the increasing incidence of NPAs might cause, it is critical that NPA resolution takes place in a timely manner. Policies concerning NPA resolution must address two critical aspects: first, how to prevent it occurring at this scale in the future? and second, how to manage the existing accumulated NPAs?
Till recently, most of the initiatives by the government and the RBI (Reserve Bank of India) had centred on the latter — how to manage the existing NPAs. The emphasis was on finding ways to reduce the magnitude of NPAs. This was driven by the idea that bank balance sheets must be cleaned up and restored. While it is important to clean up the balance sheet of banks by reducing or eliminating bad loans, it is equally important to think about preventive measures. Typically, preventive measures are structural in nature. Both elements are quite important to a robust NPA management mechanism.
Regulator’s role
 The government and the regulator have to play a greater role in the process of NPA management. The role of the government has historically been crucial when there is a banking failure or crisis. It is the government which comes to the rescue, either through direct intervention or through the regulator. The role of government becomes even more important as it happens to be the principal owner of the majority of the affected banks in India.
On preventive measures, there is a need for evolving a framework in order to bring transparency into the operation and management of SCBs (scheduled commercial banks), particularly the PSBs (public sector banks), on four major parameters — project appraisal, monitoring, accounting, and auditing. As large loans constitute a substantial portion of the total NPAs, a robust credit appraisal mechanism is very much required. As large loans tend to be relatively technically complex, the banks must enhance their technical capabilities to undertake project monitoring effectively. Greater emphasis must be placed on bringing efficiency and transparency into the accounting system. Emphasis should be given on strengthening the audit system in banks. 
The above measures can potentially reduce the possibilities of collusion among the officials of the funding institutions and the borrowers.
‘Bad bank’
On NPA resolution, to deal with the existing accumulated NPAs, there is a need for creating a publicly funded ‘bad bank’ or an asset management company which will deal with the stressed assets of PSBs. The approach should be to formulate a resolution mechanism which will maximise recovery, and thereby, reduce the burden on the banks or the government. It can be very similar to the Swedish model where the bad bank bought the stressed assets from the affected banks and sold it at a higher price at the time of economic expansion, when asset prices picked up. This way, recovery on the bad loans can be maximised. The life span of the Swedish bad bank ‘Securum’ was 15 years, and it was fully owned by the government. 
On a similar line, the Government of India, too, can create a bad bank, with full government ownership. The proposed institution can continue to exist without an expiry date as the NPA problem is perennial.
The managerial staff of the ‘bad bank’ may, however, be outsourced to boost operational and managerial efficiency. 
The proposed bank should function independently with greater professionalism and should be accountable to the government. 
Given the fiscal constraints, it may not be viable for the government to finance the proposed bad bank through budgetary support fully. The government can, however, partly finance the proposed ‘bad bank’ by issuing equity shares with the government holding the majority share.

Key monetary tools at the RBI’s disposal
","The Reserve Bank of India (RBI), earlier this month, raised its policy repo rate by 25 basis points to 6.25%, the central bank’s first interest rate increase in four-and-a-half years.
Banks need to hold some portion of their deposits in cash with the RBI. This ratio is called CRR. If the RBI cuts CRR, banks will be left with more money to lend or invest. On the other hand, if the CRR is raised, banks will have lesser money to lend.
RBI uses CRR to absorb excess liquidity or to release funds needed for economic growth. The present CRR is 4%.
When a bank’s deposits increase by ₹100, and if the CRR is 4%, the banks will have to park ₹4 with the RBI. The bank can use only ₹96 for investments and lending purposes.
Banks also have to invest a certain portion of their deposits in government securities with the RBI. This percentage is known as SLR. Banks can earn return on these investments. The current SLR is 19.5%. If a deposit of ₹100 is made in a bank, then the bank will have to invest ₹19.5 in government securities. So, to meet CRR and SLR requirements, a bank has to earmark ₹23.5 (4+19.5).
When banks need money they can borrow from the RBI against their surplus government securities at a fixed interest rate. This rate is known as the repo rate. The higher the repo rate, the higher the cost of short-term money to the banks and vice versa. Generally, whenever the repo rate is raised, banks pass the burden on to customers.
If the repo rate is lowered, then banks can potentially charge lower interest rates on the loans taken by borrowers.
What is the reverse repo rate?
The reverse repo rate is the rate of interest offered by RBI, when banks deposit their surplus funds with the RBI for short periods. The reverse repo rate at present is 6%.

‘Anchor bank for PSB consolidation put on hold’
"," The concept of having 5-6 anchor banks and merging weaker banks with them to drive consolidation among public sector banks (PSBs) has been put on the back-burner. Instead, an alternative proposal is before the Finance Ministry, according to T.N. Manoharan, chairman, Canara Bank.
“The major hurdle comes in the form of culture when it comes to integration. Instead, one of the suggestions made to the Finance Ministry is classifying banks into three categories,” he said.
One is a universal bank which does all kinds of banking, including corporate lending. The second type includes national retail banks that would focus only on retail lending. Regional retail banks constitute the third type. Mr. Manoharan and Shyam Srinivasan, MD and CEO of Federal Bank, were speaking on the topic ‘Banks-from the brink.’ The Canara Bank Chairman also said Finance Minister Piyush Goyal was keen on the concept of a ‘bad’ bank and if it went through, it would help public sector banks to start afresh. 
 Infra projects
 “Contrary to public perception that bad loans are due to wilful defaulters and indiscriminate lending, it is only a small segment,” said Mr. Manoharan. “The real issue is commercial banks lending to big infrastructure projects, which got into problems,” he said. 
Mr. Srinivasan said that the phase of recognition of bad loans was over and now, the focus was on recovery.

Today, most sectors are on automatic approval route.” He said the size and growth of the Indian market holds much potential and that the country’s per capita income had doubled in the last decade.
‘Economies of scale’
“The size and scale of requirement in India gives the added advantage of economies of scale for investors,” Mr. Modi said.
The AIIB started operations in January 2016 and has so far approved 25 projects in a dozen countries with a total financing of more than $4 billion, which Mr. Modi described as a ‘good beginning.’

‘Reserves firepower to help stem rupee’s losses’
","India believes the current slide in the rupee will not be prolonged as it has adequate “firepower” of foreign exchange reserves to deal with the current volatility, a senior finance ministry official said.
The volatility is being driven by global factors, including proposed U.S. sanctions on Iran and the mismatch in demand and supply of oil, said Subhash Chandra Garg, the economic affairs secretary in the finance ministry.
Policy makers are also worried that the ongoing trade war between the U.S. and China could adversely impact exports from emerging markets, including India, while discouraging capital inflows — putting pressure on the rupee.
The rupee is down about 7% so far this year, making it the worst performing currency in Asia.
Besides using reserves, economists said the Reserve Bank of India, which raised rates in May by 25 basis points to mark the first tightening in more than four years, could raise rates again.
“We could see a couple of rate hikes in the current monetary cycle,” said N. R. Bhanumurthy, an economist at the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy.
However, he added a further increase in the key repo rate could squeeze credit for companies as well as lead to some cuts in capital spending by the government — dragging down economic growth. “We may not be able to achieve even 7% growth this fiscal,” he said. The rupee, which fell to a record low of 69.095 per dollar before recovering to end at 68.79 on Thursday, rebounded on Friday to close at 68.46.
Adequate firepower?
New Delhi feels that with forex reserves amounting to $410 billion as of June 15, it could deal with the current storm. “We have adequate reserves, there is adequate firepower,” Mr. Garg said.
But reserves are already down from their record high of $426.08 billion as of April 13, prompting traders to believe a large part of this decline has been due to dollar sales by the central bank to prop up the currency.
“The RBI seems to be instrumental in rescuing [the] rupee from its low of 69.10 to current prices,” said Pritam Kumar Patnaik, Business Head at Reliance Commodities. “We expect them to keep participating as and when the rupee falls below the 69 to a dollar level.”
But he added: “While they can exercise control on the domestic markets, they will have little or no control on the NDF (non-deliverable forward) markets, which has been setting the trend post our market close.”
Three-month dollar/rupee contracts were changing hands at 69.35/47 levels in the offshore NDF market.
Mr. Garg said other tools were also available to stem the rupee’s decline. If needed, the government could raise funds through foreign currency non-repatriable (FCNR) deposits, sovereign bonds or other routes to increase reserves, he said.
“If we assess at any stage that we need to buttress or refurbish our reserves, the options are open,” Mr. Garg said, adding “that situation has not arisen.” Compared to a crisis in 2013, the current situation was much better, mainly due to higher forex reserves, services exports and inflow of remittances by non-resident Indians, the secretary said.
Mr. Garg, who coordinates government policy with the RBI, said the trade deficit was expected to widen in the current year, mainly due to rising crude oil prices. He said any further rise in oil prices could further widen the trade deficit and put pressure on the rupee, but the situation was not clear at this stage.
‘A storm’
“We are not even certain what kind of a storm it is or even if it is a storm or whether it will turn out to be a storm.” 
Mr. Garg also said it was too early to say what impact the fall in the rupee would have on inflation. “Inflation situation is not worrisome at the moment. You have the facility of adjustment [of interest rates] every two months, and the Monetary Policy Committee will take an appropriate view.” 
The Centre, however, believes the economic situation will not worsen, he said, adding “I do not see any need to increase rates.”

Not all Swiss bank money illegal: Piyush Goyal
","Finance Minister Piyush Goyal said on Friday the reported 50% rise in deposits by Indians in Swiss banks could not be presumed to be a case of black money parked abroad. He added that the government would start getting details on bank accounts of Indians in Switzerland from next year under a bilateral tax treaty and strong action would be instituted against anyone found guilty.
The Minister was responding to news reports that money parked by Indians in Swiss banks rose to CHF (Swiss Franc)1.01 billion (₹7,000 crore) in 2017, reversing a declining trend over three years amid a “clampdown” on suspected black money stashed there.
In comparison, the total funds held by all foreign clients of Swiss banks rose only about 3%, to CHF 1.46 trillion or about ₹100 lakh crore in same period, according to data released by the Swiss National Bank (SNB).
Citing news reports, Mr. Goyal said 40% of the deposits was the result of the liberalised remittance scheme introduced by former Finance Minister P. Chidambaram. As per the scheme, an individual could remit up to $2,50,000 per year, he said.
Replying to reporters’ queries, Mr. Goyal said, “The data that you alluded to will come to us; so how are you assuming that this is black money or this is illegal transaction?”
“We will have all information if someone is found guilty, (and) the government will take strong action against them,” he said.




Reacting to the reports, the Congress and other Opposition parties targeted Prime Minister Narendra Modi over his claims of retrieving black money stashed abroad. The JD(U), a BJP ally, also expressed “grave concern” over the surge in Indian deposits in Swiss banks.
Attacking Mr. Modi, Congress president Rahul Gandhi tweeted: “2014, HE said: I will bring back all the “BLACK” money in Swiss Banks & put 15 Lakhs in each Indian bank A/C. 2016, HE said: Demonetisation will cure India of “BLACK” money. 2018, HE says: 50% jump in Swiss Bank deposits by Indians, is “WHITE” money. No “BLACK” in Swiss Banks!”
The Congress said Swiss bank deposits had fallen during the UPA regime.
“Swiss Bank deposits fell during Dr. Manmohan Singh’s time, only to rise to record levels under PM Modi. The current increase of 50.2% post demonetisation is the maximum since 2004,” the party said on Twitter.
“What happened to Prime Minister Modi’s promise of eradicating corruption and bringing back black money?” asked Congress spokesperson R.P.N. Singh.
CPI(M) leader Sitaram Yechury said while the money of Indians in Swiss banks rose, the Centre wrote off the corporate world’s loans worth lakhs of crores and allowed some businessmen to flee after looting public money.
West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee questioned how deposits in Swiss banks had surged while public sector banks in India were reporting massive losses.
“Bravo! #DeMonetisation? Swiss Bank money flying. India losing,” Ms Banerjee tweeted.
Almost exactly a year ago, in an address on the foundation day of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) on July 1, Mr. Modi had highlighted a record 45% drop in deposits by Indians in Swiss banks.
Backing Mr. Goyal, Union Minister Arun Jaitley posted on Facebook: “Indian' money outside the country is of various categories. Past investigation by CBDT has shown that this includes money held by persons of Indian origin who now hold foreign passport, monies belonging to Non-Resident Indians, as also monies belonging to resident Indians who have made legitimate investments abroad, including transfer of money under the liberalised remittance schemes. It is only monies kept by resident Indians outside these categories which become actionable.”

IMF suggests India three steps to sustain high growth rate ","To sustain the high growth rate India has achieved, the country should carry out banking sector reforms; continue with fiscal consolidation, simplify and streamline GST; and renew impetus on reforms, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said on Friday.
India’s growth accelerated to 7.7 per cent in the fourth quarter of Financial Year (FY) 2017-18. That was up from 7 per cent in the previous quarter.
“We expect the recovery to continue in FY 2018-19. Growth is projected at 7.4 per cent in FY 2018-19 and actually 7.8 percent in FY 19-20, respectively,” IMF Communications Director Gerry Rice told reporters at his fortnightly news conference.
In order to sustain the high growth rate, Mr. Rice suggested three steps for India to follow.
“One, to revive a bank credit and enhance the efficiency of credit provision; by accelerating the cleanup of bank and corporate balance sheets and enhancing the government of public sector banks,” he said.
“Point two, to continue fiscal consolidation and to lower elevated public debt levels supported by simplifying and streamlining the goods and services tax (GST) structure,” he added.
He then suggested India to renew impetus to reforms of key markets over the medium-term.
“And thirdly, over the medium-term, renew impetus to reforms of key markets, for example, labour and land, as well as improving the overall business climate would be crucial to improving competitiveness and again, maintaining that very high level of growth in India,” Mr. Rice said in response to a question.
The IMF Board is tentatively scheduled to meet on July 18 for its annual India meeting.
“We will be releasing the staff report in relation to that Board meeting and it will have detail (about GST),” he said when asked about simplifying and streamlining the goods and services tax structure.
“It (GST) is a complicated tax to administer and to implement, so I think some suggestions that streamlining can be important. There will be more on that in the context of the Article IV,” Rice said.
The IMF is scheduled to release on July 16 the update on World Economic Outlook.

Need ₹10 lakh cr. to raise steel output: Minister
","India would require Rs. 10 lakh crore investment to achieve its target of reaching its target of 300MT steel manufacturing capacity by 2030 and it had saved Rs. 5,000 crore worth of foreign exchange through domestic substitution of high-end steel imports.
“ What we projected or what we want that if we reach the target of 300 million tonne capacity, the creation of 300 million tonnes, we would be requiring 10 lakh crore,” Union Minister of Steel, Choudhary Birender Singh, told The Hindu and Businessline correspondents on Friday.
“And out of that 10 lakh crore, 4 lakh crore, if we don’t have the machinery made in India or ‘Make in India’ then this 4 lakh crore is to go out of the country in the shape of foreign exchange.”
“So we’re organizing a conclave in the near future, in a month or so, where we will be calling all the important machinery suppliers for steel plants. We would like that they should put up their plants so that we can purchase from them and share with us their technology in the shape of JV’s.
“This would be the most important venture as regards transfer of technology. I know that certain companies have shown a lot of interest, wanting to put up plants. This is how the 300 million tonne target is achievable,” he said.
India was the world’s third-largest steel producer in 2017, according to the India Brand Equity Foundation. The growth in the Indian steel sector has been driven by the domestic availability of raw materials such as iron ore and cost-effective labour.
India is expected to become the second largest steel producer in the world by 2018, based on increased capacity addition in anticipation of upcoming demand, and the new steel policy, that has been approved by the Union Cabinet in May 2017, is expected to boost India's steel production.
Mr. Singh said the Rs. 5,000 crore saving had been achieved through an increase in output of high-end steel for infrastructure, automobile, defence and medical equipment sectors. Government’ initiatives have reduced imports by 36% to 7.48 million tonnes, he said.
 “We are on the job of substitution of high-quality steel. By a substantial portion of steel production locally and reduction in imports and our dependence on other countries has to come down.”
He said when the scrapple policy comes into effect the demand for domestic steel would increase.
India’s crude steel output grew 5.87% year-on-year to 101.227 million tonnes (MT) in CY 2017. Crude steel production reached 93.183 MT during April-February 2017-18, according to India Brand Foundation. Total consumption of finished steel stood at 81.943 MT during April-February 2017-18. 
The Union Cabinet, Government of India has approved the National Steel Policy (NSP) 2017, as it seeks to create a globally competitive steel industry in India. NSP 2017 targets 300 million tonnes (MT) steel-making capacity and 160 kgs per capita steel consumption by 2030
The Ministry of Steel is facilitating setting up of an industry driven Steel Research and Technology Mission of India (SRTMI) in association with the public and private sector steel companies to spearhead research and development activities in the iron and steel industry at an initial corpus of Rs. 200 crore.

Private security agencies seek GST on commission, not gross income
"," 
Private security agencies in the country have reiterated their demand for application of 5% GST on their gross income or, alternatively, the applicable 18% GST on their agency commission only.
“Private security agencies are under financial constraints [due to] GST which is collected on gross amount charged to a client [the principal employer] which includes reimbursement of wages and statutory benefits paid to security guards,” Security Association of India (SAI) said in a recent letter to the government.
‘Pleas yield no result’
“From the beginning, we have been representing that wages and benefits paid to security guards should be excluded from the value for calculating the amount for service tax and that the tax should be charged only on the total value of commission/agency charges received by the security agency,” SAI said in a representation to the Union Finance Minister.
The association said all its earlier pleas have yielded no result.
The umbrella organisation for this sector, the Central Association of Private Security Industry (CAPSI) has called for a nation-wide protest to press for its demands.
In a meeting held in Mumbai, the CAPSI and SAI, expressed fears that the 18% GST would force many players to close down their business and tender thousands of guards jobless.
To highlight their cause, President of CAPSI Viswanath Katti said that security agencies will demonstrate at GST offices across the country on July 18, 2018 and a memorandum will be submitted to GST commissioners.
Council urged to mull
SAI president Gurcharan Singh Chauhan said that Maharashtra’s Finance Minister Sudhir Mungantiwar has been approached and urged to discuss the issue in the GST Council meeting.
He said the sector helped employ the poor from rural areas and many of the estimated 70 lakh guards would be rendered unemployed as the cost of wages goes up.
They said GST should be levied on 10% of the agency’s service charge of ₹2,034 which will attract GST of ₹366 per month per security guard.
“The security guard who draws the lowest monthly salary of ₹10,000 is being taxed ₹4,028 per month, which is very high and unfair in comparison to his monthly wages,” the letter said.

‘Third eye’ to monitor traders on GSTN "," India has deployed business intelligence or ‘third eye’ technology in its Goods and Service Tax Network to detect defaulters and will install radio frequency identification tags on trucks transporting goods to check on compliance in the e-way bill process, Sushil Kumar Modi, who heads the GSTN panel, said on Saturday.
“There is minimum manual interference now when there is a requirement to file returns as everything regarding payments is online,” Mr. Modi told correspondents in Bengaluru. “We have business intelligence in our network. You cannot dupe the government department.
‘Discrepancies stand out’
“In the third phase of IT development, we have sent to States the GSTR 3 and GSTR 1 forms. They both have to match. If there is a discrepancy then the third eye will detect. Notices will be served.”
Mr. Modi, who is also the Deputy Chief Minister of Bihar, said the “business intelligence” within the network can generate more than 15 kinds of different registrations. “Business intelligence can give a 360-degree view of the taxpayer.”
“States can take action against the defaulters. The system, through bid data analysis, will send an alert to those who purchase goods from traders who have not paid the tax as ‘non-filer’,” he said. “The government has started serving notices to defaulters since April.”
The government is also planning to install sensors at entry and exit points of each State’s borders and deploy RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) tags on trucks to monitor e-way bills.
“Currently it is implemented in Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh. We will introduce it nationwide,” he said.
The government is also mulling simplification of tax return forms, he said. The GST Council has approved a new procedure to simplify the returns and the law committee will seek the approval of GST Council to implement the changes during the forthcoming meeting on July 21.
Infosys, India’s second-largest software exporter, is developing the information technology infrastructure to implement the new changes.
“In GSTR-3 one needs to file 37 returns in a year,” Mr. Modi said. 
“Now we are practically reducing it to only one page or maybe two pages. For business to consumer companies, it will be a three-line return form. It will be the simplest return form India has ever had.”
‘Raising threshold’
The Law Advisory Committee set up by the Ministry of Finance has suggested increasing the threshold of the composition scheme to ₹1.5 crore from the current ₹1 crore, he said. 
“The GST Council will take a call on when to amend.”
“It has also recommended a special class of dealers for the reverse charge mechanism, For service providers, the norm suggested is between 10% (of turnover) or ₹5 lakh whichever is lower.”
Another suggestion of the committee was that if restaurants, travel firms, healthcare companies and beverage outlets provide transport for women in the night shifts, they can avail of input tax credit, he said.
The funds left in the compensation cess, which is used to compensate the States for revenue shortfall suffered due to the GST roll-out and amounts to ₹22,000 crore as of March, will be distributed among the Centre and State governments, he said.
“Under the IGST there is about ₹22,000 crore in the kitty,” Mr. Modi said. The Integrated Goods and Tax (IGST) is charged on goods that get transported between States.

Fatal flaws in Balanced Scorecard execution
","Twenty-six years after it was conceptualised, the Balanced Scorecard (BSC) continues to be a staple in the manager’s arsenal. Its holistic focus, simple design and widespread acceptance make it a tool for corporates, NGOs and even governments. Most modern organisations implement some form of the BSC for performance management. However, very few of them are realising the true benefits of the tool.
Results are often relegated to Excel sheets in unused folders, and the blame for that lies squarely with poor design.
Fundamentally, the BSC is meant to be a reflection of a firm’s strategy. This implies a top-down approach, starting with a strategy map and cascading across the organisation. The 2018 Global BSC Usage Survey, which includes India, indicates that companies that engage in cascading, tend to be 45% more satisfied with their outcomes. Our practice corroborates this. In the instance of one client, achievement rates on shared metrics exceed that on individual metrics by over 20% — largely due to collaboration between teams. In general, though, many organisations fail to articulate a strategy map and create scorecards as a bottom-up process, completely defeating the purpose of the exercise.
The next fatal error is looking at metrics for metrics’ sake. We’ve all heard ‘what gets measured, gets done.’ This has led to an overdose of metrics. Many organisations use the BSC to capture a laundry list resembling the job description. Can any one person actually focus on dozens of metrics? Our work has reinforced our belief in having not more than 5-10 metrics per individual.
Again, the 2018 survey showed firms with fewer metrics derive greater satisfaction from the tool. It’s critical to ensure these metrics are truly important and measurable. An MXV analysis across thousands of scorecards showed the average rating on quantitative metrics 2.7 (out of 5), while qualitative metrics averaged 4.2, or 56% higher and clearly demonstrating various rating biases. Having fewer metrics ensures alignment and clarity. Making metrics measurable reduces bias and quickens the review cycle.
The third error is to do with inertia. Scorecards need to be dynamic. In some environments, for example start-ups, that may be as frequent as a quarter. Even the most slow-changing environments need an annual revision that ties into the strategy development and business planning process. Again, we find many scorecards are not reviewed for several years, making them as obsolete as the processes they replaced! Automation can help, putting control in the hands of managers and enabling them to use the tool as it was meant to be.
The BSC is an elegant tool suited to the needs of Indian organisations. Thoughtfully designed, it can be a key driver of company performance and growth instead of just another HR initiative that managers pray to avoid.

Upstart: the electric scooter movement is a vision on wheels
"," If you are keeping up with what is happening in the startup capital of the world, San Francisco, and by extension the Bay Area, you know that the place is under the grips of a fad that very few saw coming — electric scooters. What was a toy less than a generation ago, is now the magic bullet that is believed to be capable of solving the tricky problem of last mile connectivity for urban commuters the world over. And of course, in this ‘ride sharing’ economy, you are not expected to buy these electric scooters.
It is the Uber model, just that there is no driver. You locate a scooter closest to you. Your app tells the scooter who you are and where you have picked it up. You use it to get where you wanted to get to. You get off the scooter, end the trip. It knows where you have gotten off. Whatever needs to be charged to you shall be charged. You pay in a manner that is most convenient to you. You do not mind, for you are sure that it is going to be way cheaper than any other way of having travelled that distance without breaking into a sweat. And when millions of commuters the world over adopt this behaviour, the company operating these scooters will make a killing.
At this point, a lot of Silicon Valley investors are completely sold on this utopian vision. It does not, at least not as long as you do not worry about where electricity really comes from, consume fossil fuels that are rightfully going out of fashion. And it seems perfectly suited for millennials and post-millennials, whatever they are called, who consider any energy spent outside of their fancy exercise regimens, completely unnecessary. Two companies that are into electric scooter sharing are already unicorns, Lime and Bird. And sooner than later, I am sure there will be many more.
The thing about Silicon Valley unicorns is that they are often considered bellwethers for what is going to happen elsewhere. By elsewhere, people are almost always looking at China and India, because clearly that is where the scale is, for that is where the weight of the population exerts enough pressure. And for the first time, of an overwhelming Silicon Valley trend, I feel confident enough to laugh it off.
I will start with China. It was not too long ago when Communist China was acknowledged as a place where everyone bicycled everywhere. When China made its first overtures towards capitalism, one of the earliest sort of companies that came about were those that enabled bicycle sharing. In a model that was not actually all that different from the current model followed by Lime, Bird, and other such electric scooter sharers. 
But when this bicycle sharing was tried in China, as a business, as opposed to the positioning as cool that European cities such as Amsterdam and Paris were trying, it was a disaster. Fire up your favourite search engine, and finding images of heaps of bicycles dumped haphazardly enough to cause a nuisance turns out to be a common sight from back then. And because Beijing would then get compared to a Paris or an Amsterdam, it was easy for global media to paint this as a failure of the uncivilised East. 
Funnily enough, if you look up photos of electric scooters in San Francisco today, it is pretty much a similar sight. Electric scooters haphazardly dumped all over sidewalks. Or footpaths, as we call sidewalks in India. Even in the Bay Area, there are already loud and righteously vociferous complaints about these scooters taking over sidewalks. Imagine what would happen in India, where there is hardly space on the footpaths to walk. I will leave the idea of electric scooters succeeding on the footpaths of India as an exercise to the imagination of the reader. I take no responsibility for the chaotic nightmare that may result.

Rupee weakens past 69 to new closing low
","The rupee weakened further on Thursday, closing past the 69-mark against the dollar for the first time ever as foreign funds continued to stream out of emerging markets on expectations of higher U.S. interest rates. 
The rupee slid 43 paise to close at 69.05 on a day when most Asian currencies weakened against the dollar. The rupee’s biggest single-day fall since May 29, with the currency touching an intraday low of 69.07, was marked by the absence of central bank intervention, dealers said. The RBI sold $12 billion in May in the spot and forward markets to slow the pace of the rupee’s fall. The Indian currency is the worst performer in Asia this year, having lost over 8%.
The previous all-time closing low was on July 5, when it ended at 68.95. The rupee had hit 69.09 intraday on June 28, its lowest ever, before recovering on suspected RBI intervention.
Buoyant greenback
The dollar rose to a one-year high against a basket of currencies as investors raised bets on the currency in the wake of upbeat comments on the U.S. economy by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell.
A no-trust motion moved by opposition parties against the NDA government also weighed on the rupee and stocks. 
 The 30-share Sensex closed at 36,351.23, down 22.21 points. On the BSE, more than 1,800 stocks ended in the red as against less than 800 gainers. The broader indices like the BSE Midcap and the BSE Smallcap fell more than the benchmarks as investors remained wary about the side counters. Foreign investors have continued their selling spree in July with net sales of ₹616 crore after pulling out almost ₹4,900 crore in the previous month.

Face of Indian banking set to change over next 2 years
","In about two years from now, at least five private sectors banks will see new faces at the helm. The process for succession at Axis Bank, the third-largest private sector lender, has been finalised and is now awaiting regulatory approval. The process will start by April in HDFC Bank, the second-largest private sector bank. For ICICI Bank, a clear picture is expected by October.
Axis Bank will see a new chief executive from January 1, 2019 as its board has shortlisted three candidates and sent them to the Reserve Bank of India for approval. The lender’s present MD and CEO Shikha Sharma has decided to step down on December 31, 2018. The future of ICICI Bank MD and CEO Chanda Kochhar is unclear. Following allegations of impropriety and conflict of interest, the board of ICICI Bank has ordered a probe, with Ms. Kochhar deciding to go on leave till the probe is over.




This prompted the bank to create the post of chief operating officer and appoint Sandeep Bakhshi, who is now running the show. It remains to be seen if Ms. Kochhar, whose present term ends in March 2019, will seek reappointment.
The current term of Romesh Sobti, who has changed the face of IndusInd Bank over the last 10 years, ends in March 2020 when he turns 70 — the regulator-mandated retirement age of private sector bank chief executives. The lender will also have a new face, and will most probably elevate one of its current top management team.
HDFC Bank MD Aditya Puri, the longest-serving head of any Indian bank, will hang up his boots in October 2020. The lender will start the search process for a successor in April 2019 and there could be a 12-month overlap period in which the successor will work with Mr. Puri.
Also, the latest private sector universal bank, IDFC Bank, will also see a change of guard once it gets all the clearances for its proposed merger with Capital First. According to the deal, V. Vaidyanathan, the executive chairman of Capital First, will replace Rajiv Lall as the MD and CEO of the bank.

Texprocil in talks with textile sector on alternative plans for export subsidies
","The Cotton Textiles Export Promotion Council (Texprocil) will shortly submit its suggestions to the government on alternative programmes to replace some of the existing export promotion schemes for the textiles and clothing sector.
The council had engaged a consultant who is expected to submit a report by the end of this month. The consultant and the council are holding interactive meetings in different textile clusters now. Three such meetings had already been held and a similar number will be organised. A. Ravindrakumar, joint director, Texprocil, Harsha Vardhan Singh, chairman of IKDHVAJ Advisers (consultant) and Jayant Dasgupta, an international trade consultant, told The Hindu here that India had to phase out all export subsidies by 2018 as its share in global textile and clothing exports crossed the 3.25% threshold in 2010. 
Further, the U.S. had recently challenged some Indian export subsidy schemes at the World Trade Organisation (WTO). Schemes such as MEIS, EPCG, and SEZ had to be replaced.
However, India’s textile and clothing exports are less than the 2015 level. “In this context, if India is to remove the export benefits, it will be a further blow to the industry,” said Mr. Singh. Under the MEIS, made-ups and garments get 4% subsidy and fabrics 2%. The EPCG scheme is used widely by processing, weaving and spinning industries, they said.
Helping units scale up 
The objective of the suggestions would be to provide incentives and benefits to help all the units scale up, improve their competitiveness, encourage use of technology and enable them to go in for certifications. The alternative schemes should benefit both domestic and exportunits, they said.

An index to determine the value of coal blocks
","Major changes in the coal block auction system have been suggested by the high-powered committee set up last year to review the current process.
The recommendations, submitted this month, rest on four tenets — ensuring transparency and fairness, equity, early development of coal blocks and simplicity of implementation of the recommendations. These suggestions coincide with the opening up of the coal sector for commercial mining.
The proposed changes aim at introducing flexibility in the number of bidders, penalties for defaulting on milestones (and revoking bank guarantees), project execution, and relaxation to captive miners to sell some of the coal in the market. The panel has recommended developing a Coal Index for determining the value of blocks and a revenue-sharing model with the States. Currently, the valuation is on the basis of the notified price of Coal India Ltd. 
The committee has suggested scrapping the current practice of cancelling an auction if the number of bidders drop below three, saying that a single-bid should be accepted if biddings failed to find eligible bidders, provided the offered price was benchmarked to the reserve price. In the previous auctions, majority of the blocks could not be allocated as the number of eligible bidders was less than three.
The number of milestones are now eight versus 20 earlier, with the panel suggesting that only a default in achieving critical milestones should attract penalty against the earlier penalty for each default.
Shift from current system
If accepted, the changes would mark a major shift in the current system which was put in place after the cancellation of 204 coal-block allocations and introducing a system of auctioning the mineral blocks. Triggering euphoria and intense competition since their introduction, the e-auctions failed to sustain interest after several blocks were taken at high prices. Even companies which bought the blocks found it cheaper to import coal to meet their requirements rather than developing the mines.
There were no takers for subsequent blocks, forcing the Centre to do a rethink. The Expert Committee to ‘report on the challenges faced by the current auction system and recommend changes’ was headed by Pratyush Sinha with bureaucrats, ex-bureaucrats and one ex-chairperson each from the SBI and the Union Bank. Jayanta Roy, senior VP and group head — corporate sector ratings, ICRA, said production from the captive mines which were auctioned had remained lower than their pre-auction output. “Aggressive bids by some of the bidders during auctions, subsequent decline in coal prices in international markets as well as in e-auctions, and weak financial health of some of the coal-block winning companies are other reasons for slower ramp-up of production from these mines,” he said.
Absence of end-use condition in the guidelines is a significant positive for commercial miners, who were not eligible to participate in the coal-mine auctions conducted in 2015, he said. However, given the issues related to land acquisition and regulatory clearances, production levels from private commercial miners are not expected to rise significantly in the short- to medium term, he said.

Mechanisation in cotton harvest to boost cost saving
","Karuppusamy has sown cotton on three acres of his farmnear Udumalpet in Tamil Nadu. The farmer expects to start picking cotton in December. Two years ago, Karuppusamy would employ more than 40 workers an acre during harvest season, paying almost ₹250 per worker. 
Last year, he purchased a “kapas plucking machine.” It cost him ₹4,250 with an equal sum coming in as subsidy.
The machine does the job of three workers, the cotton comes without trash (dry leaves, etc.), and only fully bloomed cotton flowers are picked, he said about the advantages of using the mechanical plucker.
Subsidy support
 The Southern India Mills’ Association Cotton Development and Research Association (SIMA-CDRA) joined hands with Point Industries to develop the machine and unveiled it in June 2015. In 2016, the Tamil Nadu Government gave 50% subsidy for 150 machines. Last year, the Cotton Corporation of India gave 100% subsidy for 300 machines. It was distributed to farmers in Warangal, Ahmedabad, and Akola. The corporation plans to support the sale of 10,000 machines under the proposed Technology Mission on Cotton.
This year, the Tamil Nadu Government recently said it would provide 50% subsidy under the National Agriculture Development Programme of the Union government for the sale of 7,000 machines. It is expected to provide 50% subsidy for another 7,000 machines under its own schemes.
Cotton is grown on 124.44 lakh hectares in the country by almost 23 million farmers. Most of the farmers have one to five acres. However, mechanical plucking of cotton is done by less than 1% of them. This is just making a beginning, says K. Selvaraju, secretary general, SMA-CDRA.
A few Chinese machines were imported and used by farmers in the Gujarat belt. Plucking machines were made by a few private manufacturers too. However, their usage did not pick up mainly because of lack of user-friendly technology, he added.The government should support development and sale of these machines by providing GST exemption and subsidies for purchase of the implement. The state governments should also extend financial support, he said.

What is the GDP deflator?
","The GDP deflator, also called implicit price deflator, is a measure of inflation. It is the ratio of the value of goods and services an economy produces in a particular year at current prices to that of prices that prevailed during the base year.
This ratio helps show the extent to which the increase in gross domestic product has happened on account of higher prices rather than increase in output. 
Since the deflator covers the entire range of goods and services produced in the economy — as against the limited commodity baskets for the wholesale or consumer price indices — it is seen as a more comprehensive measure of inflation.
Real vs nominal
 GDP GDP price deflator measures the difference between real GDP and nominal GDP. Nominal GDP differs from real GDP as the former doesn’t include inflation, while the latter does. 
As a result, nominal GDP will most often be higher than real GDP in an expanding economy.
The formula to find the GDP price deflator:
GDP price deflator = (nominal GDP ÷ real GDP) x 100
WPI, CPI
A consumer price index (CPI) measures changes over time in the general level of prices of goods and services that households acquire for the purpose of consumption. 
However, since CPI is based only a basket of select goods and is calculated on prices included in it, it does not capture inflation across the economy as a whole. 
The wholesale price index basket has no representation of the services sector and all the constituents are only goods whose prices are captured at the wholesale/producer level.
Changes in consumption patterns or introduction of goods and services are automatically reflected in the GDP deflator. This allows the GDP deflator to absorb changes to an economy’s consumption or investment patterns. Often, the trends of the GDP deflator will be similar to that of the CPI.
Specifically, for the GDP deflator, the ‘basket’ in each year is the set of all goods that were produced domestically, weighted by the market value of the total consumption of each good. 
Therefore, new expenditure patterns are allowed to show up in the deflator as people respond to changing prices. The theory behind this approach is that the GDP deflator reflects up-to-date expenditure patterns. 
Reliability of GDP deflator 
Both the WPI and CPI capture changes in prices at varying stages of the economic cycle. While WPI is seen as a defacto Producer Price Index, CPI considers inflation at the retail end. But since only goods and services directly consumed by households — food products, clothing, petrol, health, education and recreation — are considered, the CPI does not tell us what is happening to prices of cement, steel or polyester yarn. While retail inflation is important, policymakers cannot ignore the prices that producers of consumer and intermediate and capital goods are receiving. However, GDP deflator is available only on a quarterly basis along with GDP estimates, whereas CPI and WPI data are released every month.

Consumption, govt. spending to be growth drivers
","Equity markets may well be trading at near all-time highs but the rally is taking place only in select stocks.  Mihir Vora, chief investment officer, Max Life Insurance, shares his thoughts.
The equity markets are at very high levels. Do you think it is a good time to invest in the markets or should one wait for a correction?
Markets are at near all-time highs but there is great polarisation of returns within the market and the benchmark. Stocks which are perceived to have visibility of earnings growth have been bid to extreme levels while those out-of-favour have been beaten down to yearly lows. The Nifty is held up by only eight stocks and it has become more acute in the past six months. This is seen in the large-cap benchmark stocks as well as in the mid-cap and small-cap segment. Mid and small-caps have corrected quite a lot and given up 2-3 years of outperformance versus the large-caps.
On the positive side, profit and growth numbers for the June and September 2018 quarters will be quite robust, given the low base of last year. The key to markets for the next few quarters is whether this momentum will sustain through March 2019. Valuations on an aggregate are still on the expensive side. Markets should consolidate and digest the global news flow on multiple factors viz. a) oil b) Chinese currency c) rising global yields d) trade and tariff issues. Locally, consumption and government spending look robust and should continue to be the growth drivers, continuing the trend that we have seen for quite some time.
What will be the impact on stock markets if there is an increase in crude prices besides a further fall in the rupee level? 
Crude prices, interest rates and the rupee are all very interlinked. If oil prices sustain at current levels, then we should be able to absorb it over a few quarters. However, if prices continue to rise, India as country becomes vulnerable again. Sentiment can change. Insurance products are not so closely linked to stock markets since we have a mix of products — from investment-oriented products to products which offer more protection. However, if markets and the economy do badly for a sustained long period, it may impact the flows.
Mutual funds have been seeing steady fund flow through SIPs which, in turn, is increasing inflows into the stock markets. How about the flows in the insurance segment and their stock market investments?
We continue to see steady inflows due to new sales, renewal premiums and income on existing portfolio. 
Like other segments of the financial sector, insurance also saw a sharp increase in inflows after the demonetisation event. The rise this year may not be as sharp as last year due to the high base, but the trend of savings being channeled to financial assets is likely to drive steady growth.
LIC is the largest domestic financial institution in terms of investments in the stock markets. What role do all the private sector insurance firms, including Max Life, play in the market especially when foreign investors are on a selling spree?
As we have seen in the past three years, the size of the local institutions has grown quite significantly. In the past few quarters, the selling by FIIs has been absorbed by the local institutions. Given the improved penetration of insurance and mutual funds and efforts to further improve the same, financial savings should continue to grow at a healthy pace. Moreover, the move by EPFO to increase allocation to equities and the rapid growth of the NPS schemes should further increase sustainable flows to equities annually.
In terms of relative size, FIIs holdings are still three times bigger than local holdings. Over the long term I don’t think that FIIs will remain net-sellers since they also get long-term inflows and they need to make asset allocations. India is a fast-growing economy of a certain critical size and it can absorb large amounts of capital — very few markets and countries offer this opportunity. In the past 20 years, FIIs have been net sellers of equities in only two or three years.
How has been the growth in the AUM of Max Life Insurance? Also, how do you see the growth going ahead?
Our March 2018 assets under management (AUM) were ₹52,683 crore, a growth of 19% over the previous year. Five years ago, we were at ₹20,434 crore, so we have grown at about 21% compounded over five years.
What has been the trend of your stock market investments?
We have seen good growth in our equity exposures. In the ULIP funds, the exposure is as per the fund benchmark allocation and the inflows are invested accordingly. In our traditional funds, we have increased exposure in the past five years. Overall, our equity assets have doubled in the past five years.
SEBI has reduced the individual anchor allocation size in SME IPOs to ₹2 crore from the earlier ₹10 crore. Do you think this will lead to insurance companies also looking at investing in the SME segment?
Given the size of the corpus of the larger companies like ourselves, it is unlikely that there would be a significant allocation to micro-cap stocks. We have been reducing our mid and small-cap exposure over the past year.

IBC eyes UN model for cross-border norms
"," The government is looking at the possibility of adopting a United Nations legal model for cross-border insolvency cases as it works on strengthening the insolvency resolution framework, according to a senior official.
 The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) has sections pertaining to cross-border insolvency matters but are yet to be made operational. The Insolvency Law Committee, headed by Corporate Affairs Secretary Injeti Srinivas, is studying the feasibility of introducing cross-border insolvency provisions. “The committee is looking at the adoption of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law model on dealing with cross border insolvency,” he said in the ministry’s latest monthly newsletter.
 He also noted the existing Code provides for two sections — 234 and 235 — relating to cross-border insolvency, which allows the Centre to enter into an agreement with a foreign country for enforcing the provisions of the Code, which is considered insufficient and time-taking. 
An official said in case the UN model is adopted for cross-border insolvency matters, then sections 234 and 235 could be dropped from the Code as they pertain to only bilateral pacts.

The startup bubble in India
"," I thought we were done with the startup bubble in India. I thought the age where every Tom, Dick, and Harry would consider themselves entrepreneurs and start something up was behind us. I thought whoever is starting up these days, would do so only after establishing beyond doubt that there was a tangible problem they were solving and there was a large enough market that wanted that problem solved.
And then a couple of days ago, I read an article about a Bollywood actor, one best known for playing the entrepreneurial cricketer Mahendra Singh Dhoni on the big screen, Sushant Singh Rajput, starting a tech startup. This is the sort of thing that happens right in the middle of a bubble, when celebrities decide that they want in on a fad and start companies. 
This is why you had Snoop Doggy Dogg start his own cryptocurrency. But the Indian startup scene had gotten out of a couple of such bubbles, and there was no discernible wave to ride in starting up for celebrities. Cryptocurrencies did not cause the same ripples here as they did elsewhere. Machine learning, and artificial intelligence are possibly waves celebrities might eventually target, but it is too early to do so now, for them at least.
So when I saw a headline about Sushant Singh Rajput becoming an entrepreneur, I decided I will read the article too, because I was curious. At the very least, to figure out if I had missed out some bubble. His startup is called Innsaei. It apparently is an Icelandic word meaning intuition. Of course, it tells you nothing about what the startup might be into. For that, let me quote tweets from Sushant, ones that all press coverage duly printed, for there was little else to report.
“Announcing my first venture #Innsaei with my business partner @ivarunmathur. The convergence of #IntellectualProperty and Emerging Technologies. @OnInnsaei.”
Okay, so far so vague. I do not know what this startup is really about, and maybe Sushant will clear the mist in his next tweet.
“Emerging technologies are disrupting socio-cultural and economic structures at an exponential pace and this will impact key areas like education, employment, entertainment & health @OnInnsaei.”
This is where I gave up. I know it is a grammatically correct sentence, yet, all those words neatly put together made no sense at all. In my past columns, I have harped enough times on how crucial it is for a startup to be very clear about the problem that they are solving, for it is only then that they can achieve any sort of product and market fit. I have also talked about how important it is to be able to clearly enunciate the business model in a sentence or two. When a startup fails either of these two criteria, I almost always write them off. And Sushant’s startup fails both these heuristics.
Of course, there is the likelihood that these perfectly logical thumb rules and heuristics will fail, and the startup may actually succeed. For it is a man with much privilege and the security blanket that it brings who has started it, and such access goes a long way in making something successful. Either way, I hope it is just a blip and not a trend.

India drops three ranks in AT Kearney FDI Confidence Index
","India in 2018 has fallen out of the top 10 destinations for FDI in terms of its attractiveness, according to an AT Kearney report, which says this could be due to teething troubles in the implementation of the goods and services tax and the government’s demonetisation decision in 2016.
India ranks 11 in the 2018 AT Kearney FDI Confidence Index, down from 8 in 2017 and 9 in 2016.
“Some policies, however, may have deterred investors — at least in the short term,” the report said. “The 2017 nationwide goods and services tax, for example, has faced implementation challenges, and the 2016 demonetisation initiative disrupted business activity and weighed on economic growth.”
That said, the report highlighted several of the reforms — such as removing the Foreign Investment Promotion Board and liberalising FDI limits in key sectors — that have maintained India’s high rankings in terms of FDI attractiveness.
“Notable reforms include the elimination of the Foreign Investment Promotion Board, a government agency responsible for reviewing all potential foreign investment, and the liberalisation of foreign investment thresholds for the retail, aviation, and biomedical industries,” the report said.
The report, released on Monday added that potential investors are likely to be cautious as they are monitoring political risks such as China abolishing presidential term limits and the upcoming general election in India.
“The sheer size of the Chinese and Indian markets, however, will continue to be a draw for investors, and they remain the highest-ranking emerging markets on the index,” the report brought out by the management consulting company added.

Infusion to help PSBs meet norms: Moody’s
","The government’s decision to infuse ₹11,336 crore in five public sector banks will help meet the regulatory capital requirements, rating agency Moody’s said on Wednesday. 
“The infusions are credit positive and will strengthen the banks’ capitalisation.” 
‘Weakest CET1 ratios’
 “These banks’ common equity tier 1 (CET1) ratios were the weakest among all public-sector banks as of fiscal 2018, and were at the risk of breaching the minimum regulatory capital requirement of 5.5% under the Basel III norms,” Moody’s said. The banks that would receive the funds are Allahabad Bank, Andhra Bank, Corporation Bank, Indian Overseas Bank and Punjab National Bank. “The infused capital is 0.6%-2.0% of the banks’ risk-weighted assets (RWAs) as of fiscal 2018,” Moody’s said adding with this capital infusion, these banks’ CET1 ratios are expected to be above 5.5%, which is the minimum capital requirement under the Basel III norms in India.

SEBI proposes using UPI to reduce public issue timeline ","The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has proposed allowing investors to use the unified payments interface (UPI) while bidding for shares in an initial public offer (IPO) to reduce the public issue timeline from the current T+6 to T+3.
In a discussion paper released on Wednesday, the capital market regulator said that while ASBA — application supported by blocked amount — helped in reducing the timeline two years back, UPI could help in further bringing down the overall IPO timeline. 
“In view of the significant developments in the payment mechanisms, it is felt that the unified payments interface (UPI)... could be incorporated with ASBA mechanism to further improve the efficiency of the (IPO) process,” stated the paper. 
T+3 refers to a system wherein the equity shares would be listed on the bourses on the third day from the day the IPO closes for subscription. SEBI had reduced the IPO timeline from T+12 to T+6 in January 2016 by making ASBA mandatory for all investors. 
SEBI, however, said since UPI had a cap of ₹2 lakh for money transfer, institutional investors and high net worth individuals would be allowed to bid using the existing ASBA process.

Jyoti Structures, an engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) firm, is set to become the first out of the list of 12 companies that was handed to banks by the Reserve Bank of India for resolution to be headed for liquidation.
According to bankers, the EPC firm had a debt of more than ₹7,500 crore and more than a 80% haircut was proposed. State Bank of India, ICICI Bank, Bank of India, IDBI Bank were some of the lenders.
The detailed order from NCLT on the issue would come out on Friday which would throw light on the reasons behind the rejection of the resolution plan. The revival plan was submitted by a group of high networth individuals (HNI) led by Sharad Sanghi.
Jyoti Structures may challenge the decision at the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT).
On June 13, 2017, RBI had recommended the banks to take 12 defaulting borrowers, each with an exposure of ₹5,000 crore or more, for insolvency proceedings. These accounts contributed 25% of the total gross non-performing assets of the banking system.
Some of the other borrowers in that list of 12 accounts include Bhushan Steel, Essar Steel, Lanco Infra, Bhushan Steel and Power, Alok Industries, Electrosteel Steel and Amket Auto among others.

‘EPFO, ESIC, NPS subscribers grew in double digits in May’
","Formal employment, as measured by the number of subscribers in the Employees’ Provident Fund (EPFO), Employees’ State Insurance Scheme (ESIC), and the National Pension Scheme (NPS), witnessed double-digit growth in May 2018, according to official payroll data released by the Ministry of Statistics on Wednesday.
The data shows that 7,43,608 new subscribers enrolled in EPFO in May 2018, up from 6,76,147 in April, registering a growth of 10%. Within this, about 34% of the subscribers were in the age group of 18-21 years, 25% in the 22-25 year age group, and 14.2% in the 29-35 age group.
Similarly, the number of new subscribers in the ESIC stood at 12,75,658 in May compared with 10,45,048 in April, a growth of 22%. Here too, the 22-25 age group contributed the highest proportion — 27.6% — of the new subscribers, followed by the 18-21 age group, which accounted for 21% of the new subscribers.
The number of new subscribers in NPS grew to 56,336 in May 2018, from 46,863 in April, a growth of 20.2%.
In NPS, the highest contribution to the number of new subscribers came from the above 35 years age group, which made up 29.3% of the new subscribers.
The Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation, however, clarified that simply looking at this data would not provide a complete picture of formal employment in the country.
“As mentioned in the earlier series, the levels of employment are from various sources, there are elements of overlap and the estimates are not additive,” the Ministry said in the release. “The present report gives different perspectives on the levels of employment in the formal sector and does not measure employment at a holistic level.”

Panel to review third party motor cover costs
"," Insurance regulator IRDAI has constituted a 16-member committee to examine motor third party insurance pricing aspects and make recommendations on the premium rates for 2019-20.
This is for the first time the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India has formed such a committee, an official familiar with the development said. Apart from examining the third party cover pricing aspects, including data related ones, the committee has been tasked to revisit the classification of vehicles, in view of the development in the industry. Its term will be till December 31, IRDAI said in an order constituting the committee, recently.
The composition of the committee, with IRDAI Member - Non Life P.J. Joseph as chairman, is diverse from a stakeholder perspective. Besides two others from the authority, the panel will have a senior official each from the Centre’s Department of Financial Services as well as the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways as members.
Five of the members have been drawn from general insurance companies.
Figuring in the committee, on behalf of users, are All India Motor Transport Congress president S.K. Mittal (as main member) and AIMTC vice president Mukesh Dave (as alternate member), additional secretary of Bus Operators Confederation of India D.R. Dharmaraj Bala, and president of the Federation of India Automobile Associations Nitin G. Dossa.
Others on the committee are Chief Operating officer of ‘Consumer Voice’ S.P. Chakraborty, Head-Technical of General Insurance Council Arvind Shenoy and Motor Vertical In-charge of Insurance Information Bureau of India (IIBI) Jacob Thomas.
The regulator’s decision to form the committee comes in the backdrop of a cargo transporters strike to highlight various demands, one of which is for a roll-back in the third party premium hike. As per the new rates notified by IRDAI in March for 2018-19, the increase in the premium has been over 25% for certain category of goods carrying public carriers (other than three wheelers).
IRDAI, however, was unlikely to discontinue the existing practice of arriving at the premium rates based on data provided by the IIBI and those pertaining to the claims paid and gross written premiums. The committee’s recommendations, sources said, was expected to provide newer insights while deciding on the premium rates.
On classification of vehicles as a terms of reference, sources said the committee would look at the categorisation of cargo vehicles, in terms of their GVW rating, to explore the possibility of merging certain categories.

Sensex touches 37,000 as rally extends
","Investor optimism over strong earnings and selective buying in index blue chips pushed the benchmark Sensex above the 37,000-mark for the first time ever on Thursday, which was also the fifth straight session of gain for the benchmark.
The 30-share Sensex opened strong and breached the 37,000-mark during the early morning session before partly shedding some of the gains on account of profit booking. Later in the day, it touched a high of 37,061.62 before closing the day at a new high of 36,984.64, up 126.41 points over Wednesday’s close.
While the index has gained 633 points in the last five consecutive session, it took only 13 sessions to move from 36,000 to 37,000.
Meanwhile, the broader Nifty settled at 11,167.30, up 35.30 points or 0.32%.
Dhiraj Relli, MD and CEO, HDFC Securities, attributed the rally to strong earnings and liquidity push, especially by mutual funds that have also done considerable portfolio reallocation in the recent past.
Inflows into MFs
“New highs have come about on the back of sustained inflows into mutual funds. Earnings are also catching up. Nifty earnings, which grew at a CAGR of 3% between 2013 and 2017, increased by 8.5% in the financial year 2017-18, and this year they are likely to be in high teens. This should make the valuations look comfortable,” said Mr. Relli.
Incidentally, the mutual fund reallocation has also led to the recent trend wherein the benchmarks have scaled new highs even as the overall market breadth remained weak or even negative on most days.
On Thursday, advances at 1,335 only barely managed to outnumber the declines at 1,238 with most of the broader indices registering only marginal gains. 
Most market participants still believe that the sell off in the midcap and smallcap space is not over yet.
Further, July has seen domestic institutional investors putting in more than ₹4,000 crore in equities wherein overseas investors have been net sellers at ₹927 crore.
Meanwhile, the Sensex pack saw a total of 18 stocks gaining ground on Thursday with State Bank of India, ICICI Bank, Power Grid Corporation, ONGC, Axis Bank, NTPC and HDFC all gaining in the range of 1-5% each.
While the Sensex has gained around 8.60% in the current calendar year, the BSE Smallcap index is down over 15% in 2018.
Maruti Suzuki was the worst performer in the Sensex pack, shedding 3.70% after the company June quarter profit missed analyst estimates.

‘Acquisition is about synergies, cost reduction’ ","Kumar Mangalam Birla, chairman of Aditya Birla Group, spoke after announcing the $2.6 billion acquisition of U.S.-based Aleris Corp. Edited excerpts. 
How confident are you in getting approvals in U.S, and China when the first buyer from China could not get government approval to buy Aleris?
There are couple of areas where we are competent than the other company. They had zero presence in the U.S. and we have significant presence in multiple locations. 
We have operating facilities across locations. We are constructing a new plant Kentucky. We have been in business in the U.S. for decade building trust. The Chinese company, which was competing with us, had neither presence in the U.S. nor made any investment there. 
As an industry, we are making 1.5 MT of sheet that go into automotive sector and competing with steel. No matter the process will take time. 
How do you see the see the deal in the light of resistance to foreign companies taking over assets abroad?
Think about this acquisition, we are not going to see any redundancy in operation. No job losses. This deal is about growth. We will be taking over certain plants and continue to grow these plants across the world and particularly in the U.S. It is completely about growth than anything else. 
It is about making solutions available to customers. It about achieving synergies and cost reduction to make the operations more resilient.
 Why are private equity investors quitting when their $900 million investment is going to yield returns?
It is better for them to answer, but I think the private equity investors do not lock their investment in an asset for a long time. 
They want to exit after a point of time booking their profit. This, incidentally, fits into our search for growth.
Vodafone-Idea got DoT approval for merger. When do you think the merged Vodafone and Idea will start operations and what would be your strategy when the price war is still on? 
We should start operations in next few weeks. We are still in the process of framing the strategy which will be revealed soon. We will make substantial investment in telecom sector going forward.
Do you think rising lending rate and surging inflation will affect India growth story?
 Our economists are expecting India to grow at over 8% and it will be one of the fasted growing countries. It is back on strong fundamentals. Some of the sectors are coming back strongly. 
Rising lending rates and inflation will have an impact but not much to hamper growth completely. It is part of doing business in any part of the world.
But, you were not very optimistic during UltraTech AGM?
During UltraTech AGM, I said that the economy is not looking rosy because of structural concerns like oil prices, inflation etc. Cement is looking up, roads and infrastructure sectors are doing well. I don’t see any problems with the economy. I see green shoots coming back in fact.
What’s the difference between Novelis and Aleris acquisitions?
I think Novelis was driven by the fact we wanted to move the portfolio to have a share of much higher value added products, higher margins, less volatility. 
It’s proven in the last 11 years, I think Novelis today is a well-regarded and valuable company. 
Aleris is a step forward in that direction giving us wide range of customers, new verticals like aerospace... very significant.

Google unveils AI chips ","Google is going beyond building artificial intelligence (AI) chips for its data centres.
At the Google Cloud Next ’18 conference in San Francisco, the Internet giant announced two new products aimed at helping customers develop and deploy intelligent connected devices at scale. The first one was ‘Edge TPU,’ a new hardware chip, so small that four of them can fit on a U.S penny, Injong Rhee, VP, IoT, Google Cloud, demonstrated on the stage.
“Edge TPU would bring the brain to your devices... at extremely low cost and high power efficiency without compromising performance,” said Mr. Rhee.“I believe this is a game changer.”
Edge TPU is Google’s purpose-built application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) designed to run AI at the edge.
It delivers high performance in a small physical and power footprint, enabling the deployment of high-accuracy AI at the edge, according to the company.
The other product announced was ‘Cloud IoT Edge,’ a software stack that extends Google Cloud’s powerful AI capability to gateways and connected devices.
One of the companies using these new technologies is LG CNS, a subsidiary of LG. Shingyoon Hyun, the CTO of LG CNS, said with intelligent vision inspection, the company is eager to make a better working place, raise the quality of the product and save millions of dollars each year.
“Google Cloud AI and IoT technologies with LG CNS expertise make this possible,” said Mr. Hyun.
In May this year, Google’s rival Microsoft announced the preview introduction of its Project Brainwave, a system which has specialised chips to run AI models, on its cloud computing platform Azure.
Mr. Rhee of Google said ‘‘Cloud IoT Edge, Edge TPU and Cloud IoT Core’ are opening up completely new possibilities with the Internet of Things (IoT) — a technology where devices communicate with each other intelligently.
He said with powerful data processing and machine learning capabilities at the edge, devices such as robotic arms, wind turbines and smart cars can now act on the data from their sensors in real time and predict outcomes locally.
Also, automotive companies can increase safety through intelligent technologies like collision avoidance, traffic routing, and eyes-off-the-road detection systems, said Mr.Rhee. Research firm IDC estimates that the total amount of data generated from connected devices will exceed 40 trillion gigabytes by 2025.
Google also announced that it is making the new Gmail generally available to the customers of G Suite, the company ’s package of workplace productivity tools. It said more companies can take advantage of features like redesigned security warnings, snooze and offline access.
Mountain View, California-based Google said that it is using machine learning to analyse threat indicators across billions of messages in Gmail to help quickly identify potential security attacks in the making. ML helps protect more than 1.4 billion active Gmail user accounts “from nearly 10 million spam and malicious emails every minute,” said Garrick Toubassi, vice president of engineering, G Suite.
Google also announced a new Cloud Search functionality to help companies intelligently and securely index their third-party data beyond G Suite, whether that data is stored in the cloud, or on-premise.
Companies, like Whirlpool Corporation, have started deploying Cloud Search’s new capabilities to unify search across multiple data sources. It has created a custom app that indexes more than 12 million documents across different on-premise and cloud systems and returns results in “100s of milliseconds on average,” said Mr. Toubassi.
Titan Security Key
Google also announced a product called ‘Titan Security Key’ to protect its customers from phishing attacks. Jennifer Lin, product management director, Google Cloud said the company has long advocated the use of security keys as the strongest, most phishing-resistant authentication factor for high-value users, especially cloud admins, to protect against the potentially damaging consequences of credential theft. Titan Security Keys are available now to Google Cloud customers and will be available for anyone to purchase on the Google Store soon.

Total revenue from operations at ₹10,874.6 crore in the April-June period was lower than ₹13,800.4 crore a year earlier. The company said that the figures were not comparable in view of the recast of indirect taxes.
While profits were driven by “robust performance across most segments, steep escalation in tax incidence under GST regime continues to weigh on FMCG-cigarettes performance,” ITC said in a statement.
The FMCG-others segment, which includes food and personal care products, witnessed an 86% jump in EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation) to ₹127.8 crore, driven by enhanced scale, enriched product-mix and improved cost management measures, it said.
Results at the hotels business improved through higher room rates and strong F&B sales. The 271-room luxury hotel ITC Kohenur, in Hyderabad, was commissioned on June 1 and had received “excellent initial response”, the company said. Construction of new hotels at Kolkata, Ahmedabad and WelcomeHotels in Guntur and Bhubaneswar was progressing.
The paperboards, paper and packaging segment saw a 15% increase in profit, driven by strategic investments in imported pulp substitution, improved pulp yield and higher realisation through better product mix.
In its agribusiness, ITC leveraged market opportunities in oil seeds, rice, spices and coffee resulting in robust business growth during the quarter to ₹3,151.3 crore, from ₹2,760.5 crore, even as the tobacco operations of the business hemmed in segment profits.

Coromandel Q1 profit rises 24% ","Fertiliser maker Coromandel International has reported a ₹90.21 crore consolidated net profit for the quarter ended June 30, a more than 24% increase from the year-earlier period’s ₹72.65 crore. 
Consolidated total income rose 9.4% to ₹2,537 crore (₹2,318 crore). Besides being a leading manufacturer of phosphatic fertiliser, the Hyderabad-based firm is into crop protection solutions, specialty nutrients, organic manure and retail.
In a statement,managing director Sameer Goel said the company posted a strong performance during the quarter, improving its capacity utilisation, operational and sourcing efficiencies and customer connect initiatives. 
“This was despite erratic monsoon distribution in our key operating markets,” he said.
“The normal south-west monsoon improved reservoir levels and recent pick up in crop sowing in our key operating markets are expected to augment agriculture growth. 
“With the higher crop support price and farmer welfare schemes, we are seeing positive agrarian sentiments,” he said.
The recently announced GST rate reduction on fertiliser grade phosphoric acid from 12% to 5% is likely to bring down the company’s GST credit accumulation and improve the working capital situation, according to Mr. Goel.

GDPR: travel industry can be the beacon
"," The European Union’s (EU) General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has been active since May, and while many large multinationals are already GDPR-compliant, some smaller players, including many small and mid-sized Indian companies, are not. 
A legitimate reason is that GDPR’s regulations are only applicable if the company has a presence, offers goods or services, or monitors individuals’ behaviours in the European Union. A number of Indian firms are experiencing high growth, and are beginning to explore opportunities globally. It’s critical they prepare for the obligations of a multinational organisation, and for those that do intend to conduct business within Europe, that they have prepared themselves to be GDPR-compliant.
Their existing privacy policies must be enhanced to meet stricter regulatory obligations of the global marketplace such as GDPR. For companies conducting business in Europe that fail to meet these standards, they risk fines of up to €20 million, or 4% of annual revenue for the fiscal, whichever is higher.
For the new kids on the block — India’s future global corporations — regulatory requirements may prove to be an early stumbling block if they’re not sufficiently prepared.
‘Business as usual’
For many of our clients, particularly local Indian firms looking to expand globally, GDPR is a hot topic. For us, as a global travel management company, GDPR, and other such data security regulations are typically considered ‘business as usual’. For, there have always been high expectations regarding data protection for travel companies, based on the highly sensitive information that we manage. Additionally, our roots as a bank holding company, and as the only travel management company which adheres to the Binding Corporate Rules, put us in a strong position to meet the GDPR requirements from the outset.
India’s growth sectors such as retail, banking, insurance and telecom are key areas where global expansion will likely require GDPR compliance. The travel industry’s experience in data security can provide tremendous benefit to those who are still finding their way. A few tips here:
Companies should create a robust data inventory to ensure that they are effectively and transparently communicating their data processing activities. They should put in place a regular internal audits process.
Second, companies should educate employees and provide training around privacy and security awareness. 
Finally, any business with European partners must understand its data protection obligations, especially any contractual obligations which relate to the way personal data is handled. European businesses will require their Indian partners to put in place new mechanisms to ensure any personal data transferred between them meets the GDPR’s requirements.

Sowing traditional seeds for future harvest ","For S. Sultan Ahamed Kabir of Tirumalairayar Pattinam in Karaikal of the Union Territory of Puducherry, this is the third generation’s tryst with farming. But he has transformed agriculture from a vocation to feed people into a mission to conserve seeds of traditional paddy varieties for posterity. In the last 12 years, he has grown about 80 varieties of traditional paddy.
Inspired by the words of green crusader G. Nammalvar who said that the seed was a mighty weapon in the hands of the farmer, Mr. Kabir’s quest for traditional varieties began in 2006. 
To sow 108 varieties
 Wide travel, intense interaction with farmers and valuable inputs from farm scientists resulted in more than 10 varieties reaching him. He started raising them in his own farm at Tirumalairayar Pattinam and two other farms at Kulithalai and Chengalpattu. Today, the number has crossed 80. He plans to begin the ensuing sowing season in August with 108 varieties.
“I do not sell paddy. I convert only a portion of the harvest into rice for my livelihood. My focus is on the major portion which will supply seeds,” says Kabir, sitting in his hut on the banks of the Tirumalairayar river. His farm practices include non-use of fertilisers and pesticides, hand sowing and harvesting. He adopts green practices of Mr. Nammalvar to allow the soil to rejuvenate on its own and the crop to retain its quality. When it rains heavily, he also resorts to methods followed in boro rice cultivation in the north east and Bangladesh.
 He takes care not to mix varieties when more than one is ready for harvest. “I want to ensure that purity of a particular variety is not compromised,” he says, He has two small storage facilities for ‘feed’ and ‘seed.’
The varieties raised by him include karuppu kavuni, karunkuruvai, vellai ponni, seeraga samba, mappillai samba, kaala namak, iluppaipoo samba, thooya malli and Attur kichadi sambapoonkar arupatham kuruvai. He claims that he had succeeded so far by adopting scientific farming methods in tune with the local climate. “Though these traditional varieties can be raised any time, the local climate determines the yield. The deciding factors for a good harvest are climate, soil health and water availability,” Another progressive farmer, G. Sither of Thanjavur, points out that only traditional paddy varieties display a characteristic to adapt to the micro climate.
Mr. Kabir says that there is a growing demand for traditional varieties, primarily for their medicinal properties. He usually barters seeds with fellow farmers from all over Tamil Nadu and Puducherry. Another way of popularising native varieties among farmers is through festivals and community gatherings. Each farmer is given two kg of seeds free on these occasions. Mr. Kabir also participates as resource person in lectures and workshops to popularise traditional varieties under the Agricultural Technology Management Agency of the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University.

‘Share your ride, go electric, breathe easy’ "," Smart applications and new forms of mobility may make urban commutes easier in the near future, which is going to be dominated by electric scooters, motorcycles, buses and bicycles, industry officials and analysts said.
Urbanisation has wrecked the infrastructure of Indian cities and mobility has taken a hit, Amit Gupta, CEO and co-founder, Yulu, an IoT-based bicycle share provider. “Traffic congestion has affected the productivity of people and has also had a major impact on their physical health and emotional well-being.”
Bengaluru, India’s technology hub, has the lowest pace of traffic, slower than New Delhi (25 km/hr) and Mumbai (20.7 km/hr), a study by ride-hailing firm Ola, found. The city’s traffic pace had dropped close to 3km/ hr in one year in 2017.
Yulu is trying to solve the last-mile connectivity problem, Mr. Gupta said. The firm has installed bicycle stations in the city and plans to connect buses, bikes and e-scooters through an app. “The aim is that different transportation points can talk to each other.” 
“Where is urban mobility headed? Somebody has to fix the first and the last-mile problem.” 
Tarun Rambha, assistant professor at the Civil Engineering Department of the Indian Institute of Science said the “future is shared.” 
“Vehicles that transport you are parked 95% of the time... Sharing a car will lead to lower congestion, cheaper travel and a better environment,” said Mr. Rambha, who researches in real-time traffic of traffic networks. “Ride-sharing can help reduce the oversupply (of cars) we [now] have.”
Four technology-driven trends — electrification, shared mobility, connectivity and autonomous driving — are leading the disruption in the auto industry, according to a McKinsey & Company report.
These trends will shift markets and revenue pools, change mobility behaviour and build new avenues for competition and cooperation. The real growth lies in services, which are poised to grow by an average of up to 40% a year, globally.
Sirish Batchu, head of advanced technology division at Mahindra Electric Mobility, said, “Electric technology is at a tipping point.” About 3 million EVs will be on Indian roads by 2030, he said.
By defining regulations on emissions and fuel efficiency, exploring incentives and subsidies, the Centre can support EV adoption and develop a supportive ecosystem, according to McKinsey. 
Power, fuel and charging infrastructure firms can innovate on business models such as leasing of batteries, swapping infrastructure and deploying fast chargers, to drive EV adoption, according to the report.
Savings galore
India can save 64% of anticipated passenger road-based mobility-related energy demand and 37% of carbon emissions by 2030 by pursuing shared, electric and connected mobility, government think-tank NITI Aayog said in a report.
This would help reduce 156 Mtoe in fuel consumption by that year and implies savings of about ₹3.9 lakh crore by 2030.
R.K. Shenoy, senior VP, Embedded Solutions and Product Engineering at Robert Bosch Engineering and Business Solutions, said automated mobility had resulted in a series of new inventions such as intelligent lights, auto wipers, collision warning, auto pilot and highway assist.
“It is something like eyes off, brains off and driver off. The economics of such vehicles has a long way to go.”

Drugmakers eye new prescription for exports
"," For the $17.3 billion Indian pharmaceuticals export sector, there could be no better time than now to look beyond its largest market — the U.S.
An upsurge in challenges in the U.S. market — from the long-standing regulatory issues to increased pricing pressure amid a tougher policy approach on the part of the Trump administration — coincided with a decline in India’s shipments to the world’s largest market for medicines last fiscal. Exports fell 7.4% to $5.35 billion in the 12 months ended March, from $5.77 billion in 2016-17.
‘Exports to U.S. shrink’
North America, primarily the U.S., accounted for more than 30% of India’s pharma exports in FY18. While it may continue to remain the single largest destination for some more time to come, the fact is it also was the only market to have recorded a contraction in India’s drug export basket.
With the headwinds in the U.S. showing no signs of abating any time soon, a shift in focus seems more of a necessity than a choice.
“It is difficult to predict how long these trends will last,” said Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories Chairman K. Satish Reddy and CEO G V Prasad, in a letter to shareholders in the 2017-18 annual report.
DRL, one of India’s largest drugmakers, has for some quarters now, been highlighting price erosion in the U.S. due to channel consolidation and increased competition as a key pressure point on the company’s margins. The U.S. accounts for 52% of DRL’s global generics sales.
“Our focus... instead of worrying about our exports to [North] America [should be] to simultaneously explore the markets of Africa, Latin America and Europe,” said Ravi Uday Bhaskar, director general, Pharmaceuticals Export Promotion Council (Pharmexcil). “Where there is a question of affordability and a weak economy, there, Indian generics are very much relevant,” he asserted. Decades of experience in exporting to the highly regulated U.S. and European markets should, in fact, serve as a big advantage for Indian drugmakers looking to tap other global markets, according to Mr. Bhaskar. Efforts in this direction are already under way, according to HDFC Securities analyst Amey Chalke.
“Most companies [with] a branded presence in India are exploring opportunities outside the U.S., Europe and India,” said Mr. Chalke. “They are looking at branded markets like Africa, Latin America and Asia, which are non-regulated or semi-regulated markets.”
One concern for drugmakers exploring newer markets would be profit margins. “If you are in Europe, it is a generic market. It is like the U.S. but under price control. So obviously, the margins would be lower in Europe. In case of other markets like Africa, Asia and Latin America, margins could be substantially higher if you have a good, branded portfolio. It may be less than India, but could report substantial profitability,” he said.
‘High volume game’
Volumes, though, could be substantially higher, added Mr. Bhaskar of Pharmexcil, a body under the Union Ministry of Commerce tasked with facilitating exports. 
Ajantha Pharma, he pointed out, has substantial presence in Africa and earns more than 30% Ebitda margins in the continent. There are also companies that procure products from cheaper sources in China and then supply the drugs to the African market. 
Acquisition is another path. Aurobindo Pharma’s acquisition of Canadian generic major Apotex’s European operations is an example. The acquisition is in line with Aurobindo’s strategy to strengthen and grow its European business and to expand in Eastern Europe. It already has a presence in nine countries in the continent and posted €577 million sales last fiscal.

FASTags aim to quicken pace of journey through toll booths
","Less than two years after the government introduced the radio frequency identification device (RFID)-based FASTag system for vehicles crossing toll gates on the country’s highway network, 26 lakh cars and trucks now use the windscreen-mounted tags to shorten their journey time.
According to the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways officials, FASTag users can experience ‘near’ non-stop movement at 405 of the 479 toll plazas on various national highways.
This is how the device works – the tag with a quick response (QR) code and an identification number is affixed to the windscreen of a vehicle. The tag is linked to a user’s FASTag account with the bank of his or her choice. 
When a vehicle approaches a toll plaza on a national highway, it can use dedicated FASTag lanes to avoid stopping to pay a toll tax. However, the technology being currently used in India still requires one to slow down to a speed of 10 km per hour as the toll plaza antennae has a range of only six metres.
Once the vehicle passes through a toll booth, the user receives an SMS alert regarding the charge debited to his or her account. To encourage the use of FASTags, the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) refunds 5% of the total monthly transactions.
Lack of RFID lanes
 But some users say that the promise of seamless travel is only in theory and the ground reality is very different. 
“Many plazas don’t have a dedicated lane for RFID tags, which means that one still has to wait in a queue along with other vehicles which need to stop to make cash transaction,” said Naveen Kumar Gupta, secretary general, All India Motor Transport Congress.
“What we need is free flow of vehicles which will take our average of 300 kms per 12 hours to about 800 kms, resulting in an increase in return on investment for transporters as well as bringing down logistics cost. Also, at many places RFID readers don’t work because concessionaires are not keen to switch to the new technology. We need a system that will allow movement which is free of human interventions, lanes as well as boom barriers,” he said.
Biggest users
 Trucks and taxis account for the biggest users of FASTags unlike personal car owners whose movement is most likely to be restricted to city limits.
Ministry sources acknowledge the challenges faced by the users and say that with advancement of technology they are hopeful that in coming years the country’s highways could see free flow multi-lane plazas allowing a vehicle to zip through at higher speeds similar to some foreign countries.
Officials are also enthused by the data on the use of FASTags. They say that the RFID card has seen an average uptake of two lakh vehicles per month and their use currently accounts for 12.5% or five lakh transactions of the total 40 lakh transactions recorded per day at all toll booths across the country.
The value of these transactions is higher, at 25% of the total toll collected — ₹15 crore out of ₹60 crore garnered per day —which points to a larger number of heavy vehicles availing the service as the toll paid by them amounts to seven to eight times that of cars.
While the device was rolled out in April 2016, the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways made it mandatory from December 1, 2017 for all new cars and trucks to be fitted with a FASTag before they were sold. But, the use of these smart cards is not mandatory yet. 
The Ministry has also proposed to make FASTag compulsory for all commercial vehicles seeking a national permit.

Gold council to aid exports on the anvil
"," The Centre has decided to set up a Domestic Council for Gold to aid exports of jewellery and to create an ecosystem to harness the true potential for jewellery-making in the country.
Commerce Minister Suresh Prabhu said the council would work towards industry development, job creation, building of regional clusters and strengthening of value chains. He was speaking at the 44th India Gem & Jewellery Awards 2017 organised by the Gem and Jewellery Export Promotion Council (GJEPC), in Mumbai on Saturday.
“This council will represent all the jewellers of India who will be the electoral college. They will form different interest groups and elect those who will sit in the council,” he said, adding the council would provide domestic support for exports. 
“Every village has a jeweller who makes handmade and custom-made jewellery. These artisans will be helped by jewellery designers to come out with products with better value, which will be ultimately exported by big companies,” he said. “We want to develop such a model,” he added. The Minister said that GJEPC and the Centre were working together to formulate a strategy to achieve the desired objective.
‘To address concerns’
A Coordination Committee will be set up comprising senior officials of the Ministry and the gem and jewellery industry, who will meet monthly to ensure that industry concerns are addressed on priority. The first meeting of the committee will be held on August 1.
Even as the gem and jewellery sector is rocked by the Nirav Modi scam, the Minister said that the genuine credit needs of the industry must be met by the banking sector. “Exports is a strategic issue. It is a priority for India but not [marked for] priority sector lending for the banking sector. This is a complete paradox. I have asked RBI Governor to treat exports as priority sector [for] lending.”
He added that India’s exports in 2017-18 were the highest in six years, and exports had been growing at a higher rate the last few months. He said that if this trend continued, India may be able to register record exports growth in 2018-19.

Grab for the locks
"," Greek mythology has a character named Caerus. He is the youngest son of Zeus, and is the personification of things like opportunity and luck. Caerus, also known as Kairos, is usually depicted being on tiptoes, with wings on his feet. This is to indicate how fleeting and ephemeral opportunity usually is. Caerus is also depicted with a very unusual hairstyle. Think of it as a radically reversed version of a mullet, a hairstyle famously described as “business at the front, party at the back”. 
Caerus had hair on his forehead, the sort that covers his face, not allowing people to recognise him easily, but was bald at the back. The moral was clear. If you had to prosper, you had to grab opportunity by the forelock, for once it fleet-footedly goes past you, there will be nothing for you to grab it by. 
As with anything else where luck can play a significant part, being successful at starting up is of course much like trying to grab Caerus by his forelock. But the real fun in entrepreneurship lies in two things. One, how do you recognise Caerus despite all that hair obscuring his face? And two, how do you still grab Caerus if you miss grabbing him by the forelocks?
There is a flaw in this otherwise excellent parable of Caerus’ hairstyle. It assumes that the only way to recognise Caerus is by sight. It is not all that horrible an assumption, given how most people depend on sight for recognition. But those who wish to start up, should know that their best chance lies in recognising Caerus even with his face covered. They should be able to smell him coming. Or know the sounds of his footsteps, as slight as they may be, so well, that they hear him coming. 
If you are an entrepreneur in food-tech, possibly even know what Caerus tastes like. And there is only one way this can happen. A lot of observation, and then importantly, letting all that observation inform your intuition. So if you plan to start up, once you have figured out the field of human endeavour you plan to address, just observe. A lot. Identify every player in that ecosystem. Know exactly how each of those players interact with each other. Keep looking for inefficiencies in these interactions. That is usually where Caerus is hiding, unrecognisable to an untrained eye. But you should be able to sniff him out in complete darkness even. 
Of course, more often than not, despite all this observation, Caerus being the master of camouflage that he is, you will fail to grab him, and only see his bald pate as he runs away from you. Here’s where the other skill that is very necessary for entrepreneurs comes of use. Patience. Fine, you missed him as he went past you. But the world being round, he will be back. You may miss him the second time too. But you now have new crucial information. You know the speed at which he is running. You may have to let Caerus run past you a few more times, before you are confident about his patterns. But once you are, all you have to do is to just stand in the way of opportunity, in a way that there is no way it can go past you. Grab Caerus, forelock and all, and prosper. 
That really is the true charm of startups. Unlike the rest of life, opportunity is more than just a slippery bald man who is hard to recognise.

Vedanta Resources recommends offer to take company private
","Anil Agarwal’s efforts to take Vedanta Resources private moved a step forward on Tuesday, as the company said it would be recommending the $1.028 billion offer for the share capital not currently owned by Volcan Investments.
Following the grant of an extension of a deadline, in order to continue discussions with lenders, Vedanta Resources and Volcan Investments – the holding company wholly owned by Mr. Agarwal’s discretionary trust – outlined details of the recommended cash offer of £8.25 a share, which is a near 28% premium on the closing price of Vedanta Resources on the Friday before the offer was first announced on July 2. The offer was for the 33.47% stake that Volcan Investments doesn’t already own, and values the whole company at $3.07 billion.
Mr. Agarwal said the acquisition of the remaining shares was a “natural progression” for the company and that while a London listing had served the company “extremely well” since 2003, it was no longer necessary for the company to achieve its “strategic objectives.”
In addition to representing an attractive premium, the offer in cash provided certainty, while investors would still be able to reinvest the proceeds in Vedanta Limited, where the majority of the group’s profits and cash flow were generated, either through shares in India, or American Depository Receipts in New York, Volcan Investments said.
“This is an attractive offer for independent Vedanta Shareholders,” said Deepak Parekh, the chairman of the independent committee that reviewed the offer. “It secures delivery of future value today in cash, whilst providing shareholders with the ability, should they choose, to retain exposure to the Vedanta Group growth story by reinvesting all or part of their offer proceeds in Vedanta Limited.” The increased maturity and liquidity of the Indian markets had “diminished the rationale” for maintaining a U.K. entity, he added.

Orient Refractories to merge RHI India and RHI Clasil with itself
","RHI Magnesita, a leading global supplier of refractory products, systems and services based in the U.K., has decided to consolidate its Indian operations under Orient Refractories Limited, as it sees significant growth potential for its refractory products and services in India.
The board of Orient Refractories, RHI India Private Limited (RHI India) and RHI Clasil Private Limited (RHI Clasil), at their respective meetings, approved the proposal to merge RHI India and RHI Clasil with Orient Refractories, making it a leading manufacturer and supplier of refractories with operating revenues of ₹1,235 crore, two production facilities, and more than 700 employees.
Following completion of the merger and subject to receipt of necessary approvals, Orient Refractories will be renamed to RHI Magnesita India Limited, which will combine the strengths and competencies of all three operating companies in India under one strong listed company that is well positioned to leverage future growth opportunities and enhance shareholder value, the company said in a statement.
RHI Magnesita owns 69.6% in Indian listed Orient Refractories, a leading manufacturer and supplier of special refractory products, systems and services for the steel industry. RHI India, a wholly owned subsidiary of RHI Magnesita, is the Indian sales company offering a full range of refractories and related services sourced from various RHI Magnesita group entities to Indian customers. RHI Magnesita owns 53.7% in RHI Clasil, a manufacturer and supplier of mainly alumina based refractories for the steel and cement industries.
Commenting on the merger, Mr. Parmod Sagar, MD & CEO, Orient Refractories, said “The merger will strengthen our position, significantly expand our product offerings and sales platform to access a much larger client base and allow for a pooling of resources and know-how. We believe that this will act as a strong platform from which we can embark on the next phase of our growth and unlock significant value for the shareholders.” 
As consideration for the merger, fresh equity shares of Orient Refractories will be issued to the shareholders of RHI India and RHI Clasil, thus increasing the the equity shares of Orient Refractories from 120.1 million to about 161 million. About 7,044 equity shares of Orient Refractories (of face value of ₹1 each) will be issued for every 100 equity shares of RHI India (of face value of ₹10 each).
Similarly, 908 equity shares of Orient Refractories (of face value of ₹1 each) will be issued for every 1,000 equity shares of RHI Clasil (of face value of ₹10 each). Post merger, the shareholding of RHI Magnesita, through Dutch US Holding B.V. and other group companies, in the combined company is likely to be around 70%. Furthermore, around 5% of the shareholding will be held by certain individual shareholders of RHI Clasil who are not part of the RHI Magnesita group, said the statement. 
Shares of Orient Refractories rose 0.75% to close at ₹209.15 in a firm Mumbai market on Tuesday, valuing the company at ₹2,512 crore.

Madras HC reserves order in directors’ disqualification case "," With the Madras High Court reserving its order in the directors’ disqualification case, corporate India is keeping its fingers crossed.
Justice T. Raja of the Madras High Court last week heard the final arguments in the case which saw a spate of writ petitions challenging the order of the Registrar of Companies (ROCs) disqualifying directors of private companies for non-filing of financial statements for a period of three continuous financial years.
These petitions focussed their challenge on how the three continuous financial years should be calculated.
The Madras High Court was the first to grant a stay in September. Since then, more parties had filed writ petitions. The High Court had also heard the counter-arguments by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs.
The writ petitions were filed challenging the order on disqualification of directors under Section 164(2)(a) of the Companies Act, 2013.
Initially, a list of disqualified directors numbering 45,657 of various firms with effect from November 1, 2016 was released. An updated list later saw the number reduced to 34,565. 
The calculation of three continuous financial years has become the fulcrum of focus in this instance. If one were to go by Section 274(1)(g) of the 1956 Act, which came into effect from December 13, 2000, it means “three financial years commencing on and after the first day of April, 1999.” The new Section 164(2)(a) of the 2013 Act, however, uses the words “for any continuous period of three financial years.” So, the definition of the financial years itself has become the subject matter of argument in this case.
According to Section 2(41) of the 2013 Act, it is argued ‘financial year’ in relation to any company “means the period ending on the 31st day of March every year, and where it has been incorporated on or after the first day of January of a year, the period ending on the 31st day of March of the following year.”
Since Section 164 was made effective only from January 1, 2014, the first financial year for the purpose of Section 164 of the 2013 Act would between April 1, 2014 and March 31, 2015. 
“Accordingly, the second and third financial years would be the years ended 31/3/2016 and 31/3/2017,” it is argued.
‘October 2017 as trigger’
They also cited provisions related to holding of annual meetings and time limits given thereafter for filing annual returns and the like. 
Given all these, the disqualification could get triggered only on or after October 30, 2017 if a firm fails to file annual forms for three financial years, it is argued.

Srikalahasti Pipes net down on technical snag
","Srikalahasti Pipes Ltd., formerly known as Lanco Industries Ltd., has posted lower net profit at ₹17.29 crore for the first quarter ended June 30, 2018 against ₹36.44 crore for the corresponding year-earlier period due to a technical issue in mini blast furnace since May 18, said a top official. 
During the period under review, the firm’s revenue from operations dropped to ₹309.04 crore from ₹446.68 crore in the year earlier period.
“The [technical] issue has since been addressed after shutting down the plant for about 12 days during June 2018, resulting in lower production and higher cost,” said G.S. Rathi, whole time director, Srikalahasti Pipes Ltd. “The profit was further affected by the increase in the main raw materials such as coal, iron ore and ferro silicon prices.”
While expressing optimism that the loss of production would be compensated in the coming quarters due to healthy order book, he said post relining, the operations of MBF had stabilised and the company was running efficiently. 
He also said it was decided to replace the existing MBF by installing a new mini blast furnace to have liquid metal capacity of over 1,000 tonnes per day in the existing location. The same would be synchronised with existing facilities.
To utilise the surplus liquid metal available from the new MBF, the company has decided to install facilities for manufacturing of small dia ductile iron pipe capacity of 1 lakh tonnes per annum. 
As regards the proposed ferro alloys project, he said pre-project start-up activities were going on and the project was expected to commence in the current quarter.

Coal use to rise on power uptick: Crisil
","Consumption of non-coking coal is forecast to climb to 1,076 million tonnes in fiscal 2023, from 826 million tonnes in fiscal 2018, Crisil Research said in a report. 
In a sectoral study, Crisil Research also said that non-coking coal imports would decline to 145 million tonnes in fiscal 2023 from 162 million tonnes in fiscal 2018. However, this would be due to lower imports by non-power sector which has seen improved domestic supply after linkage auctions. Overall, the power sector, with improved plant load factors, has driven domestic coal consumption. 
On coking coal, the report said that imports would remain high as domestic supply of metallurgical coking coal is estimated at 19 million tonnes against a demand of 65 million tonnes in FY23.
Global coking coal prices are expected to soften but still be dear at about $ 190 to $200 per tonne this year according to the Crisil analysis, noting a worldwide revival in steel demand. Production too is expected to improve led by resumption of coal mines which were closed earlier and resolution of transport bottlenecks in some of the mining countries. However, these easing of supply constraints may lead to prices dropping to about $175 to $185 per tonne next year, Crisil Research said.
It said that Coal India is expected to increase its output through increased production from large blocks. 
Domestic non-coking coal prices would be governed by linkage prices, auction of linkages and spot auctions. Edelweiss Research said that robust international prices will support CIL’s e-auction premium amid a demand uptick in both power and non-power sectors.

Drop a pin
"," In 2013, Chris Sheldrick was working as a concert organiser. It was a thankless job. It mostly involved getting various concert equipment to a venue on time. On paper, this should not have been anything more than just another thankless grunt job. But there was something that made it worse. The concerts were almost always at some obscure venue, and trying to get to them based on just the address provided was the equivalent of solving a rather hard chess problem. Like white to win in two moves with just a king and two blocked pawns. Sheldrick quickly got frustrated about how horrible addresses were in the USA.
Before I tell you what Sheldrick did about his frustration, let me digress a bit, and tell you that addresses in India were even worse. For some 15 years of my childhood, for as long as I lived at 15/32, 2nd Main, Marenahalli, there was another 15/32 in Marenahalli, on another road that was also 2nd Main, and pretty much right behind our house as the crow flies, but some 500 metres if the crow decided to walk on roads. For some 15 years, the two households had to exchange snail mail every now and then, as whenever the regular postman who knew the nuance was off duty, mix-ups were bound to happen. To cut a long story short, Sheldrick’s problem was not just US-specific, but something that would find resonance the world over.
Sheldrick discussed his problem with Mohan Ganesalingam, an American resident, but his name tells you where he came from. And they came up with an idea that would elegantly solve the problem of addresses. They joined hands with two more people, Jack Waley-Cohen, and Michael Dent, and very soon what3words was born. The premise of what3words was that any geographic location on Earth could be expressed uniquely by a random combination of three words. Once that was done, all one had to do was remember three words instead of a confusing address. And this triplet of words would be linked to a lat-lon, making it easy to use any sort of a map app to guide yourself accurately to the location.
What3words may have been the first to come up with this excellent solution, but there soon were many others improving upon the idea. One such was a friend of mine, J Krishnamurthy, who, bored with being a Google employee, came up with Pyntag. It was just like the what3words idea, but instead allowed users to come up with their own unique ‘addresses’. So instead of some machine-generated TomDickHarry, you could have claimed ThejaswiUdupaHome for your residential address if you wanted to. It took a good idea and made it better. Some half a dozen others also did.
This was one of those ideas that had a lot of utility, and could even easily scale. But just because there was never really any clear way of making money off this brilliant idea, it refused to take off. This is probably because the whole idea rested on Google Maps, and on top of it, there was no clear route for ever earning revenue. And so, the investors stayed away — from one of the best ideas of our generation.
And now, with the full support and benevolence of Google Maps, we have plus.codes — the same idea as what3words, the same idea as pyntag. But it is by Google.
Despite all that Google has done to underplay their involvement with plus.codes, this whole incident teaches startups, especially those that definitely solve a problem without making money, a most definite lesson.

Centre moots overseas UDAN ","State governments will be able to encourage tourism on preferred international air routes by offering subsidy to domestic airlines for a period of three years. The Ministry of Civil Aviation has prepared a draft scheme document for “UDAN International” and invited comments from stakeholders till September 4.
The scheme is designed for State governments that are keen to promote air connectivity on international routes identified by them and for which they are willing to provide subsidy to airlines. 
As per the draft, a State will identify international routes for which the Airports Authority of India (AAI) will determine a subsidy amount per seat and invite bids from domestic carriers. This will be followed by airlines submitting their proposals, which will include the routes they wish to connect as well as the subsidy needed by them.
The airlines will bid on the percentage of flight capacity for which they require financial assistance, provided that the figure doesn’t exceed 60% of the flight capacity. The entity that quotes the lowest amount will be awarded subsidy for a particular route. 
However, the government will grant financial aid only for the actual number of passenger seats that are unsold, even if the airline had sought subsidy for a higher percentage of seating capacity at the time of bidding.
No cap on fares
An airline that is awarded a particular route will have exclusive rights to a subsidy on that route for a period of three years. The key difference between this scheme and the regional connectivity scheme (RCS) for domestic routes is that there is no capping of fares. Under RCS, fares are capped at ₹2,500 for one hour of flight on a fixed wing aircraft in order to make air travel affordable, which was why the scheme was called Ude Desh Ka Aam Nagrik (UDAN).
“When we look at international connectivity, we are looking at people with disposable incomes looking to undertake air travel for the purpose of tourism,” a source said, explaining the rationale behind not capping fares. The financial assistance to an airline will be offered from the International Air Connectivity Fund (IACF), which will be created through the contributions made by the State government.
The scheme is meant for domestic airlines. Only fixed wing aircraft with more than 70 seats can be operated under the scheme and airlines will have to conduct a minimum of three and a maximum of seven departures on a given route on three days in a week.
The Centre has allowed airlines to enter into a code-sharing arrangement with international and domestic airlines for UDAN international. The AAI may also offer additional discounts at its own discretion such as landing, parking and housing charges at airports owned by it.
So far, Assam has proposed to offer ₹100 crore per year for flights to Kathmandu, Dhaka, Singapore, Bangkok, Kuala Lumpur and Yangon. Andhra Pradesh has also expressed its keenness to the Civil Aviation Ministry to encourage tourism. 
At present, the low-cost carrier AirAsia operates daily flights to Kuala Lumpur from Bhubaneshwar with a subsidy from the State government on a per-flight basis.

SEBI’s MF reclassification hits small cap universe "," The capital markets regulator’s decision last year to reclassify mutual fund schemes to help bring uniformity in investment strategy and asset allocation seems to have made the small cap universe a big casualty, with a bulk of the mutual fund flows going into large and mid caps.
An analysis by domestic brokerage Prabhudas Lilladher has found that between January and June, when mutual fund houses churned their portfolios to comply with the new regulatory guidelines, mid cap and large cap stocks witnessed net buying of ₹14,500 crore and ₹21,900 crore, respectively. The same period saw net buying of a paltry ₹22 crore in small cap stocks.
This assumes significance as the period prior to the churn saw net inflows of ₹5,650 crore in small cap stocks, while large and mid caps reported net inflows of ₹8,170 crore and ₹14,320 crore, respectively.
“Our analysis indicates that small caps bore the brunt almost entirely due to the SEBI circular on mutual fund reclassifications while for mid caps, the subsequent changes to Nifty Midcap index apart from the SEBI circular caused a vast rotation between stocks,” the brokerage said.
Money flows
“Money flows continued into mid caps, while small caps were abandoned and within mid caps, the index exclusions were sold into while the new incoming ones/ones in status quo were bought into substantially,” it added. While SEBI issued the MF reclassification circular on October 6, 2017, the NSE issued a circular on index replacement on February 21, to become effective from April 2. The NSE move led to 46 stocks being replaced in the Nifty Midcap 100 index.
Interestingly, this also explains the rally this year with benchmarks touching new highs even as broader indices are way off their highs touched in January. While the benchmark Sensex has gained more than 12% in the current calendar year, the BSE Midcap and BSE Smallcap indices are down 7.10% and 11.80% respectively.

‘Creditors have recovered over ₹50,000 cr. under IBC’ ","M.S. Sahoo, chairperson of Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (IBBI) talks about the success of the IBC process, challenges and the way forward. Edited excerpts: 
What’s the status of resolution of cases under the IBC in terms of resolution? 
I don’t have the exact figures. I think about 40 corporate debtors... the process has yielded resolutions. In this 40, the creditors have got over ₹50,000 crore or so. The average realisation has been above 50%. The operational creditors have also got 50%. 
Are corporates undermining the IBC’s 270-day deadline by moving the courts?
If somebody has a right and thinks that he can establish his right by going to the court, we should not be aggrieved. That’s why we have court system in the country to sort out the differences. It’s not a cause for concern that people are going to court and courts are entertaining them. Is it that 100% of the cases are going to court and getting delayed? 
Our experience suggests that very few, say 20 out of 1,000 cases, have gone to court. Number of cases going through lengthy court process is very less. 
But, isn’t it delaying the overall resolution process? 
We have seen from our experience that issues that have gone to NCLT, NCLAT and Supreme Court have been sorted out by the Supreme Court forever. Last week, we saw Supreme Court order in the case of Jaypee Infra, which was about Section 29 (A) and home buyers. Then, there was an order on the scope of moratorium on the corporate guarantors in the SBI vs Ramakrishna case. I am referring to these two issues because they are dealing with the law which came in the last ordinance on June 6 and is yet to become an Act. 
Even at this stage, the Supreme Court has dealt with provisions of the ordinance in these two orders, so this is the speed at which the courts are working. 
Is it just a perception that no one is willing to take responsibility, with the RP passing it to CoC, CoC to NCLT, NCLT to NCLAT and NCLAT to SC? 
No, it’s not that NCLT passes on to NCLAT and NCLAT to SC. NCLT takes a view and those who are aggrieved appeal to NCLAT and those who are aggrieved, appeal again to SC. 
But you have to look at the data, what is the percentage of orders challenged at NCLAT, it’s about 5-7%. Again what’s the percentage of cases challenged at SC? It’s about 20-30%. You have to see it in totality. Some high profile cases create much more noise, but besides these, big cases also are getting resolved. 
Does the NCLT’s acceptance of bids after closure of deadlines not hurt the sanctity of the IBC process?
You should ask that question to NCLT or whoever does it. 
There were some instances in the past. You should look at the regulatory provisions and the amendments made on July 4 to the IBC regulations. 
It very categorically states that the process, including the timeline and that plan received outside the system will not be considered. As we learnt from experience, we are trying to avoid those problems either by making laws, or SC sorts it out. 
NCLT courts are not fully equipped to deal with such a large number of insolvency cases coming in. How do you address this concern?
It is not in the domain of the IBBI. We have seen that NCLT capacity is being increased over time. Today, we have 12 benches and new benches are being set up in Jaipur and Cuttack. Recruitment process has started to recruit more judges. Efforts are on to take new premises in New Delhi and Mumbai. 
The progress in on and the government is taking efforts to create capacity to meet the number of cases.

‘Weak rupee may hit CAD by 10-20 bps’
","The Centre expects minimal impact to the current account deficit of about 10-20 basis points due to the rupee depreciation and an increase in the oil import bill, a senior Finance Ministry official said.
“There are times when you have to pay more for oil and in the short term the CAD could be stressed slightly,” the official said. “But oil prices are not showing signs of any great fluctuations and so the CAD will not be as bad as forecast. It will be about a 10-20 basis point impact.”
Moody’s had earlier this week estimated that higher oil prices coupled with the rupee depreciation would widen the current account deficit to 2.5% of GDP.
“Dollar has been appreciating against all other currencies, not just the rupee,” the official added. The rupee, on the other hand, has remained stable in relation to other currencies apart from the U.S. dollar, he noted.

Trade deficit greater concern than rupee, says NITI chief
","NITI Aayog Vice-Chairman Rajiv Kumar said on Tuesday that he was more concerned about the rising trade deficit than the falling rupee, and called for efforts to push exports.
“I don’t believe in strong rupee... Rupee should remain in its natural value, some countries depreciate their currency deliberately, this is wrong. It will be very difficult for India to try and push up the rupee,” Mr. Kumar said at an event organised by industry body CII.
“There is a constituency that benefits from strong rupee...The constituency should be put on back foot,” he added. The rupee on August 16 had slumped to life-time low of 70.32 on strong demand for the U.S. dollar.
Mr. Kumar further said that economic policy making should not focus only on fiscal deficit number, arguing that large economies like USA, China and European Union do not give much importance to fiscal deficit.
“Nobody is playing by rules, so we should learn to play as it suits our requirements,” he said.
He pointed out that at a time when private investment is low, then the aggregate demand can be brought up by public spending. He said however that some revenue expenditure can be just be brought to zero. The main worry, he added, is trade deficit. “I think it will be much better to try and push exports, as our share in world trade is low. Even our share in services sector in world trade is lower than China’s,” he noted.

This [manufacturing facility] is the first investment done in Asia Pacific,” he said. The AFS acquisition was the first one in 50 years of the company’s history. 
“With this success, we went ahead and did acquisitions in the U.S. and Czech Republic and Brazil. With this model, they might be looking at other Asia Pacific regions also.”
The company’s solutions are used by network operators, in office buildings, data centres, apartments, as well as in the industry. R&M operates in Europe, the Middle East and in Asia. 
R&M achieved sales of Swiss Francs 232.1 million in 2017, with 80% of that figure being generated overseas. The company is wholly owned by Martin and Peter Reichle. “In India, we are already developing the design and doing the engineering for molds for some customers in Europe. Now we want to make India the global hub for designing of the mold and engineering of the products. They are looking to expand this from India to Europe and India to the U.S. also,” Mr. Ahluwalia said.
He said the demand for the company’s products was primarily driven by data centres.
Rapid growth
The APAC market is growing rapidly with a 25% market share at $42 billion and the Middle East and Africa region hold a 3% share with nearly $6 billion in investments, according to Cushman & Wakefield, a 100-year-old real estate brokerage giant backed by private equity firm TPG.
Digital data in India was about 40,000 petabytes in 2010 and this number is projected to go up to 2.3 million petabytes by 2020, twice as fast as the worldwide rate
India had a data centre capacity of 1.3 million square feet in 2007, which is expected to go up to 10.9 million square feet by the end of 2018 at a compounded annual growth rate of 19.8% (excluding the data centres smaller than 1,000 square feet). Mr. Ahluwalia said R&M will employ 600 people within two years.
“With the new regulation coming into India that data centres have to be located in India, there is going to be a good demand for those in India. The second is the Giga fiber application from Jio. This is going to drive the demand for the next five years.” R&M is also investing in warehouses with a current capacity of 12,000 square feet. “We carry over ₹30 crore of fiber component to meet the demand.”
“All the fiber adapters, connectors we are still getting from our plant in Europe and we are assembling those here in India. We look forward to making most parts in India,” he said.
For the Smart City projects in cities such as Nagpur, Vizag, Hyderabad, Pune, Raipur and Mumbai, R&M has already executed cabling projects. “Few more are in the pipeline.”

Kochhar eyes I-Sec board slot
","Chanda Kochhar, who is in the midst of a probe by ICICI Bank and other regulatory agencies, is seeking reappointment as a director on the board of ICICI Securities, the financial services arm of the ICICI Group.
The AGM of the recently listed entity will be held on August 30, where shareholders can vote on the reappointment of Ms. Kochhar, 56, who has been on the board of ICICI Securities since October 2008.
Ms. Kochhar, who is currently on leave, is facing conflict of interest allegations, with ICICI Bank setting up an independent panel under former Supreme Court judge B.N. Srikrishna to look into the matter.
Separately, SEBI and CBI are conducting inquiries in the matter involving the Videocon group and NuPower Renewables, a firm run by Ms. Kochhar’s husband Deepak Kochhar.
Interestingly, proxy advisory firms are of the view that shareholders can vote for the reappointment of Ms. Kochhar as till date no inquiry report has confirmed the allegations against the ICICI Bank chief.
“Currently, there are only allegations against her and one cannot take a negative view based on allegations,” said J.N. Gupta, MD, Stakeholders Empowerment Services. “Till date, there is neither any regulatory action against her nor there are any findings of the Srikrishna panel. So we are not recommending voting against her reappointment,” Mr. Gupta added. 
Ms. Kochhar serves as a director on various other ICICI Group companies such as ICICI Bank, ICICI Lombard General Insurance Company and ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Company, ICICI Prudential Asset Management Company and ICICI Bank Canada. 
Shares under pressure

India seeks revision in price of gas via TAPI line
","India has sought re-negotiation of the natural gas price it is to source through a proposed $10 billion Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India (TAPI) pipeline due to slump in global energy markets, a top source said.
 The four nations had in 2013 signed a gas sale purchase agreement (GSPA) that bench-marked the price of natural gas that Turkmenistan is to export at 55% of the prevailing crude oil price. This translates into a price of about $7.5 per million British thermal unit (mmBtu) at current oil prices at the Turkmen border.

Finmin to PSB CEOs: check NPA frauds or face action ","In a stern warning to bankers, the finance ministry has asked chief executives of public sector banks (PSBs) to check all NPA accounts exceeding ₹50 crore for fraud, else face criminal conspiracy charges, according to official sources.
This missive comes in the light of arrest of Bhushan Steel’s erstwhile promoter Neeraj Singal by the Serious Fraud Investigation Office (SFIO) for allegedly siphoning of funds.
The sources said that bankers could be held accountable under Section 120B of Indian Penal Code if they fail to report fraud in an account which is later unearthed by investigating agencies, sources said.
If the investigating agencies find diversion of funds in those defaulting accounts, bankers may be liable to face criminal proceedings, the sources said, adding that this advisory is like an extra precaution to keep bankers from getting into legal tangles.
More than a dozen companies undergoing bankruptcy resolution are being reviewed by banks and investigating agencies for fraudulent activities, including diversion of funds.
Indian banks are facing mounting non-performing assets (NPAs) or bad loans, especially at PSBs, which have reached more than ₹8 lakh crore. In addition, several banking frauds have been unearthed, including the ₹14,000-crore scam at PNB, carried out allegedly by diamond jeweller Nirav Modi and his associates.
A senior government official confirmed the development and said that some discrepancies had been pointed out in the case of a steel-maker and a real estate firm among 10-12 companies.
“There were some inputs and lenders who have been asked to provide transaction details of last five years. If required, banks will also undertake forensic audit,” he said. Earlier this month, the SFIO arrested Mr. Singal for alleged diversion of ₹2,000 crore, raised through loans from state-owned banks.
“Similar modus operandi has been used by other promoters also,” said another government official, adding that there had been Intelligence inputs on associate companies being used for similar transactions.
SFIO is also looking into the books of companies which are currently undergoing debt resolution, he said, adding that this had been done on the basis of specific inputs provided by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs. During the resolution process, the extensive audit of bankrupt companies has thrown up financial irregularities in several cases.
In June 2017, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had identified 12 stressed accounts, each having more than ₹5,000 crore of outstanding loans and accounting for 25% of the total non-performing assets (NPAs) of banks for immediate referral under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC). In August, RBI had sent a list of 28 more firms to lenders for resolution by December 2017. “These accounts also have some firms from the second list and those where later banks filed cases in NCLT (National Company Law Tribunal),” said a bank executive aware of the developments.
The NCLT benches handle banks’ bad debt resolution under Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC).
Banks have to undertake a two-year transaction audit when they start the resolution process through IBC. In case there are any issues or specific information, banks also conduct a forensic audit.
In August 2017, the SFIO was given powers to arrest people for company law violations. SFIO is a multidisciplinary organisation having experts for prosecution of white-collar crimes and frauds under the company law.

The falling rupee value should be seen as strengthening of the dollar rather than weakness of the rupee because the rupee has been stable over the last five years against most global currencies, Mr. Sanyal said.

Smartphones lift Xiaomi revenue by 68% ","Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi Inc. reported second-quarter revenue surged 68%, as strong smartphone sales complemented a jump in revenue at its smaller, but fast-growing connected devices business.
Xiaomi, whose cheap smartphones have become very popular in price-conscious countries such as India, said on Wednesday its revenue from overseas markets more than doubled from the year-earlier period.
This is the first set of results released by Xiaomi since it raised $4.72 billion in a high-profile IPO in June, valuing the firm at about $54 billion, almost half of industry’s earlier estimates of $100 billion. The going has not been smooth for Xiaomi as a listed company, however. Its Hong Kong-listed shares have slumped by about a fifth from their peak a month ago on concerns about Xiaomi’s valuation and trading accessibility for mainland Chinese investors.
The results are likely to assuage concerns about the company’s operations.
Revenue for the three months ended June 30 rose to 45.2 billion yuan ($6.58 billion) from 26.9 billion yuan, the company said in a statement. It posted a net profit of 14.63 billion yuan compared to a net loss of 11.97 billion yuan in the year-earlier period.
International revenue was 16.4 billion yuan, accounting for 36.3% of total revenue. Sales of Internet-connected devices, including smart TVs, also grew rapidly.
With its eyes on the premium smartphone market in India, Xiaomi unveiled sub-brand Poco that will compete with high-end devices from the stables of OnePlus, Apple and Samsung.
Poco — which introduced its maiden smartphone ‘F1’ priced at ₹20,999 onwards — will use the manufacturing and supply chain as well as the after-sales network of the Chinese parent.

Maersk’s Mumbai records ‘highest load’ ","Maersk Line said one of its container vessels named after Mumbai set a ‘world record’ by achieving a load of 19,038 TEU, the highest-ever load so far, surpassing the 19,000-mark for the very first time — not only for a Maersk vessel, but also any vessel in the world.
Named after Mumbai
Mumbai Maersk, the second generation Triple-E vessel, left the dock of Tanjung Pelepas Port, Malaysia, over the past weekend and will now sail to Europe. The first stop is expected at Rotterdam on September 5. 
 The vessel, with a nominal capacity of 20,568 TEU, is the newest to enter the Triple-E fleet, in May 2018, and is deployed on the Asia-to-Europe service (AE5). 
“The world record load of 19,038 TEU has raised a new bar for Maersk by surpassing Madison Maersk, a first generation Triple-E class vessel, which reached 18,215 TEU in 2015,” Maersk Line said in a statement.
“At the same time, Mumbai Maersk overtakes all other reported record loadings from other carriers,” the company added in the statement. “The record-breaking load also marks a sign of progress on one of Maersk’s Core Priorities for this year: to make APM Terminals perform again,” Maersk Line said. “Tanjung Pelepas is one of the hub terminals where productivity is currently high, also benefiting Maersk Line in line with the integrator strategy,” it added.

Ujjivan offers overdraft for micro, small firms
","Ujjivan Small Finance Bank, a subsidiary of Ujjivan Financial Services Ltd., has announced the nationwide roll out of overdraft (OD) facility for micro and small enterprise (MSE) customers. An add-on product to the bank’s existing MSE term loans, the facility aims to assist businesses having a turnover of ₹50 lakh or more with funding to meet their long-term and short-term financing requirements.
The OD offered to all MSEs on a competitive interest rate is for a period of one year with a credit limit ranging from ₹11 lakh to ₹50 lakh, which can be renewed on an annual basis.
MSE customers are allowed to pay EMI only on the utilised amount, Ujjivan said in a statement. It also enables MSEs to repay the amount anytime during the tenure of the OD facility to replenish the credit limit back to its original amount, the lender said.
“This offering is aimed at the MSEs who don’t have easy access to formal credit given their turnover,” Samit Ghosh, MD and CEO, Ujjivan Small Finance Bank said in the statement.
Given the requirement of funds for working capital, and sometimes for short term purposes, overdraft limits would help customers to meet fluctuating capital requirements, he said.
“With this facility, we now offer a complete range of formal banking solutions to MSEs to meet all their business needs. The existing product offering of Ujjivan for the MSE customers is in the form of term loans,” he said.

Bengal ties up with bourses to help SMEs tap capital market
","The West Bengal government has signed pacts with BSE and NSE to raise awareness among the State’s MSMEs to tap the capital market as an alternate funding source.
The State has the highest number of micro, small and medium enterprises — 52.7 lakh in 2016-17, employing about 1.1 crore people, according to official statistics.
SME listing provides higher visibility at national level and this initiative is part of the government’s plans to expand their funds base. Bank credit to MSMEs in last seven years is estimated at ₹1.74 crore, according to the MSME and Textiles Department of West Bengal Government.
To start with, the State government, is planning to get 100 SMEs listed on NSE Emerge platform by 2020. Through the pact, BSE will encourage them to tap domestic capital markets as an option for accessing capital for expansion while gaining national-level visibility. BSE will provide intellectual and manpower support in such awareness programmes. About 18 companies from West Bengal are already listed on the BSE SME platform.
Ajay Thakur, head of the BSE SME platform, said that it was a myth that only large companies could be listed. West Bengal, being the largest hub of SMEs, would benefit immensely because of this MoU. Currently, six companies from varied industries in the State are listed on the NSE Emerge platform with total fund raising of about ₹44 crore.

GST fuels warehouse space demand in first half: CBRE ","Leasing activity in India’s Industrial and Logistics space gained 45% in the first half of 2018 to close to 10 million sq.ft. of space as compared with H1 2017, mainly owing to GST implementation, CBRE said in a report.
The transactions were primarily driven by consolidation and expansion initiatives of e-commerce, 3PL, retail, and engineering and manufacturing companies, which together accounted for more than 75% of the leasing during the period. 
“This is as a result of the policy reforms that the sector has undergone in the past two years (particularly the implementation of the GST), as more and more corporates in this sector consolidate their operations and locate closer to consumption hubs, thereby driving demand for larger warehouses,” the realty firm said. 
The average size of acquired space increased from 75,000 sq. ft. during H1 2017 to close to 90,000 sq. ft. during H1 2018. 
Bengaluru tops
The overall demand for logistics and warehousing space was largely concentrated in Bengaluru (25%), Delhi-NCR (21%) and Mumbai (20%). Chennai and Hyderabad also reported sizeable transaction activity and accounted for about 12% and 10% of the demand respectively. Smaller cities such as Kolkata, Ahmedabad and Pune collectively held a share of 12%. “Going forward, we foresee the use of innovative technology solutions being the game-changer for the sector,” Anshuman Magazine, chairman, India and South East Asia, CBRE, said in a statement.
“As the sector witnesses the use of technology, coupled with the government’s reform push, corporates across all sectors would be driven to opt for large, modern warehouses,” he said.
 “The entry of various private equity firms and foreign players in the Indian logistics market would boost quality supply, hence propelling demand. Cities such as Mumbai, Pune and Chennai would remain major investment destinations, with Delhi-NCR and Bengaluru also being on the investors’ radar,” he added.

NSC seeks comment on GDP back series ","The National Statistical Commission (NSC) has sought public comments on a panel report which showed that the economy grew at the fastest pace under the Congress rule, amid a political row over the growth numbers. The report of the panel, constituted by the NSC, was made public last week.
The government has maintained that the GDP Back Series Report 2011 was an unofficial document that has not been accepted by it. The Centre had also said the report was only at discussion stage and its acceptance will be based on wider consultations.
The Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MOSPI) posted the report on its website under the section that calls for comments on draft reports. “The NSC welcomes comments and suggestions on the reports by September 30, 2018,” the commission said.
Earlier, the report was posted on the website’s publication section, which the Opposition Congress cited as vindication of its economic policies.
The NSC said the draft report has been placed in the public domain to facilitate wider public consultation and invited suggestions on that by September 30, 2018.
According to the draft report, the Indian economy recorded a 10.08 per cent growth rate in 2006-07 under the then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, the highest since liberalisation of the economy in 1991.
The back series data on GDP report was prepared by the Committee on Real Sector Statistics. The report compares growth rates between old series (2004-05) and new series based on 2011-12 prices. “The GDP backseries data is finally out.

SEBI to review MF expense ratio limits
","The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) might soon review the expense ratio limits for mutual funds to address concerns related to concentration of profits among a few large fund houses. 
Hinting that the regulator might take a relook at the norms, SEBI chairman Ajay Tyagi said that a review would serve to encourage healthy competition.
‘Healthy competition’
“You would appreciate that from an overall industry perspective, some thinking is definitely required to bring in elements that facilitate a healthy competition in the industry,” Mr. Tyagi said, while speaking at an event organised by the Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI). The SEBI chief made the statement in the context of the fact that the revenue of the seven largest fund houses exceeds 60% of the total industry revenue, while the profit margin of large mutual funds is in the range of 40-50%. Expense ratio, which broadly ranges between 0.75% to 2.5%, is the fee that fund houses charge investors to manage all the expenses of the fund house.
“It is apparent, therefore, that large AMCs have a fairly high market share of the total AUM, revenues and profits for the industry as a whole, indicating a high concentration of the industry in a few hands. Is this concentration due to lack of adequate competition in the fund space? Are such disproportionately high profits due to high Total Expense Ratio (TERs), especially in equity funds?,” Mr. Tyagi pondered.
The SEBI chairman also said that fund houses should maintain an arm’s length relationship with respect to related party investments to avoid any conflict of interest. 
“Some recent cases, the details of which I need not get into, do not augur well with the public service character of the industry and have to be avoided at all costs. An arm’s length relationship with respect to related party investments as also avoiding conflict of interest is the need of the hour,” he said. 
Recently, there were reports that the capital market watchdog had directed ICICI Prudential Mutual Fund to return the money to its schemes that invested in the public issue of ICICI Securities.
AUM growth
Lauding the performance of the mutual fund industry, the SEBI chief highlighted the fact that the AUM has more than doubled in the last five years to touch ₹23 trillion in June. 
“The customer base of mutual funds is also growing at a healthy rate with nearly 7.59 crore folios in July 2018, as against 5.99 crore folios in July 2017 — an increase of around 27% over one year,” Mr. Tyagi said.
Further, the share of the cities beyond the top 15 (B-15) in the overall AUM climbed from 12.7 % in 2012-13 to 17.7 % in 2017-18, he said, adding that the fund houses should now concentrate on B-30 centres.
“I hope that the dispensation to allow AMCs to charge additional TER (up to 30 bps) of new inflows from beyond top 30 cities, would facilitate in further deepening the industry,” Mr. Tyagi said.
He, however, added that the AUM as a share of the gross domestic product is only 11%, while it is 100% in the US.

Sugar export: mills get time till Dec.
","With sugar mills exporting barely a quarter of their assigned quota for the season, the Food Ministry has extended the deadline by another three months from September until the end of the year, according to an official order issued on Wednesday.
With sugar production reaching record highs and the resultant glut in sugar stocks causing a fall in prices and exacerbating the payment arrears that cash-starved mills owe cane farmers, the Centre had encouraged mills to reduce inventory by exporting their stock. In May, mill-wise Minimum Indicative Export Quotas (MIEQ) were allocated by the Food Ministry with the mills expected to export a total of 20 lakh tonnes for the season.
With the deadline to meet their export quotas due to expire at the end of September, mills have only exported about five lakh tonnes so far, according to a senior official at the Food Ministry. The Indian Sugar Mills Association estimates that only four lakh tonnes had actually been actually shipped so far.
The Food Ministry official said the deadline extension was a response to industry requests, as heavy rains had impeded the movement of sugar. With the global market demanding raw sugar, which is unavailable at this point in the season, the Ministry has also allowed mills to sell fresh raw sugar from the next season’s production that begins in October.
“The date of export of MIEQ allocated to sugar mills is extended by three months i.e. up to 31.12.2018 and the sugar mills will have option either to export sugar of 2017-18 sugar season or 2018-19 sugar season,” said the order.
ISMA general secretary Abinash Verma denied that the mills lobby group had requested the extension. He blames a retrospective government condition which meant that most mills failed to export sugar for at least two months during the peak marketing season. “The global prices were at $350 per tonne in June-July, but have fallen to $305 per tonne now,” he said. “The losses are massive.” International sugar prices are even lower than the domestic rates, he said, pointing out that mills would get ₹12-14 less for every kilogram of sugar that was exported.

‘Flood damage may slash India’s coffee output by 20%‘
","India’s coffee production in 2018/19 is likely to fall by at least one-fifth from a year earlier as floods in key producing states damaged the crop and delayed exports, industry officials told Reuters.
Some of the worst flooding in India in a century killed hundreds of people in the southern states of Kerala and Karnataka earlier this month, both of which account for more than 90% of the country’s total coffee production.
“Earlier we were expecting better crop this year,” Ramesh Rajah, president of the Coffee Exporters’ Association of India, told Reuters. “Now we are expecting at least 20% drop in production.”
Severe crop loss was reported in the coffee-growing regions of Kodagu in Karnataka and Wayanad in Kerala, while the Chikmagalur and Hassan districts in Karnataka also reported damage on limited scale, he said.
The South Asian country, famous as a tea producer, is the world’s sixth-largest coffee grower, according to state-run Coffee Board, mainly churning out the robusta beans used to make instant coffee, but also producing some of the more expensive arabica variety.
In 2017/18 marketing year to September 30, India produced 3.16 lakh tonnes coffee, Coffee Board data show.

IT budgets are shrinking because it is mostly pay-as-you-go model now, and there is less capital expenditure required. “Also, overall costs are coming down. Here, the device cost may come down, but the need for building an overall solution which has more components, and upgrading it with more features and functionalities, that is on the rise.”
Global spending on information security products and services will reach more than $114 billion in 2018, an increase of 12.4% from last year, according to an August 16 report from Gartner, Inc.
In 2019, the market is forecast to grow 8.7% to $124 billion. Privacy concerns, persisting skills shortages and regulatory changes such as EU’s Global Data Protection Regulation are the main drivers, said Siddharth Deshpande, research director at Gartner.
A recent attack on Singapore Health Services (SingHealth) network compromised personal health records of 1.5 million patients in the island and reinforced the need to view sensitive data and IT systems as critical infrastructure, he said. A10 Networks, a New York Stock Exchange-listed cybersecurity firm, providing networking and security solutions, is headquartered in San Jose. “Today everybody has realised that PCs, servers, networks, applications have all become commoditised. One can go and pick any of it up, very easily. Now what all this generates is a huge amount of data. This data belongs to the enterprise. “And the security of this data, in terms of who should access this data, where should it be accessed from, where should it be stored, all of this will always be the decision of the enterprise. So what will remain with the enterprise is two things — one is the storage of data, how to store the data, where to store it and in what form, and the second is how to keep this information secure.
“This data becomes information once it is processed, so how to secure this information in terms of security at rest and security while the data is in motion. So for both storage and security of data, the decision will be that of the enterprise and will always remain so. This will not go out of the enterprise. So, investments in these two areas will happen consistently,” Mr. Gangadharan said. He cited an example of an Australian bag manufacturer who made expensive handbags for women. A customer could buy the bags only by invitation. “But, the problem they faced is that the day a product releases on the market, China makes a copy of the same and sells. They wanted to know the leak point. For this, when they dug deep to find out how this was happening, they realised that it was happening from inside the organisation itself.
Someone in the company was leaking the information via email. They ended up plugging the issue.” “This is a threat, and these kinds of issues could happen to anyone. In this case, their exclusivity of having an invitation-based purchase was lost when copies started mushrooming in the market. These are ways in which organisations could lose their reputation.”

‘Odisha aims to be hub of east with port-led manufacturing’
","Odisha aims to leverage its ports as part of a push to develop the State as a manufacturing hub in eastern India that could serve the larger South Asian regional market, according to Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik.
“Odisha is fast emerging as the manufacturing hub of eastern India and we are working towards developing the State into a manufacturing hub of South Asia,” he said on Thursday, after inaugurating two manufacturing plants and laying the foundation stones for 13 units entailing a total investment of ₹2,901.20 crore.
“Our emphasis is to drive port-led manufacturing, anchored by the three deep-water ports in the state along the east coast economic corridor,” Mr. Patnaik said.
The State’s focus is on ensuring state-of-the-art infrastructure and progressive policies to provide a conducive environment for industrial development, according to the Chief Minister.
Mr. Patnaik said Japan would be the country-partner for the second edition of ‘Make in Odisha’ investors meet to be held in November.
“This would provide a new impetus to the relations between Odisha and Japan and open up varied sectors for collaboration,” he said.
The units inaugurated on Thursday included a caustic soda facility set up by Grasim Industries at a cost of ₹110 crore in Ganjam District and Jyoti Solar Solutions solar power plant in Bolangir District.
OCL India, the flagship company of the Dalmia Group, is investing ₹2,000 crore followed by Hindustan Urban Infrastructure Ltd. with ₹389 crore, IFFCO ₹63.55 crore and Jaipur Cement with ₹63.5 crore.

‘SBI on course to becoming profitable’
","State Bank of India (SBI) chairman Rajnish Kumar on Friday said the bank has put its house in order and will like to pursue 10% growth in advances this fiscal, including through some good corporate lending opportunities.
“The field is wide open for State Bank, we have the capability to give small loans and large ticket size loans,” the head of the country’s largest lender told reporters after participating in SBI Hyderabad circle’s CSR programmes.
Corporate lending
 Post the process improvement undertaken in the last quarter, particularly around stressed asset management, the bank, he said, was now in a position to revive corporate lending. “In doing so, we do not want to compromise on asset quality... mindful [of] having suffered so much in the past,” he said.
SBI, which had in the June quarter reported a net loss of ₹4,876 crore on the back of higher provisioning, was on course to definitely turning profitable this fiscal, he said. “Hopefully from September itself the bank should [return] to profitability,” Mr. Kumar said.
This, he explained, was on account of the bank doing a lot of provisioning for bad loans, upfront in March quarter as well as in June. “The intent is take the blows upfront and from September onwards, start returning to normal.” SBI had made a provisioning of ₹70,000 crore in 2017-18 and ₹55,000 crore in the preceding year. 
Consumer loans
Stating that a 10% growth this fiscal, given SBI’s portfolio of ₹20 lakh crore, would translate into ₹2 lakh crore, Mr. Kumar said the lending pattern at present was driven by consumer loans while a good pickup was visible in SME loans. Cement, road, steel, automobile and auto components, oil and gas, renewable energy are some sectors expected to revive corporate lending, he said in response to a query. 
Resolution of cases, either those before the NCLT or the stressed power assets, was bound to reflect on profit. On stressed power assets, he said work with the other lenders to complete the process of resolution for seven of the accounts, worth ₹17,000 crore for SBI, was likely to be completed next week.
“The intent of the lenders is very clear. The process is almost complete... it means there are buyers for these assets. Price discovery has happened... technical evaluation is complete and what remains is the documentation part of the lenders.”
In most cases, there is a buyer and these assets will be sold. The benchmark that has emerged is ₹3 crore per mega watt, he said.

Prabhu seeks report from DGCA on grounding of nine A320 Neo aircraft ","Minister for Civil Aviation Suresh Prabhu has sought a detailed report from aviation regulator DGCA on the grounding of A320 Neo planes due to snags in Pratt and Whitney engines.
The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), has in the meantime, submitted preliminary details on the status of the planes grounded and said that nine A320s – seven of IndiGo and two of GoAir – were on ground out of the total 60 A320 Neos with PW engines with these two airlines.
The regulator also pointed out that the groundings were due to combustor distress, but ruled out safety concerns. 
“There are no safety concerns as such distress is found during routine scheduled boroscope inspections of these engines,” the DGCA informed the Ministry, adding that it was in touch with the manufacturer and no additional measure was required on the issue.
The new A320 neos inducted by IndiGo and GoAir since March 2018 as well as new spare engines have combustors with better life, the regulator said and emphasised that the measures taken by the engine manufacturer had “significantly reduced the engine problems.” IndiGo has a total of 41 A320 neos with PW engines, while GoAir has 19.
Engine removal 
“Engine removals are being planned and coordinated with the airlines as we continue to successfully retrofit the fleet with the latest configuration engines. Some aircraft will be out of service temporarily as they perform these removals,” Pratt and Whitney said in a statement.

In the previous week, the forex reserves had witnessed a drop of USD 1.822 billion to USD 400.881 billion.
The reserves have been declining in the past few weeks as the Reserve Bank is selling the US dollar to contain depreciation in the rupee, which is frequently testing the 70-level against the American unit.

SEBI allows longer trading hours for SLB segment "," To facilitate physical settlement in equity derivatives, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has allowed stock exchanges to extend the timing of the stock lending and borrowing (SLB) segment.
Stock exchanges can set the trading hours in the SLB segment between 9am and 5pm, stated a circular issued by SEBI on Friday.
SLB segment is typically used by institutional investors to lend or borrow the shares depending on the positions taken in the derivatives segment. Globally, insurance companies and mutual funds that are typically long-term investors use the SLB segment to earn interest on their idle holding.
While the exchanges currently offer SLB segment, there is hardly any traction as the equity derivatives contracts were settled in cash.
Early this year in March, SEBI announced the introduction of physical settlement in the derivatives segment. Physical settlement refers to a mechanism wherein contracts are settled by giving or taking shares instead of cash.

Further rate increases best way to protect U.S. recovery: Fed’s Powell
","The Federal Reserve’s steady interest rate increases are the best way to protect the U.S. economic recovery and keep job growth as strong as possible and inflation under control, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said on Friday in a high-profile endorsement of the central bank’s current approach to policy.
Speaking just days after President Donald Trump criticised the U.S. central bank’s rate hikes, Mr. Powell used a research symposium here to “explain today why my colleagues and I believe that this gradual process...remains appropriate.”
“The economy is strong. Inflation is near our 2% objective, and most people who want a job are finding one... If the strong growth in income and jobs continues, further gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate will likely be appropriate.”
Mr. Powell’s comments were not a direct response to Mr. Trump’s criticism that he is “not thrilled” with the Fed raising rates as he is trying to stimulate economic growth. However, the Kansas City Fed’s annual conference is among the central bank’s higher profile annual events, drawing international media attention and an audience including representatives of other nations’ central banks.
The theme this year involves changes in market structure and Mr. Powell used that topic to elaborate on why shifts in concepts like the level of “full employment” and the neutral rate of interest justify gradual rate increases. He said Fed mistakes of the past, such as a misestimation of full employment that allowed inflation to take off in the 1970s, mean the central bank today should not assume its current estimates of those economic variables are precise.
The Fed “has been navigating between the shoals of overheating and premature tightening with only a hazy view of what seem to be shifting navigational guides,” Mr. Powell said. With unemployment so low, “why isn’t the (Federal Open Market Committee) tightening monetary policy more sharply to head off overheating and inflation? With no clear sign of an inflation problem, why is the FOMC tightening policy at all, at the risk of choking off job growth and continued expansion?”
The resolution, he said, is to move carefully.
“I see the current path of gradually raising interest rates as the FOMC’s approach to taking seriously both of these risks.”
The Fed is expected to raise rates in September, perhaps again in December, and continue what it terms “normalisation” into 2019.

Oil rises as U.S. sanctions on Iran cloud supply view
","Oil prices rose more than 1% on Friday, supported by signs that U.S. sanctions on Iran are already reducing global crude supply.
Benchmark Brent crude oil rose $1.30 a barrel to a high of $76.03 by 1425 GMT, on track for gains of more than 5% this week. U.S. crude was $1.20 higher at $69.03, heading for a weekly rise of more than 4%.
“Both crude markers are on track to end a steady run of weekly declines. This is largely due to a tightening fundamental outlook on the back of looming Iranian supply shortages,” said Stephen Brennock, analyst at London brokerage PVM Oil Associates.
The U.S. Government reimposed sanctions on Iran this month after withdrawing from a 2015 international nuclear deal, which Washington saw as inadequate for curbing Tehran’s activities in the Middle East and denying it the means to make an atomic bomb. Tehran says it has no ambitions to make such a weapon.
Iran is the third-biggest producer in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, supplying around 2.5 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude and condensate to markets this year, equivalent to about 2.5% of global consumption.
“Third-party reports indicate that Iranian tanker loadings are already down by about 700,000 bpd in the first half of August relative to July, which if it holds will exceed most expectations,” U.S. investment bank Jefferies said on Friday.
“We expect that by Q4 the market will be dealing with either undersupply, dwindling spare capacity - or both,” it added.
Energy consultancy FGE says it expects Iran’s crude and condensate exports to drop below 1 million bpd by mid-2019.
Market sentiment was cautious, however, after talks between U.S. and Chinese officials aimed at resolving an escalating trade dispute ended on Thursday with no major breakthrough.
Instead, both countries activated another round of tariffs on $16 billion worth of each other’s goods.
“Investors are likely to feel nervous as the two countries vow to step up the pressure,” ANZ bank said.
Economists say a prolonged trade war would reduce business activity in the United States and China, and stifle world economic growth. Despite the trade war, China’s Unipec will resume purchases of U.S. crude oil in October, sources said. Traders kept an eye on North Sea, where workers on three oil and gas platforms plan to go on strike.

Nippon Steel targets India opportunity
","Japan’s top steelmaker Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal Corp. sees India as the most promising market and wants to become “an insider” to capitalise on growth of the world’s third-biggest steel market, a senior executive said.
“India will be the fastest-growing steel market in the world going forward,” Nippon Steel executive vice president Katsuhiro Miyamoto told Reuters in an interview on Thursday.
“But since it’s not an easy market to export due to trade and distribution issues, it’s important for us to become an insider. That’s why we are bidding for Essar Steel,” he said.
Nippon Steel has teamed up with Luxembourg-based ArcelorMittal, the world’s largest steelmaker, to bid about $6 billion for bankrupt Essar Steel, India’s fourth-biggest steelmaker.
But the bidding process has been delayed due to legal battles over eligibility for the bidders.
Asked if he thinks the chances are in their favour in the bidding race, Mr. Miyamoto said: “We have always believed so.
“We have submitted all the documents requested to the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) and we expect their decision by the end of this month,” he said.
World Steel Association (WSA) forecast steel demand in India will climb 5.5% in 2018 and 6% in 2019, becoming the fastest-growing market among the world’s top ten steel consumption countries.
Even so, Japan’s steel exports to India nearly halved in 2016 after India imposed duties of up to 20% on some hot-rolled flat steel products in September 2015. India also set a floor price in February 2016 for steel product imports to deter countries such as China, Japan and South Korea from undercutting local mills.
Since then, Japan’s annual steel exports to India have been hovering at about 1.3 million tonnes, just 3% of the country’s total exports of the metal.
Nippon Steel has a joint venture with India’s Tata Steel to produce cold-rolled sheets for automobiles, but it has little presence in steel used in other areas in the South Asian nation.
“If we can buy Essar, it will give us access to India’s general steel users including builders,” he said.
Nippon Steel said in March it will spend ¥600 billion ($5.4 billion) for business investment, including for mergers and acquisitions (M&A), over the next three years.
That would be up from ¥210 billion spent over the previous three years to step up global expansion.

Handed over to the Institute after completion early this year, the imposing grey building (merging with the rest of the hospital) is slated to house teaching rooms, laboratories, research units along with a knowledge centre.
AIIMS chairperson of media and protocol officer Dr. Neerja Bhatla said: “The building will have an array of facilities including a student and teaching wing with examination halls, laboratories, media cell and an alumni cell. Space is also being allocated for research projects and record keeping. We hope to start using the building for students by July-August.”
The Block has 10 floors and two basement areas, with a total built-up area of 18,463 sq. metres. The building design also conforms to energy-saving norms and will offer space for faculties for various departments including Biology, Anatomy, Biochemistry, Physiology, Pharmacology and Pathology.
The Centre had planned the project and work began on the Block in 2011. This is among the most significant initiatives to expand infrastructure in the Hospital to handle the growing number of students and research needs and to provide quality patient care.
Besides housing the knowledge centre meant for creating a data base for various research activities, including clinical experiences at the AIIMS, the Block is also expected to have a state-of-the-art facility for knowledge expansion.
“The idea is to convert this into a one-point knowledge hub, where both basic sciences and clinical departments will have a common facility of doing technology-driven research in the Institute,” noted a senior official at the Union Health Ministry.
The Convergence Block is part of the Moily Committee’s recommendations for augmentation of infrastructure at AIIMS for which the Central Government has allocated Rs.750 crore.

To dump contractor or not to
","About one-and-a-half years after selecting a company to manage its garbage, the Mangalore City Corporation is all set to take a decision on Monday whether to allot the company the contract or not.
Though the corporation had selected a Mumbai-based company in December, 2013 to collect and transport solid waste from all the 60 wards in the city, so far it has not been issued the work order.
The fact that MCC’s Council, though elected over a year ago, was in limbo is said to have contributed to the delay. The official machinery in the civic body did not take any decision on doing away with the present multiple contractor system of collecting and transporting garbage, implementation of a new solid waste management scheme was hanging in balance.
The new scheme is called three-package solid waste management scheme. According to it the operation and maintenance of compost plant and landfill site at Pachchanady has been handed over to a Delhi-based company under a package.
The 60 wards in the city have been bifurcated as north (29 wards) and south zones (31 wards) under two packages for collecting and transporting the waste to Pachchanady.
The two packages were made to ensure two separate companies are assigned the job. But as the bid of Antony Waste Handling Pvt. Ltd., Mumbai was the lowest, the corporation selected the same company to take up the work of both the packages.
Mayor Mahabala Marla told The Hindu that the company officials have been asked to make a presentation on how they would make a difference from the existing multiple contractor system. They would have to explain about their preparedness, vehicles, manpower and other facilities required to take up the work at one go.
If it was satisfied the company might be asked to take up the work in north zone first, prove themselves and take up the south zone work later.

Growers happy as arecanut prices more than double in a year
","Arecanut prices have more than doubled in a year bringing cheer to growers. Factors such as gutka ban and the rumours on a possible ban on arecanut itself have not affected the optimistic mood prevailing in the market.
D.B. Shankarappa, director, Shimoga Arecanut Merchants’ Association, told The Hindu that the decision taken by the Centre to hike the minimum import price of arecanut and the decline in production owing to climatic changes were the reasons for the sharp increase in the prices.
The price of rashi, idi, api and chali varieties of arecanut, which was around Rs. 130 a kg during the same period last year, is now Rs. 320 a kg. The price of saraku variety that was around Rs. 180 a kg last year is being traded at Rs. 370 now.
The Central government decided on May 13 last year to hike the minimum import price of arecanut from Rs. 75 to Rs. 110 a kg. This decision triggered an upward movement in the prices of locally grown arecanut. The prices of rashi, idi, api and chali varieties that was at Rs. 130 a kg in the first week of May last year reached Rs. 180 a kg by the end of the month.
The growers were under the apprehension that the prices might crash following the decision taken by the State government on May 31, 2013, to ban gutka. However, after the ban, gutka entered the market in a new avatar.
As mixing of arecanut with tobacco was banned, firms engaged in the production of gutka began selling arecanut and tobacco in separate pouches. Even after the ban, the prices continued to rise. The prices of rashi, idi, api and chali varieties reached Rs. 210 a kg by the first week of August and remained stable for six months after.
In September 2013, Union Ministry for Health and Family Welfare wrote to the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India to examine the scientific evidences on the harmful effects of arecanut on human health, with a view to classify it as an injurious substance and prohibit its use as an ingredient in food products.
A section of growers saw this as a first step to ban arecanut. The protests and debates that happened in January this year over the issue again led to the concern that the prices may fall. Interestingly, the prices remained insulated from these developments. The prices of arecanut began to move northwards again from the first week of February this year.
Owing to heavy rain that lashed the Malnad region and coastal Karnataka in the 2013 monsoon, more than 50 per cent of arecanut plantations were infected with kole roga, also known as fruit rot disease. The yield declined by more than 30 per cent resulting in a mismatch between the demand and supply for arecanut, owing to which the prices increased since February. Arecanut merchants here anticipate a further increase of 10 per cent in the prices by the end of this month.

Amazon keen on getting digital content right
","A year into its India journey, global e-commerce retailer and e-reading device maker, Amazon, says that getting publishers to work seriously on India-specific pricing and working with them to get more content digitised is on the company’s “shortest current list of priorities”.
While at present the company appears to be more focussed on its growing e-commerce marketplace in India, Amazon’s top executives told The Hindu that the company’s vision for India includes being able to make deeper inroads into the content business, including the vital education sector.
Grandinetti Russell, Vice President, Kindle Content, said that though it’s early days for the company in India, the short-term plan is focussed on getting the English language digital content game right and in the long-term being able to get books in as many regional Indian languages as possible on the platform. “Even in the English language, we still have a long way to go to bring all the local titles that should be there, and in getting more books digitised. The second is, of course, to make books available at prices that are a good balance between consumer interest and business outcome. Getting publishers to be thoughtful about their pricing in India is on our shortest list of priorities today,” he said, alluding to alternate business models that will be required to be able to facilitate lower pricing for the Indian market.
In terms of content, Amazon has its eyes set on the vast untapped potential offered by the education sector in India. While the company does not yet have a concrete roadmap on this, Mr. Russel said that the education sector offered an interesting opportunity, with professional education such as scientific, law, engineering and medical being potential focus areas within this. “We hope over time to find the right partners in India, and elsewhere to be able to explore this further. There are a few challenges as the content can be complex, but we see it as an important sector.”
He compared what could be done in India to what the company has been able to do with the Ministry of Education in Brazil, where it has used its enterprise education technology Whispercast to deliver textbooks to students and teachers across Brazil. “This could be done in India, and there is vast potential. The solution works on hardware that isn’t ours and so can be widely deployed.”
India is one of the 11 new geographies, apart from the U.S. and the U.K., which the company has expanded into since 2011. While the company does not disclose sales figures for the country, device sales have been steadily picking pace with Amazon selling Kindle e-readers and tablets here. Amazon’s most recent foray into the hardware segment, the digital media-streaming device Fire TV, is yet to release in India.
Amazon remained non-committal on a date for an India release, as executives across the board maintained silence on the much in-the-news plans to unveil a new Amazon smartphone.

“The mandate of FRA will be to resolve failed financial institutions and financial markets infrastructures (FMIs) — other than those owned and operated by Reserve Bank of India (RBI) — along with providing deposit insurance and protection to insurance policy holders and investors / clients within limits, if required at the resolution stage,” the group said in its report.
The FRA should be the sole authority responsible for operation and implementation of the financial resolution framework, including the decision to choose the appropriate resolution tool, except the power to take an institution into temporary public ownership (TPO) that will be invoked by the government on the recommendation of the FRA.
This working group was set up by the sub-committee of the Financial Stability and Development Council (FSDC).
FRA can be set up by either transforming the present Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation  (DICGC) into FRA or by setting up a new authority, namely, FRA that will subsume DICGC.
“The aim of resolution is not to preserve the failing institution, but to ensure the continuity of the functions that are critical for the financial system as a whole and limit any use of taxpayers’ money,” the group stated in its report.
The group recommended that as the ultimate objective of regulation and supervision in India was to protect the interests of depositors, insurance policyholders, and investors, the proposed statute for financial resolution framework should explicitly provide for preference to be given to depositors, insurance policyholders and investors over other unsecured creditors in resolution of failed financial institu- tions.
It also said that equal treatment may be provided to uninsured depositors of banks and claims of DICGC on account of payments made to insured depositors.
To ensure that regulators/supervisors can intervene at a sufficiently early stage with clear trigger levels to prevent the institution from reaching situation of non-viability, the group recommended each financial sector regulator/supervisor to formulate a prompt corrective action (PCA) framework for the institutions under their regulatory jurisdiction.

Wilful bank loan default crosses Rs.70,000 cr
","The wilful bank loan default by 400 customers to various public sector banks have crossed the Rs.70,000-crore mark.
Having released the names of top 50 wilful defaulters in December 2013, the All India Bank Employees’ Association (AIBEA) will publish the second list of remaining 350 candidates on Tuesday.
The first set of 50 defaulters, consisting of a sitting Member of Parliament, a Central Minister and two Padma Shri awardees, collectively owe over Rs.40,000 crore to nationalised banks and the remaining 350 defaulters account for Rs.30,000 crore. In the last five years (March 2008-13), banks’ bad loans have risen by four-fold from Rs.39,000 crore to Rs.1,64,000 crore, and in the six-month period up to September 2013, it bloated by Rs.72,000 crore. At present, bad loans in top 30 accounts in 24 banks stand at Rs.70,300 crore.
Besides releasing the defaulters’ names, AIBEA had sought the permission of the Chief Election Commissioner to debar and disqualify them from contesting the Lok Sabha polls and to declare wilful default as criminal offence.
Talking to The Hindu, AIBEA general secretary C. H. Venkatachalam said: “The CEC did not take any steps to debar the wilful defaulters. We are releasing the list to enable the public to know how many of them have contested the polls and whether they should be allowed to assume office.”
According AIBEA, the top 12 defaulters owe more than Rs.20,000 crore with Kingfisher Airlines leading the pack. Punjab National Bank is the worst sufferer followed by Central Bank of India.

Sensex falls for fifth day in a volatile trade
","In a volatile trade, the BSE benchmark index Sensex surrendered its initial gains to close marginally down by 13.91 points due to profit booking mainly in RIL, Larsen & Toubro and auto stocks on Friday, extending losses for the fifth straight day.
The 30-share index had recovered by over 157 points at the outset and touched a high of 22,575.62 points. Later, it succumbed to profit-booking to settle 13.91 points lower, or 0.06 per cent, at 22,403.89 points.
The 50-share Nifty of the National Stock Exchange fell 1.60 points, or 0.02 per cent, to end at 6,694.80 after touching the day’s high of 6,737.65 points.
“Profit-booking and cautious approach ahead of Lok Sabha election results are evident in the market,” Nidhi Saraswat, Senior Research Analyst, Bonanza Portfolio Ltd.
“Almost flat growth in manufacturing PMI in April, as against previous month, also weakened market sentiment,” Saraswat added.
Foreign funds were seen trimming their portfolios by booking profits at every rise, brokers said, adding that a subdued opening in the European markets also influenced the sentiment.
Maruti Suzuki and Mahindra & Mahindra fell by up to 1.69 per cent at close on poor April sales numbers.
RIL declined by close to 1 per cent while Larsen & Toubro dropped the most by 2.50 per cent among Sensex scrips. Tata Steel too faced selling pressure and lost 2.46 per cent.

Gold, silver prices fall on Akshaya Tritiya day
","Contrary to the general trend witnessed on Akshaya Tritiya, prices of gold and silver plunged on Friday, an auspicious day in Hindu calendar, and jewellers said it was mainly due to external factors.
The spot price of 24 carat gold was quoting at Rs.29,970 per 10 gram in Mumbai’s Zaveri Bazaar as compared to Rs.30,150 on Thursday, down Rs.180. According to jewellers, the price of gold has fallen by nearly Rs.1,000 in the past five to six days.
Similarly, silver prices dropped by Rs.41 a kg on Akshaya Tritiya day. On Friday, silver was quoting at Rs.42,259 against Rs.42,300 a kg a day before, jewellers said.
Gold future price was also tended lower. MCX gold future price was down Rs.35 at Rs.28,545 (10 gram) while silver future was quoting at Rs.41,240 a kg, up Rs.334.
Last year, on Akshaya Tritiya day, gold price had suddenly plunged to Rs.26,825 and over 20 tonnes of gold worth Rs.600 crore was sold, said jewellers. This year, consumption can only be known on Saturday.
According to experts, internationally, gold prices are falling due to encouraging economic data emanating from the U.S. and the U.K. where fund houses and other investors are off-loading gold in huge quantity. This has affected gold prices, they said.
“Gold prices in India are determined by international trend and any festive demand in India can’t make any major difference in pricing. Currently, gold is under pressure internationally as it is no longer a safe haven investment option. Besides, the Indian rupee has appreciated against the dollar and this helped in softening of gold prices in India,” said Pramit Brahmbhatt, CEO, Veracity Financial Services that deals in bullion among others.
He said that this year the demand for gold was less in India as compared to previous years.
Anticipating this almost all leading jewellers had announced different schemes to lure gold buyers and footfalls had increased as compared to normal days, reported jewellers.
“We are having a packed day today and people are buying jewellery and coins. This year light weight jewellery is in demand and coins of 5 gram and 10 gram are being sold in large numbers. Most people had not bought gold during Dussehra, Dhanteras and Gudi Pawda and thus there was pent up demand today,” said Kumar Jain, Vice President, Mumbai Jewellers’ Association.
He said people were buying gold as the marriage season would be approaching in two months. Several jewellers were offering 5-10 per cent discounts on making charges. Reliance Jewels was offering Rs.111 discount on gold prices and a flat 15 per cent discount on diamond jewellery. There were also offers from Tanishq and Waman Hari Pethe, some of the city’s leading jewellers.

Bescom to outsource ‘preventive’ maintenance of equipment
","Though Bangalore Electricity Supply Company (Bescom) has been plagued by reports of its equipment posing danger to its consumers, only emergency maintenance was being undertaken. In fact, Bescom officials have earlier admitted that less than one per cent of its budget is spent on equipment maintenance. And, ‘maintenance work’ generally meant pruning of tree branches and such other work.
Now, the power utility is looking at getting assistance from a third party. Bescom has called for tenders for undertaking ‘preventive maintenance’.
Bescom Managing Director Pankaj Kumar Pandey told The Hindu that the preventive maintenance work, once entrusted to an agency, will be implemented in areas coming under Bruhat Bangalore Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) and surrounding urban areas.
The tender would be granted to an agency by May-end, and the contract will be on the incentive-penalty basis, Mr. Pandey said.
“The third party will be entrusted with the task of ensuring that all equipment is in good shape in the first six months of the contract. All repairs and maintenance of oil level in electricity transformers will be done by them. After this, we will see if we can entrust the task of regular maintenance of all Bescom equipment to them,” Mr. Pandey said.
Soon after the maintenance work is undertaken, a board will be put up on the transformer with information such as the date on which it was done and the date on which the next maintenance work is due.
Apart from this, the agency will also undertake maintenance of high-tension lines and ring main units as well.
Mr. Pankaj Kumar Pandey said that soon the power utility’s new helpline number 1912 will become functional. He said they had requested the government to approve an easy-to-remember helpline number instead of 22873333, so the four-digit number has been given.

HOPCOMS to set up large supermarket-type store in Mysore
","Horticultural Producers’ Cooperative Marketing and Processing Society (HOPCOMS), Mysore, is coming up with a large supermarket-type “bazaar” for farm-fresh vegetables and fruits on a two-acre plot near the Lalitha Mahal Palace here.
Unlike its 43 outlets here, the HOPCOMS plans to give a new and modern touch to the upcoming store on the lines of fruit and vegetable sections in supermarkets and malls. The new store is coming up at a cost of Rs. 20 lakh with funding from the Karnataka Horticulture Federation (KHF).
With ample space for parking, customers can also purchase fruit juices, which will be sold in a lounge, apart from shopping.
The KHF is supporting the modernisation of HOPCOMS outlets. One of its oldest outlets at the city bus-stand here was modernised a few years ago.
Managing director (in-charge), HOPCOMS, K.B. Krishnamurthy told The Hindu that the work is under way to build the store at a farm (previously under the control of the Horticulture Department) which also houses a procurement centre and a fruit ripening chamber. “The proposed store is an attempt to provide more facilities to customers,” he said.
Mr. Krishnamurthy said there were also plans to market packaged fruit juices of private manufacturers at HOPCOMS outlets here to improve their earnings.
“The HOPCOMS outlets in Bangalore have already been marketing juices of private companies and therefore a proposal will be placed before the governing council here seeking its nod for replicating the model,” he said.

Profit

The Mysore HOPCOMS made a net profit of Rs. 50 lakh last year. Despite competition from supermarkets, it earned good revenue, thanks to the support from the department, the officials and the staff, Mr. Krishnamurthy said.
“The staff had no option but to work hard and improve earnings to remain in the market,” Mr. Krishnamurthy said.
Revenue is expected to go up further with a proposal to open 11 new outlets here, he added.
The grape juice sold by HOPCOMS in 200 ml bottles has established a market here, despite competition from private packaged fruit juices. It is sold in paper cups at its outlet at the city bus-stand. With summer peaking, sales of the juice have picked up.
“Only the grape juice is fast moving. We had also introduced mango juice, but it did not receive a good response,” he said.

Copra prices shoot up as online trading takes off
","Commencement of online trading in copra through the Rashtriya e-Market Services (ReMS) has resulted in the sharp rise in prices of the commodity in markets around major coconut production districts in the State.
Compared with prices of 2011, copra prices have increased by 75 per cent in Tiptur market and 49 per cent in Arasikere market in April 2014. All traders in two markets switched over to online trading in February 2014.
The average prices of copra increased from Rs. 6,545 per quintal in April 2011 to Rs. 11,474 per quintal in April 2014 in the Tiptur market, while it moved from Rs. 6,496 per quintal in April 2011 to Rs. 10,200 in April 2014 in the Arasikere market of Hassan district.
Manoj Rajan, Managing Director and CEO, ReMS, said the implementation of the Unified Market Platform (UMP) through the ReMS had contributed to the significant rise in prices of copra in coconut-growing districts. Now, the government has decided to expand online trading to other commodities in other APMC yards.
The government implemented online trading to develop a barrier-free market for farmers. Now, wholesale dealers such as Metro Cash and Carry and major traders in different parts of the State are participating in online trading and quoting competitive prices.
ReMS is a joint venture between NCDEX Spot Exchange and the State government. Online trading was introduced in the State following implementation of the Karnataka Agricultural Marketing Policy 2013.
Online trading helps producer-seller to secure the best price for commodities at the APMCs. The new system has eliminated the role of middlemen and unfair trade practices, he said.
Shortage of coconut yield is not the reason for the hike in prices of copra this year. The Arasikere market received 8,801 quintals of copra in February 2014 against 3,128 quintals in February 2013. Arrivals of copra in Tiptur market stood at 38,000 quintals in February 2014 against 29,330 quintals in the same month in 2013, Mr. Rajan said.
The Odisha government has decided to adopt Karnataka’s model. However, it is yet to amend the Agricultural Produce Marketing (Regulation) Act.

Flat manufacturing growth, drop in core sector industries data, lower monsoon forecast and tensions mounting over Ukraine affected the sentiment.
The HSBC survey for April showed manufacturing sector remained ‘steady’ even as domestic demand made up for fall in exports.
Growth in eight core sector industries decelerated to 2.6 per cent in 2013—14, the lowest in almost a decade, said government data.

Gold, silver surge on wedding season buying, global cues
","Gold staged a strong recovery on Saturday by surging Rs. 320 to Rs. 30,710 per 10 grams in the national capital on emergence of buying by stockists to meet the ongoing wedding season demand amid a firming trend overseas.
Silver also snapped its three-day falling streak and spurted by Rs. 1,050 to Rs. 42,700 per kg on increased offtake by industrial units and coin makers. The white metal had lost Rs. 1,750 in the previous three sessions.
Traders attributed the rebound in precious metals to buying by stockists for the ongoing wedding season demand.
Besides, a firming global trend where gold advanced the most since mid-March as tensions between Russia and Ukraine increased, boosting demand for the precious metal as a safe haven, also boosted the sentiment here, they said.
Gold in New York, which normally sets the price trend on the domestic front, rose 1.5 per cent to $1,302.90 an ounce, the biggest gain since March 12 and silver by 2.6 per cent to $19.54 an ounce, the biggest gain since February 14.
In Delhi, gold of 99.9 and 99.5 per cent purity spurted by Rs. 320 each to Rs. 30,710 and Rs. 30,510 per 10 grams, respectively. It had lost Rs. 195 yesterday.
Sovereign followed suit and rose by Rs. 100 to Rs. 25,100 per piece of eight grams.
Silver ready recorded by a whopping rise of Rs. 1,050 to Rs. 42,700 per kg and weekly-based delivery by Rs. 1,105 to Rs. 42,080 per kg.
On the other hand, silver coins remained steady at Rs. 80,000 for buying and Rs. 81,000 for selling of 100 pieces.

Tamil Nadu and Gujarat finances: some pluses and minuses
","Tamil Nadu and Gujarat, whose models of development triggered a lively debate in the Lok Sabha election campaign, have some accomplishments in public finances, even as the former has better credentials in social and educational indicators of development.
A perusal of the report of the Reserve Bank of India, ‘State Finances: A Study of Budgets of 2013-14,’ published early this year, reveals that in the debt-Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP) ratio and the interest payments-revenue receipts ratio for the fiscal 2011-2012, Tamil Nadu was better placed than Gujarat.  
Also, be it the State’s Own Revenue (tax and non-tax) or in respect of select indicators like the development expenditure-GSDP ratio or the social sector expenditure-GSDP ratio, Tamil Nadu’s performance surpassed Gujarat’s.
The RBI report, an annual publication, presents an exhaustive account of the fiscal position of all State governments.
However, the story on public finances is not one-sided, and there are areas wherein Gujarat has scored over Tamil Nadu. For example, the former had a higher revenue surplus for 2011-2012. Compared with Tamil Nadu’s revenue surplus of around Rs. 13.6 billion, Gujarat registered Rs. 32 billion.  In respect of the fiscal deficit-GSDP ratio, Gujarat’s score was 1.8 per cent against Tamil Nadu’s 2.6 per cent. As for the profit/loss of public sector undertakings, the accumulated losses of the Tamil Nadu PSUs stood at Rs. 596 billion, whereas Gujarat’s undertakings (many of which are in the sector of energy and petroleum) recorded Rs. 16.9 billion in profits.  
 On the relative positive features of Tamil Nadu, the value of the State’s Own Revenue was Rs. 652 billion, while it was Rs. 495 billion for Gujarat. Tamil Nadu overtook Gujarat even in the parameter of the SOR as a ratio to the GSDP. Tamil Nadu’s 11.2 per cent was about three percentage points ahead of Gujarat’s (8.09 per cent).  (The total value of the GSDP of the two States is sourced from the budgetary documents of the States).  
With regard to the relationship between interest payments and revenue receipts, Tamil Nadu’s ratio (10.4 per cent) was lower than that of Gujarat (17.4 per cent). This means that the annual interest outgo on loans is lesser for Tamil Nadu than for Gujarat for 2011-12. Yet, the western State’s higher revenue surplus could be attributed to its less expenditure on wages and salaries and in the social sector, in both of which Tamil Nadu spent cumulatively about Rs. 210 billion more than Gujarat’s Rs.478 billion.  As for outstanding liabilities, Tamil Nadu’s tally was lower than Gujarat’s by Rs. 200 billion. In terms of percentage of the GSDP, the liabilities of the southern State accounted for 19.6 per cent, while Gujarat’s debt amounted to 24.7 per cent of its GSDP.

No magic wand for new government to wave
","The wheels of commerce, to borrow a cliché, have been grinding ever so slowly in the last few weeks ever since the country went into election mode.
Businessmen and CEOs that you speak to uniformly have a single response to any question you pose and that is: “we are waiting for the next government.”
This probably reflects their frustration with the outgoing dispensation and its policies which have not exactly been industry-friendly. Yet, the statement is alsoa reflection of their expectations from the new government. Indeed, a survey report of industry body, Assocham, released last week shows that expectations of India Inc. from the next government are sky high.
“The expectation level is soaring by the day among different segments of the economy — stock markets, industry, trade, multilateral institutions and foreign investors’, says the report based on a survey of 450 CEOs from different sectors such as manufacturing, banking, IT, real estate and finance. The survey respondents expect the new government to bring down prices (inflation), interest rates, create jobs and revive manufacturing, all in the next few months.
Nothing wrong in the expectations at all except that it is unrealistic to imagine that they will all happen in the near-term. There is a clear danger here that the weight of expectations will be too much for any new government to bear and whatever it does will fall short, which will, in turn, fuel disappointment and disillusionment.
The biggest assumption underlining these expectations is that we will have a stable dispensation taking charge once the results are out on May 16. All bets on a quick return to growth will obviously be off if we are to get a wobbly coalition government next. However, getting a stable government does not mean that the economic problems will go away immediately. There is no magic wand for the new Prime Minister to wave and immediately cure the economy of its serious ailments. A strong government will only be the first step in a long journey to get the economy back on rails.
Let’s take a few of the issues that need to be addressed by the new government immediately. Price rise is the foremost amongst them. Rising food prices have proved an insurmountable problem over the last three years. The problems lie on the supply side and it is futile to assume that the next government can increase supply of food commodities immediately.
While foodgrain can be released from the overflowing warehouses of the government, the same cannot be said about vegetables, fruits, milk and other protein foods. Prices of perishable commodities always rise during summer and the first indications were provided in the inflation data of March which showed a spike in consumer prices. With warnings of an El Nino strike this year, the predictions for the monsoon are not very favourable too. This is bad news for a new government inheriting the inflation gift.
Rest assured that inflation will not be tamed for the next few months. Assuming that the new government acts immediately to reform the agricultural products chain and procurement policies, the benefits will begin to be felt only by the end of the next few quarters.
The issue of interest rates is linked to inflation and those expecting rates to fall immediately will obviously be disappointed. The RBI’s actions reflect the sum total of the government’s efforts on the fiscal side and the new dispensation has to do a number of things right before the central bank can be willed into softening rates.
The second important issue that India Inc is waiting for the government to address is the slowdown in manufacturing. Consumption, the most important indicator of economic health, has slowed down visibly and that is clearly reflected in the sales of industries such as automobiles, consumer durables and electronics. The government will have to think of stimulus measures to revive manufacturing such as duty reductions/concessions in the first budget that it will announce in July. Reducing income tax to put more money in the hands of the people to spend is another option.
Of course, given the not-so-comfortable position on the fiscal deficit front, there will not be much leeway for stimulus measures. Yet, the fact is that even if such measures are announced, it will be at least two, if not three quarters, before the benefits are begun to be felt.
Whichever party forms the new government, it will have to necessarily focus on infrastructure growth but here again, the benefits will be felt only over the medium-to-long term. The national highways project of the Atal Behari Vajpayee government was a tremendous boost not just to infrastructure but to the overall economy itself as it created demand for downstream industries and generated jobs. What will be the equivalent project for the new government? Will it be inter-linking of rivers if the NDA forms the government, as opinion polls seem to indicate?
The challenges on the economy front for the new government will be stiff and getting growth back on rails is a long-haul project. Those building up expectations now — including the markets — would do well to remember this.

India, emerging markets need to increase investments
","The global economy has shown signs of strengthening over the past few months and the emerging markets like India need to increase investments, especially in infrastructure, to revive growth, >Finance Minister P Chidambaram said on Sunday.
Speaking at the first business session of the 47th Annual Meeting of ADB Board of Governors in Astana (Kazakhstan), Mr. Chidambaram also stressed upon the need to increase resources of the Asian Development Bank for lending, an official statement said.
“Policies to revive growth in most emerging markets, including India, will have to be rooted in increasing investments, particularly in infrastructure. As most emerging markets are resource constrained, it would be necessary to have recourse to foreign savings for investment,” he said.
There is, however a need to ensure that the flows to emerging markets are broadly stable, he said, adding that the best option would be investment flows with a preference for FDI, followed by a hierarchy of other sources weighed against the cost of such dependence.
“The world economy is a little better placed now than a year ago. Global recovery appears to have strengthened in the recent months. However, we are yet to reach a stage where we can make a medium term forecast of a moderate growth,” Mr. Chidambaram said.
According to him, in the emerging markets that have large net exports, the slowing of growth is due to weakness in advanced economies and there is a need in these markets to rebalance to domestic sources of growth.
In economies not so dependent on exports, there are various other factors, some local, other global, which require more deft handling and international cooperation, he added.
On increasing lending resources of ADB, >Mr. Chidambaram said: “We firmly believe that the fundamental solution for enhancing sustainable level of lending (SLL) to a more meaningful level lies in increasing the capital stock of the bank.
“We appreciate that in a multilateral institution consensus building for major initiatives are necessary. I urge the management to make serious and sincere efforts to augment capital of the bank.”
Of late, ADB has been confronting challenges of portfolio performance and declining disbursements, and 2013 witnessed decline in disbursements under OCR, particularly under sovereign operations, he added.
“Net resource transfer, which is our net financial support to members declined to its lowest level in at least last five years to just over $ 100 million,” >the Finance Minister said.
On the issue of revival of growth, Mr. Chidambaram said ADB being the bank of the region must “respond to these growing expectations”.
“It is only natural that we feel closest to ADB and are most comfortable partnering with them. Our vision and aims converge. A healthy and growing ADB is in the best interest of the region and its people,” he added.
He said the banks’ midterm review of Strategy 2020 is trying to “rightly” shift the focus on implementation and disbursements. Average delay in completion of successful projects is 2.3 years with one-sixth of projects getting delayed by over 4 years.
“This underscores the need for internal reforms, re-engineering of business processes and delegation and decentralisation,” Mr. Chidambaram added.
Procurement reforms are the most needed, he said, adding that there must be focus on deploying staff resources with authority to regional departments and Resident Missions, increased delegation of authority to country offices, progressively higher use of e-procurement, post review of small contracts, robust oversight and well defined timelines for end-to-end processed.
On ABD’s role in India, he said: “While contribution of ADB to India remains small, it nevertheless is quite important.”
Mr. Chidambaram further said: “I am happy to note that as agreed in the South Asia Sub-regional Economic Cooperation (SASEC) platform we negotiated $500 million assistance from ADB for building roads in North-eastern states for regional connectivity.”
ADB is also assisting India in developing the East Coast Corridor from Chennai to Kolkata, he added.
The Minister said India has decided to become a contributor to the Asian Development Fund (ADF) and will contribute $30 million towards ADF-11 in agreed instalments beginning October 2014.

FDI in services sector drops 54% during April-February
","Foreign direct investment (FDI) in the services sector declined 54 per cent to $2.18 billion during April-February of 2013-14 from a year earlier.
Services such as banking, insurance, outsourcing, R&D, courier and technology testing had received $4.74 billion of FDI during April-February 2013, according to data from the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP).
According to experts, foreign investors will move ahead with their decisions once a new government takes over after the ongoing Lok Sabha elections.
“Although the present government has taken steps to attract investments, more needs to be done by the new government,” said Krishan Malhotra, an expert on FDI with corporate law firm Amarchand & Mangaldas.
Overall foreign inflows into the country declined to $20.76 billion during the first 11 months of 2013-14 from $20.89 billion in April-February 2013.
The services sector contributes over 60 per cent to India’s gross domestic product. In 2012-13, foreign investment in services fell to $4.83 billion from $5.21 billion in 2011-12.
Other sectors where inflows have declined include construction, metallurgical industries and hotel and tourism.
Foreign investments are considered crucial for India, which needs about $1 trillion in the five years to 2017 to overhaul infrastructure such as ports, airports and highways to boost growth.
A drop in foreign investment could affect the country’s balance of payments situation and the rupee.

‘Bandhan will show that the poor are also bankable’
","
The IFC (International Finance Corporation)-invested microfinance firm has, in the past, won many awards. However, Chandra Shekhar Ghosh the Chairman and Managing Director admits that he too was not prepared for the giant wave of support and adulation that came his way after the announcements made by RBI earlier this month.

It has been a busy, busy phase since then Mr.Ghosh spoke to The Hindu about his plans to scale up operations and bring Bandhan’s 55,000 clients onto a formal banking platform.

What are your plans for launching banking services?

BFSPL is a microfinance organisation, which is also registered as a non-deposit taking NBFC.
We have been working for over a decade with women, giving them business loans for taking up a host of activities. Our aim has been capacity building and we provide loans starting from Rs.1000 and going upto Rs.5 lakh for business activities and from Rs.1000 to Rs.10,000 for non-business activities such as building a sanitary latrine) and children’s education, among others. We also give pension and there are 55,000 borrowers across 22 states, covering 173 un-banked districts. About 75 per cent of Bandhan’s coverage is in rural areas.
With the proposed launch of banking services, we will cover all our clients at one go and 50 per cent of the coverage would be in un-banked areas. This perhaps will be the largest single-sweep coverage of un-banked areas….

What is the business model you are contemplating?

We have a very viable model in our micro finance business and that model should work for the bank too. The loan portfolio stood at over Rs.6200 crore in 2013-14 against Rs.4400 crore the year before.
We are targeting Rs.7500 crore this fiscal . We will maintain our profitability, which is around Rs.200 crore.
We will need investments in setting up the IT infrastructure and also for the branch roll out, but that should not be a problem.
We have a capital base of Rs.1100 crore. However, initially profit will be modest.

What will be your areas of opportunity?

We will merge the existing microfinance business with the bank.
But our thrust area will be medium and small scale sectors. Reaching the un-banked areas would be one of the biggest areas of opportunity. We will target the poor and the segment just above that.
We would like to show that the poor can also be bankable. Our entire loan portfolio is directed at priority sectors and our recovery rate is 99.5 percent.
As we graduate from a MFI to a bank, our range of services will also expand such as accepting deposits and remittances. As we start taking deposits it should become possible for us to offer loans at rates lower than the present 22 per cent.

You have a sizable manpower. How do you plan to utilise them as you roll out banking services?

We have nearly 13,000 staff who reach credit at the doorsteps of our borrowers. They are in regular touch with our clients and we hope to utilise them to raise deposits too. About 95 per cent of employees are from poor families and rural areas. We have trained them up to their present task. We will, of course, need fresh recruitments at key places and some at senior positions. But I would like to train up these youths too.

What are the challenges ahead?

My father was a sweet-maker and we were a family of eight including all the siblings. My family could not afford my education beyond my Masters. After my father’s death, as the eldest son, the task of running the family fell on me. I started my career with a NGO based in Bangladesh (just across the border from where we stayed in Agartala) and it was the biggest of its kind in the world. After that I worked for several such NGOs. I saw poverty and deprivation close at hand... I realised from the way my mother used to run our home with limited income, that women were the best money-managers. This also inspired me to start my own venture.
I started Bandhan in 2001 with money borrowed from a money lender at nearly 80 per cent annual rate of interest. We have grown year-on-year andBandhan’s client base, its branch network and loan portfolio give me immense strength.
But yes, I do foresee some challenges. And one of these is the integration of this workforce with the senior banking professional that we will need to hire. It may be a culture shock on both sides.

BSNL aims to double post-paid users in one year
","As it aims to double its post-paid mobile customer base to 10 per cent in one year, BSNL has launched a facility wherein bills can be paid at over 5 lakh of its franchises or retailers all the seven days in a week.
The State-owned telecom firm has been citing bill payment problem as one of the issues for decline in its high revenue post-paid customer base.
“One of the reason for our declining post-paid users was the problems related to bill payment. But with the launch of this new facility from May 1, we are targeting to double our post-paid users to 10 per cent by May next year,” BSNL Director (Consumer Mobility) Anupam Shrivastava told PTI.
Currently, 5 per cent of BSNL’s users are post paid as most of them prefer pre-paid due to hassles in bill payment.
Customers had to pay the bills on BSNL’s counters and billing centres during working hours only, which used to be a problem for working professionals.
The state-run company had 9.48 crore wireless subscribers at the end of February 2014.
“The average revenue per user (ARPU) for post-paid is around Rs. 400 whereas for pre-paid, it is in the range of Rs 90-100. It will be good for BSNL’s profitability, if we can increase the post paid users,” Mr. Shrivastava said.
He added the company has attractive post-paid plans but most of the people prefer pre-paid due to bill payment.
BSNL has a network of around 5 lakh franchisees and retailers across the country. The new facility will allow users to pay bills all the seven days and also during government holidays.
No additional amount will be charged from customers for using this facility.
BSNL has been logging losses since 2009-10. The company’s profits started declining after 2004-05, when it had made net gains of Rs. 10,183 crore.
The government had also constituted a Group of Ministers (GoM) for revival of BSNL and MTNL.

Preparing for the budget
","The budget is the most important economic statement of the government. Over the years, it has ceased to be a mere statement of revenue and expenditure but also conveys the thrust of the government’s macro-economic policies.
As everyone knows, the Finance Minister presents the budget at the end of February. This allows sufficient time for Parliament to debate and approve the budget proposals for the financial year commencing April 1.
The budget process for fiscal 2014-15 will be different from any normal year. An interim budget was presented by P. Chidambaram in February. Essentially, in the nature of a vote on account, the interim budget was intended to get Parliament approval for expenditure that will be incurred during the first few months of fiscal year 2015. This is meant to accommodate the election schedule and the formation of a new government, whose urgent task it will be to present a “full “ budget by July for 2014-15.
The new finance minister will be constrained by time. The budget exercise usually starts months ahead of its actual presentation (in February). This time that luxury will simply not be available. The finance minister will have very little time to nominate and get acquainted with key officials who will be responsible for the budget preparation.
All these suggest that the first budget of the new government, whatever be its predilections, would substantially resemble the interim budget of February. There will not be any time to prepare a fresh set of numbers, different from the interim budget. For very practical reasons, the new government will stick to the projections of expenditure and revenue in the interim budget.
Yet, there is something special about the first budget of a new government, which, if opinion polls are correct, will be formed by a political combination that will be different from the one that has been in power for a decade. The July budget will be keenly watched for the likely course of fiscal policy over the next five years.
The very large expectations raised by political parties will challenge the new finance minister.
There is no doubt that some of those expectations are overblown. Like those from the foreign institutional investors who have pumped in large sums of money into the stock market. If the poll results do not vindicate their optimism in a Modi-led NDA government how will they react? Many other sections of society — industrialists and common man alike — clamour for a government which is ‘decisive’. Will such expectations be partially at least met in July?
Game changer this budget may not be but the Finance Minister would do well to lay the framework for a more transparent budgetary mechanism that will involve some honest accounting.
The next round of official national income statistics (GDP) will be available only in early June. The Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) next review of monetary policy will be released by that time. Inflation data — both CPI and WPI — will be released by the middle of this month. Whatever statistics that have been released do not present a particularly flattering picture of the economy although most forecasters think that the economy is on the mend and that GDP (gross domestic product) growth will finally move out of the sub-5 per cent growth trajectory during the current year.
The validity of election-eve official claims will come under scrutiny. Mr. Chidambaram has claimed that he is leaving behind an economy in good health. The current account deficit which threatened macro-economic stability last year has come down to very manageable levels (from around 4.7 per cent of GDP last year it is projected to come down to below 2 per cent).
On fiscal deficit, the government has claimed credit. The Finance Minister has said that on no account will the deficit breach the self-imposed red-line and that the interim budget’s estimate of the deficit at 4.6 per cent of GDP will hold good.
On the face of it, the success claimed in addressing the twin deficits is remarkable. Yet, in both, it is not the actual numbers so much as how they were achieved that matters. The current account deficit (CAD) has come down essentially because of the government clampdown on gold imports.
The restrictions on gold imports cannot continue indefinitely. Already a large portion of the bullion trade has shifted underground. Besides, a healthy reduction of the CAD is best achieved through increased exports and not through imports reduction. It is noteworthy that non-oil imports too have fallen, not a good sign because it indicates a continuing slowdown.
Much will be said about the other ‘achievement’ of the UPA-II government in fiscal consolidation. Here again, it is the quality of fiscal contraction that matters. It is not healthy to cut Plan expenditure or shift subsidy payments to the next accounting period or claim revenues that strictly accrue during the next year.
None of the above blemishes in fiscal management are special to the UPA II’s ways of managing public finance.
Yet, when claimed as big achievements during election time, they do require special scrutiny.
The next finance minister should sift the dodgy numbers from the genuine ones and overhaul fiscal policy.

New Govt should respect Rajan’s appointment: Chidambaram
","The new government should respect the appointment of Reserve Bank Governor Raghuram Rajan, who was selected to head the central bank on the basis of his reputation, Finance Minister P Chidambaram has said.
His comments to Bloomberg on the sidelines of ADB’s annual conference at Astana, Kazakhstan, come amid media speculation that the BJP-led NDA may not be keen to retain Dr. Rajan as RBI Governor.
Dr. Rajan had last month dismissed the talks about his differences with BJP as “media invention”, saying “I haven’t had any discussion with the new government. I think its all press-invented difference. I think it should be seen as speculation rather than any actual differences“.
His comments came against the backdrop of certain BJP leaders questioning his policies to deal with the current economic woes.
During the 8-month stint, Dr. Rajan has >raised key policy rates thrice by 0.25 per cent each.
In an interview to CNBC at Astana, Chidambaram said: “I have done more heavy lifting in the last 12 months than the RBI... I have done what needs to be done on the fiscal side, the central bank has done what needs to do on monetary side. Now we have to address the supply side constraints“.
Answering questions on growth, the Minister said Indian economy will pick up pace and will grow at 6 per cent in the current fiscal.
Mr. Chidambaram said: “We have unblocked a very large number of projects which had stalled... When the projects are completed and begin production, you will see all that adds to the economy.”
The economy grew is estimated to have grown at 4.9 per cent in the 2013—14 fiscal after touching a decade-low level of 4.5 per cent growth in 2012—13.
“As long as we have high inflation how can you ask the RBI to lower rates dramatically,” Mr. Chidambaram questioned, adding “we have to address supply side constraints. (We have to) bring down inflation before the monetary policy can come to aid of growth“.

>WPI inflation in March stood at 3-month-high of 5.7 per cent, while the >CPI or retail inflation too inched up to 8.3 per cent.
Mr. Chidambaram also said that the fiscal deficit and the current account deficit have been contained and investments have started pouring in.
In the interim Budget, he had said that the fiscal deficit would be contained at 4.6 per cent of GDP, lower than the earlier target of 4.8 per cent. The deficit in 2012—13 was 4.9 per cent of GDP.

Rangarajan says CAD to be around 2% of GDP
","India’s Current Account Deficit (CAD) is likely to be around 2 per cent of GDP in the coming few years due to slackening of gold imports, among other factors, Prime Minister’s Economic Advisory Council Chairman C Rangarajan said on Monday.
“With inflation showing signs of decline and gold prices also not rising, the attraction of gold as an asset is coming down. And as we go ahead we should find the demand for gold falling. There are also other factors contributing to improvement in exports. Therefore, I expect the current account deficit to remain around two per cent of the GDP over the years,” Dr. Rangarajan told reporters here on the sidelines of a programme organised by Centre for Economic and Social Studies.
Finance Minister P Chidambaram recently said the >CAD was brought down significantly to $ 32 billion in 2013-14 as against $ 88 billion during 2012-13 and fiscal deficit contained within the target in the last fiscal.
The CAD in 2012-13 was 4.7 per cent of GDP and in 2013-14 it will be only 1.7 per cent, the Finance Minister had said.
Replying to a query, he said administrative restrictions that were imposed on gold import may be relaxed as the prices of the yellow metal are stabilised.
“I think the restrictions that have been imposed administratively will be relaxed. I think the import of gold will come down because of the natural factors like inflation coming down, and gold prices not rising and the attraction of gold as an asset will come down. That’s what reflects in the reduction of gold import,” he said.
Gold and silver imports contracted by 40 per cent to $33.46 billion in 2013-14, or just seven per cent of the total import bill, against 11 per cent in the earlier fiscal, after the government put in place steps to check runaway gold imports.
On the reported likely El Nino effect on the country’s GDP, Dr. Rangarajan said “We do not know what the ultimate impact will be. Sometimes these forecasts also will go wrong. So we will have to wait and see“.
Recent reports predicted inflation in India may remain sticky in the current financial year as a >possible El Nino effect on the monsoon is likely to push up food prices and geopolitical uncertainties are likely to pump up global commodity rates.

SEBI proposes new listing, disclosure requirement norms
","The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), on Monday, proposed a new set of rules, which would require greater disclosures by companies and give more powers to stock exchanges to check any non-compliance.
The proposed norms, to be called SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2014, would need to be followed by all listed companies, as also for listing of debentures, bonds and mutual funds on stock exchanges.
The final norms, which would be framed after taking into public comments, would replace the existing provisions for Listing Agreements that currently act as a contract between a stock exchange and the entity seeking to list on its platform.
SEBI has sought public comments on the proposed norms by May 30.
Detailing the proposed norms in a 74-page document on Monday, SEBI has brought in provisions related to powers of bourses in case of non-compliance by listed entities, empowering bourses to impose penalties on entities for violations, listing and disclosure requirements for mutual funds, among others.
“The stock exchange shall, in case of non-compliance with provisions of these regulations, initiate appropriate action against the listed entity including levying of fines, suspension, freezing of promoter shareholding and the like as specified by the board through circulars or guidelines issued in this regard from time to time,” the draft norms said.
“The stock exchange shall revoke suspension, unfreeze promoter shareholding etc of the listed entity in the manner as directed by the board from time to time,” it added.
The new rules would also include provisions related to the revised corporate governance framework such as requirement by companies to get shareholders’ approval for related party transactions, setting up a whistle blower mechanism, elaborate disclosures on pay packages and requirement of at least one woman director on company boards. The draft norms are also likely to include rules that would require entities to give prior intimation about their fund raising events such as preferential issue and debt issue as well as file an annual information memorandum.
“In order to ensure uniformity in disclosure requirements, the provisions of various clauses of equity listing agreement have also been made applicable to SMEs,” SEBI said. Moreover, the proposed rules may also be made applicable to non-convertible debt securities and non-convertible redeemable preference shares.
According to SEBI, ‘policy changes’ are being proposed separately with respect to financial results “by following a consultative process”. The same would be included in draft regulations once the process is completed.
Meanwhile, SEBI said norms with respect to allotment, refund and payment of interest, book closure date, requirement of 1 per cent security deposit, submitting multiple copies of documents to stock exchange, among others, may not be included in the new listing norms as they are either redundant or would be incorporated in separate set of regulations.

Rupee drops marginally to 60.21 against dollar
","The rupee on Monday failed to maintain initial gains and ended lower by five paise at 60.21 against the dollar on fag-end demand for the US currency from banks and importers.
The rupee opened higher at 60.09 a dollar against last weekend’s level of 60.16 at the Interbank Foreign Exchange (Forex) market.
It firmed up further to 60 per dollar on initial dollar selling from banks and exporters amid capital inflows into equity markets.
According to provisional data from stock exchanges, foreign institutional investors (FIIs) bought shares worth a net Rs 386.95 crore last Friday.
However, fag-end dollar demand from banks and importers pulled the domestic currency to 60.21, a marginal loss of five paise from its previous close.
Meanwhile, the benchmark BSE Sensex ended 41.23 points higher at 22,445.12.
The dollar index was quoted lower by 0.01 per cent against the major currencies in the international market.
“The initial gains were supported by the gains in other Asian currencies against the dollar overseas,” said Abhishek Goenka, Founder and CEO, India Forex Advisors.
The benchmark six-month premium payable in October settled the day at 228—230 paise from last Friday’s close of 225.5—227.5 paise.
Far forward contracts maturing in April, 2015 ended at 458.5—460.5 paise against 456—458 paise previously.

Gold declines on subdued demand, silver ends steady
","Gold prices declined by Rs 30 to Rs 30,680 per 10 grams in the national capital on Monday on slackened demand at prevailing higher levels even as the yellow metal extended gains in the overseas markets.
On the other hand, silver held steady at Rs 42,700 per kg on scattered buying support from industrial units and coin makers.
Traders said fall in demand from retailers at current levels led to decline in gold prices but a firming trend overseas — escalating tension in Ukraine boosted demand for a safe haven — limited the downside.
Globally, gold rose as much as 0.7 per cent to $1,308.91 an ounce, the highest level since April 15 in Singapore.
In Delhi, gold of 99.9 and 99.5 per cent purity declined by Rs 30 each to Rs 30,680 and Rs 30,480 per 10 grams, respectively. It had surged by Rs 320 in the last trade.
Sovereign, however, found some local buying and traded higher by Rs 50 to Rs 25,150 per piece of eight grams.

“In the event of any person ceasing to be a ‘fit and proper person’ or being declared so by the Commission, such person shall forthwith divest his shareholding,” the FMC said in its new guidelines.
Until the shares are divested, the voting rights of such entities should be withdrawn, the FMC said.

FMC tightens commodity exchange investment norms
","Tightening shareholding norms of commodity exchanges after the National Spot Exchange (NSEL) crisis, the Forward Markets Commission (FMC), on Tuesday, said no resident individual could hold more than 5 per cent stake in them and scrapped the concept of promoters and anchor investors for such bourses.
In an eight-page document laying out shareholding norms for national-level commodity exchanges, the FMC said at least 51 per cent of the shares of any commodity exchange will have to be held by the public. This is to ensure broader participation in commodity bourses.
Only a commodity exchange, stock exchange, depository, bank, insurance company or public financial institution can hold up to 15 per cent in such an exchange.
As per the norms, any shareholding in excess of the specified norms will have to be lowered to the threshold level within five years. The previous guidelines had allowed promoters/anchor investors to hold up to 26 per cent stake in a bourse.
Foreign investors will not be allowed to hold more than a 5 per cent stake. The combined holdings of people resident outside the country have been restricted at 49 per cent.
No foreign institutional investor can have any representation on the governing board of a commodity exchange, the regulator said. The revised shareholding norms come into force immediately. The regulator said a commodity exchange needs to have a net worth of at least Rs.100 crore at all times.
“Since commodity derivative exchanges are financial market infrastructure institutions having an important regulatory role, there is a need to diversify their ownership structure and attract more institutional investors. The FMC directed all six commodity exchanges to amend their rules.
Compliance should be reported to the FMC by June 23.

Switzerland among 47 nations to agree on tax data exchange
","In another step towards shedding banking secrecy practices, 47 nations including Switzerland and India, have agreed upon automatic exchange of information on tax matters.
The endorsement of the ‘
>Declaration on Automatic Exchange of Information in Tax Matters’ by 47 countries under the aegis of OECD on Tuesday will come as a boost for India, which is >stepping up pressure on Switzerland to share details on alleged illicit funds stashed away by Indians there.
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the global body that frames economic policies and conventions against tax frauds, said the latest declaration commits countries to implement a new single global standard on automatic exchange of information.
The standard agreed upon by the 47 nations will help clamp down on bank secrecy practices and ensure that they work towards full disclosure of information on tax evaders and financial criminals pertaining to any national jurisdiction.
“The declaration on automatic exchange of information in tax matters was endorsed during the OECD’s annual Ministerial Council Meeting in Paris by all 34 member countries along with Argentina, Brazil, China, Colombia, Costa Rica, India, Indonesia, Latvia, Lithuania, Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, Singapore and South Africa,” OECD said in a statement issued last night.

>Switzerland, long perceived as a safe haven for stashing away untaxed money, is an OECD member.
“The standard, which was developed at the OECD and endorsed by G20 finance ministers last February, obliges countries and jurisdictions to obtain all financial information from their financial institutions and exchange that information automatically with other jurisdictions on an annual basis,” said the statement.
Such a protocol was required between the countries as tax crimes rob countries of their genuine revenues, OECD said.
“Tax fraud and tax evasion are not victim less crimes. They deprive governments of revenues needed to restore growth and jeopardise citizens trust in the fairness and integrity of the tax system,” OECD Secretary General Angel Gurria said.

Jignesh Shah arrested in NSEL scam
","Jignesh Shah, former director of the scam-ridden National Spot Exchange Limited (NSEL), was arrested by the Mumbai police on Wednesday in connection with the nearly Rs.5,600-crore payment crisis.
The Economic Offences Wing (EOW) of the Mumbai police also arrested the Chief Financial Officer of Financial Technologies India Ltd. (FTIL), Srikant Javlekar. FTIL owns NSEL.
On September 30, an investor had filed an FIR against the directors and key functionaries of NSEL for cheating, forgery, criminal breach of trust and conspiracy. The FIR alleged that the accused hatched a criminal conspiracy to defraud the investors and misrepresented that they were investors and induced them to trade on the platform of NSEL by creating forged documents such as bogus warehouse receipts, thereby, defrauding the clients.

Criminal conspiracy

According to the police, Mr. Shah masterminded the entire scam and engaged in a criminal conspiracy with the co-accused to turn NSEL into a non-banking institution. So far, 11 persons have been arrested in the case.
Mr. Shah, FTIL head and NSEL director, as well as member of its audit committee, approved all the borrowers from NSEL. The accused conspired to turn NSEL into a non-banking institution, the police claimed.
Rajvardhan Sinha, Additional Commissioner of Police, EOW, told the press: “Mr. Shah represented to the government regarding the scheme of NSEL, which was nothing but a platform for running a non-banking financial company. Mr. Shah had linked the volumes of transaction of NSEL platform to the percentage of income of FTIL and by this FTIL made substantial gains and improved its brand value in the market which helped in launching of other exchanges by FTIL.”

Custodial interrogation

While the case was registered in September, the police took over nine months to arrest Mr. Shah.
Explaining the delay, Mr. Rajvardhan said, “He was interrogated on numerous occasions. However, he was evasive and was not cooperative. Hence, the need of custodial interrogation was felt.”
The police also said that Rs.5,100 crore had been ‘securitised’ as the seizures had been made under the Maharashtra Protection of Interest of Depositors (MPID) Act. This money will be disbursed to the investors on a pro rata basis.

Charge-sheet

In January, a charge-sheet had been filed against the NSEL CEO, Anjani Sinha, two vice-presidents — Amit Mukherjee and Jay Bahukhundi — and two borrowers of the beleaguered exchange — Nilesh Patel, managing director of NK Proteins and Arun Sharma, film financier and chairman of Lotus Refineries.
Police said borrowers and brokerage houses were on their radar and more arrests might take place.
“Many brokerage houses issued fake warehouse receipts. They had also accessed the accounts of their clients without their consent to perform transactions. These houses are under scrutiny,” Mr. Sinha added.

Sensex closes with marginal gains as ICICI, Tata Motors gain
","The BSE benchmark index Sensex on Thursday recovered marginally by 20 points in choppy trade on value buying in bluechips such as ICICI Bank and Tata Motors as investors turned cautious ahead of the general election results next week.
The 30—share index had recovered by 119 points in early trade on positive global cues following Federal Reserve Chief Janet Yellen’s upbeat outlook on the US economy.
However, cautious investors booked profits in every rise pulling the index down to day’s low of 22,277.04 points.
The barometer closed with gains of 20.14 points, or 0.09 per cent higher at 22,344.04 on value buying in recently battered stocks such as auto, consumer durables and banking companies. The Sensex had tanked over 184 points to close at a 3-week low on Wednesday.
Investors turned cautious and divested some stocks at improved levels ahead of the Lok Sabha election results, brokers said.
The 50—share Nifty of the National Stock Exchange closed up by 7.30 points, or 0.11 per cent at 6,659.85 after moving between 6,688.40 and 6,638.55.
“Selling pressure was seen in the first part of trading day and latter session saw consolidation near 6650 levels as Nifty held above this crucial support level,” Rakesh Goyal, Senior Vice President, Bonanza Portfolio said.

Silver followed suit and plunged by Rs 800 to Rs 42,000 per kg.
Traders said sentiments dampened after gold fell the most in three weeks in overseas markets on speculation that the Federal Reserve would further curb monetary stimulus as the US economy recovers, reducing demand for the metal as an alternative investment.
Globally, gold in New York, which normally sets price trend on the domestic front, fell by 1.5 per cent to USD 1,288.90 an ounce, the biggest decline since April 15 and silver lost 1.5 per cent to USD 19.34 an ounce.

Plummeting gold imports help narrow trade deficit
","Continuing fall in gold imports narrowed India’s trade deficit to barely $10 billion in April against $18 billion in the same month the previous year. Exports grew 5.26 per cent to $26 billion in said month raising hope that the weak export momentum could be improving. Exports were $24 billion in April, 2013.
 Gold imports continued to decline during the month under reference and were down 74 per cent to $1.75 billion. In the same month last year, gold imports were $6.8 billion.
Total imports dipped 15 per cent to $36 billion in April, leaving a trade deficit of $10 billion, according to official data released on Friday.
Prime Minister’s Economic Advisory Council Chairman C. Rangarajan had said in Hyderabad on Monday that the current account deficit (CAD) was likely to be around 2 per cent of gross domestic product in the coming few years due to slowing gold imports, among other factors. “With inflation showing signs of decline and gold prices also not rising, the attraction of gold as an asset is coming down… As we go ahead we should find the demand for gold falling,” he had said.
Gold and silver imports had contracted 40 per cent to $33 billion in 2013-14, or just seven per cent of the total import bill, against 11 per cent in 2012-13, after the government put in place curbs.
 Exports had recovered marginally in 2013-14, but, at $312.35 billion, were below the UPA Government’s target of $325 billion. In 2012-13, India’s exports were just above $300 billion.
 Federation of Indian Export Organisations (FIEO) chief M. Rafeeque Ahmed said in a statement on Friday that the new Foreign Trade Policy should target to increase exports to at least $750 billion by 2019. “This would require CAGR of 19 per cent per annum, and would need major thrust on manufacturing,” Mr. Ahmed said. Manufacturing sector growth, according to the latest available official data, had decelerated by 3.7 per cent in February compared to the same month in the previous year. The Commerce Ministry has already kicked off meetings to gather feedback on the formulation of the Foreign Trade Policy 2014-19.

Don’t buy tall claims
","Everything should have a limit, corruption too. But as seen in the case of Supertech’s 40-storeyed towering plans in Noida, the administrators and builders often play games that home buyers get caught up in.
In this particular case, the builder compromised the green area indicated in the plan and started construction of two 40-storeyed towers two-and-a-half years before the approval—which they were certain of obtaining—came through from the Noida administration. Originally, the plan was to build a residential tower of ground plus 11 floors, which in 2009 was revised to ground plus 24 floors and still later to its premeditated intent of scaling 40.
Imagine the plight of home buyers who thought they were getting the highest floors at 10th or 11th suddenly finding more roofs over their heads. Those who hoped to be perched atop the 24th floor must have been floored by the further revision in altitude. Dark clouds continue to hover over the fate of the towers with the Supreme Court’s stay on razing the towers, providing only a temporary reprieve.
Coincidentally, even as the fate of Supertech’s towers remains in question, the development authority in Mumbai has announced plans to make details of approved building plans available online for viewing by prospective buyers. All plans approved since June 2013 are expected to be accessible. This can spell a big leap in transparency, provided the information provided is regularly updated and complete. It can also put pressure on administration officials to tread cautiously. But alas, if the administration-builder nexus enter into agreements on future alterations, little purpose will be served with even such a measure.
From a home buyer’s perspective, the property market out there is an opaque jungle where you have to be on guard. And the safer option, when buying a home, is to let the big money investors take the early project entry risks and profits, if any, by entering into home purchase agreements only after the final plans are under execution. This may lead to some loss of value creation, but imagine what can happen if the project gets mired in the legal quagmire or worse still gets scrapped.
Better a home than sorry!

Rajan has failed, will have to go, says Swamy
","If the BJP comes to power, its economic policy plans could include immediate cuts in interest rates, elimination of select subsidies and exemption from income tax for individuals other than billionaires.
Former Union Minister and BJP leader Subramanian Swamy told The Hindu that he believes Reserve Bank of India chief Raghuram Rajan will have to go for having failed to manage inflation and interest rates: “If Rajan gets one more term you can safely say bye to all investment and therefore high growth in this country … he’s from [University of] Chicago so he is not fit for this country … there they believe that more free market the better but in India market failures take place and you’ve got to correct for that.”
“We need to immediately drop interest rates … doesn’t mean that we do it in one go … there can be a road map but businesses must know that cost of capital will come down.”
Deposit rates, on the other hand, need to rise, according to Dr. Swamy. “Bank account holders must get assured 12 per cent interest on deposits of three-year duration.”
A proposal to abolish income tax over five years has found many takers in the BJP, said Dr. Swamy, adding it could not be discussed during an election campaign to avoid being seen as pro-rich. “Only the richest 40,000-50,000 … the billionaires … must pay income tax but they must be allowed to deduct savings parked in certain productive instruments from their taxable income,” he said.
On new jobs, Dr. Swamy said, “Agriculture will be the most important industry for a government led by the BJP’s prime ministerial candidate, Narendra Modi.”
“Modi will focus on building agriculture as an industry and will free up exports of dairy products and food grains etc with full backend support for cold storage as there is no other real way creating jobs in rural India.”
The Gujarat model has proved that subsidies can be eliminated, especially in the power sector, Dr. Swamy said. “I am not in favour of subsidies at all; The PDS [public distribution system] should move to coupons encashable by shopkeepers only through a bank account to eliminate leakages,” he said.
Asked why the BJP manifesto does not specifically address the issue of subsidies, Dr Swamy said, “Revolutionary ideas have to be introduced in small doses and cannot be outlined in the manifesto.” The 2014-15 Interim Budget presented by the UPA government in Parliament in February provided Rs. 2,55,708 crore for subsidies or more than a quarter of the proposed total net tax revenue for the Centre.
Dr. Swamy said the loss of revenue on account of the income tax proposal could be made good by the proceeds from auction of natural resources such as spectrum and coal. “All natural resources will be auctioned to mop up the rental income in the economy,” he said.

The guidelines include a requirement for entities declared unfit to run an exchange to divest their entire stake immediately.

Post-2011 SEBI decisions in focus
","Former SEBI board member K. M. Abraham, in his statement to the CBI, has drawn attention to the decisions of SEBI since 2011 when the present Chairman, U. K. Sinha, assumed office.
“After Mr. Bhave and I left SEBI, there were several regulatory permissions and orders from SEBI between 2011 and 2014 that were issued to MCX-SX and directly or indirectly linked to the promoters… Many of them had far more regulatory implications and carried much greater risks to the markets,” Mr. Abraham says, terming it ‘curious’ that the CBI did not select for its enquiry any of the permissions and sanctions. SEBI permitted MCX-SX to start a full-fledged stock exchange in July 2012, and, thereafter, extended its recognition to the exchange in September 2012. SEBI again extended its recognition to MCX-SX in September 2013, a couple of months after the Rs.5,600-crore scam at NSEL came to light in July.
Meanwhile, the Forward Markets Commission, regulator of the commodities markets, found Financial Technologies, promoter of MCX-SX as not ‘fit and proper’. SEBI did the same much later in March 2014.
Mr. Abraham has also hinted at the possibility of a connection between the incarceration of Subrata Roy, Sahara Group founder, on March 4 and the registration of the PE against him and Mr. Bhave exactly nine days later, on March 13. It was Mr. Abraham’s order against two Sahara entities in June 2011 that lead to the unravelling of the group and its activities.

Abraham goes on the offensive against CBI over Preliminary Enquiry
","Former Whole Time Member of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), K. M. Abraham, against whom the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has registered a Preliminary Enquiry (PE) over alleged irregularities in giving sanction to MCX Stock Exchange in 2008, has questioned the authority of the investigating agency to enquire into the decision-making process in SEBI which is a regulatory and quasi-judicial body.
Mr. Abraham appeared before the agency in Mumbai for questioning on May 7 and handed over a 24-page signed statement to the CBI that takes the controversy right into the investigating agency. Dr. Abraham points out in his statement, >a copy of which is with The Hindu, that the PE “runs counter to and flouts the dictums and guidance” laid down by the Supreme Court in its various judicial pronouncements.
The CBI has every right to probe into whether as a public servant he has taken any illegal gratification but it cannot review the decision-making process itself as the PE seeks to do, Mr. Abraham says in his statement. “The CBI cannot arbitrarily wander into the realm of ‘decision making’ of the public servant or quasi-judicial authority itself unless there is at least one ‘decision’ of that public servant that is characterised clearly and unequivocally as defined under the relevant sections in the Prevention of Corruption Act,” he says. The starting point of any enquiry has to be a ‘decision’ and not the ‘decision-making’ itself.
“… this PE instituted around decision making in SEBI… is ultra vires the powers of the CBI and encroaches into the powers of review given only to statutory and judicial bodies,” according to Dr. Abraham.

Leaking of PE

 He has also gone on the offensive against the investigating agency for revealing the fact of registration of PE against him and former Chairman of SEBI, C. B. Bhave, to the media. “By disclosing information about the PE directly or indirectly, the CBI has contravened the principle of confidentiality laid down explicitly in its own Manual,” Dr. Abraham points out.
Directing his angst against the CBI Director, Ranjit Sinha, Dr. Abraham says that Mr. Sinha “appears very casual and nonchalant about the leakage” and his comments to a former CBI Director D. R. Karthikeyan (published in a newspaper and not denied till date) when he asked Mr. Sinha why the information was made public, “Nothing remains a secret these days…” was “outrageous”.
Taking umbrage at Mr. Sinha’s comment asking what was there to be so agitated about the leak of the PE since there have been no arrests or raids, Dr. Abraham says: “… his [Mr. Sinha] comments are to say the least insensitive and outrageous, given that the CBI is toying with the dignity and reputation of people who have toiled hard their entire career to preserve purity in their public life.”
The former SEBI board member, who is now an Additional Chief Secretary in the Kerala Government, has also questioned the timing of the leak on the same day — March 13 — when the CBI raided the promoters of National Spot Exchange Ltd. (NSEL), which is caught in a Rs.5,600-crore scam. Dr. Abraham says that the revelation of the PE against him and Mr. Bhave came as a “handy shroud and useful distraction and a good public smokescreen for the perpetrators of the NSEL scam.”
“The deliberate and conscious coupling of the two issues… prima facie appears to be a carefully contrived artifice to help the perpetrators of the NSEL scam,” alleges Dr. Abraham. “The PE has very artfully and deviously resulted in linking our names to the NSEL scam and to MCX, FTIL and NSEL, which are institutions in the line of fire in the enquiry in the NSEL scam,” says Dr. Abraham.
Wondering whether the PE “originated from the vile design of any of the many powerful entities who were adversely affected by regulatory actions” taken by him as SEBI member, Dr. Abraham ends his statement saying that in the absence of an enquiry by an independent agency, the real reasons for the PE might never come to light.

Stock indices shoot up on election result expectations
","The stock markets were gripped by euphoria as indices surged on Friday to record all-time highs on expectation that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is likely to come to power when the poll results are announced on May 16.
The S&P BSE Sensex surged to close at a record high of 22,994.23 points, a gain of 650.19 points or 2.91 per cent. It touched an intra-day high of 23,048.49, up 704.45 points. The previous high was on April 25, when the Sensex had closed at 22,939.31.
According to a Bloomberg Survey of 19 brokers and investment advisory firms, the Narendra Modi-led BJP may get more than 230 seats while the NDA may get 266 seats, close to the 272 mark.
“There was talk in the market that the outcome of the exit poll was leaked and data indicated a lead for the BJP. This caused buying momentum. As buying picked up and initial momentum started, more people sitting on the fence joined the bandwagon and indices surged to all-time high levels,” said Ambareesh Baliga, Managing Partner, Edelweiss Global Wealth.
“In the last couple of months, the market is purely driven by sentiments and market will rally further as the results will be out on May 16. It is basically a news-and-rumours-based rally. The buying momentum is speculative, as no one knows the final outcome. The results can also throw some surprises and investors should be prepared for this,” said Mr. Baliga.
Experts have advised investors to remain 30-40 per cent (of their holding) liquid so that they can take an appropriate decision after the election results are out.
“Markets are doing pretty good and may rise further before May 16,” said Dilip Bhat, Joint Managing Director, Prabhudas Lilladher, adding, “Major part of the elections is over and the market is sensing that there will be a decisive government. This is showing.”
Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) have turned major buyers in the last few days as they are anticipating a strong government at the Centre. According to analysts, the buying was led by domestic institutions, high net worth individuals and it was backed by FIIs. “This kind of movement cannot happen without the involvement of FIIs,” said Mr. Baliga.
Though there was a Modi factor behind this surge, some analysts said that short-covering caused Friday’s rally. “The Nifty was short in futures. Today short-covering took place and this led to buying. Also fresh buying was seen,” said Deven Choksey, Managing Director, K. R. Choksey Shares and Securities.
On the National Stock Exchange (NSE), the 50-share Nifty gained 211.50 points to hit its new all-time high of 6,871.35, before closing at 6,858.80, up 198.95 points or 2.99 per cent.
PTI reports:
The rupee on Friday gained three paise against the dollar to end at 60.04 on persistent selling of the U.S. currency by banks and exporters in view of sustained foreign capital inflows into equity markets.
The rupee resumed slightly lower at 60.09 a dollar against the last closing of 60.07 at the inter-bank foreign exchange market on initial dollar demand from banks and importers. However, it recovered to 59.92 on renewed selling of dollars by banks and exporters, before finally settling at 60.04, showing a marginal gain of three paise from its last close.
