Sharath’s second coming
","Achanta Sharath Kamal is the classic comeback man. From his maiden 2003 conquest to claiming the senior National table tennis men’s singles title five years in a row, spilling it in the next five and regaining it twice in the last two years, he equalled Kamlesh Mehta’s record of eight titles at Ranchi last week.
It’s a second coming for the Chennai-based champ, laid low by a hamstring injury in 2015, wheelchair-bound for four weeks and able to walk without support only three months later. From an all-time high world ranking of 32, he had crashed to 74 the same year.
“I largely went unchallenged when winning five times on the trot, with either 4-0 or 4-1 verdicts,” Kamal told The Hindu on the sidelines of the Petroleum Sports Promotion Board (PSPB) inter-unit tournament here.
Recalling his Ranchi triumph, he said, “I was in Chennai all December. I trained in small halls where the ball travels faster than the bigger arenas that host major National or international tournaments. Such a switch suited me fine and I could come out guns blazing,” he said of his success.
The climb back to the top was slow but steady. Under the tutelage of coach Linus Mernsten since 2012, his game saw a transformation. The Swede who previously trained England and Luxembourg stood by his ward through the depths of despair. 
“I began to counter Anthony Amalraj with the backhand flick that he used to subdue me with. Consequently, I would lean less to the right to curb my overtly forehand game, realigning my body and correcting the posture,” said the highest-ever ranked Indian paddler.
The road to the final saw him cruise through seven rounds at his explosive best. “As the tournament progressed, my timing only got better,” said Kamal, a senior manager in Indian Oil. As always his pet stroke is the forehand top spin lash, unleashed close to the net with the ball on the ascent. “It defies physics,” he said of the shot, mastered under his uncle Muralidhara Rao.
“With Sharath based in Europe and adopting their style of play, he had difficulty in adapting to Indian conditions — the air, atmosphere, ball and tables. That caused his slump. Now that he has blended the two, he’s doing well. I wish he wins the National title a ninth time, because he deserves it for his dedication,” said India coach Arup Basak.

Sindhu survives a stern test
","It proved to be a truly testing day for the host at the $350,000 India Open on Friday. Moreover, coach P. Gopi Chand could only watch helplessly as a vast majority of his trainees tumbled without stretching their rivals.
One after another, B. Sai Praneeth, Sameer Verma and P. Kashyap lost in straight games and left the men’s singles draw without any home interest. Shockingly, this is the second successive year when the men semifinals is without an Indian.
If that was not disappointing enough for spectators present at the Siri Fort Indoor Complex, the meek surrender of Saina Nehwal came as a shock.
The saving grace was the survival of defending champion P.V. Sindhu and the Pranav Chopra-N. Sikki Reddy combine. Sindhu’s preparedness was severely tested as she needed a decider to stay alive unlike the convincing display from Pranav and Sikki. 
Saina’s first defeat in four meetings to USA’s Beiwen Zhang was followed the exit of Olympic champion Carolina Marin. 
Down 0-6 in the first two minutes meant Saina was never allowed to settle down. She struggled through the 12-minute opening game, hardly finding her feet and the ‘feel’ for the strokes. In the second game, Zhang showed that Saina had very little left in the tank. 
A panting Saina, a finalist last Sunday in the Indonesian Masters, began to err in judgements and sent the shuttles long on the ‘big’ points, including the match-point. 
Zhang, who represented Singapore before falling out with her Chinese coach and moving to the US three years ago, will now take on another surprise semifinalist, Hong Kong’s Cheung Ngan Yi, the conqueror of Marin 21-12, 21-19.
Earlier, Sindhu had to deal with 13-20 deficit in the second game against Marin’s teammate Beatriz Corrales. Sindhu then saved six game points to reach 19-20 before the Spaniard levelled and forced the decider following a ‘lucky point’ off the net-chord. But those six points helped Sindhu regain her self-belief and she raced through the decider. 
In the one-sided men quarterfinals, Iskandar Zulkarnain, the conqueror of K. Srikanth, advanced at the expense of Sameer. Chinese Taipei’s Chou Tien Chen raced past Praneeth after Kashyap began the trend with a straight-game defeat against China’s Qiao Bin.
Quarterfinal results: Men: Qiao Bin (Chn) bt P. Kashyap 21-16, 21-18; Chou Tien Chen (Tpe) bt B. Sai Praneeth 21-15, 21-13; Shi Yuqi (Chn) bt Wang Tzu Wei (Tpe) 21-13, 21-12; Iskandar Zulkarnain (Mal) bt Sameer Verma 21-17, 21-14.
Women: P.V. Sindhu bt Beatriz Corrales (Esp) 21-12, 19-21, 21-11; Ratchanok Intanon (Tha) bt Yip Pui Yin (Hkg) 21-11, 21-11; Beiwen Zhang (USA) bt Saina Nehwal 21-10, 21-13; Cheung Ngan Yi (Hkg) bt Carolina Marin (Esp) 21-12, 21-19.
Doubles (involving Indians): Men: Marcus Fenaldi Gideon & Kevin Sanjaya Sukamuljo (Ina) bt Manu Attri & Sumeeth Reddy 21-11, 21-15. Women: Du Yue & Li Yinhui (Chn) bt Ashwini Ponnappa & Sikki Reddy 21-17, 23-21; Jongkolphan Kititharakul & Rawinda Prajongjai (Tha) bt J. Meghna & Poorvisha Ram 21-10, 21-15.
Mixed doubles: Pranav Chopra & Sikki Reddy bt Han Chengkai & Cao Tong Wei (Chn) 2-8, 21-13; Mathias Christiansen & Christinna Pedersen (Den) bt Satwiksairaj Rankireddy & Ashwini Ponnappa 21-17, 21-11.

Saqib continues to be on top
","He has been on the professional circuit for a little more than three years but Syed Saqib Ahmed has never felt so good before. During the practice rounds here, the 24-year-old from Bengaluru felt very different, felt that this could be his moment.
Still, Saqib was surprised with his splendid run in the PGTI Cochin Masters at Nedumbassery’s CIAL Golf Club which helped him maintain his overnight lead, with a four-shot lead, after Friday’s penultimate round. 
“I didn’t expect this at all. I’m just playing each shot as it comes, I’m not even expecting to win tomorrow,” said the young man, who has never won a PGTI title before but appears to be a favourite to triumph on Saturday. 
Saqib has been trying out yoga and meditation for the last six months, after a friend asked him to try them out, and now the results are showing. 
“Yes, I’m more focused on living ‘in the moment’,” explained Saqib who was a very impressive junior with many wins in the Indian Golf Union’s amateur circuit a few years ago.
Saqib appeared to be growing stronger with each hole at that stage early in the back nine and once even had a six-shot lead over his nearest rival before bogeys in the 14th and 18th holes pulled him down.
Chandigarh’s Abhijit Singh Chadha was in the second spot while his good friend, Noida’s Amardip, occupied the next rung.
Chandigarh’s Sujjan Singh, with the day’s best score of 68, was joint fourth along with Noida’s Gaurav Pratap Singh and Gurugram-based Ankur Chadha.
The scores (18 holes, par 72, day 3): 
1. Syed Saqib Ahmed (206), 2. Abhijith Singh Chadha (210), 3. Amardip Singh Malik (211), 4. Sujjan Singh, Gaurav Pratap Singh, Ankur Chadha (all 212), 7. Shankar Das (213), 8. Sudhir Sharma, Maniram, Honey Baisoya (all 214).

I will be at my best in All England, says Marin
"," Olympic champion Carolina Marin has sent a warning to her rivals in the badminton world, saying she expects to be at her absolute best during next month’s All England Championships.
 The 24-year-old from Spain clinched two World Championship titles, an All England title beside the Olympic crown — all within three years between 2014 to 2016.
 But she lost motivation because of injuries post the Rio Games. Last year, she won the Japan Open and European Championship besides reaching the finals at India Open, Malaysia Open and Singapore Open.
 However, she suffered a hip injury during the Hong Kong Superseries and missed the Dubai Superseries Finals in December.
Marin feels she still needs to sharpen her skills and vowed to be at her best at the All England Championships.
“I feel my performance is not 100 per cent but it would be there in the All England. I feel motivated because I want to keep improving my game. I will prepare very well for All England,” said the former world no. 1 Marin.
“Last year it was hard because I had injuries after Olympics and my body needed a long break. It is always tough to keep going mentally after you have an injury but I have a good team.
“I had to believe in myself. I had to change my game during that phase and I didn’t get enough time to prepare for tournaments. I want to focus on improving my game after this event,” said Marin, who is playing at the India Open here.
 The All England Championships is schedule to be held from March 14 to 18 at Birmingham.
 Her mentor and chief coach Fernando Rivas will not travel with her for every tournament from now on and Marin said with her coach not around she needs to be more focused on court.
“I have another coach, who knows what I need. Fernando has a baby so he couldn’t come and he can’t be there in all tournaments with me. Now I will have to think more about myself and the game,” said Marin, who guided Hyderabad Hunters to title triumph in PBL 3 last month.
 Talking about competition in women’s singles, Marin said: “Women singles is really tough. Any player in top 10 can win any tournament because they are in the same level.
Every player changes their game. So we have to be really prepared.”

Visu Palani — a calm and consummate hoopster
","“Visu Palani can beat anyone in ball control, his dribbling skills invariably making him come out trumps in one-on-one situations,” said former Indian basketball captain Hari Krishna Prasad. “Young, but very talented, he’s an accomplished shooter, who goes for a lot of assists,” the three-time Asian Basketball Confederation championship hoopster told The Hindu.
“Visu is the Bjorn Borg of Indian basketball,” observed Norman Isaac. “Not flustered even by the most blatant fouls, he’s calm, stable and mature when switching roles of ball handler and forward. What sets him apart is that he uses one arm to shoot, without a supporting hand, even when targeting the ring from a distance,” said the International Basketball Federation (FIBA) Commissioner.
The Tuticorin-native averaged 20 points for Telangana in the recent senior National championship at Chennai, even logging 33 in one game with as many as eight three-pointers.
“An intelligent schemer, few can stop him. His anticipation in defence is excellent, finding him faster to the ball than players on the offence. A selfless player, its not surprising that he gets along well with his teammates,” added Isaac, chairman, technical commission, Basketball Federation of India (BFI)
“Visu is an athletic player who uses his speed and jumping ability to get to the rim and finish. He also shoots the ball well from the 3-point-line. He is a really good defender on the perimeter as well. What I appreciate most is that he is constantly improving his fitness skill sets and is very ‘coachable,’” noted Jon Kimberlin, United Basketball Alliance (UBA) league Assistant Coach.
“The UBA league came in handy to showcase his abilities,” said Puneeth Suresh, Head Coach of Bangalore Beast and Jain University. “When he joined our university, he had a language problem but soon went on to play for Karnataka,” he said. Jain University clinched the bronze from among 750 varsities at the all India competition at Satyabhama University.
“When we see a rival player scoring, I task Visu to mark him. Sure enough, the opposition’s scoring declines,” said Suresh, who added Visu couldn’t go to the US for further training due to visa issues.
“Visu’s very disciplined and that’s the reason for his consistency in three seasons,” explained Thimmaiah Madanda, Vice President, Operations, UBA.
“After the UBA experience, this time I could score a lot more. I feel that people only got to know me after UBA, when they could see me play on live TV,” said Visu, who acknowledged the support of coaches Sathiya Sankar at SAV Higher Secondary School in Tuticorin and Suresh at Jain University. The teenager led the UBA in steals in season three and shot 54% from three-point range in season four.

Sindhu sails into the final
","Favourite P. V. Sindhu produced a scintillating exhibition of controlled stroke-play to win the opening game 21-13 in 20 minutes against former World champion Ratchanok Intanon in the second semifinal of the $350,000 India Open badminton here Saturday.
Taking the court at 10 p.m. in what was the last fixture of the eight-match card on the TV court, Sindhu lost the first two points but then reeled off 12 points on the trot to lead 13-3. The 10-point lead provided enough cushion for Sindhu to stay in control.
Sindhu’s cross-court smashes and deft touches at the net kept Intanon guessing. Sindhu, who won her previous encounter against the Thai girl last year to bring her head-to-head record to 2-4, showed some exceptional anticipation.
However, owing to the poor scheduling of the semifinals, the exhausted winner of Sindhu-Intanon match will take on a well-rested Beiwen Zhang in Sunday’s final.
Unlike Zhang, who finished her match four hours the start of the second semifinal, Sindhu or Intanon were bound to get far less time to recover.
The 11th-ranked Zhang, seeded five, battled for 63 minutes to overcome sixth seed Cheung Ngan Yi 14-21, 21-12, 21-19. Zhang got her game together in the second game and carried on the momentum to hold four match-points in the decider. But the Hong Kong girl valiantly saved three match-points before she missed a dribble from Zhang.
The men final will offer third seed Chen Tien Chen an opportunity to do one better than he did last year. The Chinese Taipei player, runner-up to Viktor Axelsen here in the last edition, overcame unseeded Chinese Qiao Bin 23-21, 21-16. In the title-match, he faces another fourth seeded Chinese Shi Yuqi.
The 2017 All England runner-up Shi Yuqi needed 69 minutes to end the dream run of World No. 86 Iskandar Zulkarnain 18-21, 21-10, 21-19. The Malaysian, the back-to-back conqueror of second seed B. Srikanth and Sameer Verma, held a 16-12 lead in the decider before the eighth-ranked Shi Yuqi’s relentless attack finally found a way through his defences.
In fact, the point of the match came when Shi Yuqi held two match-poitns at 20-18. In a 42-shot rally, Zulkarnain came out stronger after the Chinese netted a forehand. However, off the next point, the match stood decided when Zulkarnain misjudged the flight of the shuttle that fell ‘in’.
In mixed doubles, the lone Indian pair of eighth seed Pranav Chopra and N. Sikky Reddy lost in straight games to their higher-ranked Danish rivals.
The results: (semifinals, prefix denotes seeding): Men singles: 3-Chen Tien Chen (Tpe) bt Qiao Bin (Chn) 23-21, 21-16; 4-Shi Yuqi (Chn) bt Iskandar Zulkarnain (Mal) 18-21, 21-10, 21-19.
Women singles: 1-P. V. Sindhu leads Ratchanok Intanon (Tha) 21-13, 6-5; 5-Beiwen Zhang (USA) bt 6-Cheung Ngan Yi (Hkg) 14-21, 21-12, 21-19.
Men doubles: 1-Marcus Fernaldi Gideon and Kevin Sanjaya Sukamuljo (Ina) bt Mohammad Ahsan and Hendra Setiawan (Ina) 21-11, 21-16; 4-Kim Astrup and Anders Skaaru Rasmussen (Den) bt Han Chengkai and Zhou Haodong (Chn) 21-19, 21-14.

Saqib’s long wait finally over
"," 
For a brief moment, as he came up with successive bogeys on the 15th and 16th holes in the final round on Saturday, Syed Saqib Ahmed felt his title chances slipping away in the PGTI Cochin Masters.
The 24-year-old golfer from Bengaluru had produced amazing play over the last two days, including a hole-in-one at Nedumbassery’s CIAL Golf Club, but suddenly everything appeared to be going up in smoke.
He then found out from his friends that Delhi’s Honey Baisoya, his nearest challenger who had started half hour earlier, had finished with a seven-under and realised that he had to buck up. And Saqib found his touch just in time, produced birdies in the last two holes, and clinched his maiden professional title.
The victory came with a cash prize of ₹6 lakh and took Saqib to the top of the 2018 PGTI Order of Merit after two events.
“I really felt the pressure after the bogeys on the 15th and 16th because both the par fives are actually easy holes,” said Saqib, who finished with a three-shot lead over the pre-tournament favourite Baisoya. 
“But I had a birdie on the 17th, which I think is one of the toughest. And the 18th went like a dream, I really didn’t think I could handle it so well. This is really a big burden off my head.”
The title ended three years of waiting for Saqib.
“I dedicate this, my first pro title, to my parents and my grandfather,” said the young man and then turned emotional.
Cochin International Airport Limited managing director V.J. Kurian gave away the prizes. 
The final placings (par 288, four day total, top 10): 1. Syed Saqib Ahmed (278), 2. Honey Baisoya (281), 3. M. Dharma & Abhijit Singh Chadha (both 283), 5. Ankur Chadha (284), 6. Veer Ahlawat, Maniram, Gaurav Pratap Singh (all 285), 9. Arjun Prasad & Karandeep Kochhar (286).

Warriors have a romp
","Stephen Curry scored 33 points, sinking an NBA Finals record nine 3-pointers in the process, and the Golden State Warriors moved halfway to it third title in four seasons on Sunday by beating Cleveland 122-103.
The Warriors, who never trailed, seized a 2-0 lead in the best-of-seven series, which shifts to Cleveland for games three and four on Wednesday and Friday.
“We’ve got to get that same focus going to Cleveland,” Curry said.
Curry, the 30-year-old guard, broke the old mark of eight 3-pointers in a finals game set by Ray Allen of Boston in 2010. “To be on top of that 3-point list is pretty special,” Curry said.
Curry scored 16 points in the fourth quarter, including a 4-point play from a corner 3-pointer and the record breaker from the left side with 3:30 remaining.
He finished by shooting 11-of-26 from the floor, 9-of-17 from 3-point range, with seven rebounds and eight assists.
Kevin Durant added 26 points, Klay Thompson had 20 and JaVale McGee added 12 to spark the Warriors.
James nets 29 points
Cavaliers superstar LeBron James netted 29 points with 13 assists and nine rebounds while Kevin Love added 22 points and 10 rebounds, but Cleveland came no closer than five points in the second half.
After an overtime opener loss James called one of the worst defeats of his career, the Cavaliers couldn’t play Golden State as close, Curry and his teammates thwarting every threat.
Cavs guard J.R. Smith, whose late-game blunder in the opener denied Cleveland a potential winning shot, was greeted with a standing ovation by Warriors fans and chants of “MVP” when he went to the free throw line. Smith went 2-of-9 from the floor and scored only five points.
Cleveland pulled within five points three times in the third quarter but the Warriors carried a 90-80 lead after three quarters.
James opened the fourth quarter with a 3-pointer but Curry followed with back-to-back 3-pointers for a 96-83 Warriors edge.
Curry followed soon after with his seventh 3-pointer of the game, a desperation heave with the shot clock expiring, to give the Warriors a 103-89 advantage and the rout was on.
Three 3-pointers by Curry sparked a 19-8 Warriors second-quarter run as Golden State took a 59-46 halftime edge.
Curry had 16 points, five rebounds and six assists in the first half, when the Warriors shot 59% from the floor and passed out 18 assists. James produced 15 first-half points on 5-of-11 shooting with seven rebounds and eight assists.
The result: Warriors 122 (Curry 33, Durant 26, Thompson 20, McGee 12, Livingston 10) bt Cavaliers 103 (James 29, Love 22, Hill 15, Thompson 11). Warriors lead the Finals 2-0.

Another draw for Anand
","Continuing with his sequence of draws, Viswanathan Anand shook hands with Shakhriyar Mamedyarov after 32 moves in the sixth round of Norway chess tournament here on Sunday.
But the talking point of the day was Wesley So’s first-ever victory over World champion Magnus Carlsen in the classical time format. The result ended the Norwegian’s 37-game unbeaten streak this year. 
The 44-move defeat, on the eve of the second rest day, also sliced Carlsen’s lead to half a point and threw open the title-race. 
In the exchange variation of Slav Defence, Carlsen miscalculated in the middle-game and lost a pawn on the 25th move. So, playing white, slowly gained control with an advanced pawn structure that left the black’s castled king with limited options. 
Though Carlsen managed to win back the pawn, So stayed in control. Soon thereafter, Carlsen erred in judgement with a pawn-move on the queenside and lost a pawn. A move later, the top seed gave up. 
Sixth round results: Viswanathan Anand (2.5/5) drew with Shakhriyar Mamedyarov (Aze, 2.5/6), Wesley So (USA, 3/5) bt Magnus Carlsen (Nor, 3.5/6), Levon Aronian (Arm, 3/6) drew with Fabiano Caruana (USA, 2.5/5), Hikaru Nakamura (USA, 2.5/5) drew with Maxime Vachier-Lagrave (Fra, 2/5), Sergey Karjakin (Rus, 2.5/5) bye. 
Seventh round pairings: Lagrave-Anand, Karjakin-Aronian, Caruana-Nakamura, Mamedyarov-So, Carlsen bye.

It was an amazing experience, says Neha Pardeshi ","NEW DELHI: For Neha Pardeshi and Vahbiz Bharucha, it was a dream come true moment when India played Singapore in its first ever international Test at the Asia rugby women’s championship (Division 1). India lost 30-5 but the result does not convey the fight put by Vahbiz’s team.
Speaking from Singapore, Vahbiz, the skipper of the path-breaking team, said: “I am proud of the girls. They put up a gallant fight. Our defensive line was good. We did not allow Singapore to score for the first 36 minutes and this in our first ever Test. We suffered a few injuries and Singapore dominated once it scored.”
It was the first foreign exposure for the team. “We were regular playing Rugby7s but this was a different experience,” said Neha. “We will have to be aware and anticipate better in the next match (against the Philippines on June 5). Overall, it was an amazing experience and we learnt a lot.”
As Neha analysed, “the difference lay in the fitness level of the sides. They were superior in strength and endurance. Size too mattered. We may not have matched them in strength but we had the heart to fight. It was a history-making moment and that is what motivated us.”
On the difference between Rugby7s and Rugby15s, Neha said: “The 7s is very fast compared to the 15s, which is more contact game, a brain game. It was like playing chess physically. We were new to this format and playing against a team which is ranked 34th in the world. Some of our girls were taken aback at the sight of the opponents but we fought. We won’t take long to adapt to this format.”
After the Singapore experience, the team will prepare for the Asian Games in Jakarta where rugby will be played in the 7s format.

‘Indian swimmers need top-class facilities’
","S. Pradeep Kumar, 53, the current National swimming coach and a Dronacharaya Award winner, who has trained many who have gone on to represent India in the Olympics, spoke to The Hindu while attending the Karnataka State sub-junior and junior aquatic championships 2018. Excerpts.
What do think is the present scene in Indian swimming?
The scene is not so encouraging. Indian swimmers perform well in Asian age group competitions, but are not up to Olympic standards yet. To come to that standard we require many things. We need better facilities, a lot more financial back-up and support.
Sajan Prakash and Shivani Kataria represented India in 2016 Rio Olympics. We should not compare our swimmers with those who are winning medals in Olympics. We should have a huge talent pool of swimmers from which we can choose the best.
We should also have specialists in stroke technique, physiology, physical fitness, nutrition expert and video analysis to support the system. The coach can work alongside them and improve their skills.
Do you think the system needs a revamp?
Indian swimmers choose academics when they graduate to the senior level. Parents don’t continue to invest more money on swimming, and this is where private funding is necessary.
Top class swimmers need to train under a long-term coach and also need proper exposure by taking part in stiffer competitions abroad often. Then we can see some changes happening.

Cavaliers will need James to sustain his spectacular play ","Cleveland Cavaliers coach Tyronn Lue has said the 124-114 defeat by the Golden State Warriors in Game One of the NBA Finals on Thursday was painful but provided valuable insights into how to dethrone the champion.
The Cavs led with less than a minute left in regulation and but for an overturned foul call on Warriors’ Kevin Durant and a miscue by Cavs guard J.R. Smith at the end of the fourth quarter, the game could easily have had a different result.
The underdog Cavs used their length to out-rebound the Warriors and were able to slow down the tempo of the game, allowing LeBron James to score 51 points by isolating hapless Warriors defenders and setting the table for a near upset.
“It was a tough game for us. We played well enough to win but we didn’t,” Lue told reporters. “Our guys’ confidence is not shaken. We see what we need to do and how we need to perform to win. So we have the blueprint, now we just need to execute at a higher level.”
Cavs guard George Hill said they feel as confident as ever and are eager to avenge the loss when the teams meet for Game Two on Sunday.
“Everyone in this locker room felt we gave this one away and we missed the opportunity,” he told reporters. “We have a game on Sunday to make up for it and do the best we can to get back on the right track.”
To even the series the Cavs will need James to carry over his spectacular play from Thursday, which included eight rebounds and eight assists along with his monster scoring performance.
“He did everything he could to will our team to win,” Lue said. “He showed his team on the biggest stage how you have to play to beat this team and he did a great job of that.”
Asked if James could play any better than he did on Thursday, Lue laughed. “I hope so,” he said.
“I know it’s asking a lot but we need him to lead by example, being aggressive and attacking the basket. He he’s got to keep it up.”

India leg of 24-hour Global Run on June 6
","NEW DELHI: The India leg of the first ever 24-hour Global Run, organised by the International Federation of Athletics Associations (IAAF), will be held here on June 6.
The unique concept, named “Let’s Outrun the Sun”, would be a one-mile (1.6km) run across 24 cities around the world and would begin in Auckland and culminate in Vancouver over a period of 24 hours with live streaming throughout. The relay event would begin at 4.30 p.m. from Raj Ghat and end at Shanti Van.
Olympian and former India quartermiler Paramjit Singh has been named as the city captain by the Athletics Federation of India (AFI) for the event. Registration and entry is free and can be done on the AFI or IAAF website.
AFI secretary C.K. Valson said it was a recognition of India’s growing acceptance in world athletics that the country was chosen as one of the five Asian hosts despite not asking for it.
“It was a proposal from several countries to raise interest in running and fitness and was recently accepted by the IAAF executive board in its meeting. The decision to hold the world-relay event was taken around 20 days back by the international federation,” Valson said, adding it is likely to become an annual event.
Delhi will be preceded by Bangkok and followed by Minsk in Belarus as hosts.

Impressed with the talent in Karnataka, says Nisha Millet
","Nisha Millet, 36, Olympian and Arjuna Award winner and the first Indian female swimmer to qualify for the Olympic Games in Sydney 2000, spoke to The Hindu on the sidelines of the Karnataka state sub-junior and junior aquatics championships here on Sunday.
Excerpts:
How do you see the present talent of junior and sub-junior swimmers in Karnataka?
I am very much impressed with the performance of the boys in the State championships. Swimmers in the boys section (Group I to IV) have broken the state and national records, which is a good sign. In the girls section, the performance needs to improve. After a gap of 25 years, Sajini Shetty’s record has been broken by Rachana S.R. Rao (Group II girls section). She also won the 100m backstroke with a new national mark. There are promising swimmers like Nina Venkatesh and Suvana C. Baskar (both from Dolphin Aquatics). They need to work hard to perform well at the national and international level.
What should they do to improve further?
They need to be more professional in their outlook towards swimming. They need to get updated on the sport, do mental training and take part in more events abroad in the Asian and European circuits where competition will be tougher. The SFI and the government needs to get involved and send talented swimmers on exposure tours abroad often. The Khelo India programme is a good concept and they have also started financially supporting talented sportspersons, which is positive. The Karnataka swimming Association has also announced that it will will give cash awards to state and national record breakers, which is good news.
About your academy?
I started the Nisha Millet Swimming Academy in Bengaluru in 2004. We have two main centres, one in Kennigston Pool, Ulsoor and one in Koramangala. We have 10 other centres in city to cater to the needs of the public. It’s satisfying to be into coaching. We are a team of 30 coaches and I head the senior and Sirish Reddy the junior sections. I also support the top swimmers from the academy with sponsorship from Speedo and upcoming juniors with Speedo kits.

Stephen Curry: short-term focus for long-range hero
","Golden State guard Stephen Curry said that while it was “cool” to set an NBA Finals record with nine three-pointers in the Warriors’ 122-103 win over the Cleveland Cavaliers on Sunday, his focus was on keeping the Larry O’Brien Trophy in Oakland.
Curry drained a series of three-pointers, some of them from well beyond the arc, during his stellar Game Two performance to break the back of a Cavs team that had hoped to bounce back from a heartbreaking Game One loss on Thursday.
“That’s a pretty cool deal to accomplish,” Curry told reporters after the win, which puts his team two wins away from their third title in four years. “But at the end of the day, it’s all about trying to get a win and doing whatever you can to make that happen.”
Curry’s performance surpassed Ray Allen’s record of eight three-pointers in a Finals game, which he set with the Celtics in 2010.
“I never woke up and was like, all right, let’s go get nine threes and get the record,” he said. “It was more so about playing the game the right way, having good intentions out there on the court and good things happen.
“So pretty special night, and hopefully some more special things happen and we get two more wins.”
While Curry was humble, Warriors coach Steve Kerr was quick to sing his praises after the win.
“He was tremendous. You know, nine threes and seemed to hit the big shot every time we needed one,” Kerr said. “He was fantastic.”
Warriors forward Kevin Durant was anything but surprised by Curry’s heroics. “At this point, it’s expected,” he said.
Game Three of the best-of-seven series is in Cleveland on Wednesday.

The Durant-Curry duo: A symbiotic relationship that has blossomed
"," Before last season, fans wondered how well newcomer Kevin Durant and star guard Stephen Curry would work together as new teammates for the Golden State Warriors.
Now halfway to a second consecutive NBA title together, inside force Durant and 3-point sharpshooter Curry have become a lethal combination against Cleveland once again in this year’s NBA Finals.
“Two seasons together, I think we’ve figured out a good balance,” Durant said on Tuesday. “I think being able to play off of each other definitely helps. But not just us two. Everybody else on the court kind of plays off each other well.”
Playing Durant tight inside leaves open space for Curry to utilise. Outmanning Curry outside leaves Durant to outmatch most rivals near the basket.
As a result, Durant averages 28.7 points, 7.3 rebounds and 4.3 assists a game in the playoffs while Curry contributes 25.8 points, 6.2 rebounds and 5.5 assists a night in the post-season. “Every opportunity we get to play more minutes together, we start to figure out a better chemistry,” Curry said.
“It’s nice when we’re both going and have the opportunity to play off each other. We both can be aggressive no matter if I’m getting the shot or he’s getting the shot or anybody else on the team is getting the shot.”
“We just try to do whatever it takes to get the W,” Durant said. “Run the right plays. Run them with force and with pace. When you get your opportunities, be disciplined in your work and trust in your work. That will dictate the outcome. So just try to keep things as simple as possible.”
It became tricky this season when each of them was injured for a span, most recently Curry at the start of the playoffs.
“But it’s not hard to kind of ramp it back up once we’re both out there on the floor. We built up that chemistry again. And it has been fun.”
Greater communication this season has led to more encouragement between the stars, helping lift each other mentally as well as with their skills.
“When we pick our spots offensively and try to find the right matchups, find the right flow, make simple plays, good things usually happen,” Curry said. 
“It’s best when we’re communicating with each other about what we see on the floor consistently. We want to see each other succeed. Got a good chemistry going.”

On eight wheels
","If you have never been to a skating rink, it is a challenge to express the rush that the sport has on a spectator. Visakhapatnam is known for many things, and skating is one of them. The third edition of Rising Star Summer Roller Skating Championship organised by the Sivaji Park Skating Association (SPSA) at the Park, MVP Colony, got off to a colourful start on June 2. The modest-sized skating arena was decorated with colourful flags and was lined by parents sitting around the rink, cheering each time a skater zipped passed them. The impressive movement of feet and the turns — squatting slightly and staying absolutely still — was made to look effortless by the children in the rink. But it’s only when you get on the wheels do you really know what it takes to look effortless. Manha Begum, a three-year-old, has been skating since the last five months. Reshma Begum, Manha’s mother says, “We come to the park every day; she immediately got drawn to the sport.” 
The championship consisted of jonex, practice and speed wheel events. “A skater begins with jonex wheels and moves eventually to speed wheels as they improve,” says SPSA general secretary Mahendra Tated. About 260 children aged between three to 16 years registered for the two-day event. Andhra Pradesh Roller Skating Association president Raghupati Raju inaugurated the championship. In his inaugural address, Raju says “Thanks to existing infrastructure, the city has produced many world-class skaters. But we need an indoor facility as for next two years the nationals will take place here. We have requested the municipality to turn Sivaji Park skating rink into an indoor facility so that monsoons do not affect the competition.”
All the children participating were radiating the sportsman spirit. It was soul lifting to see children finish the race, without worrying about results. After each race, skaters rushed back to their parents for a hug and joined in the cheering for other participants. Ananda Dissanayake, a proud parent, said: “I am so proud, Chehitha (7) has learned so well in 11 months and qualified for the next round.” On June 3, the championship came to an end with the award ceremony. The event took a moment to recognise 20 children who won medals at the 55th National Roller Skating Championship and 13 skaters who will represent the nation in the 18th Asians Roller Skating Championship to be held in South Korea.

No equestrian team for Asian Games ","A five-hour meeting between the Equestrian Federation of India (EFI) officials and the Indian Olympic Association (IOA) here on Thursday ended with the IOA deciding not to recommend a team for the Jakarta Asian Games, citing the inability of meeting the qualifying criteria set by the EFI itself.
“As of now, there is no team being fielded at the Asian Games,” EFI secretary-general Col. R.K. Swain told The Hindu adding that re-trials were not possible given the paucity of time. 
The decision, he said, was taken after discussing all factors including the medal-winning prospects of the teams. 
Small door open?
Sources, however, said a small door has been left open for participation depending on whether EFI president Lt. Gen Ashok Ambre is able to convince IOA president Narinder Batra of the team’s chances at a later date but chances are bleak.
There were also murmurs of the selection committee insisting on sending the same team as selected without any changes but Col. Swain refuted any such suggestions.
IOA officials, meanwhile, insisted that there was no point sending a team to make up the numbers. 
“When the teams haven’t been able to fulfil the EFI’s own qualifying criteria, how can they be fielded,” they questioned.
The EFI had on June 4 announced a seven-member team — four in eventing and three in show-jumping — despite only one meeting the 03 qualifying criteria in both events, keeping the “best interest of the sport” in mind.
Decision overtuned
Two days later, the EFI president, also the president of the selection committee, unilaterally overturned the decision of which he had been part with a blunt statement, “in view of the fact that NO rider has met the criteria for any of the team or individual events i.e. in eventing, showjumping and dressage, the selection of the team for eventing and show jumping stands cancelled”.

The committee — chaired by IOA vice-president Sunaina Kumari and including SAI officer Rajendra Pathania, GFI joint-secretary Makarand Joshi, Delhi Olympic Association secretary Suresh Sharma and gymnastics coach Ram Milan — will select the team, most likely in Delhi.
“A final decision on the date and venue will be taken by tomorrow [Friday] because it is the Sports Authority of India that has to give the clearance. We would like to hold the trials on June 24 only but the venue is likely to change from Pune to some other centre,” Joshi told The Hindu after the meeting.
Selecting the best team
The GFI has also submitted its acceptance of the committee to the IOA, a copy of which is with The Hindu. “We have to work with the GFI because of the international federation. At the end of the day, it is about selecting the best team for the Asian Games and without any controversy. It’s good that all parties are agreeable to this proposal,” IOA officials said.
A training camp for elite gymnasts is currently on at the Indira Gandhi Stadium here and will be held till June 24, and given that all the top Indian gymnasts are part of it along with national coaches G.S. Bawa and Bisweswar Nandi, sources said selection could be done the same day to ensure seamless movement from one phase of training to the next.
Interestingly, the GFI letter is signed by general-secretary Ranjeet Vasava whose appointment has been the bone of contention between the federation and IOA and one of the reasons for pending recognition.
De-recognised by the IOA and/or the sports ministry, the mess in gymnastics is trickier since it holds recognition from the International Gymnastics Federation (FIG) and hence is the sole authority to recommend teams for international events. A similar situation before the CWG had the FIG direct IOA not to interfere.

Bhuvneshwari confident of India’s chances at Asiad ","There is hardly a match that former National squash champion Bhuvneshwari Kumari must have missed in the Asian Games selection trials which are currently on at the Indian Squash Academy courts here. She arrives at the venue on time almost always, watches the matches intently. 
The 16-time [consecutive] National women’s singles champion, who will be coach of the Indian women’s team for the Asiad, is in the city to witness the trials to pick the third and fourth singles players to complete the Indian women’s team.
The 57-year-old from Delhi is confident of the country’s men and women’s teams doing well at the Games. 
“We will get a minimum of four medals. We will do extremely well in the singles and team championships,” she opined.
Her optimism is based on the players’ world rankings and their current form.
“I am confident because they are playing well. [Of course] Joshna [Chinappa] will be the favourite in women’s singles. In the men’s section, we have Saurav [Ghosal]. Actually we have a solid men’s team,”she said.
The big concern in squash circles is the absence of good quality players other than Joshna and Dipika Pallikal. Bhuvneshwari replied that it was only a matter of time before junior players come good at the senior level.
“The thing is that the other girls are not playing international events, even if they are playing they are not playing top of the the line [events]. Give them a few years, I am sure they will come up in world rankings,” she said.
The former Kenyan Open champion picked Sunayna Kuruvilla, Ashitha [Bengra], [Aishwarya] Bhattacharya as the ones to watch out for.
Born into the royal family of Alwar in Rajasthan, Bhuvneshwari said she didn’t expect to hang up her boots after her record 16th title, but for an unfortunate knee injury.
“I never expected the 16th title to be my last. While playing in an inter-club tournament I injured my knee. I had decided to continue for another three years. 
“The doctors said I had damaged my knee, and could not play competitive squash any longer,” she said.

Norway chess tournament: Anand loses to Caruana
","Viswanathan Anand suffered a rare defeat with white pieces after his sense of danger surprisingly deserted him against World No. 2 Fabiano Caruana in the eighth and penultimate round of Norway chess tournament here on Wednesday. 
In the day’s other decisive game, Hikaru Nakamura scored an easy win over Sergey Karjakin. As a result, Nakamura and Caruana joined Magnus Carlsen and Wesley So in the lead at four points. 
A day after scoring his first win and joining the leaders, Anand looked in no serious danger for the better part of this Petroff Defence game that soon appeared like the exchange variation of French Defence. 
Anand began losing ground around the 27th move and soon gave up his rook for an advanced knight and a pawn. While Anand failed to find the right defence, Caruana kept improving his position. 
Just when Anand was expected to bring to the fore his well-known defensive skills, he faltered. On the 49th move, Anand’s decision to advance his king deeper into the enemy territory hastened the end as he went on to resign a move later. 
Eighth round results: Viswanathan Anand (3.5/7) lost to Fabiano Caruana (USA, 4/7); Magnus Carlsen (Nor, 4/7) drew with Shakhriyar Mamedyarov (Aze, 3.5/8); Hikaru Nakamura (USA, 4/7) bt Sergey Karjakin (Rus, 3/7); Wesley So (USA, 4/7) drew with Maxime Vachier-Lagrave (Fra, 2.5/7); Levon Aronian (Arm, 3.5/7) bye. 
Final round pairings: Karjakin-Anand; Lagrave-Carlsen; Caruana-So; Aronian-Nakamura; Mamedyarov bye.

Anand stops Karjakin, finishes joint second
","Viswanathan Anand signed off in great style when he tamed Sergey Karjakin to finish joint second in the Norway chess tournament here on Thursday. 
Fabiano Caruana, the conqueror of Anand in the previous round, had his share of luck on way to a title-deciding victory over Wesley So. 
Caruana took the winner’s share of 75,000 euros for what was his third title – after Candidates and Grenke – this year. 
For the record, Caruana tallied with five points, half a point better than Magnus Carlsen, Hikaru Nakamura and Anand, who finished in that order after the tie-break was applied. 
Anand prevailed in an eventful game that lasted 32 moves for his second victory with black pieces. 
It must be noted that Anand started this elite 10-player field as the lowest rated player but eventually managed a creditable finish. 
Statistically, Anand won two games with black pieces, drew six others (including the one against Ding Liren who withdrew after three rounds) and lost only the eventual champion. 
The performance helped Anand gain nine rating points which in turn lifted his World ranking from 14th to 11th.
Final-round results: Sergey Karjakin (Rus) lost to Viswanathan Anand; Fabiano Caruana (USA) bt Wesley So (USA); Maxime Vachier-Lagrave (Fra) drew with Magnus Carlsen (Nor); Levon Aronian (Arm) drew with Hikaru Nakamura (USA); Shakhriyar Mamedyarov (Aze) bye. 
Standings: 1. Caruana (5 points); 2-4. Carlsen, Nakamura, Anand (4.5); 5-6. So, Aronian (4), 7. Mamedyarov (3.5), 8-9. Lagrave and Karjakin (3).

Asian Games selection headaches continue ","With just over two months to go for the Asian Games, the cobwebs around various sports federations are being dusted and new issues flaring up. After gymnastics and equestrian, it’s now time for taekwondo to see a struggle for selecting teams.
The martial art form isn’t exactly a medal hope and is de-recognised by the Sports Ministry but that hasn’t stopped the powers-that-be from indulging in power games. In fact, there are four different factions existing in the sport in India at the moment with each claiming allegiance to a different parent organisation.
“The ministry has suggested that the Sports Authority of India (SAI) conduct selection trials and the same could then be ratified by the world body-recognised faction. That will make it easy for everyone but it may well run foul of World Taekwondo and we have already suffered once before CWG,” sources said.
Officials added that the IOA was instead keen on forming an ad-hoc committee, on the lines of gymnastics, involving all parties concerned — the government / SAI, the IOA and the faction officially recognised by the world body — but there was no clarity yet. The IOA and WT recognise the Chetan Anand-led faction.
Meanwhile, the Fencing Association of India has been unable to send its team for the upcoming Asian Championships in Bangkok pending an official order from the SAI. Interestingly, the trip and its budget has already been cleared by both the Sports Ministry and the finance committee of SAI.
“We have to leave latest by 15th, we have already postponed our departure twice. Next up is the weekend, how would arrangements be made? We had given the proposal even before the ACTC was submitted, met the sports secretary on May 22 and got verbal clearance. Two days later, it was officially cleared after being satisfied with our selections and other details. And yet the SAI hasn’t passed the order,” FAI secretary general Bashir Ahmed Khan said.
Twenty-four athletes — 12 men and women, four each in three events epee, foil and sabre — are to participate. Khan said two more in each event would be added to the squad on return and the best 24 would then be selected for the Asian Games.

Dancing on wheels
"," “When I go back to Italy, I'll explain to my students that they don’t sacrifice as much as Indian skaters,’’ says Barbara Bundy to her staff after training the young artistic skaters from all over India. The young athletes were training without skates because the rink was wet due to rain on the first day of the camp. 
Bundy is an artistic skating coach from Italy. She has been appointed by Fédération Internationale de Roller Sports to coach artistic skaters in India in a ten-day camp at the Visakhapatnam Steel Plant Skating Rink. “Skaters have the right attitude in India but the levels of skating in other countries are much higher. One of the main reasons is because of more coaches to train the athletes,” she says. Bundy continues, “Having an indoor skating rink is an absolute must if India wants to compete at international levels. Roller sports are one of eight sports in consideration for the 2020 Olympics. And hence, the coming two years will be crucial for every professional skater in the world.”
Bunday has been coaching artistic skating since last 18 years in Italy. Her association with roller skating goes back to 1970, under her mother’s guidance when she was just four years old. Skating continued to be her hobby until Bundy realised she would like to be a professional judge. She enrolled in a short-term professional course when she was in first-year of college studying economics. Bundy starting judging skating competitions in 1984 and finally decided to take up coaching in 2000. “In 1997, I took a break for three years after I conceived my first child. It was during these years I decided to become a coach,” she says. Bunday specialises in various types of skating events - artistic (solo and pairs), freestyle and figures. She co-coached the winners of the pairs competition in the 2014 Junior World Championships, Reus, Spain. 
In Visakhapatnam, she is training in two sessions — 5.30 am to 10 am and 5.30 pm to 10 pm. During these sessions, Bunday’s primary objective is to work on basic elements so that the execution is right. She says, “I work on the attitude of the athletes while coaching.” After few minutes of warming-up, the skaters perform drills which test their stance and body posture. Bunday feels, “Going forward the popularity of artistic roller skating will only increase.”

Warriors’ third title in four years
","An overpowering Golden State Warriors squad captured its third NBA crown in four seasons on Friday, routing Cleveland 108-85 to complete a sweep in the best-of-seven NBA Finals.
Stephen Curry scored 37 points and Kevin Durant was named the NBA Finals Most Valuable Player for the second consecutive year after 20 points, 12 rebounds and 10 assists — his first finals triple double.
Warriors inflicted the first 4-0 NBA Finals blanking since the Cavaliers were swept by San Antonio in 2007.
It was the fourth year in a row Warriors and Cavaliers met in the finals, Golden State winning in 2015 and the past two years.
Matching Chicago Bulls
Golden State claimed the sixth crown in club history, matching Chicago Bulls for third on the all-time list.
“It feels great to go out there and win a championship with these guys the way we did it. To finish it off with a sweep feels so good,” said Stephen Curry.
LeBron James, playing his eighth consecutive finals, scored 23 points, grabbed seven rebounds and passed off eight assists but fell to 3-6 in the finals for his career.
He revealed after the game he had been playing with a broken right hand for the past three games.
The result: 
Golden State Warriors 108 (Curry 37, Durant 20, Thompson 10) bt Cleveland Cavaliers 85 (James 23, Love 13, Smith 10) (Warriors sweep series 4-0).

James ponders leaving Cleveland again
","NBA superstar LeBron James admits he’s considering breaking the hearts of Cleveland sports fans once again by leaving the Cavaliers for a better chance at becoming a champion again. James, who played his eighth consecutive finals, can opt out of his contract and become a free agent in July, much the way he did when he left Cleveland in 2010.
While opportunities with the Houston Rockets, Philadelphia 76ers and Los Angeles Lakers are likely available, the native of nearby Akron might elect to stay and try to keep the Cavs a contender.
“I have no idea at this point,” James said. “Sitting down and considering everything, my family is a huge part of whatever I’ll decide to do in my career, and it will continue to be that. So I don’t have an answer for you right now.
“I’m not going to take you throughout the whole process. That’s not fun. But when I decide what I’m going to do with my future, my family and the folks that have been with me for the last, you know, 20 years, pretty much, will have a say-so. Then it ultimately will come down to me, and so we’ll see what happens.”
In 2014, James returned to the Cavaliers vowing to win a title and did so in 2016, the first by any Cleveland sports team since the 1964 NFL Browns.
“I came back because I felt like I had some unfinished business,” James said. 
Asked if his business was finished, James called that a “tricky question” but noted the victory fed his hunger for more trophy ceremonies.
“I still have so much to give to the game,” James said. “I think I’ve shown this year why I will still continue to be in championship mode.”

Drama at wrestling selections ","There is never a dearth of drama in Indian wrestling. After exempting four wrestlers, the men’s selection trials in both Freestyle and Greco-Roman categories on Saturday saw some surprise winners but it was the closely-contested 57kg category that remained the highlight.
While CWG winner Rahul Aware did not participate in the trials at the SAI Training Centre in Sonepat — there were murmurs of him not making the weight — the three-way tie between Sandeep Tomar, Utkarh Kale and Ravi Kumar ended in a stalemate with all three winning a bout each in the second round. While Tomar, who represented India at the Rio Olympics was initially announced as the winner by virtue of winning the final bout, the decision was quickly rescinded. A re-trial between the three is now scheduled for June 13.
Ravi Kumar won the first bout 4-2 against Tomar but then lost to Kale 6-4. It all came down to the bout between Tomar and Kale and even though the latter looked set to take the spot with a 6-2 lead at break, Tomar came back with a massive four-point throw to lead in the last few seconds. Kale challenged the decision but it held and Tomar won 12-8.
While technically the decision should have been on the basis of classification points in case of a tie, in this case both Kale and Tomar had 14 points. The WFI has now rescheduled the trial in the 57kg along with the trials for the Asian Junior Championships on Wednesday.
In the 97 kg, Mausam Khatri came back from being 2-0 down against Satyavrat Kadian to level 2-2 and take the bout and the spot for the Asiad. Bajrang Punia (65kg) and Sushil Kumar (74kg) had been allowed to skip the trials by the federation and are currently training in Georgia. While those winning the selection trials in the four categories here would participate in both the Asian Games and the World Championships in October, WFI is likely to conduct fresh trials in the two exempted categories for the Budapest event. 
Women’s trials would be held in Lucknow on Sunday.
The squads: Freestyle: Bajrang Punia (65kg), Sushil Kumar (74kg), Pawan Kumar (86kg), Mausam Khatri (97kg), Sumit (125kg); Greco-Roman: Gyanendra (60kg), Manish (67 kg), Gurpreet Singh (77 kg), Harpreet Singh (87 kg), Hardeep (97 kg), Naveen (125 kg).

NBA finals: Golden State Warriors beat Cleveland Cavaliers for third title in four years
","The third time was more than just the charm. It was perfection.
The Golden State Warriors became the NBA's first back-to-back champion since 2013, on Friday night, gradually pulling away from the Cleveland Cavaliers to complete a four-game sweep in the Finals with a 108-85 romp in Game 4 in Cleveland.
Stephen Curry poured in 37 points, including 20 in the first half, during which the Warriors took a commanding lead, helping Golden State capture its third championship in the four-year Steve Kerr coaching era.
“It was definitely the toughest,” Kerr said in comparing the three championships. “I remember sitting in this room three years ago; it seemed like a dream. This feels more like reality.
“I hope that doesn't sound arrogant. It's just that's the talent we have, and that's the experience we've gained. But it's a very different feeling. It's still euphoric, but three years ago was I can't believe this happened, and now it's I can definitely believe this happened. But it was hard.”
All three championships have come against the Cavaliers, with the series clincher coming in Cleveland for the second time.
“I just want to congratulate Cleveland on an amazing season,” Kerr praised. ”You know, I watched that team a lot during the year. We always keep our eye on them, of course, and there have been kind of three different versions of their team. The fact that they got here surprised me, actually, watching them during the regular season. It didn't look like they were going to have enough.
“But what (coach Tyronn Lue) did with his group and obviously what LeBron (James) does night after night is just incredible. They had an amazing run.”
Kevin Durant was named Finals MVP for the second year in a row, the sixth player to accomplish the back-to-back feat. He got seven of the 11 votes cast by the media, with Curry getting the other four.
Durant supplemented Curry's big scoring night with the first Finals triple-double of his career with 20 points, 12 rebounds and a post season-career-high 10 assists.
It was Durant's 28th consecutive playoff game with 20 or more points.
“Steph went out and recruited K.D. with this in mind: Winning titles,” Kerr said. “I was there in the Hamptons (at the Durant recruiting session) when we had that discussion. I don't remember anybody asking who is going to win MVP in the Finals. It was all about let's win championships together, and that's what this is about. You guys can write about MVP. We don't care.”
The sweep was the second in Warriors history, duplicating their 1975 feat, and the first in the NBA since the Cavaliers were beaten in four straight by the San Antonio Spurs in 2007.
James, perhaps playing his final game for the Cavaliers, had his least productive outing of the series, recording 23 points, seven rebounds and eight assists in his eighth consecutive trip to the Finals. He revealed after the game that he had been playing through a significant hand injury suffered after Game 1.
“To be the best player in the world and to give everything you've got in your 15th season, play all 82 games, probably one of the greatest playoff runs that we'll ever see from an individual, to carry this team the way he did all season and leading by example, it's just a testament to his character and who he is as a person and as a player,” Cavaliers coach Tyronn Lue gushed of James.
“He's a bad boy, and I love having him on our team. He fights and competes to the end. Sometimes you can give everything you've got and still come up short.”
A majority of Curry's 37 points came from outside the 3-point arc. He buried 7 of 15, and Golden State connected on 14 of 38, including 9 of 17 en route to a 61-52 halftime advantage.
The Warriors buried the Cavaliers in the third quarter, holding them to 13 points on 4-for-17 shooting. James did not have a field goal in the period, going 0-for-2, as Cleveland saw its nine-point halftime deficit balloon to as many as 21.
“It's tough,” Lue said of the challenge of defending the Warriors. “They move at such a pace, and they have five guys on the floor that can dribble, pass and shoot. They can make plays. So if you make a mistake, they're going to make you pay. That's the beauty of their team.
“Even when you do defend them well, you've still got guys like Steph and K.D. and Klay (Thompson) who can make unbelievable shots, even when you play the best of defense.”
Thompson had all 10 of his points in the third period, during which Golden State outscored the Cavaliers 25-13.
Draymond Green added nine points, nine assists and three blocks in the win, which gave Golden State six all-time championships, tying Chicago for the third-most in NBA history behind Boston (17) and the Los Angeles Lakers (16).
The Warriors blocked 13 shots in the game, with Curry and Durant joining Green with three apiece.
Andre Iguodala, playing for just the second time in the Finals, contributed 11 points to the win off the bench.
James left to a standing ovation after playing 41 of the game's first 44 minutes. The three-time champion, including 2016 when the Cavaliers beat Golden State in seven games, can opt out of his Cleveland contract this offseason.
“I hope he stays. I mean, we all know that,” Lue insisted. “But after a game like that, I'm not in any position to talk about that. I just appreciate what he's done for us this season. That's all I can really speak about.”
Kevin Love had 13 points, while JR Smith and Rodney Hood chipped in with 10 apiece for Cleveland, which shot just 34.5 percent from the field and 8-for-27 from behind the 3-point line.

Kamalraj, Ajit strike it rich
","He had planned a big jump here on Sunday. But, shortly after his first jump, a 15.75m, Tamil Nadu triple jumper K. Kamalraj felt a severe pain in his ankle. He attempted a second round, thought it was something like 16.50m but it was flagged down as a foul.
Still, Kamalraj’s first attempt was good enough for gold in the 19th Asian junior championships. India won another gold, through Ajit Kumar in the men’s 5000m, and finished third in the medals table with 17, including five gold, two silver and 10 bronze.
“My body was in top shape here. I was definitely hoping to cross 16.50m and break the National record (Arpinder Singh’s 16.45m), now I feel very bad, very sad. The ankle pain spoiled everything,” he told The Hindu.
The 18-year-old Tirupur triple jumper, who was coached by former international Nizamuddin, is now being trained by National jumps coach Bedros Bedrosian in Thiruvananthapuram. 
“I felt pain right from the first jump. Now, the doctors have told me to take a week’s rest,” he said.
Kamalraj, who has a personal best 16.41m which came last year, has already qualified for the next month’s under-20 Worlds.
There were no such worries for the Allahabad-based Ajit as he clocked a personal best 14:15.24s (previous best 14:38.10s) for the men’s 5000m gold. He had clocked a personal best in the 1500m earlier but it was only good enough for sixth place.
Meanwhile, the Indian women’s 4x400m relay team — the defending champion — was pipped at the post by Japan and had to be content with the silver.
The Indian squad, comprising Jisna Mathew, Subha Venkatesan, Nidhi Yogendra Singh and Rachna, clocked 3:41.11s.
Jisna, clearly one of the big stars of the championship with her 400m gold earlier, also won a bronze in the women’s 200m.
The results (gold medallists and Indians): Men: 200m: 1. Wei Tai-Sheng (Tpe) 21.05s.
5000m (Ind): 1. Ajit Kumar 14:15.24s; 5. Gurpreet 14:28.57.

Sakshi, Vinesh to lead Indian women wrestlers in Asian Games "," 
Olympic bronze medallist Sakshi Malik and Commonwealth Games gold winner Vinesh Phogat will lead a six-member Indian women wrestling team at the Asian Games to be held in Indonesia later this year.
Sakshi, who won bronze medals in this year’s Gold Coast Commonwealth Games as well as 2016 Rio Olympics, and Vinesh were exempted from the trials by the Wrestling Federation of India because of their current form and past performances. 
Sakshi and Vinesh will carry India’s hopes in the 50kg and 62kg freestyle categories. Four other wrestlers—Pinki (53kg), Pooja Dhanda (57kg), Divya Kakran (68kg) and Kiran (72kg)—went through the trials to book their tickets for the Asian Games.
The Asian Games will be held in Jakarta and Palembang from August 18 to September 2.

IOA president Narinder Batra seeks resolution of issues ","The Indian Olympic Association has taken strong exception to the Sports Ministry’s letter to state associations seeking conformation to the National Sports Code and principles of Good Governance. IOA president Narinder Batra, on Friday, shot off a letter to sports secretary Rahul Bhatnagar protesting the contents of the letter and its implications. 
“I am disturbed with the misinformation campaign started by the Ministry and SAI to malign me before IOA members,” Batra wrote.
Making it clear that his involvement in the committee for re-drafting the NSC (formed in early 2017) was only as president of the International Hockey Federation (FIH), Batra said, “My responsibility as president of FIH was limited only to Best International Practices in the committee and during the period of this committee and till its conclusion, I was not the president of IOA. 
“I am disturbed and disappointed to note that the Ministry and SAI are telling NSFs and SOAs that the IOA president was party to drafting of the New Sports Code, which is not true.”
He also found fault with the government of interfering in the workings of sports bodies, reminding it of the IOA’s de-recognition six years ago. “The IOA was de-recognised by IOC in 2012 and one of the reasons was interference by the government in the autonomy of the NOC and NSFs. It was recognised again only in 2014. 
“The revised IOA Statutes in 2014 had the approval of the ministry. We fail to understand what has changed between 2014 and now,” he wrote in his letter.
Further, Batra stated that the ministry had given an affidavit in the Delhi High Court that it would discuss the new draft code with all stakeholders and seek public opinion but nothing had been done so far. He also reminded the ministry of a previous meeting with then sports secretary P.K. Deb in 2013 regarding the Sports Bill which, he said, clearly mentioned that Deb had informed the IOC about the bill and a draft would be sent to the international body for consent.
He, however, ended on a positive note, seeking a meeting with the ministry to discuss concerns. “In a recent meeting on June 2, the IOA EC approved of a committee to initiate discussion with the ministry to understand concerns of Good Governance and resolve the issues,” he said.

TN triple jumper Praveen set to go places ","With his father Chithravel and uncle good at kabaddi, it did not take long for little C. Praveen to get hooked to that sport. Chithravel also used to take Praveen frequently to Thanjavur district athletics meets where the youngster did well in the long jump.
Praveen attended the SDAT Sports Hostel trials one day and found himself in Chennai where he began specialising in the long and triple jumps under coach Indira Suresh.
On Saturday, the 17-year-old produced an impressive 16.22m triple jump as he won the Tamil Nadu State senior championship gold in Tirunelveli.
That made Praveen the world’s seventh best jumper in the under-18 category.
“Everything went perfectly on my final jump,” Praveen, who has now moved to Nagercoil after his SDAT coach Indira was transferred there, told The Hindu on Monday.
He bettered his personal best, the 15.66m at the recent junior Federation Cup in Coimbatore that helped him qualify for next month’s under-20 Worlds in Finland, with his third jump (15.67) and also had a 15.99 before the big one.
That saw him getting a call to join the National camp in Thiruvananthapuram and is expected on Tuesday.
“He has good speed, good legs and is very aggressive in his jumps. I know what he is capable of,” said Romanian Bedros Bedrosian, the long and triple jumps National coach. 
Indira and Praveen travel to Tirunelveli’s Anna Stadium, a two-hour bus ride away, thrice a week as there is a synthetic track there.
Praveen is also preparing for the Youth Olympics’ Asia qualification meet which begins in Bangkok on July 4.
“My goal is to do 16.50m this year,” he said. That really sounds good!

Echevarria unleashes a monstrous leap ","Cuban teenage star Juan Miguel Echevarria won the long jump at the Stockholm Diamond League meet on Sunday with a monstrous wind assisted 8.83 metres.
In front of a 15,000 crowd in the Olympic stadium, the World indoor champion produced his stunning leap on his sixth and final effort to come just 12-centimetres short of American Mike Powell’s 8.95m world record.
Despite the excessive tail wind meaning the jump won’t last in the record books, it brought gasps from the crowd and demonstrated the incredible potential of this 19-year-old, who is now reaching distances not seen in international long jump competitions for a decade.
World No.1 Luvo Manyonga of South Africa — beaten by two centimetres in March for the indoor World title — came a distant third with 8.25m. American Jeff Henderson was second with 8.39m.
Already, though, Echevarria has big ambitions on his mind. “I’m not thinking about nine metres. I’ll have to work very hard to achieve that, it’s an enormous barrier.”
Abderrahman Samba continued his stunning form in the 400m hurdles with a run of 47.41s to beat World champion Karsten Warholm of Norway (47.81s) into second.
Samba, a Mauritanian who now runs for Qatar, not only improved his personal best but also set a new Asian record. “I was looking for something special and I got it today,” said Samba, 22, who has four Diamond League wins from four this year.
In the 200m, world champion Ramil Guliyev, the Azerbaijan-born Turk, won in a time of 19.92s. World indoor 60m champion Murielle Ahoure of the Ivory Coast was upset by Briton Dina Asher-Smith (10.93s) in the women’s 100m, though.
The results (winners only): 
Men: 100m: Hassan Taftian (Iri) 10.07s; 200m: Ramil Quliyev (Aze) 19.92; 800m: Peter Bol (Aus) 1:44.56; 5000m: Gaseleon Barega (Eth) 13:04.05; 400m hurdles: Abderrahaman Samba (Qat) 47.41.

Satish’s stunning show in 5000m
","M. Satish Kumar of Coimbatore came up with a stunning show in the men’s 5000m in the just concluded 91st Tamil Nadu State senior athletics championship at Tirunelveli.
He is just 17 and probably there may hardly be anyone of his age to have come up with such a performance in a big-ticket meet like this. 
A plus two student of Rathinapuri Corporation HSS, Satish stopped the clock at 15:15.30s for the gold.
He further added the 10,000m silver to make it doubly sweet for his coach S. Vairavanathan of the Genesis Sports Foundation here.
“This is just the beginning. He will come up with even better performances in the years to come,” said Vairavananthan. 
The 10,000m medal was a bonus as his pet events are the 3000m and 5000m,” he added.
Vairavanathan said Satish showed interest in participating in a marathon race a couple of years ago. “I could see the spark in his eyes; so I picked him up and trained him to this level.”
The coach was obviously pleased as Satish overcame some experienced runners in the field. 
“He was able to do that because he was willing to spend long hours in training. He is blessed with a good stride and style, but the big plus is his amazing lung-capacity. So be prepared for many more surprises.”

Vijay will look to regain form
","Olympic silver medallist Vijay Kumar will attempt to regain his confident trigger in rapid fire pistol when he opens competition in the 18th Kumar Surendra Singh shooting championship here on Wednesday.
It has been a struggle for Vijay, who has been out of the National squad in recent times, as he has not been able to reach even the ‘Minimum Travel Score’ of 579. In fact, Vijay had shot 566 and 567 in the last two trials. His attempt to revive fortunes by competing in the MQS section of the Munich World Cup did not fructify, as his pistol box was misplaced by the airlines when he reached Munich. Anish Bhanwala and Neeraj Kumar will also be in the fray.
That the World Championship team can have only 10 shooters in all for five of men’s pistol events, would make it difficult for the fringe shooters to make the cut.
Along with the 25m rapid fire pistol, competition will open in the men’s 10-metre air rifle, which will feature junior and youth sections. 
There will be about 600 shooters, which has forced the organisers to arrange eight relays of 70-odd participants each, and hold the air rifle finals on Thursday.

US Open: Shubhankar confident ","Shubhankar Sharma was all fired up after attending a dinner hosted by Ernie Els, the captain for the 2019 Presidents Cup, and looked desperate to produce a fine show at the US Open, which tees off at the Shinnecock Hills on Thursday. 
“This is one Major I have tried to qualify for in the past and failed to do so. So, it was very satisfying to do so this time. I had a good weekend at the Colonial (tied 20th) but was disappointed to miss the cut at the Memorial. In hindsight it made me more determined to do well at the US Open qualifiers in Columbus,” said Shubhankar. 
Talking of the course, Shubhankar said, “I have heard and read a lot about this course and I know it is a tough test but I love such challenges and this is what pro golf is all about. I am looking forward to it and hopefully I will be able to make a mark on the weekend.” 
While Shubhankar is the focus of Indian and Asian fans, the world is waiting with bated breath to witness how Tiger Woods performs at his first US Open appearance since 2015. The US Open is also the event where Woods won his 14th and last Major in 2008. 
Woods has had some good finishes this season, including a close second at the Valspar Championship
Woods, apart, there will be a lot of interest in how the other ‘veteran’ Phil Mickelson does. This is the only Major Mickelson has not won despite coming second numerous times. Dustin Johnson, who reclaimed his World No 1 spot last week, Justin Thomas, Rory McIlroy, Jordan Spieth, Rickie Fowler, Masters champion Patrick Reed and defending champion Brooks Koepka are all raring to go in the ‘peoples’ Major.

Soumya Swaminathan, who said no to 'hijab', glad her stand has been noted ","Soumya Swaminathan is overwhelmed by the response she has received following her decision to pull out of the Asian team chess championship to be held in Iran from July 26 because she doesn’t want to wear a hijab.  
“When I posted on my Facebook page that I was withdrawing from the Indian team for the Asian event because I did not wish to be forced to wear a hijab or burkha, as I see it as a violation of my human rights, I never imagined that I would be trending on Twitter,” Soumya, a former World junior champion, told The Hindu over phone from Pune on Wednesday. “I am happy to get so much support for my decision and that people in India have become aware of the issue.”
She said the decision wasn’t difficult at all. “I had written to the organisers in Iran asking them whether any exception could be made about wearing the hijab, but they replied in the negative, very politely,” she said. “When I played in Iran seven years ago, I had felt very uncomfortable playing with a hijab. I had decided then that I would never compete in a tournament in which such dress codes were in place.”
She is not the first chess player to have taken such a stance.
 Some top players, including reigning champion Mariya Muzychuk of Ukraine, had boycotted the Women’s World championship held in Tehran last year. The United States champion Nazi Paikidze-Barnes had even started a petition to relocate the tournament, citing religious and sexual discrimination. 
“I had signed the petition,” said Soumya. “I believe that sports bodies should ensure that major events are held in countries where freedom for the participants is not denied.”

Football shadow looms over UTT season 2 "," With the football World Cup looming over it, the CEAT Ultimate Table Tennis (UTT) promoters would be hoping that at least their fraternity does not turn its back on the tournament’s second edition, which will commence on Thursday at the Shree Shiv Chhatrapati sports complex.
Joao Monteiro, the Portuguese veteran who will be leading Maharashtra United, will be hoping to avenge last year’s semifinal loss to eventual champion Falcons TTC during the tournament-opener even as the 34-year-old veteran will also be keeping an eye on Friday night’s World Cup clash between Portugal and Spain.
After all, Cristiano Ronaldo used to be his sparring partner at times during Monteiro’s first stint with the Sporting academy in Lisbon. Monteiro recalls that Ronaldo, who also was at Sporting, would be a regular in the table tennis hall. 
“Ronaldo enjoyed playing table tennis. Almost everyday before practice, he would come with a few friends and play with us. Even now he mentions table tennis as his hobby,” Monteiro told The Hindu after his team’s training on Wednesday. 


Having led Portuguese table tennis’ rise, thanks to the team’s fifth-place finish at the London Olympics in 2012 and the team gold at the European championship two years later, Monteiro is chuffed to be among the most sought-after sportspersons in Portugal besides footballers. But he still has a regret of sorts.
“I am a team match lover. I love playing for somebody than playing for myself,” Monteiro says. “This is my sport. Yes, it is primarily an individual sport but many competitions are team events. I love playing team matches. Many time when I speak with friends, I feel maybe I am not in the right sport because I love playing team sport. But I have learnt to deal with it.”
Maharashtra United would be hoping the veteran would help them get off the blocks by upsetting the defending champion come Thursday.

“I couldn’t have asked for a better start to the grass court season. In the first set, I was serving well and he was a bit slow which helped me take it,” said Prajnesh.
“In the second set, I played one loose game and he capitalised while I couldn’t convert the breakpoint chances I had. But in the third set, I got my return games going and raced to a 5-0 lead and could have closed it out sooner but still I am very happy with the way it turned out.”
Speaking on the pain of missing out on the French Open, Prajnesh said, “I felt bad for a few days and I did not compete well in that challenger tournament, but I got over it quickly.”

Surf’s up ","With pale yellow surfboards tucked under their arms, a group of youngsters head to the sea at Rushikonda. They hop on top of the surf boards and fearlessly tame the waves. Amidst the rush of tourists, seafood restaurants and fast-food vendors, a small community of boys from the neighbouring fishing village has transformed this sleepy coastal destination into a popular surfing spot. And training them since 2006 is Melville Smythe, the man who started the Waveriders’ Surf School (WSS) and brought about a change to the lives of 15 kids from the fishing community. 
While the boys of WSS have had their special moments when international cricketers and expert surfers came down to the coast to surf with them, the young surfers are nurturing a different dream today. They aspire to represent their country in the Olympics some day. With surfing set to make its much-anticipated foray into Olympics in 2020 in Toyko, the young wave riders feel that they may finally have their moment in the sun. Like the waves he has braved to conquer, Smythe waded through a sea of challenges to set up the Waveriders’ Surf School — which has hosted names such as Jonty Rhodes, Paddy Upton and Sam Billings from the international cricketing fraternity. “The initial challenge was to bring about a change in the mindset of these kids who would often resort to begging on streets and frequently bunked school. It took a while for me to convince them to pick up the surfboard to make a living out of it. The sport helped discover many hidden talents among the kids,” says the 55-year-old national level surfing and sailing expert, who is currently associated with the Sports Authority of Andhra Pradesh. And now, he is hoping to draw the attention of the State Government to host a surf festival in the city and more importantly, get some financial backing to make the dreams of the young talented surfers come true. 
A prodigy
Twenty-year-old Kalyan Rayithi, who hails from the fishing community, would have taken to his family profession had it not been for the surfboard that he discovered as an 11-year-old. Over the past decade, Rayithi has won several national level competitions held in Mahabalipuram (Tamil Nadu), Puri (Odisha) and Puducherry. But his most memorable moment was when Jonty Rhodes came up to him at India’s top surfing competition Covelong Point Surf, and introduced him to the media as a “surfing prodigy”. A first year student of business administration, Rayithi’s heart lies in surfing. But what’s holding him back is the exposure and lack of funds to travel to some of the country’s best surfing locations and participate in competitions. One of his biggest achievements is the surfboard he won while competing with international surfers in Puducherry in 2012. He was ranked No. 1 in his category then. After that incident, Rayithi had accompanied Rhodes and his family on surfing vacations to Kerala. Rhodes knows most of the young surfers of Rushikonda by their names. “He once told me that he loves surfing more than cricket,” says Rayithi. 
From a mix of epic waves to beautiful, small glassy swells, time and again the waters of Rushikonda have been termed as a ‘surfer’s delight’. There are tourists from across India and passionate surfers from countries like France, USA and South Africa who have traced their way to the sands here. India has about two dozen listed surfing spots, mostly clustered around the South of the country. 
Rushikonda beach features on the list of the popular surfing site magicseaweed.com that gives surfers all the required information about the swell consistency and wind overview. 
Promising future
The last time cricketer Paddy Upton came to the city to surf, he was floored by the passion of the small community of surfers at Rushikonda who were trying to popularise the spot. In an earlier interview he had said, “There are five or six places that are known for surfing in India and Visakhapatnam has the potential to be right on top of the list. It has great waves and a fantastic beach,” and added: “If international cricketers come here and get floored by the beauty of the waves in Rushikonda, I can promise you that it will be great for you guys as well. Just give it a try.” While the Tokyo Olympics may be too early for the region’s young surfers, the future certainly seems bright. 
The bigger challenge now plaguing the surfing community is the garbage strewn beaches that are a big blow to the image of this surfing hub. This year, Rhodes and other cricketers gave the coast a miss when they came down to India for the IPL.

Protesting compulsory hijab rule, Soumya Swaminathan pulls out of Iran chess tournament "," Woman Grandmaster Soumya Swaminathan has withdrawn from the Asian Nations Cup Chess Championship to be held in Iran next month objecting to the country’s compulsory headscarf rule.
In a Facebook post last week, city girl Soumya, who had won the World Junior Girls’ Championship in Argentina in 2009, called the Iranian law of “compulsory headscarf to be in direct violation of my basic human rights, including my right to freedom of expression, thought, conscience and religion.”
“I do not wish to be forced to wear a headscarf or burqa. I find the Iranian law of compulsory headscarf to be in direct violation of my basic human rights, including my right to freedom of expression and right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion. It seems that under the present circumstances, the only way for me to protect my rights is to not go to Iran,” said the 29-year-old in her post which went viral on social media. 
The tournament is to be held in Hamadan from July 26 to August 4. 
 Swaminathan, ranked 97 in the world among women chess players, further remarked that she was “disappointed” to see that player’s rights and welfare being given scant importance while organising official championships.
Rebuking chess authorities for not taking the players’ considerations into account while choosing venues, Swaminathan said: “I understand the organizers expecting us to wear our national team dress or formals or sporting attire for our games during official championships, but surely there is no place for an enforceable religious dress code in Sports.”
She further asserted that despite certain compromises a sportsperson might make, “some things could not be compromised upon.”
In 2016, Indian pistol shooter Heena Sidhu had similarly pulled out of the Asian Airgun Shooting Championship in Iran owing to the compulsory hijab rule for women athletes.
In 2016, Georgian-American chess champion Nazi Paikidze boycotted the world championship in Tehran, taking to Instagram to call the hijab law “oppressive”.
In 2017 the Iranian Chess Federation banned 19-year-old Dorsa Derakhshani – the country’s second woman international chess master - for attending competitions abroad without wearing the headscarf, compelling her to play from the U.S. side.

Smashing outing for Manika, Sathiyan at UTT
","Golden girl Manika Batra and giant-killer G. Sathiyan showcased their readiness to take over the mantle of Indian table tennis from veteran A. Sharath Kamal at a packed Shri Shiv Chhatrapati Sports Complex auditorium on the third night of the CEAT Ultimate Table Tennis.
Thanks to Batra and Sathiyan Dabang Smashers cruised to a comfortable 14-7 win over fancied Warriors.
After struggling to find her rhythm, Batra changed tactics effectively to force left-handed Austrian and World No. 18 Sofia Polcanova into committing mistakes.
Batra also raised her game to win the golden point in the opening and the deciding games.
Sharath tried his best to get Warriors back into the match by pocketing the opening game against Japan's Yoshida Masaki. But the World No. 27 was too consistent to handle for Sharath.
Once Sharath and Hana Matelova conceded tamely to Sathiyan and Sakura Mori in the mixed doubles, the result was all but sealed.
Sathiyan then upset Chin-Yuan Chuang of Chinese Taipei in the penultimate rubber. He not only matched the World No. 15 rally for rally, but also won most of the long rallies to register one of the most memorable victories of his career.
The results: Dabang Smashers bt Warriors 14-7 [Manika Batra bt Sofia Polcanova 11-10, 5-11, 11-10; Yoshida Masaki bt A.

Dustin Johnson has history on his side at the US Open
"," Dustin Johnson has history on his side going into the weekend at the U.S. Open golf. 
Johnson became the seventh player to lead by at least four shots after 36 holes in more than a century of this 72-hole championship. Only one player failed to win the trophy, and that was in 1909 when Tom McNamara sputtered on the weekend. 
Johnson was the only player under par 4-under 136 and led by four shots over Scott Piercy and Charley Hoffman. 
Three major champions were within five shots Henrik Stenson, Justin Rose and defending champion Brooks Koepka. The sun was out, and there was just enough wind in the Hamptons for Shinnecock Hills to remain the tough test it has been over the opening two days. 
The scores: 136 - Dustin Johnson 69-67; 140 - Scott Piercy 69-71, Charley Hoffman 71-69. 
141 - Tommy Fleetwood 75-66, Henrik Stenson 71-70, Justin Rose 71-70, Brooks Koepka 75-66, Ian Poulter 69-72; 142 - Russell Henley 69-73, Rickie Fowler 73-69; 143 - Marc Leishman (AUS) 74-69, Matthew Fitzpatrick 73-70, Charles Howell 71-72.

Ayhika and Manav cause a flutter
","The second day of the CEAT Ultimate Table Tennis belonged to the Indians as Ayhika Mukherjee and Manav Thakkar stunned top paddlers during the RP-SG Mavericks and Empowerji Challengers contest on Friday.
While Ayhika set the tone for Mavericks’ victory by surprising World No. 20 Lee Ho Ching of Hong Kong in the opening rubber, rising star Manav overpowered the China-born Ukrainian Kou Lei, the World No. 33, to pull things level for Challengers.
In the other matches, Harmeet Desai stretched Tiago Apolonia before losing 11-10 in the final game, while local girl Divya Deshpande, making her UTT debut, gave the fans at the Shree Shiv Chhatrapati sports complex plenty to cheer about despite going down to the seasoned Sabine Winter. Mavericks, though, had little trouble in winning the tie, with Winter sealing the deal by winning the opening game. 
Ayhika, after losing the opening game, used her long pimples to upstage Ching. She also minimised her errors, keeping her more fancied opponent under pressure. Manav then registered probably the biggest victory of his career by not letting Lei get into any rhythm. 
The results: RP-SG Mavericks bt Empowerji Challengers 13-8 (Ayhika Mukherjee bt Lee Ho Ching 4-11, 11-2, 11-5; Kou Lei lost to Manav Thakkar 4-11, 7-11, 11-10; Harmeet Desai & Doo Hoi Kem bt Arjun Ghosh & Lee Ho Ching 11-9, 11-8, 10-11; Mattias Karlsson bt Simon Gauzy 8-11, 11-7, 11-7; Doo Hoi Kem bt Georgina Pota 11-1, 11-8, 6-11; Harmeet lost to Tiago Apolonia 11-8, 6-11, 10-11; Sabine Winter bt Divya Deshpande 11-8, 11-9, 11-5.

Mavericks pip United in TT thriller
","On a night that saw the golden point rule the roost, the Karlssons from Sweden — Mattias and Kristian — stole the limelight as RP-SG Mavericks edged out Maharashtra United in a nail-biting CEAT Ultimate Table Tennis contest on Sunday. 
In the first of the four ties that were decided in the last of the 21 games at the Shree Shiv Chhatrapati sports complex, Sabine Winter kept her nerve to pip Madhurika Patkar 3-0 and take the Mavericks to a 11-10 win against the home team.
Spellbound 
So high was the quality of table tennis and so little to differentiate the sides, it left the full house spellbound. 
Nine of the 21 games, including the final game of the tie, were decided through golden point, a UTT innovation. Winter trailed Madhurika 8-10 in the tie-deciding third game but backed her aggressive instincts to win three points in a row.
The UTT format doesn’t allow two Indians to face each other in a singles match. 
As both sides had a top-ranked Swede in their camp, the teams decided to pit them against each other. The Karlssons, friends off the field, enthralled the audience with some breathtaking table tennis. 
United, trailing 6-3, was looking forward to World No. 18 Kristian to put it back on track. 
The southpaw didn’t disappoint, his forehand top-spin helping him dominate the first two games. However, the lanky Mattias fought back to win the third, with some powerful forehand kills. 
United’s Elizabeta Samara then earned three vital points against Doo Hoi Kem before veteran Joao Monteiro turned the tables on Harmeet Desai to put United on the brink of a win as it led 10-8 going into the final match. But, Winter turned the tide in Mavericks’ favour. 
The results: 
RP-SG Mavericks bt Maharashtra United 11-10 (Ayhika Mukherjee bt Lily Zhang 10-11, 11-5, 11-10; Kou Lei bt Anthony Amalraj 10-11, 11-10, 11-5; Harmeet Desai & Doo Hoi Kem bt Anthony Amalraj & Elizabeta Samara 11-5, 11-6, 5-11; Mattias Karlsson lost to Kristian Karlsson 9-11, 6-11, 11-10; Doo Hoi Kem lost to Elizabeta Samara 5-11, 10-11, 8-11; Harmeet Desai lost to Joao Monteiro 11-10, 9-11, 10-11; Sabine Winter bt Madhurika Patkar 11-7, 11-9, 11-10).

Golf: Johnson falters to be in four-way lead in US Open
","Dustin Johnson three-putted the final hole to fall into a four-way tie for the lead with fellow Americans Brooks Koepka, Daniel Berger and Tony Finau after the third round at the U.S. Open on Saturday.
Johnson carded a seven-over-par 77 but still found himself sharing the lead after surviving brutal conditions as Koepka set himself up for a shot at successfully defending his title.
Johnson steadied himself after squandering a four-shot advantage on the front nine at Shinnecock Hills as the field bunched up like rush hour traffic on the Long Island Expressway.
Tough conditions
The 2016 champion negotiated the back nine in one-over on a day when strong winds and low humidity baked the greens dry and left some on the verge of being unplayable.
Johnson, Koepka (72), Daniel Berger (66) and Tony Finau (66) led Englishman Justin Rose (73) by one stroke, and Swede Henrik Stenson (74) by two.
Though Saturday showed that no lead is safe at the toughest test in golf, nothing was likely to create more discussion than Phil Mickelson’s bizarre decision.
Mickelson insisted he meant no disrespect when he opted to putt a moving ball, swallowing a sextuple bogey at the 13th hole.
His bogey putt skated past the cup and was heading down a slope when he trotted after it and batted it back toward the hole with his putter. 
He needed eight strokes to get the ball in the hole and with a two-stroke penalty walked off with a sextuple bogey 10.
“Look, I don't mean disrespect to anybody,” he said. “I know it’s a two-shot penalty. At that time, I just didn't feel like going back and forth and hitting the same shot over.
Top scores: 
213: Daniel Berger 76-71-66, Tony Finau 75-72-66, Brooks Koepka 75-66-72, Dustin Johnson 69-67-77; 214: Justin Rose 71-70-73; 215: Henrik Stenson 71-70-74.

Mehuli Ghosh is best of the best
"," 
Commonwealth Games silver medallist Mehuli Ghosh continued to make waves as she shot a 632.7 in the qualification stage of women’s air rifle in the 18th Kumar Surendra Singh shooting championship at the Dr. Karni Singh Range, Tughlakabad, on Sunday.
Competing in the second relay that had all the best shooters in the country, the 17-year-old Mehuli, who is coached by Olympian Joydeep Karmakar, stood tall with a near World record score.
It was a better average than 10.5 over 60 shots, with 10.9 as the perfect.
Mehuli who had a series of 105.9, 105.3, 105.7, 106.4, 104.4 and 105.0 was a mere 0.7 points off the World record shot by Zhu Yingjie of China in the World Cup in Fort Benning.
Such a high level of consistency was not a surprise as Mehuli had shot a record 252.8 during the mixed air rifle final on Saturday, a score that was 0.4 points better than the World record by another Chinese Zhao Ruozhu who shot it in the World Cup in Changwon in April.
Meghana Sajjanar (628.0), Anjum Moudgil (627.2) who holds a World record in rifle 3-position, Elavenil Valarivan (627.1), Neha Chaphekar (625.3), Shreya Agrawal (624.3), Barkha Chauhan (623.3) and World Championship finalist Avneet Sidhu (622.7) followed Mehuli in her relay.
Asian champion Pooja Ghatkar (622.4), Elizabeth Susan Koshy (619.2), Olympian Ayonika Paul (619.1), former National champion Mampi Das (618.7) were not in a position to fight for a berth in the eight-shooter final, in a strong field of about 350 shooters.
Even Samrat Chahal who topped the first relay with 623.5, may find it hard to make the cut, as the qualification continues on Monday, culminating in the finals in the afternoon.
Mihika Poore who topped the third relay with 621.6 stood no chance.
Meanwhile, in 25-metre standard pistol, Adarsh Singh won the men’s and junior gold medals, with a score of 576. Anish Bhanwala who had won the junior World Championship gold in the event in Suhl last year, placed fourth among juniors with 561.
The results:
25m standard pistol: Men: 1. Adarsh Singh 576; 2. Rajat Kumar Yadav 572; 3. Shivam Shukla 571.
Junior men: 1. Adarsh Singh 576; 2. Vijayveer Sidhu 565; 3. Sambhaji Patil 563.

Smashers make their intentions clear
","Having acquired the services of two of India’s in-form paddlers for the CEAT Ultimate Table Tennis’ second edition, Dabang Smashers TTC has hopes to better its third-place finish in the inaugural season.
The Smashers paddlers displayed their swag in abundance as they thumped defending champion Falcons TTC 17-4 on Monday night at the Shree Shiv Chhatrapati Sports Complex. 
The win catapulted Smashers to the top of the points table with 31 while Falcons remained in the fourth position with 15.
Manika Batra continued her giant-killing spree by accounting for World No. 30 Matilda Ekholm in the opening match. The Indian displayed tremendous control with her long-pimpled rubber, after losing the opening game.
Once Manika had given the impetus, Smashers dominated the next two matches, with Japanese Yoshida Masaki thumping India’s Sanil Shetty and the mixed doubles combination of Sathiyan and Sakura Mori rolling over Shetty and Bernadette Szocs.
Even though Liam Pitchford overcame Masaki, the Englishman only delayed the inevitable for Falcons. 
When Puerto Rican Adriana Diaz, the youngest among the 24 Olympians participating in the league, stunned Szocs in the first two games, Falcons had pocketed the tie with seven games to spare. 
With virtually nothing to lose, Sathiyan showcased his artistry with forehand top-spins and side-spin serves to outsmart lower-ranked Spaniard Alvaro Robles in straight games. 
Mori then capped off a perfect evening for her team by making short work of Falcons’ Sutirtha Mukherjee, the National women’s champion. 
The results: Dabang Smashers TTC bt Falcons TTC 17-4 (Manika Batra bt Matilda Ekholm 8-11, 11-10, 11-10; Yoshida Masaki bt Sanil Shetty 11-5, 11-4, 11-8; G.

Khade satisfied with his progress
","Virdhawal Khade recorded a personal best timing of 22.52s in 50m freestyle to go under the Asian Games qualification mark of 22.91s set by the Swimming Federation of India. 
During the selection trials for the Asian Games held at the Padukone-Dravid Centre for Sports Excellence here over the weekend, the 26-year-old eclipsed his own performance — the best by an Indian — which came nearly a decade ago (2009, 22.55s).
The team for Jakarta is expected to be announced after the National sub-junior & junior aquatic championships in Pune (June 24 to 29).
“It is definitely satisfying,” Khade told The Hindu on Monday. “I have been working really hard and I expect to get much better in the coming months leading up to the games.”
Khade, a bronze medallist in 50m butterfly at the 2010 Guangzhou Asian Games, is on the comeback trail. After having missed four straight high-profile events — the 2012 and 2016 Olympics and the 2014 Commonwealth and Asian Games — he had to go through an Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) surgery last year.
At the Commonwealth Games in Gold Coast in April, Khade’s timing was only 23.11s as he crashed out in the Heats. But the recent improvement will be greatly encouraging.
“The legs have been much better in the last few months,” he said. “Immediately after the surgery they weren’t really performing as well as I wanted them to. Now they are good.”
Khade also credited the “world-class” facilities at the Padukone-Dravid Centre — which boasts of a state-of-the-art pool built by Myrtha, the official pool designers for the Olympics — for his effort.

Asiad more competitive than CWG: Ponappa ","Ashwini Ponnappa is eyeing a podium finish at the upcoming Asian Games but the ace shuttler conceded that the continental games are more competitive than the Commonwealth Games with some top badminton nations in the fray.
Ponappa had played a crucial role in India winning its first ever gold medal in a team event at the Commonwealth Games early this year. 
“At the international level there are no easy games as every team has quality players but yes the Asian Games are more competitive than the Commonwealth as the top badminton nations like China, Japan, Korea, Indonesia and Thailand are a part of it,” the 28-year-old shuttler, who plays doubles, told PTI.
The Asian Games are scheduled to be held in Indonesia from August 18 to September 2 in Jakarta and Palembang.
“It would be a great challenge to compete against these teams as it would test our skills, speed and endurance. We aim to put our best foot forward and look for a podium finish in the Asian Games,” Ponappa said. “We finished on the podium in the last Asian Games in the women’s team event. The ultimate goal is to get gold for the nation. So definitely the team is looking for a podium finish at the Asian Games. 
“It would not be easy but we have to train hard and give our 100 per cent on the court if we are to win a medal. It is important to keep the focus intact and not crumble under pressure,” the Olympian added. 
Ponappa also said that that she would be taking part in the World championships. 
“The next big tournament would be the World championships. It is going to be a busy schedule but my preparations have been going on and things have worked out well. I had a good training block after the Commonwealth Games before taking a tiny break and have some much needed time off before these major events to get back fresh and continue training,” she said.

Koepka triumphant in title defence
","American Brooks Koepka putted brilliantly to win the U.S. Open by one stroke at Shinnecock Hills on Sunday, becoming the first player in almost 30 years to successfully defend his title.
England’s Tommy Fleetwood gave him a run for his money with a seven-under 63 that matched the lowest score in tournament history, but Koepka’s closing 68 saw him finish top of the leaderboard on one-over 281.
Dustin Johnson was left to ponder another Major that got away. After starting the day in a four-way tie for the lead with Koepka, Daniel Berger and Tony Finau, 2016 champion Johnson carded a 70 to finish two shots back in third place.
Masters champion Patrick Reed (68) was fourth, three strokes behind Koepka, after his early charge — five birdies on the first seven holes — faltered.
With the win, Koepka became the first player to win back-to-back U.S. Opens since Curtis Strange in 1988 and 1989.
The victory comes less than two months after Koepka returned from a left wrist injury, a partially torn tendon that had kept him out of action since January.
The 28-year-old had his work cut out to beat Fleetwood after everyone else stalled in conditions that were more conducive to good scores than on Saturday.
Fleetwood, playing more than two hours ahead of the overnight leaders and starting the day six shots off the pace, had threatened to steal a stunning victory after reeling off four consecutive birdies from the 12th hole.
He had good chances to birdie the final three holes but missed them all, including an uphill eight-footer at the last with history beckoning.
 Koepka birdied the 10th hole to take a two-shot lead at even par.
But just as it seemed he had grabbed the championship by the throat he misjudged his tee shot on the par-three 11th and watched his ball rocket over the crowned green and hurtle way beyond into the rough.
He did well to salvage bogey, sinking a 12-foot putt to stay ahead.
A hot putter kept him in front as he made clutch pars on the next three holes.
Needing only a bogey on the last to win, Koepka hooked his approach so far left it bounced off the base of a grandstand, but he pitched onto the green and lagged his first putt close before tapping in to earn victory. 
The results: 
281 - Brooks Koepka 75-66-72-68; 282 - Tommy Fleetwood 75-66-78-63; 283 - Dustin Johnson 69-67-77-70.

Mavericks keep winning
","Doo Hoi Kem and Mattias Karlsson, the top-ranked singles players in the RP-SP Mavericks camp proved the difference against Dabang Smashers in the 13-8 triumph in a battle involving two previously-undefeated teams in the Ultimate Table Tennis league here on Wednesday. 
Doo, ranked 13th among the women and Mattias, ranked 20th in the men’s world list, raced away to 3-0 victories over Sakura Mori and G. Sathiyan in successive matches to give Mavericks the crucial 11th point in the 21-game tie. 
In the day’s final clash, that pitched the experience of 34-year old Mouma Das against the exuberance of 17-year-old Adriana Diaz, the veteran Indian prevailed over the World No. 38 2-1 to enhance the winning margin. 
Even as Mavericks maintained its all-win record to reach 37 points, Smashers remained atop the points-table by reaching 39. These two teams are almost sure of being among the semifinalists. 
Manika bounces back
Smashers’ Manika Batra continued her undefeated run after accounting for the all-conquering Sabina Winter. Relying increasingly on her backhand blocks and looking to finish with her fast improving forehand drives, Manika made light of the loss of the first game by winning the next two against Sabine who had not dropped a game in two encounters. 
But the joy for Smashers was short-lived as Harmeet Desai, ranked 81, upstaged 27th-ranked Yoshida Masaki. After the duo of G. Sathiyan and a screeching Sakura Mori maintained their unbeaten run, Cendric Nuoytinck kept his slate clean by upsetting 33rd-ranked Kou Lie that helped Smashers stay ahead. However, Doo, Mattias and Mouma won eight of the last nine games to seal Mavericks’ win. 
The results: RP-SG Mavericks bt Debang Smashers 13-8 (Sabine Winter lost to Manika Batra 11-4, 3-11, 7-11; Harmeet Desai bt Yoshida Masaki 8-11, 11-10, 11-9; Harmeet Desai & Doo Hoi Kem lost to G.

Indian junior squash team will win a medal: Mishra ","Three sessions a day for three weeks. The Indian boys have been training hard for the last three days at the ISA courts to make their mark in a tough field at the World junior (under-19) championships to be held here between July 18 and 29.
Deepak Mishra, head coach of the boys’ team, while admitting it would be difficult for India to win a medal, he expected the boys to create an upset or two in the individual section and aim for a fifth-place finish in the team event.
“In the last edition [Bielsko-Biała] in 2016, our boys finished sixth, and we are keen to go one better,” said the 23-year-old Mishra.
Mishra was hopeful of Utkarsh Baheti, Veer Chotrani and Yash Fatde making a impact and creating a few upsets. 
“The boys have been putting in a lot of hard work in training. I hope that they cause a few upsets,” he said. “If any of our boys could reach the quarterfinals, it will be a big thing.”
Tough going, but...
Cyrus Poncha, the National coach, who is also the tournament director for the World juniors, conceded that the boys were very young and hence would find the going difficult. He was optimistic of the same boys doing well at the World juniors two years later. “We will win a medal and [hopefully] a gold then,” said Poncha.
Meanwhile, in the draw released on Tuesday, defending champions Marwan Tarek and Rowan Elaraby of Egypt have been given top billing in the boys’ and girls’ sections respectively.
The top 16 boys seeds comprise six Egyptians, three Englishmen, two Malaysians apart from players from USA, Canada, Mexico, Colombia and Switzerland. On the other hand, the women’s seedings has players from Egyot, Malaysia, England, Hong Kong, USA and Scotland with Egypt looking to capture the team title for the eighth year in a row.

In praise of the Slim Reaper: How Kevin Durant has changed NBA
","For the second season running, Kevin Durant was the Finals MVP, enabling the Golden State Warriors to repeat as champions. 
The Warriors-Cleveland Cavaliers tussle for glory (the fourth in four years, with the Warriors winning three) featured little competition this time. Durant helped apply the finishing touches, scoring points whenever Cavaliers threatened to keep it close, and playing suffocating defence against the great LeBron James and in the paint.
Few basketball connoisseurs will begrudge Durant his MVP awards. And no one who saw them will forget the dagger three-pointers that settled Game 3, both in 2017 and in 2018, away in Cleveland.
That said, despite his successes, Durant will not be spoken of in the same breath as LeBron, who will be credited with carrying a far inferior team deep into contention four seasons running. Durant, on the other hand, joined the world-beating Warriors that had broken the all-time regular season record in 2015-16 and had narrowly lost the Finals to a LeBron-inspired Cavs. There is merit to the argument that Durant, a former MVP who led the league in individual scoring in four of his first nine seasons at Oklahoma City Thunder, simply bandwagoned onto a team dripping with talent.
A squad that featured superstar Stephen Curry, his “splash-brother” Klay Thompson, Swiss army knife Draymond Green and versatile sixth man Andre Iguodala did not need Durant. His addition only launched the team further into the stratosphere of all-time greatness. For many critics, this diminishes Durant’s achievements; he will forever trail LeBron unless he drags a lesser squad to a title like The King did.
Durant has been discomfited by this argument, and has used the criticism to fuel his ambition. He has taken pay cuts to allow the Warriors to retain its strong talent. More importantly, he has sought to better himself as a player. Durant’s trajectory from scoring freak to all-round lynchpin is worth studying before judging him.
Durant was picked second in the 2007 draft by Seattle Supersonics, who later became Oklahoma City Thunder. Within a few years, Thunder became a powerful contender in the Western Conference — first as an athletic, three-headed scoring monster (forward Durant, point guard Russell Westbrook and shooting guard James Harden) and later as an all-round team. Durant was a key element of both units. He used his freakish length and unusual silkiness in jump-shots and guard-like play (despite being 7ft tall) to overpower perimeter defenders. He could also play one-on-one at the post, run hard and finish in transition.
Glory evaded the Thunder teams for various reasons — Harden was traded after they reached the 2012 Finals due to salary cap issues, and injuries sabotaged their chances. But primarily, Thunder seemed a squad where the sum of the individual talent was greater than the actual output, and Durant was partly responsible. He played in a one-dimensional offensive system that depended upon ‘hero-ball’.
Thunder’s best season, ironically, was Durant’s last. In 2015-16, they came close to upending defending champion Warriors. They led 3-1 in the series and were cruising in Game 6 before a Klay Thompson special put paid to their chances. During the Playoffs, Durant showed dramatic improvement in his defensive game — he played his height, his shot-blocking in the paint was first-rate — and commentators wondered if it was only a matter of time before Thunder caught up with Warriors. It was not to be, as Durant promptly switched to the Bay Area later in the off-season.
Despite the criticism of this decision, Durant has shown that his all-round performance in the 2015-16 Playoffs was no fluke. His shot-blocking has been off the charts as a Warrior, he has retained his efficient scoring (eased as it is in a stellar offensive system), and has adapted to playing both in the perimeter and in the paint. In sum, Durant has achieved what he set out to — develop as player and become the lynchpin of a phenomenal squad, forcing the competition to keep up. He deserves to be appreciated for this, even though not everyone can find it within them to cherish him.

Kabaddi Masters: India crushes Pakistan
","India cruised past Pakistan 36-20 in their opening match of the Kabaddi Masters Dubai on Friday. 
Pakistan paid a heavy price for poor defending, which allowed India to march on unchecked. The Pakistan antis frequently broke the chain to attempt silly solo tackles. 
For the Indian raiders, led by skipper Ajay Thakur, it was easy pickings. 
Pakistan stayed competitive in the early minutes, holding India to a manageable 8-10 deficit. An all-out, however, saw India seize the initiative with a 14-8 lead. A second all-out gave India a huge 25-9 advantage. 
Pakistan’s Ibrar Hussain attempted to infuse some life with a low reverse leg-sweep raid, and gained a touch on Surender. His Indian teammates, however, piled on Ibrar to snuff his challenge. 
The energetic crowd, which included actor Abhishek Bachhan and Sports Minister Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore, perhaps would have loved to see a closer encounter. 
The result: India bt Pakistan 36-20.

Ultimate Table Tennis: Sanil excels in Falcons’ resounding win
"," Sanil Shetty shook off his poor form and set the pace for defending champion Falcons’ commanding 15-6 win over Warriors in the Ultimate Table Tennis league here on Friday. 
Making a mockery of World rankings, the 108th ranked Sanil upstaged Commonwealth Games silver medallist and World No. 22 Aruna Quadri 2-1, to follow his straight-set victory over the Nigerian last season. 
The left-handed Sanil, who appeared too tentative during the Pune leg, reproduced his aggressive best that helped the side win the title last year. Significantly, Sanil came good on a day when the team needed to lift itself from the bottom of the table, having tallied just 15 points from two encounters. 
Moving up in placings
As things stand, after three rounds, Falcons (30 points) is placed third while Warriors (27) have slipped to fifth. For Warriors, unless World No 15 Chih Yuan Chuang, Quadri and 47th-ranked Sharath Kamal come good in the remaining two rounds, a semifinal spot looks difficult. 
Sanil, even after defeating Quadri was not done with Warriors. He returned to the arena in the company of Bernadette Szocs and stunned Sharath and Sofia Polcanova in mixed doubles. 
The 36th-ranked Szocs, laid low by indisposition, also contributed by shocking 18th-ranked Sofia 2-1 in a match where every set was decided on ‘golden point’. 
England’s Liam Pitchford, ranked 49th, played his part to perfection by upsetting Chih Yuan Chuang 2-1 and then stopped an error-prone Sharath by a similar margin to remain unbeaten in four encounters. 
Warriors’ lone victory came when 51st-ranked Hana Matelova bounced back to stop Sutitha Mukherjee. 
The results: Falcons bt Warriors 15-6 (Matilda Ekholm bt Pooja Saharabuddhe 11-4, 11-3, 11-5; Sanil Shetty bt Aruna Quadri 11-6, 5-11, 11-10; Sanil Shetty & Bernadette Szocs bt Sharath Kamal & Sofia Polcanova 11-4, 11-7, 11-9; Liam Pitchford bt Chih Yuan Chuang 11-10, 5-11, 11-7; Benadette Szocs bt Sofia Polcanova 10-11, 11-10, 11-10; Pitchford bt Sharath 11-9, 11-4, 10-11; Sutirtha Mukherjee lost to Hana Matelova 11-10, 3-11, 5-11).

Khade upstages Schooling, takes gold ","Advait Page broke the men’s 1500m national record by nearly 20 seconds as he won the gold in the 14th Singapore National swimming championships in Singapore on Friday.
The youngster, from Madhya Pradesh, clocked an Indian best time of 15:25.98s which broke the previous record of 15:45.83 set by Kerala’s Sajan Prakash in 2014. 
It also helped him go past the Swimming Federation of India’s qualification standard for the coming Asian Games (15:33.21, sixth place of 2014 Incheon Asiad).
“That was absolutely spectacular, many of the swimmers are coming up with awesome timings,” prominent swimming coach Nihar Ameen, the Dronacharya awardee, told The Hindu from Singapore on Friday evening. 
Advait had broken the 800m national record earlier with a time of 8:10.22s. Meanwhile National record holder Virdhawal Khade won the men’s 100m freestyle gold in 50.26s and in the process defeated the host Singapore’s Joseph Schooling, the Rio Olympics champion. Schooling was third with 50.49s. 
Later, Karnataka’s Arvind Mani bettered the men’s 100m back stroke national record while finishing third with 56.38s (previous 57.95s). However, he narrowly failed to make the cut for the Asiad (qual. time 56.35). 
Sandeep Sejwal, the national record holder, had won the silver in the men’s 100m breast stroke on Thursday in 1:02.33s. Sejwal had won the 50m breast stroke bronze medal at the Incheon Asiad.

By half-time, with India up 27-9, the game was all but over.

United puts it past Smashers
","In a dream comeback, Maharashtra United bounced back from 2-7 to shock table-topper Dabang Smashers 12-9 as Romania’s Elizabeta Samara and A. Amalraj provided a late impetus in a thrilling encounter of the Ultimate Table Tennis league here on Saturday. 
United’s late burst, winning the last seven sets, pushed into the background the winning efforts of Japanese Sakura Mori.
For United, Portugal’s Joao Monteiro started the comeback by playing way above his World ranking of 71 to down 27th-ranked Japanese Yoshida Masaki. 
Samara, having recovered from a twisted ankle suffered on Thursday, presented herself to play two singles and showed what grit is all about. 
Ranked 19th in the world, she soaked in the pressure to beat 17-year-old Adriana Diaz, ranked 38th, 2-1 and saved her best against Manika in the final singles. 
In between Samara’s victories, Amalraj shook off his run of disappointments by winning his first singles match, that too, against World No. 52 Cedric Nuytinck who suffered his first loss in three outings. 
Amalraj, having lost three singles matches after blowing away comfortable leads, finally produced his best and blanked the Belgian and then celebrated in his signature style — jumping and roaring in joy!

Gaayathri shoots gold
","Gaayathri Nithyanandam of Tamil Nadu came up with a strong performance in the final to clinch the gold in women’s rifle 3-position event in the 18th Kumar Surendra Singh shooting championship at the Dr. Karni Singh Range, Tughlakabad, on Saturday.
After a modest 1,152 in qualification, which was the top score but did not compare well with her 1,176 shot in the Munich World Cup this year, Gaayathri shot 453.3 in the final to beat K.C. Hema by 1.4 points for the gold.
Sonika took the bronze ahead of Lajja Gauswami, Shreya Saksena, Jayashree Das and Ankita Gupta.
Gaayathri would be skipping the fifth selection trial on Sunday, as she was second in the overall averages for selection to the Indian team for the Asian Games and World championship.
Gaayathri’s Statemate, G. Varshaa won the junior gold, in a field of four shooters in the final. Yashika Shinde had no chance of catching up with Varshaa and spoilt the margin further with a 5.7 last shot in the gruelling 45-shot final.
In the men’s rifle 3-position, Olympian Chain Singh pipped Gagan Narang by 2.4 points for the gold, even though the qualification scores of 1,164 and 1,149 respectively was far below the best of the two champion shooters.
The results: 50m rifle 3-position: Men: 1. Chain Singh 452.6 (1164); 2. Gagan Narang 450.2 (1149); 3. Surendra Singh Rathod 438.3 (1167).

Seema Punia’s Asiad berth not in danger ","After insisting that all athletes, except Commonwealth Games javelin throw champion Neeraj Chopra, must take part in next week’s National inter-State athletics championships in Guwahati to confirm their berths for the forthcoming Asian Games in Jakarta, the Athletics Federation of India (AFI) appears to have softened its stand for Seema Punia too.
Woman discus thrower Seema, the country’s lone athletics gold medallist at the last Asian Games in Incheon, will not be competing in Guwahati but her place in the Asiad team is not in any danger.
“Seema will not be taking part but she has got permission from the AFI president (Adille Sumariwalla),” Radhakrishnan Nair, the deputy chief national coach, told The Hindu from New Delhi on Saturday. 
“She does not want her training to be disturbed and moreover, she has proved herself in the recent Commonwealth Games (where she won silver),” said Radhakrishnan.
But nobody knows for sure where the Haryana athlete currently is. 
“She is not in the country, I think she is somewhere in Russia but am not sure about it,” Radhakrishnan added.
The coach also said that javelin thrower Vipin Kasana, who finished fifth in the CWG, would miss the inter-State meet with an injury.

Falcons fly into the second spot
","Falcons’ flight into the top-four bracket stayed on course with 15-6 dismantling of Empowerji Challengers, as Sanil Shetty and Manav Thakkar drew a blank in singles, in the Ultimate Table Tennis league here Sunday. 
The one-sided result lifted Falcons to the second spot with 45 points and pushed Challengers to the fifth with 36. 
After the teams were locked 3-3 following two singles matches, Falcons broke away with Sanil making amends for his ordinary show in the singles by pulling off the doubles with ease in the company of the energetic Bernadette Szocs. 
Liam Pitchford maintained his unbeaten streak with a 2-1 win over Tiago Apolonia. The 49th-ranked Briton made light of the loss of the opening set to the Portuguese, placed nine rungs higher, and then called the shots to live up to his team’s expectations. 
Bernadette, ranked 36th, took a leaf out of Pitchford’s book and upstaged Lee Ho Ching in straights sets. Later, the 20th-ranked Hong Kong girl did prove superior to Sutirtha Mukherjee but not before dropping a game to the World No. 613. 
Even though there were victories for lower-ranked players in the tie, the singles matches involving Sanil and Manav disappointed the vociferous crowd. 
Sanil could not reproduce the magic of Friday and went down to World No. 12 Simon Gauzy, the highest-ranked player in the league this season, without a fight. The left-handed Indian could manage on 13 points during the 3-0 drubbing. 
Manav, ranked second in the world among juniors and the most promising Indian kid on the block, faced 56th ranked Alvaro Robles. In the first two sets, Manav ran Robles close but perished without a fight in the third. 
The results: Falcons beat Challengers 15-6 (Matilda Ekholm bt Divya Deshpande 11-9, 11-6, 11-7; Sanil Shetty lost to Simon Gauzy 5-11, 3-11, 5-11; Sanil Shetty & Berdadette Szocs bt Manav Thakkar & Georgina Pota 11-4, 11-9, 11-8; Liam Pitchford bt Tiago Apolonia 8-11, 11-7, 11-8; Bernadette Szocs bt Lee Ho Ching 11-9, 11-3, 11-10; Alvaro Robles bt Manav Thakkar 11-10, 11-9 11-2; Suthirtha Mukherjee lost to Lee Ho Ching 9-11, 11-5, 9-11).

Abhishek, who had won the mixed gold with Yashaswini Deswal and was third in the competition behind Deepak Sharma and Om Prakash Mitharval on Saturday, did his averages a world of good by shooting 585 in qualification and then beating Deepak Sharma, Jitu Rai and Amanpreet Singh to the top the fifth trials.
Saurabh Choudhary, who shot 589 in qualification, was second ahead of Shahzar Rizvi, who had shot a gold and silver in the World Cups this season.

Chennai’s Praggnanandhaa is world’s second youngest Grand Master ","Prodigy R. Praggnanandhaa, who missed out on the chance to become the game’s youngest-ever Grandmaster in March this year, completed the technical formalities to become the world’s youngest GM at present, and the second youngest on the all-time list. 
On Sunday, the Chennai-based youngster made the third and final norm in style by winning the ninth and concluding round of the Fourth International Chess Festival ad Gredine Open at Ortisei, Italy. 
Praggu, as he is fondly called by his coach and mentor GM R.B. Ramesh, defeated Dutch GM Roeland Pruijssers in 40 moves to tie for the title with Croatia’s Ivan Saric at 7.5 points before settling for the second spot. 
After beating Italian Luca Moroni Jr. in the eighth round, Praggnanandhaa had to wait for the final-round pairing to know whether he had already done enough to make the final norm or needed at least a draw on Sunday. 
Had Praggnanandhaa faced a player below the rating of 2485 in the final round, he would have required at least half a point more. As it turned out, the pairing with Pruijssers, rated 2514, meant even a defeat would not have hurt the youngster’s norm prospects. With the pressure off, Praggnanandhaa demolished the Dutchman. 
As things stand, at 12 years, 10 months and 13 days, Praggnanandhaa is now behind record-holder Sergey Karjakin in the all-time list. Karjakin, the only other under-13 GM in the game, accomplished the feat in 2002 — three years before Praggnanandhaa was born! 
Thus, Praggnanandhaa emulated compatriot Parimarjan Negi who achieved a similar distinction on July 1, 2006 at the age of 13 years, four months and 22 days. Interestingly, at that time, Pragnanandhaa was only 318 days old! 
For the record, the world’s youngest International Master Praggnanandhaa made his first GM norm in the World junior championship in Tarvisio (Italy) in November 2017. The second norm took time and eventually came in the Fischer memorial in Heraklion (Greece) in April this year.

C’wealth meet: Indians set to monopolise
"," Over the years, the Commonwealth chess championship has increasingly resembled a miniature version of the Indian National championship. Whether it is the Open section — involving men and women — or the age-group categories, the Indians have hardly missed a medal. 
Though the country’s best have stayed away from this competition it has, in no way, slowed the Indian juggernaut. The continued absence of the elite players from England and Canada means India will once again virtually monopolise the medals when the action begins here on Tuesday. 
The list of 13 Grandmasters — all Indians — is headed by 2014 champion Deep Sengupta, ranked 15th in the country. That is the true reflection on the lack of worthiness of the Commonwealth title for the Indian elite. The field also has 15 IMs and two WGMs. For the record, there are 134 Indians in a field of 166. Among those missing from the field is the four-time winner and defending champion Abhijeet Gupta.
On the brighter side, the organisation of this event has improved dramatically since 2016. This year the competition returns to the Leela Ambience Convention Hotel here. Unlike last year, the main action will be at the spacious ground floor hall. 
In the seven age-groups, where the competition will be held separately for girls, as well, Indian talent is set to come to the fore. 
The top-10 seeds are: 1. Deep Sengupta (2526), 2. Vaibhav Suri (2556), 3. Deepan Chakkravarthy (2531), 4. M. R. Lalit Babu (2529), 5. V.Vishnu Prasanna (2525), 6. Debashis Das (2522), 7. Swapnil Dhopade (2495), 8. M. S. Thej Kumar (2495), 9. Abhijit Kunte (2494), 10. V. Karthik (2475).

Wrestling: Tomar qualifies
","The wrestling squad for the Asian Games was finally completed after Sandeep Tomar won the selection trials in the 57kg freestyle category at the Sai Training Centre in Sonepat on Tuesday.
Rio Olympian Tomar got the better of Utkarsh Kale to book his spot following the three-way tie that was necessitated after three main wrestlers — Tomar, Kale and Ravi Kumar — were tied on points during the earlier trials. Tomar fought back from being 2-6 down to level scores and was declared winner by virtue of winning the last scoring point. Kale beat Ravi 10-0 in the other bout. 
CWG gold medallist Rahul Aware, on whose request the trials had been delayed by almost a week to get more time to prepare, withdrew citing injury. Wrestling Federation of India officials said he had submitted a medical certificate claiming a ligament tear in his right knee.
Meanwhile, trials in three of the remaining four freestyle non-Olympic weight categories for the World Championships were also completed with Pankaj Rana (70kg), Sachin Rathi (79kg) and CWG bronze medallist Sombir (92kg) ensuring their spots. 
Trials in the 61kg would be held at a later stage to allow wrestlers from 57kg also to participate if they manage to make the grade.
Also, as reported earlier, trials for World Championships in the 65kg and 74kg would be held after the Asian Games. Bajrang Punia and Sushil Kumar were named directly in the Asiad squad. While Bajrang would face Praveen (lone entry in 65kg), Sushil would take on the winner of preliminary trials in the 74kg, to be held at a later date. 
The preliminary trials were postponed after a request from Praveen Rana, Sushil’s closest competitor, following the passing away of his mother.
In the Greco-Roman trials in non-Olympic weight categories, Gaurav (63kg), Vijay (55kg), Kuldeep Malik (72) and Manjeet (82kg) qualified for the World Championships.

My next target is to become a Super GM: Praggnanandhaa ","CHENNAI: R. Praggnanandhaa’s quest to become a Grandmaster began after he became an International Master in May 2016. After more than 20 tournaments across the globe and quite a few close misses, the 12-year-old from Chennai finally got his final GM norm in the Gredine tournament at Ortiesi, Italy. 
Was it not frustrating or was he under any pressure? “There was little pressure,” said Praggnanandhaa here on Tuesday on his arrival from Italy. 
“Since I have been playing for a while, I was able to focus,’” added Praggnanandhaa.
He rated the victory over GM Roeland Pruijssers at the Gredine Open recently as one of the best in his career. But the 12-year-old added that his wins over a higher-rated Alex Bachman in 18 moves in the Isle of Man tournament in 2016 and the victory over David Howell in the same tournament in 2017 were as good. 
Praggnanandhaa also played against Sergey Karjakin (he is the youngest GM), whose record he couldn’t overtake, in the Aeroflot Open in February. “We played two games in the blitz format, and I drew one and lost the other. We played and shook hands.”
The youngster credited coach R.B. Ramesh for teaching the intricacies involved in openings and calculations — analysing one’s game — and most of all “to enjoy chess”.
Praggnanandhaa said he couldn’t have achieved anything without the support of his school (Velammal MHSS), coach (Ramesh) and parents. 
“My next target is to improve my ratings and become a Super GM,” said Praggnanandhaa, who will next play in a tournament at Leon, Spain beginning July 5.

Sathish sets eyes on Asian Games
","Chennai: After successfully defending his Commonwealth Games gold at Gold Coast, weightlifter Sathish Sivalingam has eyes set on the Asian Games in Indonesia. 
Commenting on his chances at the Asiad, the lifter, who won the 77kg gold, said while the level of competition will be higher, he is confident of doing well. 
“Usually, the competition is definitely higher at the Asian Games but with countries like China and Kazakhstan banned for doping, I feel my chances are very good.”
The 26-year old from Vellore carried an injury into the CWG but still managed to secure the top spot. But since his return from Australia, he has been undergoing a rehabilitation programme and feels he is ready for the upcoming challenges.
Speaking on Tuesday on the sidelines of an event in which he was unveiled as ISteel’s brand ambassador, Satish said: “The last one month I was at Invictus Performance Lab in Bengaluru for rehabilitation, which got over recently. Now I will be preparing for next week’s trials at Patiala ahead of the Asiad.”

Table Tennis: Maharashtra United makes semis
","Kristian Karlsson thwarted A. Sharath Kamal’s challenge to help Maharashtra United prevail over Warriors TTC 11-10 in Ultimate Table Tennis here on Wednesday. 
Elizabeta Samara won two crucial matches to give United the lead early on and helped it reach the semifinals with a tally of 49 points. 
Karlsson turned things round in the sixth match when he collected six consecutive points to pip Sharath Kamal, who led 10-5 at that stage, at the post and win the first game 11-10. Karlsson won the next two games easily to secure an unassailable 11-7 lead.

Amalraj then paired with Lily Zhang to upstage the fancied Warriors’ pair of Sharath Kamal and Sofia Polcanova 2-1 before Chih returned to outlast Joao Montiero 2-1. 
The fifth match saw an interesting clash with Polcanova coming up against Samara. The clash of the left-handers saw Polcanova winning the opening game 11-9 but Samara showed better nerves to win the next two on ‘golden points’ (11-10, 11-10) to give United a 8-7 lead.

Transplanted Vaishnavi takes root
","Talk of Indian badminton and the names of Saina Nehwal and P. V. Sindhu come to mind. Ever wondered who is next on the list?
Even an ardent lover of Indian badminton can’t be faulted for not getting it right. Such is the gulf between the country’s two best players and the rest.
This subject is discussed mostly when India plays a women’s team competition like the Uber Cup. India’s bronze medals in the Uber Cup in 2014 and 2016 drew entirely on the strength of Saina, Sindhu and the effective pair of G. Jwala and Ashwini Ponnappa. Even before the first shuttle was tossed in a tie, India expected nothing from the third singles and the second doubles.
But in recent times, the rise of 16-year-old Vaishnavi Reddy has raised hopes of India finding its next world-class singles player.
After Sindhu and Saina, Vaishnavi is the strongest Indian in the world rankings (No. 53). Fourth in the world junior rankings, she is the only Indian female qualifier in the upcoming Youth Olympic Games. In July, she will join Sindhu and Saina in the 32-player Indonesian Open, one of the elite events of the season.
Against the tide
What makes Vaishnavi’s rise so fascinating is that her success has been earned by swimming against the tide. Following a disillusioning experience at the Gopi Chand Academy three years ago, her father Vinod Reddy decided to move base to Bangkok.
“The kind of attention a child [Vaishnavi] deserved for being India No. 1 in under-13 and again in under-15, both in singles and doubles, was not given,” says a pained Vinod, “I thought this was not the right place for Vaishnavi.”
But why move to Bangkok?
“The year before I left India, I saw Thailand’s Phittayaporn Chaiwan [in the junior Asian Badminton Championship] who was the top-ranked girl in every age-group… even now she holds the No. 1 rank among junior girls,” says Vinod.
“I was very impressed with the way she played and conducted herself in the arena. I also met the daughter of the owner of the Banthongyord Badminton School, where Chaiwan trained. Later, I learnt that Ratchanok Intanon [former world champion, currently No. 4] also trained there.
“I thought Vaishnavi could go there for short stints. Also, it’s just a three-hour flight from India. So when I decided to leave Gopi’s academy, Bangkok was an obvious choice,” he reveals.
The decision proved a blessing for Vaishnavi. Adapting admirably to the new surroundings, the teenager stayed focused and won 15 international medals (mostly in the junior section), seven of them gold, in 2017-2018.
Recently, a place in the Uber Cup squad came on the rebound for Vaishnavi after Sindhu chose to stay away. Like Saina, Vaishnavi also returned with a one-win-two-loss record from the event.
However, walking out of the Gopi Chand Academy has strained the relationship with those who run badminton in the country. She is seen in some sections as a ‘rebel’.
But Vaishnavi has her admirers as well. National selector and four-time National champion Manjusha Kanwar foresees a bright future.
“The fact that she handles the work-load from foreign coaches, who are mostly tough taskmasters, shows that she works extremely hard,” says Manjusha. “She has good height and [a good] wrist. She has all the basic attributes that go into making a strong player. She hits hard and retrieves well. No doubt, given her age, she is likely to lose more than she wins in the seniors. But Vaishnavi surely has what it takes.”
Chief National junior coach Sanjay Mishra is impressed with what he saw in the Dutch Open, “Without doubt, Vaishnavi has the game to be the next big name from India in singles. She has the height and the range of strokes. Strength will be built with time and age. Vaishnavi can be expected to serve the country for long.”

Asiad equestrian: No place for Pattu
","The Equestrian Federation of India on Friday sent a revised list of athletes and horses to the IOA for Asian Games with just one change — Colonel (retd) Rajesh Pattu has been replaced by Major Ashish Malik in the Eventing discipline.
Pattu is the only Indian rider to win three consecutive bronze medals in Asian Games (1998, 2002, 2006) as part of Team Eventing. The Setelvaad brothers Kaevan and Zahad and Chetan Reddy have been renamed Show Jumping. 
In Dressage, the meeting decided that the two riders — Sruti Vora and Anush Agarwalla — managed qualifying scores in team event but there was no third rider to complete the team while they had failed to get qualifying scores in individual events.
The selectors have also changed the rider-horse combination for Swr Jitender Singh, one of the four names nominated in Eventing in the revised list.

Malaysia Open badminton: Sindhu, Srikanth enter semifinals "," P V Sindhu and Kidambi Srikanth continued their impressive run at the Malaysia Open, progressing to the semifinals of the women’s and men’s singles competition with a straight-game wins in the USD 700,000 world tour super 750 tournament in Kuala Lumpur on Friday.
 In a clash between Olympic silver and gold medallists, it was Sindhu who emerged victories with a 22-20 21-19 result in a 52-minute quarterfinal match.
 The 22-year-old Sindhu, who won a silver at the Glasgow World Championship, will face world no 1 and top seed Chinese Taipei’s Tai Tzu Ying on Saturday.
 Earlier fourth seed Srikanth, who won a silver medal at the Gold Coast Commonwealth Games, dumped world no 22 France’s Brice Leverdez 21-18 21-14 in a 39-minute clash at the Axiata Arena in Bukit Jalil, a suburb in Kuala Lumpur.
 The Indian had also beaten the French in three games at All England Championship this year.
 The 25-year-old will take on former world no 2 and 2015 world championship bronze medallist Kento Momota, who has been in sensational form ever since making a comeback after serving a one-year ban by Japan Badminton Association for gambling at an illegal casino in 2015.
 Momota clinched the Macau Open and Dutch Open last year besides reaching the finals at Canada Open. He won the 2018 Asia Badminton championship and was also unbeaten at the Thomas Cup.
 Srikanth will have a tough task at hand as Momota will be extra motivated to earn back his respect as it was here two years ago that he had to concede a second round match after the news of him and compatriot Kenichi Tago gambling at an illegal casino broke out.
 In the women’s singles match, Sindhu started the proceedings with a sharp smash and moved to a 3-1 lead early on but Marin clawed back. Sindhu again opened a slender two-point lead which evaporated quickly.
 As has been the norm, Sindhu and Marin continued to fight it out as leads changed hands too frequently. The Indian finally grabbed a miniscule 11-10 lead at the interval after Marin failed to reach for a shot at the backline.
 Marin dictated the pace of the rallies to open up a 13-11 lead, celebrated every point with her usual verbal screams. Sindhu attacked her opponent’s backhand to draw level this time at 14-14 and moved to lead with a smash, which Marin hit wide.
 Lagging 15-18, Marin stepped up the attack and grabbed five straight points to secure two game-point opportunities. A net error and a wide shot by Marin saw Sindhu claw back at 20-20. The Spaniard again hit wide and then found the net as the Indian pocketed the opening game.
 The second game started in a similar fashion as Sindhu and Marin moved to 3-3 before the Indian surged to a 6-3 lead. The left-handed shuttler, however, soon levelled the score with three points as Sindhu committed a few unforced errors.
 At the interval, Sindhu grabbed a 11-6 advantage after reeling off five straight points, which ended with Marin hitting out.
 Marin slipped on the court after the break but managed to narrow the gap to 10-13 before moving to 14-15. However, the Spaniard hit long, netted a shot and failed to reach one at the forecourt as Sindhu moved to 19-15.
 A solid defence saw Sindhu grab three match points. She blew two points before unleashing a cross court smash to seal the contest in 52 minutes.
 Earlier, Srikanth erased a 5-8 deficit to grab a 11-9 lead at the break. Leverdez clawed back at 12-12 but the Indian again marched ahead to grab a 17-14 advantage. The French drew parity at 17-17 before Srikanth surged to pocket the opening game.
 In the second game, Srikanth and Leverdez fought till 5-5 before the Indian first grabbed a 11-5 lead and then kept his nose ahead to comfortably shut the doors on his rival.

While Chittoor, the district headquarters town, has been sanctioned a ‘Yuva Bhavan,’ SAAP has agreed to provide one more for Tirupati, which is not only emerging as an academic hub, but also a destination for sports, fitness and athletics.
 Mr. Raju, during a marathon meeting with youth welfare and sports officials here on Thursday, announced that the Yuva Bhavan, to be developed at an outlay of ₹5 crore to house 500 young participants, will be used to conduct workshops, seminars and other forms of talent-nurturing events. 
Positive aspects
He said that youth would be trained in positive aspects such as in disaster management. While folk artistes are identified once in a year through cultural and youth festivals, he suggested a year-long calendar for holding such events on a regular basis.
“Skill development will get enhanced attention, where local youth will be trained as plumbers and electricians.” The meeting also discussed development of playfields, KVK stadiums and other cultural programmes.

Prize money: TTFI to make amends
","While the Table Tennis Federation of India (TTFI) has been increasing the entry fee for a national-ranking table tennis tournament every year recently, it has been stingy when it comes to rewarding the players. 
After a long wait, the players could get more rewards with the federation promising to pass on a chunk of the additional revenue it generates through entry fees. 
Rise of 200%
Since 2011, the entry fee has seen a rise of at least 200%, with the TTFI charging more for at least a bunch of players with every passing year. 
On the other hand, the prize money has been revised only three times in the last eight seasons, including the current year. 
While the total prize money has been raised by 30% since 2011, the largest individual prize purse — that of the men’s singles champion in each of the five national-ranking tournaments every year — has increased only by 17%. 
It is intriguing that despite getting 11Sports as a title sponsor since 2016, the federation has not passed on the additional bucks to the players, let alone reducing the entry fee. 
Displeasure voiced
During the Central Zone National-ranking tournament, which concluded on Wednesday, a plethora of players, coaches and parents voiced their displeasure over the TTFI’s apathy towards players. 
When The Hindu posed this question to M.P. Singh, the TTFI general secretary, he said the issue is being addressed. 
“We have realised that the hike in the entry fee doesn’t translate into increase in the prize money. 
“I agree it is a little unfair to the players and the TTFI executive committee, during its recent meeting, has decided that at least half of the additional entry fee revenue should be passed on to the players as prize money very soon,” Singh said. 
“Since the minutes of the meeting haven’t been ratified, we couldn’t implement it for the Central Zone tournament. 
“We hope to introduce the benefit to players for the remaining season.”

India wins one silver and two bronze medals
","NEW DELHI: Indian women had a mixed outing on the third day of the junior Asian wrestling championships here on Thursday, managing a silver and two bronze medals.
While all five Indians in action reached medal rounds, their performances failed to impress. 
The biggest hope for the host, Commonwealth Games bronze medallist Divya Kakran — the only one in the competition here who would also be on the flight to Jakarta for the Asian Games — lost 0-11 by technical superiority to Meerim Zhumanazarova of Kyrgyzstan in the final.
Incidentally, she had lost to the same opponent in the bronze-medal playoff at the Asian Championships earlier this year. With a bye in the first round and a walkover in the quarterfinals, Divya managed to win her only other bout of the day in the semifinals before being outclassed in the title clash.
Sangeeta Phogat, however, would consider herself unlucky. The youngest of Phogat sisters fought hard but with a limp and a non-responsive knee due to an injury earlier in the day, she could hardly move and lost 5-10 to China’s Juanjuan Shi. 
“There was a gap in the mat during my quarterfinal bout and I slipped and twisted my knee when I fell then. I tried to fight with painkillers and thought I could manage but then she (Shi) grabbed the same knee and pulled it, after which I just couldn’t do anything,” a disappointed Sangeeta said.
She did come close, going from 0-4 to 4-5 before the above-mentioned move ended her hopes despite managing to get into an advantageous position repeatedly. The fact that she received two cautions for fouls early on did not help either.
Karuna, one of the two bronze medallists, won 10-0 by technical superiority in the medal round, finishing in just over four minutes in the 76kg after Reena opened India’s account with an 8-2 win over Uzbek Khodicha Najimova in the 55kg. 
Shivani Pawar, the other Indian, was pinned to the mat in the first round by her Kazakh opponent and conceded the bout.
The standings (gold, silver and bronze medals): 
Women: 50kg: Miyu Nakamura (Jpn); Yumei Zhong (Chn); Anudari Nandintsetseg (Mgl); Marina Zakhshevskaya (Kaz).
55kg: Sena Nagamoto (Jpn); Jiajing Hou (Chn); Khaliunaa Bayaraa (Mgl); Reena (Ind).
59kg: Yuzuro Kumano (Jpn); Nabira Esenbaeva (Uzb); Purevsuren Ulziisaikhan (Mgl); Juanjuan Shi (Chn).

IOC adds 7 medal events to 2022 Beijing Winter Games
"," Planning for its next three Olympic Games, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) has added seven medal events to the 2022 Beijing Winter Games, published a 2020 Tokyo Olympics schedule with no agreement on when to race swimming finals, and set a timetable to add new sports to the 2024 Paris Olympics.
The next Winter Olympics will now include: women’s monobob, Big Air freestyle skiing for men and women, plus mixed team events in short track speed skating, ski jumping, ski aerials and snowboardcross.
The addition of gold medals to a 109-event programme was combined with a reduction in how many athletes will compete.
In an attempt to cut organising costs, amid recent failures of potential bidders in Europe for the 2026 Winter Games, there should be no additional venues required and 41 fewer athletes in Beijing than the 2,933 competitors at the Pyeongchang Olympics last February.
IOC sports director Kit McConnell said on July 18 that changes for Beijing were “really sending a strong message about controlling the size of the Olympic Winter Games.” Sports losing athletes from their Olympic quota include 41 in skiing disciplines, 26 from skating, and 20 fewer in biathlon.
Women’s ice hockey will grow by two teams to become a 10-nation lineup instead, adding 46 athletes.
McConnell said an improved gender balance will see 45.4% female athletes in Beijing, rising from 41.1% in Pyeongchang.
A women’s Nordic combined event — mixing cross-country skiing and ski jumping — will not join the Olympic program because the overall quality of competition and variety of countries taking part was not “at a level appropriate to being included,” the IOC official said.
Two years and one week before the Tokyo Olympics open, the IOC published a detailed schedule on July 18 of when competitions will take place.
It lacked any breakdown of events at the Olympic Aquatics Centre, which hosts swimming, diving, and synchronized swimming.
At the 2008 Olympics in Beijing, in a time zone one hour different to Tokyo, swimming finals and semifinals were raced in morning sessions so they could be broadcast live in the United States late evening. U.S. broadcaster NBC is the single biggest contributor to Olympic revenues.
However, swimming is also a core attraction for the host nation’s viewers with Japan winning seven medals, including two gold, at the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics.
McConnell said a swimming sessions schedule should be finalised inside two months, with the IOC, Tokyo organizers and swimming governing body FINA seeking a balance to ensure “each of the key time zones have some of their key sports live.”
Paris organizers have an uncertain wait to discover if new sports they propose next year for inclusion on the 2024 programme will be approved.
The IOC plans to make interim decisions on the Paris preferences at an October 2019 meeting in Milan, then review again after seeing how other sports perform at the Tokyo Olympics.

Shubhankar assured of making the cut; Zach sets the pace "," Shubhankar Sharma on Friday became the youngest Indian golfer to make the cut in any Major after he capped a wonderful back nine to achieve the feat at the 147th Open Championships here.
Shubhankar gave himself the perfect 22nd birthday present with that final birdie on 18th. It was one of the four he had on the tough back nine.
“I am so, so excited right now. At the 18th I still thought I just needed to make a par because so many players have yet to finish. After the putt dropped I was definitely very happy. I have never played in such wet and cold conditions, changing towels and gloves so often,” said Shubhankar.
Playing on a wet and cold day, Shubhankar warmed the hearts of the Indian fans at the Carnoustie Golf Links with four birdies against one bogey on the tougher back nine to climb out of a hole at five-over through 27 holes. 
With rounds of 73-71, he is now two-over 144 and sure to be inside at the cut line. 
Meanwhile, former winner Zach Johnson continued his love affair with the Open when he charged to the top of the leaderboard on six-under-par 136 early on Friday.
While the 42-year-old American was plotting his way to a four-under 67 in cold, wet conditions at Carnoustie, Tommy Fleetwood (65) and Rory McIlroy (69) were delighting the home fans by moving into title contention. 
But World No. 1 Dustin Johnson looked certain to miss the cut after struggling to a 72 for 148, six over.
Change in weather
The umbrellas were up and the waterproofs out as rain greeted the players at the start, in complete contrast to the blue skies and sunshine that have been in evidence all week.
I am sure my friends will be congratulating. Making the cut at the Major, which has always been my dream, is the best birthday present I could have got. Shubhankar Sharma
Zach, who claimed the coveted Claret Jug at St. Andrews three years ago, recovered from a bogey at the opening hole with birdies at the third, fourth, sixth, 14th and 18th.
He produced a grin as wide as the North Sea that skirts the Carnoustie layout and raised his putter to the heavens when he rammed in a 35-foot putt at the closing hole.
Fleetwood, who shot a course record 63 at last year’s Dunhill Links Championship, flourished again and strung together six birdies to move up the ladder.
McIlroy, playing in Match Eight, was the second player to break 70 on Friday as he mixed four birdies with two bogeys.
However, it is looking a little less likely that this tournament will finally be the one where Tiger Woods ends his decade-long major drought, as he shot a second straight even-par round of 71.
Leading scores (after round one): 66: Kevin Kisner (USA); 67: Tony Finau (USA), Zander Lombard (RSA), Erik Van Rooyen (RSA); 68: Brendan Steele (USA), Brandon Stone (RSA), Ryan Moore (USA); 69: Pat Perez (USA), Zach Johnson (USA), Sung Kang (Kor), Danny Willett, Matthew Southgate, Chez Reavie (USA), Rory McIlroy, Justin Thomas (USA), Jon Rahm (ESP), Russell Henley (USA).
Indians: 73: Shubhankar Sharma; 76: Anirban Lahiri.

Peter Sagan sprints to victory
","Slovakian Peter Sagan underlined his sprint credentials for the third time on the Tour de France Friday after powering to victory in the 13th stage from Bourg d’Oisans to Valence.
Sagan, of the Bora team, is one of the few real sprint specialists still in the race after surviving an Alpine stage trilogy that proved fatal to the hopes of rivals Mark Cavendish, Marcel Kittel, Andre Greipel and Dylan Groenewegen.
All the aforementioned exited the race over two tough days in the Alps, and Sagan — who had won two stages on this edition so far — was quick to capitalise. 
Sagan, wearing the green jersey for the leader of the points competition that he has won five times previously, was given extra work to do after Belgian upstart Philippe Gilbert (Quick Step) brazenly attacked a leading peloton full of ambitious sprinters 930 metres from the line. 
But Sagan, and his rivals didn’t flinch. They kept the pace high and one-day classics specialist Gilbert was caught with 245m remaining. 
The FDJ team of Arnaud Demare had been key in chasing down a relatively tame four-man breakaway in the closing kilometres of the race.
But the Frenchman came up short when it came to payback. He launched his burst first, but, as Norwegian Alexander Kristoff and Sagan came up on his left, Demare ran out of juice.
Britain’s Geraint Thomas, fresh from winning two stages in the Alps, remained in the leader’s yellow jersey.
Welshman Thomas leads Sky teammate Chris Froome by 1min 39secs, with Dutchman Tom Dumoulin (Sunweb) third overall at 1:50.
The 14th stage on Saturday is far more more difficult and technical ride over 188 km between Saint-Paul-Trois-Chateaux to Mende.

Sneha Sivakumar’s best bests Ingy Hammouda
","Sneha Sivakumar couldn’t have chosen a better city, unwittingly so, to showcase her wares. Born to parents from Chennai, the 17-year-old, representing Singapore, produced her career-best performance yet in the WSF-World junior squash championships here.
Sneha snuffed out a stiff challenge from Ingy Hammouda of Egypt, seeded nine, 7-11, 11-6, 13-11, 7-11, 11-9 on Friday in a cliff-hanger of a pre-quarterfinal that lasted 60 minutes at the ISA courts. 
In another upset, Egypt’s Farida Mohamed, younger sister of former world junior champion (2014) Habiba Mohamed, defeated Aifa Azman of Malaysia, the third seed, 15-17, 11-7, 11-7, 4-11, 11-6. 
“I came into the tournament with not the best of draws. I thought I would be seeded. I am really happy with my display,” said Sneha. “I didn’t come here with a hope of reaching the quarterfinals. I hope to bring Singapore squash back to life.” 
True to expectations, 10 Egyptians have reached the quarterfinals. Top seeds Marwan Tarek (boys) and Rowan Reda Araby (girls) cruised to the last eight. 
Like many of Egypt’s players, Hammouda relied on power to outplay Sneha. The Singaporean, though, proved to be clever in her placements as she kept deceiving the ninth seed with immaculate drop shots and double boasts. 
Truth be said, Sneha was lucky in the decider. At 7-7, Hammouda appealed to the referee that Sneha had taken the ball which was ‘double bounce’, a rally that Sneha eventually won. Even the Singapore coaching staff sitting on the sidelines said as much, but the referee insisted that Sneha had indeed taken the ball on the first bounce.
From the quarterfinals onward, the tournament will be held at Express Avenue Mall. 
The results (pre-quarterfinals): Boys: 1-Marwan Tarek (Egy) bt George Crowne (Can) 11-6, 11-6, 9-11, 11-4 ; 5/8-Mostafa Montaser (Egy) bt 9/12-Yehia Elnawasany (Egy ) 9-11, 11-9, 11-7, 8-11, 12-10; 5/8-Nick Wall (Eng) bt 9/12-Matias Knudsen (Col) 11-8, 9-11, 11-5, 11-8; 3/4-Omar El Torkey (Egy) bt 13/16-Julien Gosset (Can) 11-7, 11-3, 9-11, 10-12, 11-9; 3/4-Mostafa El Serty (Egy) bt 13/16-Siow Yee Xian (Mas) 11-7, 11-9, 9-11, 11-9; 5/8-Darren Rahul Pragasam (Mas) bt 9/12-James Wyatt (Eng) 7-11, 11-7, 11-13, 11-1, 11-8; 5/8-Leonel Cardenas (Mex) bt James Flynn (Can) 11-7, 8-11, 11-5, 11-3; 2-Mostafa Asal (Egy) bt 13/16-Yannick Wilhelmi (Sui) 11-9, 11-5, 11-8. 
Girls: 1-Rowan Reda Araby (Egy) bt 13/16-Chan Yiwen (MAS) 11-4, 11-5, 11-2; 5/8-Hana Moataz (Egy) bt 9/12-Alice Green (Eng) 11-8, 11-3, 11-9; 5/8-Jana Shiha (Egy) bt 9/12-Wen Li Lai (Mas) 11-6, 9-11, 11-5, 11-4; 13-16-Farida Mohamed (Egy) bt 3/4-Aifa Azman (Mas) 15-17, 11-7, 11-7, 4-11, 11-6; 3/4-Lucy Turmel (Eng) bt Jessica Keng (Mas) 11-8, 11-6, 13-11; Sneha Sivakumar (Sgp) bt 9/12-Ingy Hammouda (Egy) 7-11, 11-6, 13-11, 7-11, 11-9; 5/8-Marina Stefanoni (USA) bt 9/12-Georgia Adderley (Sco) 11-8, 4-11, 11-9, 11-8; 2-Hania El Hammamy (Egy) bt 13/16-Kah Yan Ooi (Mas) 11-8, 11-8, 11-7.

Mansi has to be content with silver
","Being disappointed after losing in the final is understandable but Mansi Ahlawat was stunned into silence. It didn’t matter that she was participating in her maiden international competition at home and ended with a silver. The Rohtak girl had blanked out after the defeat and had no words to express herself at the Junior Asian Wrestling Championships here on Friday.
 It took a while for her to start speaking but had nothing to say about her 57kg title bout against Japan’s Akie Hanai, which she lost by technical superiority 10-0, except that she had never fought against her opponent before and had not seen any videos of her either. She knew nothing of her rival.
A silver medalist at the Cadet Asian Championships in May this year — she had lost to another Japanese, Ozaki Nonoka — this was also Mansi’s maiden international competition in the junior category after winning gold in the national championships in February. Travelling 10km every day to and from Seria village in Jhajjar district to Sir Chotu Ram Stadium in Rohtak, twice a day, Mansi and her younger sister Khushi are first-generation wrestlers in her family.
“I was a gymnast for two years at the same stadium. We used to see girls practice wrestling and liked it, moving to the sport four years ago to train with Mandeep sir,” she said. Up next is the selection trials for the World Junior Championships. And though the girl with few words didn’t say anything, it was the first time she smiled throughout the interaction, making her determination evident.
Mansi was the only bright spot of the day for the host apart from Swati Shinde, who ended her bronze medal bout in double-quick time to win by technical superiority 10-0 in the 53kg. The other three Indians in the fray for a bronze all lost as the Indian women finished with two silvers and three bronze in third place, behind runaway leader Japan — seven golds and one silver — and China, who had five silvers and four bronze.
The standings (Gold, silver, bronze): Women: 53kg: Umi Imai (Jpn), Yuhong Zhong (Chn), Swati Shinde (Ind) and Enkhtsetseg Batbaatar (Mgl); 57kg: Akie Hanai (Jpn), Mansi (Ind), Zhanerke Assanova (Kaz) and Qi Zhang (Chn); 62kg: Irina Kuznetsova (Kaz), Rin Kondo (Jpn), Seeun Choi (Kor) and Xinyuan Sun (Chn); 65kg: Naomi Ruike (Jpn), Yaru Wu (Chn), Delgermaa Enkhsaikhan (Mgl) and Bakhtigul Baltaniyazova (Uzb); 72kg: Mei Shindo (Jpn), Khulan Tsermaa (Mgl), Hui Tsz Chang (Tpe) and Gulnaz Zhapparova (Kaz).

Disappointing start for Lahiri, defending champion Spieth
","
Indian golfer Anirban Lahiri carded a 5-over 76, leaving him with a mountain to climb in his bid for a weekend appearance, on the opening day of the 147th Open Championships here on Thursday. 
The Carnoustie Golf Links, which was baked on a warm morning, penalised visits to the fairway bunkers and did not make putting easy either.
Americans, who have won the last five Majors, and 10 of the last 14, dominated the leader-board. Kevin Kisner led the field with a 5-under 66 which included a colourful stretch of bogey-eagle-par-birdie from fifth. 
Hat-trick of birdies
He then he had a hat-trick of birdies from 13th to 15th and survived the famous Carnoustie bite on the 16-18th hole.
“Getting accustomed to links golf is something you have to do where we come from,” Kisner said. “The ball's running 50 to 80 yards on certain shots. I didn't think it was as firm today as it has been, but I also played at 7:50 in the morning.
“I think I only hit four drivers all day, maybe five. I just want the ball on the fairway because it's not an overly long golf course.”
Van Rooyen delights
Erik Van Rooyen of South Africa, who qualified for the Open by finishing second behind Shubhankar Sharma at Joburg Open, was flawless for 17 holes before dropping a shot on 18th for a 4-under 67.
Defending champion Jordan Spieth was not a model of accuracy, and it finally caught up with the Texan as he dropped four shots in the final four holes for a 72.
Lahiri had bogeys on fourth, ninth and 16th and he double-bogeyed the 10th and there were no birdies
“It was not the day I was hoping for. I didn’t get off to a good start and after 2-3 holes in, I started tightening up and had a ‘birdie free’ round. That’s not the phrase I want to be associated with, but that’s what it was,” said Lahiri, who found only 20% of the fairways, hit 50% greens in regulation and needed as many as 31 putts. 
“I missed a lot of shots to the right and that’s not what I do usually. I missed a lot of opportunity early on and didn’t take advantage of the two par-5s and I found too many fairway bunkers.” 
“I got my speeds on the green a little wrong; left a couple in the jaw and a couple lipped out. So, I need to work on the speed and tempo. Still 5-over is not where I should be but I still feel I can make a bunch of birdies tomorrow.”
Niggle in the neck
Lahiri admitted to not having had a good sleep for 2-3 nights here in Carnoustie and the unease led to a niggle in the neck. 
American Tony Finau showed there were a lot of birdies to be had, eight in total, but also dropped four bogeys in his 67. Brandon Stone, who shot 60 on Sunday enroute to winning the Scottish Open and making it to the Open, carded 68. Augusta Masters champion Patrick Reed shot a 75. 
Earlier, veteran Scot Sandy Lyle, the champion way back in 1985, had the honour of hitting the opening tee. He striped an iron down the middle of the fairway on the way to shooting 75.

Woods turns back the clock
","It had been 2,226 days since Tiger Woods had led at the end of a round at a major, but for a short while at the British Open on Saturday it looked like he might do just that going into the final day.
The 42-year-old's much anticipated return to The Open after a two-year hiatus had been a bit of a damp squib on the first two days at Carnoustie.
However, in an event he has won three times, most recently in 2006, the old fire returned on the Scottish links to reward the packed gallery of spectators following him.
The 14-time major winner — plagued in the past eight years by personal issues and back problems — fired in six birdies in a round only marred by a bogey at the 16th as he seeks a first tournament win in five years.
A brilliant par on the ultra-demanding 18th — having benefited from a huge stroke of luck — briefly made him the clubhouse leader on five under par and he was smiling from ear to ear as he strode off the green.
He has not topped the leaderboard at the end of a round in a major since the second round of the US Open in 2012. 
Woods may have struggled to make par on the first but from then on some of his golf resembled that of him at his peak, back when he appeared to be on another level entirely compared to his rivals.
A monster birdie putt on the ninth had him punching the air in celebration and took him to three-under for the day and the tournament. 
Fired up by that, he played even better on the next hole as he turned for home.
His approach shot to the 10th green landed a foot from the cup and he duly tapped in for another birdie, flashing a contented smile.
A massive drive on the following hole almost took him to the green and he duly went on to birdie that as well to pile the pressure on overnight leaders Kevin Kisner and Zach Johnson.
Indian golfer Shubhankar Sharma carded a second successive even-par 71 even as he failed to break into the top-50 spot.
The 22-year-old, who was tied 52nd after the first two rounds, took his three-day total to two-over par. He was tied 56th with many players still yet to complete their round.

The Gopi controversy should’ve been avoided: Prakash Padukone
","The allegations of bias and favouritism levelled against National coach P. Gopi Chand following the selection of his daughter Gayathri Gopi Chand in the Asian Games squad was something Indian badminton could have done without, feels legend Prakash Padukone.
“It should have been avoided,” Padukone told The Hindu on the sidelines of the IIMB Alumni Association’s IIMBue Annual Leadership Conclave. 
“It has come after a long time. So many good things have happened for Indian badminton and in the last two to three years there hasn’t been any negativity. It was not required.”
The Indian women’s squad for Jakarta will have six singles players and four doubles specialists. The selection of youngsters Akarshi Kashyap and Gayathri as extra singles players instead of a third doubles pair prompted Aparna Balan, a doubles exponent, to cry foul. While refusing to cast aspersions on the decision makers, Padukone conceded there were no straight answers.
“You can argue both ways. For the youngsters it’s more for exposure. But there is no specialist doubles pair as a standby now. We have to make one of the singles players play doubles [in case of an injury]. This was a question of interpretation. I think they have been fair. There was no conflict of interest as such. There is a selection committee and meetings have been held. Everybody's views have been taken and it’s a majority decision. I don’t think one person has [made the choice].”
The former All-England champion in fact gave a thumbs up to the rejigged selection process. Starting from the Thomas & Uber Cup, the Badminton Association of India (BAI) has introduced selection tournaments to pick players which ensures that along with international ranking, domestic performances count too.
Wise thing
“I am personally in favour of it. People should be selected on present form. They have done the wise thing by excluding top players. Everybody else needs to compete. Earlier, it was more subjective. Only those in the core group would get an opportunity to play. They will never play any domestic tournament. In this, you do well in two selection tournaments, you get to play two events and then the selection tournaments happen again. So nobody is guaranteed a place [forever].”
To what extent the changes will prove right remains to be seen but Padukone was confident of a decent showing at the Asian Games. 
In the 2014 edition, India won a bronze in the women’s team event, the country’s first medal since 1986 Seoul, while Syed Modi remains the only individual medallist (bronze, Delhi 1982).
“We have done well at all the important events. We have done well even at the Olympics. But it will be tough because most of the top badminton-playing nations are from Asia. It is almost like the Olympics or the World Championship.
“You have to beat two good teams to win a medal especially if you are vying for gold or silver. This is more so in a team event. You need to be good in both singles and doubles but below Saina [Nehwal] and [P.V.] Sindhu there is a fairly big gap. So it won’t be easy.""

World junior squash championships: An all-Egyptian boys’ semifinal ","That Egypt is quite synonymous with squash is a no-brainer. And the World junior squash championships here, as expected, it has turned out to be an exhibition of supremacy of the North African country.
The boys’ semifinals on Sunday of the Worlds at the Express Avenue Mall will be an all-Egyptian affair. In the girls’ category, Lucy Termel of England broke into the semifinal party.
If one has to pick a contest for its intensity, it has to be the one between Jana Shiha and the lower seeded Farida Mohamed, both from Egypt in the girls’ quarterfinals on Saturday. It was Shiha who emerged triumphant 7-11, 11-6, 11-5, 7-11, 15-13 in 51 minutes.
Shiha is a copy-book player with an array of shots while Farida is more of a player who relies on grit and fighting spirit.
The manner in which Shiha blew away Farida in the third game, it appeared that the 16-year-old would pocket the fourth and the match in a jiffy. But Farida fought back taking the match to the decider.
Unleashing winners and drop-shots from all corners, Shiha ran up a handy 9-5 lead and had three match points at 10-7, only to see Farida make a comeback. Shiha, however, finished the contest on her fifth match point while saving one on the way.
Egypt’s Mostafa Asal, seeded two, proved why he is rated as one of the best in the business, when he defeated Leonel Cardenas of Mexico 12-10, 11-7, 11-9.
Whenever he was trailing — be it 8-10 in the first game or 7-9 in the third — he raised his game with some unbelievable retrievals and deception. No wonder, the 17-year-old is spoken about in glowing terms by the squash fraternity.
Semifinal line-up: Boys: Marwan Tarek vs Omar El Torkey, Mostafa Asal vs Mostafa El Sorty; Girls: Rowan Reda Araby vs Jana Shiha, Lucy Termel vs Hania El Hammamy.
The results (Quarterfinals): Boys: 1-Marwan Tarek (Egy) bt 5-8 Mostafa Montaser (Egy) 11-8, 11-1, 11-5; 3-4 Omar El Turkey (Egy) bt 5-8 Nicholas Wall (Eng) 11-6, 11-3, 11-7; 3-4-Mostafa El Sorty (Egy) bt 5-8-Darren Rahul Pragasam (MAS) 4-11, 13-11, 6-11, 12-10, 11-6; 2-Mostafa Asal (Egy) bt 5-8 Leonel Cardenas (Mex) 12-10, 11-7, 11-9.
Girls: 1-Rowan Reda Araby (Egy) bt 5-8 Hana Moataz (Egy) 12-10, 11-6, 11-3; 5-8 Jana Shiha (Egy) bt 13-16-Farida Mohamed (Egy) 7-11, 11-6, 11-5, 7-11, 15-13; 3-4-Lucy Termel (Eng) bt Sneha Sivakumar (Sgp) 11-5, 11-8, 11-8; 2-Hania El Hammamy (Egy) bt 5-8 Marina Stefanoni (USA) 11-2, 11-4, 11-7.

Wrestling: Abdullaev stuns Naveen
","Indian grapplers faltered at the final hurdle on the penultimate day of the junior Asian wrestling championships here on Saturday, settling for silver in three of the five weight categories that saw action on the day and a bronze as the competition moved to the freestyle men’s category.
The biggest upset was Naveen losing to Gulomjon Abdullaev of Uzbekistan in the 57kg 7-1 despite being favourite for the title. The 20-year old Naveen, a trainee at the Chhatrasal Stadium for the past five years, had won bronze in the 2016 edition of the competition and though he managed to improve on that, there was disappointment writ large on his face.
“The gold went out in the beginning itself when the other guy took those four points at the end of the first round. Once I trailed 0-7, the mind went completely blank, there was nothing I could think of or even try to come back into the bout,” Naveen admitted.
It was a weak shoulder grip that let Naveen down as the Uzbek opponent pounced on his weakness to take of successive two-pointers to widen the gap. Naveen had defeated a much-stronger Iranian Reza Mohsen Alijanzadehjouybari 6-5 in the quarterfinals to stamp his authority here but was unable to repeat the performance in the final.
The gold medallist at the Asian Cadet championships in 2015, Naveen announced his potential when he defeated Rio Olympian Sandeep Tomar in the quarterfinals at the National Championships last year before finishing fifth.
It was also heartbreak for Vishal Kaliraman who started with a bang but went out with a whimper in the 70kg final to Iran's Amirhossein Morteza Gholi Kavousi, losing 10-7. Kaliraman back-flipped his opponent for four points but the Iranian kept pushing him out of the mat for points. The Indian did manage to level scores at 7-7 but fumbled with less than a minute left to finish second.
Sachin Giri, in his maiden international competition, was no match for Sajjad Saberali Gholami, surrendering in just 72 seconds in the 97kg while Karan, bronze medallist in the previous edition last year, ended with a bronze again in the 65kg.
The Standings: 57kg: Gulomjon Abdullaev (Uzb), Naveen (Ind), Almaz Smanbekov (Kgz) and Reza Mohsen Alijanzadehjouybari (Iri); 
65kg: Takuma Taniyama (Jpn), Ernazar Akmataliev (Kgz), Karan (Ind) and Amirhossein Azim Maghsoudi (Iri); 
70kg: Amirhossein Morteza Gholi Kavousi (Iri), Vishal Kaliraman (Ind), Kojiro Shiga (Jpn) and Nurkozha Kaipanov (Kaz); 
79kg: Sajjad Saberali Gholami (Iri), Sachin Giri (Ind), Mukhammadrasul Rakhimov (Uzb) and Takato Uchida (Jpn); 
97kg: Sajjad Gholamhossein Azizi (Iri), Serik Bakytkhanov (Kaz), Kunai Nurdavletov (Kgz) and Hynsu Han (Kor).

Woods takes prime position as challengers falter ","A charging Tiger Woods was leading the British Open with nine holes to play on Sunday as defending champion and overnight co-leader Jordan Spieth began to feel the strain.
Woods, the 14-times Major champion began the day four shots adrift of fellow Americans Spieth, Xander Schauffele and Kevin Kisner but was leading as he reached the turn on seven-under.
The 42-year-old, who won the last of his 14 Majors a decade ago, has rolled back the clock at Carnoustie and after a sizzling third-round 66 he was at it again.
Playing in his traditional last-day red shirt, Woods continued to turn the screws. A deafening roar reverberated around the course when he sunk a long birdie putt on the fourth. Then at the sixth he rolled in an eight-footer.
With the strong westerly breeze causing havoc at the top of the leaderboard, Woods played the opening nine holes in 34 strokes.
Spieth and Schauffele had begun steadily but both came to grief with bogeys on the fifth.
When Spieth double-bogeyed the next after needing a penalty drop out of a gorse bush and Schauffele followed suit with a double on the seventh, Woods found himself leading a Major on a Sunday for the first time since 2011.
He was one stoke ahead of playing partner Francesco Molinari who began his final round with 10 straight pars.
The predicted winds materialised on cue to add an extra ingredient to what was already looking like a thrilling climax. Only three of the first 42 players to complete their rounds on Sunday scored in the 60s.
Kisner, who had begun the day on nine-under with Spieth and Schauffele, suffered a dreadful start with a double bogey at the second and a bogey at the third to slip back, although he responded with a chip-in birdie at the fifth.
Two more bogeys followed but a birdie at the 10th kept him in the hunt at six under.
Four-times Major champion Rory McIlroy was another to struggle. He began the day at five-under but dropped two shots in his opening seven holes to slip back to three-under. 
India's promising young golfer Shubhankar Sharma said making the cut was the best possible birthday present he could have wished for.
Shubhankar, who turned 22 on Saturday, carded a final round of two-over-par 73 to finish four-over.
“It's the best birthday present that I could have had. Really happy with whatever happened this week. I would say I felt the pressure on the second day, a little bit, when I was outside the cut line and really wanted to play the weekend,” said the Indian

Paddlers left stranded at Delhi airport
"," The Indian table tennis contingent’s performance at the ITTF Australia Open could suffer after seven of the 17 squad members, including Commowealth Games double gold medallist Manika Batra, were disallowed to board a flight at the Indira Gandhi International Airport.
The Indian contingent had to leave for Melbourne for the Australian Open, scheduled to start on Wednesday.
The players were stunned to hear only 10 of them could board the aircraft since the plane had been overbooked. Batra vented her anger out on Twitter, prompting Sports Authority of India (SAI) director general to step and make alternative arrangements.
Seven squad members, including paddlers Batra, Madhurika Patkar, Mouma Das, Harmeet Desai, head coach Massimo Costantini and support staff members Kishore Dey and Amarjeet Singh thus were scheduled to board a Singapore Airline flight late on Sunday night. 
It will mean the players would arrive in Melbourne barely 12 hours before their first match.
“It is extremely unfortunate that the players’ performance would suffer due to Air India’s mismanagement,” M.P. Singh, secretary general of Table Tennis Federation of India, told The Hindu. 
“Thanks to the intervention of other relevant authorities, alternate arrangements are made, which would at least ensure that the players would not miss out on the tournament. ”

Wrestling: Rathi, Punia break gold drought
","India ended its title drought on the final day of the competition with two gold and as many bronze medals to finish second in the freestyle tally at the Junior Asian Wrestling Championships here on Sunday.
The contrast between the two golds, however, couldn’t have been more stark. If Sachin Rathi rode on a vociferous crowd support and mental strength to overturn a huge deficit and win by pinning his Mongolian opponent in the final of the 74kg, Deepak Punia, displaying technical superiority, had an easy 10-0 win in the 86kg category with almost 1.30 minutes left in the bout.
Trailing 2-5 at the end of the first round, Rathi conceded four more to lag 2-9 as the competition seemed all but over. But even as his opponent tried to roll him, the 20-year old from Baghpat in Uttar Pradesh turned it around, exposing twice to reduce the margin to three points. A pin then ended the competition as the Mongolian appeared stunned by the fightback.
Confident
“Crowd support always helps, you don’t want to let down all the people who have travelled to see you fight. But I was always confident even when he was leading. The fact that I had defeated the Iranian in the semifinals only made me more confident since he was a much tougher opponent,” a reticent Rathi said.
Junior national coach Maha Singh Rao explained the change in strategy at half-time. “I told him he was giving too much space to the opponent and allowing him to attack. Closing the space gave Sachin the opening he wanted,” Rao said.
Punia, on the other hand, was favourite to win after returning with bronze from the Georgia Grand Prix in Tbilisi. “That was in the senior category so this was easy. But there is not much difference between seniors and juniors if you are well-prepared,” the student of coach Satpal at the Chhatrasal Stadium said. 
The results: 
Freestyle: 61kg: Abbos Rakhmov (Uzb), Syrbat Talgat (kaz), Suraj Kokate (Ind) and Minso Cho (Kor); 
74kg: Sachin Rathi (Ind), Bat-Erdene Byambasuren (Mgl), Ali Bakhtiar Savadkouhi (Iri) and Taro Umebayashi (Jpn);

 92kg: Abbas Ali Foroutanrami (Iri), Takuma Otsu (Jpn), Alisher Yergali (Kaz);

Badminton: Lakshya wins Asian junior crown ","Lakshya Sen on Sunday became only the third Indian shuttler to secure a gold medal at the Badminton Asia junior championships after defeating World junior champion Kunlavut Vitidsarn of Thailand in straight games in the final.
The sixth-seeded Indian from Uttarakhand, who had won a bronze in the last edition, notched up 21-19, 21-18 upset win over Vitidsarn in the summit clash that clocked 46 minutes.
Late Gautam Thakkar (1965) and Olympic silver medallist P.V. Sindhu (2012) had won the prestigious title earlier. Sindhu had won a bronze as well in 2011, while Sameer Verma won a silver and bronze in 2011 and 2012 and the pair of Pranav Chopra & Prajkta Sawant bagged a bronze in 2009.
The Badminton Association of India has announced a cash reward of ₹10 lakh for Lakshya.
“I am happy to win the tournament. It will boost my confidence. I played in the team event and then in the individual event, so it was a long tournament. The focus was on recovering well after each match and I am happy I could play well and win,” said Lakshya.
“I got a very good support from team members as well. This Asian Junior gold is precious to me. 
“The win against the second-seeded Chinese the other night helped me. I carried my confidence further and beat the fourth-seed in the semifinals. And today, I played my natural game to beat Kunlavut. Since it was our first meeting, I played without any pressure, he added.
“It was very hectic. In fact, ahead of the tournament I had to tweak my training a bit as I had suffered shin splints. During the tournament also I had to take pills sometimes to curb the pain,” he said.

World junior squash championship: no stopping the Egyptians ","For those rooting for a non-Egyptian, Lucy Termel was the lone hope in World junior squash championships. But it was not to be as Hania El Hammamy, seeded two, tamed Termel 11-6, 8-11, 11-4, 11-4 in the girls’ semfinals in what was the last match of the day at the Express Avenue Mall here on Sunday.
In the summit clash, Hammamy will take on another Egyptian, top seed Rowan Reda Araby, who was ruthless in her 11-5, 13-11, 11-6 demolition of Jana Shiha.
Shiha, a competent player with excellent control over her shots, came a cropper against the top seed. Araby dominated Shiha from the backcourt for the most part.
It will be an all-Egypt final in the boys’ category as well with Marwan Tarek, the top seed, taking on Mostafa Asal, the second seed.
Tarek had to dig deep to outwit Omar El Torkey 11-9, 6-11, 11-8, 2-11, 11-8 in a tie that lasted an hour and 32 minutes. Asal showed his class in ample measure to defeat Mostafa El Serty 11-3, 11-7, 11-7 in the other semifinal.
Possessing a similar-type of game, the match between Tarek and El Torkey had long rallies. Each played for the other to get tired or commit mistakes.
It was not an engrossing match one bit as the pace was slow and sometimes the rallies tended to be never-ending.
The fifth game and the decider had its interesting moments, though. Leading 3-2, El Torkey took a medical break to treat his ankle. Coming back, he took an 8-4 lead, and was looking like he would sew up the match in no time. 
But Tarek had other ideas. Pushing El Torkey around the court, Tarek had the upper hand in most of the rallies. No wonder, he took the next seven points to win the match.
There was a minor interruption in the first game when lights went off inside the glass court for around 20 minutes. Leading 4-2, when the stoppage happened, the 18-year-old World No.1 didn’t let it affect his rhythm.
Asal will be the favourite going into the final against Tarek. No doubt, Tarek will be no pushover given his patience and shot selection. Given the explosive power of Asal, his energy, resilience and the variety of strokes, it may be difficult for the top seed to retain his title.
The results (Semifinals): Boys: 1-Marwan Tarek (Egy) bt 3/4-Omar El Torkey (Egy) 11-9, 6-11, 11-8, 2-11, 11-8; 2-Mostafa Asal (Egy) bt 3/4-Mostafa El Serty (Egy) 11-3, 11-7, 11-7.
Girls: 1-Rowan Reda Araby (Eng) bt 5/8-Jana Shiha (Egy) 11-5, 13-11, 11-6; 2-Hania El Hammamy (Egy) bt 3/4-Lucy Termel (Eng) 11-6, 8-11, 11-4, 11-4.

A challenge to win the gold again: Srinivas ","HYDERABAD: He guided South Korea to its maiden Asian Games bronze in the last edition as a coach. In his maiden assignment with the Indian kabaddi team for next month’s Games, Lingampally Srinivas Reddy is optimistic of the country retaining the gold for the eighth successive time.
The 41-year-old Srinivas, who is in the city for a short break before joining the Indian preparatory camp at Sonepat, said it would be a challenge to win the gold again but not insurmountable as despite the improved standards of other teams like Pakistan, Korea, Japan, India stands well and above the rest.
“There is everything in place as far as combinations of the team are concerned, both in defence and attack. The biggest advantage is that we have very good all-rounders,” said the Andhra Bank manager.
“The recent triumph in the Dubai World Masters was a reminder that this Indian team is capable of rising to the occasion in any event. The best part is that we have been preparing for four months already,” said Srinivas, who owes a lot to the first Dronacharya in kabaddi E. Prasada Rao.
“The ProKabaddi League is the biggest thing to have happened as it not only changed the lifestyle of the players but also saw foreigners feature in it. It also gave the Indians a feel of their strengths and weaknesses. 
“This might hold good for other nations too. But we have a better domestic structure unlike other countries, which at the most play only one big national event,” Srinivas said.
What exactly will be the focus in the final phase of the camp? “It will be on super tackles — how to execute and also how to counter them. This will be the key to the preparations as we will be formulating different strategies for the opponents,” says the former player who will be coaching Jaipur Pink Panthers in the next edition.
“We are all geared up for the big moment again in Jakarta,” signed off the 2005 Asian Championship gold medallist.

Table tennis: Indian women top group, earn direct quarterfinal berth
","The Indian women’s team topped its group to secure a direct entry into the quarterfinals while the men will fight it out in the round of 16 after finishing third in their group in the second division of the World Team Table Tennis Championships on Thursday.
Indian women got past Bulgaria 3-2 in Group G which they topped with five wins in as many matches. Given a bye in the first round of the knock out stage, India faces the winner of the Egypt-Brazil match in the quarterfinals on Saturday.
The men’s team, led by A. Sharath Kamal, finished third in Group F behind Iran and Italy though all three teams had nine points and suffered a loss each. A loss against Italy on Wednesday from a winning position cost India dear. It will take on Egypt on Friday.
“It is a pity the way we lost against Italy. Harmeet lost a close match he should have won,” Indian coach Peter Engel said of the 3-2 loss against Italy. Desai lost the decider 3-1 and was leading 9-1 in the fourth before Niagol Stoyanov turned it around to win the game 24-22 and thus the match.
“Sometimes one game can make all the difference. We would have topped the group had Harmeet won. We could have beaten Italy and lost to Iran,” said Engel.

The results: Men: India bt Paraguay 3-0 (A. Sharath Kamal bt Alejandro Toranzos 11-4, 11-8, 11-1; A. Amalraj bt Marcelo Aguirre 11-1, 11-6, 11-7; Sanil Shetty bt Axel Gavilan 11-3, 11-3, 13-11).

Lahiri, Jeev, Gangjee shoot five-under in Singapore
","Jeev Milkha Singh, who is on a recovery path from a shoulder injury, seemed headed for a flawless day before a late double bogey blotted the card and he finished with a round of five-under 67 on the first day of The Championship at Laguna National in Singapore on Thursday.
On a day when lightning and thunder delayed the start by over an hour and by the end 18 players were still to complete their first round, no less than three Indians came in with five-under scores.
While Jeev Milkha and the in-form Anirban Lahiri had completed their rounds, Rahil Gangjee after five birdies still had three holes to complete tomorrow. The trio was tied 16th, four shots behind Thailand’s Panuphol Pittayarat who put up a class act when he fired a sparkling nine-under-par 63 as the players were allowed preferred lies at the $1.5 million event sanctioned by the Asian Tour and European Tour.
Digvijay Singh and SSP Chowrasia fired four-under 68 each to be tied 26th on a low-scoring day, Chiragh Kumar (69) was tied 48th. Things were not as good for Rashid Khan (72), Shiv Kapur (74), Himmat Rai (three-over through 15), and Jyoti Randhawa (77).
Lahiri, who is now ranked at a career-best 67th in the world and leads Asian Tour earnings for this year, was happy to see his putter working. “I got off to a wayward start. I didn’t hit the ball very good today but it was nice to have my putter come to my rescue for a change. I am happy with how I am striking the ball. I feel more confident with my game this week (after my win in Indonesia last week) as compared to the last few weeks,” said Lahiri, one of Asia’s top stars at the EurAsia Cup in March.
Jeev, who had a slow start in the Middle East at the start of the year, took almost 10 weeks off after that — though he did make an appearance in domestic Indian circuit with little success — before missing the cuts in Malaysia and China.
“It was a great round for me. I haven’t been doing well in the last few weeks but my game is coming around. I’m happy that I shot 67. This has come after a long time,” said Jeev, who was six—under after 16 holes. But a double bogey on 17th set him back before he recovered some ground with a birdie on 18th.
Jeev added, “My shoulder injury is getting better. I’m taking medication after the surgery so it’s working out. I think what is important for me now is to trust my game. I have got to trust it under pressure so I can put more good numbers out there.”
Singapore’s Quincy Quek kept chase with Panuphol by returning with a 64 to share second place with Scotland’s Scott Jamieson, American-Korean David Lipsky and Korea’s Kim Byung-jun.
After missing the cut in his last three starts on the Asian Tour, Panuphol breathed new life into his season with a flawless 63 that would have been the course record if not for the preferred lie ruling in place this week.
A total of 18 players will have to return at 7.40am (local time) to complete their first round after play was suspended due to fading light.

IOC says Pyeongchang is right on track for 2018
","The IOC is convinced that preparations for the >2018 Winter Games in Pyeongchang are on track, in contrast with concerns over the chronic construction delays for the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro
Gunilla Lindberg, who led the International Olympic Committee’s coordination commission on a three-day inspection visit of the 2018 host city, said a large amount of work had been achieved since the panel’s previous visit in June last year.
“The 2018 Games are on the right track but it is clear that much work remains,” Lindberg said Thursday. “With only four years to go until the Pyeongchang 2018 Olympic Winter Games begin, it was important for the commission to be able to survey the progress being made on the different venues. We are pleased to see that work on key sites like the sliding center and coastal Olympic Village has begun.”
Russian organizers were under intense pressure to finish venues and accommodations until right before the Sochi Winter Olympics and Brazilian organizers are lagging well behind schedule for the Rio Games.
Representatives of South Korea’s federal, provincial and city governments attended the three-day meetings in Pyeongchang, along with international and national winter sports federations.
The delegation toured the sites of competition and non-competition venues in the mountain and coastal clusters, including Olympic villages and media facilities.
“The third coordination commission meeting was the first one after Sochi, and it was especially meaningful because we had the high-level representatives of the international winter sports federations with us this time,” local organizing committee president Kim Jin-sun said.
“This year is a big turning point for us. We must establish a solid framework.”
The next coordination commission visit to Pyeongchang is scheduled for November.
The start of the inspection visit to South Korea on Tuesday was overshadowed by IOC vice president John Coates’ blunt warning for Rio during an Olympic forum in Sydney, when he said Brazil’s preparations were “the worst I have experienced.”
Coates later backed down, saying organizers “recently took a number of measures designed to make sure that we can together deliver a great games ... (and) a lasting legacy for the people of Rio and Brazil.”

Don’t take dietary supplements: Moses
","American track legend Edwin Moses feels athletes should stay away from all dietary supplements to escape possible doping bans in the future instead of claiming ignorance on testing positive for banned substances.
“I think athletes are making a mistake if they are trying to be aware of what is in every single substance. It is easier just to say ‘no’. You just have to say ‘no’ instead of taking the ‘I didn’t know’ approach. You cannot have it both ways,” Moses told World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA)’s official publication Play True.
This was in reply to a query whether the sheer number of supplements available today makes it more difficult for an athlete (to stay drug free).
In the Indian context, his advice has come a bit late as six athletes, including double Asiad gold medallist Ashwini Akkunji, tested positive in June 2011 and served out a two-year ban. Ashwini and five others — Sini Jose, Mandeep Kaur, Priyanka Panwar, Juana Murmu and Tiana Mary Thomas — tested positive for banned substances. They claimed the substances were in the food supplement given to them by their coach.
According to Moses, in this digital age, athletes should take responsibility for conforming to the Anti-Doping Code. “A great part of the problem is the athletes themselves.
“If you are in a sport like track & field and you’re out there earning significant money and have people working with you such as physical therapists, masseurs and coaches, and you have access to electronic devices which can easily download all the information instantly, then the case of pleading ignorance should not be as acceptable as it was during the pre-digital era when we had to circulate a piece of paper around the world.
“Athletes have to begin to take more responsibility because strict liability is a fundamental principle of the Code. When I was an athlete I knew what things not to take, what things to be aware of, and there was nowhere near the level of supplements that there are today,” he said.

Junior Davis Cup: Chinese Taipei proves too strong for India
","India’s aspirations of qualification were dashed ruthlessly by second seed Chinese Taipei in the quarterfinals of the Asia-Oceania Junior Davis Cup under-16 tennis tournament in Kuching, Malaysia, on Thursday.
Chinese Taipei proved too strong as it won both the singles and lost the inconsequential doubles. Paramveer Singh Bajwa managed to make a fight of it in three sets, but Alex Solanki was beaten 6-1, 6-0 in the second singles, featuring the No.1 players of the two countries. In the positional matches for the fifth to eighth places, fifth-seeded India will play eighth seed the Philippines.
In other quarterfinals, Hong Kong shocked the third-seeded Australia 2-1, top seed Korea beat Uzbekistan 2-1 and fourth seed Japan got past the Philippines 3-0.

The results (quarterfinals): Chinese Taipei bt India 2-1 (Cing Yang Meng bt Paramveer Singh Bajwa 6-1, 3-6, 6-3; Tung Lin Wu bt Alex Solanki 6-1, 6-0; Chien Hsun Lo & Tung Lin Wu lost to Alex Solanki & B.R. Nikshep 1-6, 2-6).

Asia Oceania Junior girls tennis: India qualifies
","It was time to enjoy the rewards of hard work. The India girls qualified with ease as they beat Kazakhstan 3-0 in the quarterfinals of the Asia Oceania World Junior under-14 tennis tournament at the DLTA Complex here on Thursday.
Shivani Ingle gave a rousing start for the host as she blanked Darya Detkovskaya in 47 minutes. If the Indian girls thought it would be a walk in the park, they were mistaken as Ainur Suleimenovadis played a much superior game in the second singles to push Sathwika Sama to her wit’s end.
Sathwika shrugged off her tentative game to weave a web around the Kazakh girl on the way to a 4-6, 6-2, 6-1 victory in nearly two hours. The relieved Indian girls returned later to the court to clinch the inconsequential doubles as well, in three sets.
India will play second-seeded Chinese Taipei in the semifinals, while the other match will feature top-seeded Australia and third-seeded China.
Captain Ankita Bhambri praised the girls for keeping a positive attitude and playing to their potential, despite the fluctuating fortunes. She was also relieved that the girls sealed the issue in the singles matches itself.
More than anything else, Ankita was happy that the girls would get six matches in the World Group competition in the Czech Republic in August, that would further pave the way for them to become better.
“The girls are much better players today than what they were when the tournament started. They have been receptive and improved with every match. I have kept a positive outlook and made sure that the pressure did not get to them,” said Ankita, who herself had helped the Indian girls reach the fifth spot in the world in the company of Sania Mirza in the Junior Fed Cup.
Shivani Ingle, who trains with Sandeep Kirtane and Kedar Shah at the Deccan Gymkhana in Pune, said that she was very happy to help the team qualify. “We were focused to give our best,” she said.
Sathwika Sama who was very nervous in the early part of her match and froze with many shots said that she was thrilled to have bounced back into the match, neutralising the strategy of her opponent by running hard to get the drops and turning the match on its head.
A trainee of coaches Narendra Nath and Vasudeva Reddy in Hyderabad, Sathwika said that the team was confident of clinching the tie and qualifying for Czech Republic after the memorable victory over fourth seed Japan in the league.

The results (quarterfinals): Australia bt Japan 2-0 (Baijing Lin bt Yuki Ando 6-0, 6-1; DestaneeAiava bt Ayumi Miyamoto 6-1, 6-2).
China bt New Zealand 2-0 (Tang Qianhui bt Tiana Windbuchler 6-3, 6-2; Nima Zhuoma bt Nina Paripovich 5-4 (retired).
India bt Kazakhstan 3-0 (Shivani Ingle bt Darya Detkovskaya 6-0, 6-0; Sathwika Sama bt Ainur Suleimenova 4-6, 6-3, 6-1; Aarja Chakraborty & Sathwika Sama bt Darya Detkovskaya & Ainur Suleimenova 2-6, 6-2, 6-3).
Chinese Taipei bt Hong Kong 3-0 (Pei-Hsuan Chen bt Hei Ching Ng 6-1,7-5; I-Hsuan Cho bt Hong Yi Wong 6-3, 6-0; Pei-Hsuan Chen & Yang Leebt Hei Ching Ng & Wai Yiu Tsang 6-1, 6-4).

Gangjee lies fifth in Singapore; SSP, Lahiri, Jeev make cut
","Rahil Gangjee overcame a double bogey and two other bogeys to bring home a second round card of five-under 67 to move to 11-under and tied fifth place at The Championships at Laguna National in Singapore on Friday.
Gangjee, who completed three holes from his first round in the morning, finished first round at six—under 66.
He was the best among the Indians, while SSP Chowrasia, a city-mate of Gangjee from Kolkata in India, added a second successive 68 to get to eight-under and tied 15th place.
Gangjee is winless since his first and only Asian Tour win 10 years back in his rookie year 2004.
Last week’s winner, Anirban Lahiri showed amazing powers of recovery as he bounced back from two double bogeys and another bogey on front nine to shoot a 70 that included six other birdies and an eagle on par-5 15th.
He had two bogeys and two doubles in a roller-coaster of a round, which brought him to seven-under 137 and tied 34th place. Also making the cut were veteran Jeev Milkha Singh (67-72) and Chiragh Kumar (69-70) in tied 48th place. But Digvijay Singh (68-73), Rashid Khan (72-70), Shiv Kapur (74-68), Himmat Rai (76-68) and Jyoti Randhawa (77-72) missed the cut, which fell four-under.
Meanwhile at the top, Thailand’s Panuphol Pittayarat did not wilt under the tropical heat and continued to take the lead after signing for a four-under-par 68 in the second round.
Panuphol stayed ahead of the chasing pack with his two-day total of 13-under-par 131 even as Australia’s Scott Hend, Korean-American David Lipsky and Chile’s Felipe Aguilar put pressure on him by trailing closely by one shot at the $1.5 million event sanctioned by the Asian Tour and European Tour.
Gangjee, who is seeking to end a decade-long title drought on the Asian Tour, got back into the mix after signing for a 67 to share fifth place with Korea’s Baek Seuk-hyun and Denmark’s Anders Hansen.
Gangjee said, “My putting was very good today. I didn’t hit it as well as I did in the last couple of weeks. The greens are really good here and I’ve been putting well for the last two rounds, especially today. I had a few bad drives on holes 16 and 17 which resulted in a double-bogey and bogey respectively.
“However, I managed to recover with birdies on the next two holes after that. It was a good comeback.”
Talking of low scores, he said, “I would say the course is rather easy because the greens are in good condition. It was easy to read the lines and the speeds are good. I will keep myself hydrated for tomorrow and have a good rest tonight so I can get my energy up for the next two rounds.”
Panuphol said, “The weather is really hot today. The two birdies in my last three holes were nice to end off my round and that cooled me down a bit. I really wanted to make that long putt (on 18) to take the outright lead and I am happy I did it,” said Panuphol.
Panuphol has not featured in the weekend rounds since the start of the season and he is delighted with his new-found position on the leaderboard this week.
Meanwhile Hend, a five-time Asian Tour winner, took advantage of his booming drives to remain in the hunt for another victory on the region’s premier Tour.
The Australian, who topped the Asian Tour driving distance category on four occasions in the last five years, was a figure of consistency as he overcame a four-shot deficit to hit the front in the morning.
A total of 72 players made the cut which was set at four-under.

Kuznetsova in her first final in three years
","Svetlana Kuznetsova reached her first final in more than three years on Friday with a 6-3, 6-1 win over fellow Russian Elena Vesnina to set up a clash with Carla Suarez Navarro at the ATP-WTA Portugal Open.
The Russian seventh-seed will take on the Spanish top seed competing in her third straight final here but without a career trophy of any kind.
Suarez Navarro overcame Romanian qualifier Irina Begu 7-6(3), 6-1 in one and three-quarter hours, Kuznetsova has won three of her four meetings with Suarez Navarro, the last in 2013.
Suarez Navarro, who cruised through her early rounds with barely a challenge, was made to work in the semifinal by Begu ranked 117.
The challenger kept the first set competitive before getting discouraged over line calls and fading in the second.
The winner broke five times but lost her own serve on four occasions. Suarez Navarro will become the season singles win leader with 25 victories as a result of her victory.
Kuznetsova struck 27 winners, breaking her good friend on five of 16 opportunities.
But Vesnina, seeded eighth and ranked 33rd, showed resistance at the end, saving four match points on her serve before Kuznetsova finally prevailed. Vesnina fell victim to six double-faults in defeat.
Kuznetsova won the opening set in 42 minutes and was barely under pressure as she moved smoothly to within one victory of her 14th career singles title. Kuznetsova had lost the only other match she had played against Vesnina, in Dubai five years ago.

Divij-Purav out

Meanwhile, India’s challenge ended in the men’s events with Divij Sharan and Purav Raja going down to top seeds Pablo Cuevas and David Marrero in the doubles quarterfinals here.
The unseeded Indian pair lost 2-6, 2-6 to Uruguay-Spanish combination in the €485,760 clay court event.

Chinese Taipei too good for India
","The second-seeded Chinese Taipei outclassed India 3-0 in the semifinals of the Asia Oceania World Junior under-14 girls’ tennis tournament at here on Friday.
On a day when China knocked out top seed Australia 2-1, Chinese Taipei was ruthless, especially in the singles.
Shivani Ingle was blanked in 42 minutes by Pei Hsuan Chen. It was a chastening experience for Shivani after she had meted out similar treatment to Darya Detkovskaya of Kazakhstan on Thursday.
Sathwika Sama battled better against the big-serving and sweet-stroking I-Hsuan Cho, but managed to eke out only three games. Sathwika even managed a break once in the first set.
What was clear was the sound basics of the Taipei girls and the inability of the Indian girls to keep pace in the rallies, even though they tried with all the energy that they could muster. The tendency to wait for the ball rather than pounce on it was the major difference.
In running hard for retrievals, the Indian girls invariably played into the hands of their opponents who crisply belted the ball all over the court.
The learning curve may continue when India faces Australia on Saturday, in the match for the third place, on the relatively quicker court No.2.
Having met their match in China, which was well served by the tall Tang Qianhui who won both her singles and doubles rubbers, the Aussie girls will be keen to finish the tournament on a strong note.

The results (semifinals): China bt Australia 2-1 [Tang Qianhui bt Baijing Lin 7-5, 6-3; Nima Zhuoma lost to Destanee Aiava 2-6, 1-6; Guo Meiqi and Tang Qianhui bt Destanee Aiava and Baijing Lin 6-7(4), 6-3, 6-2].
Chinese Taipei bt India 3-0 [Pei-Hsuan Chen bt Shivani Ingle 6-0, 6-0; I-Hsuan Cho bt Sathwika Sama 6-2, 6-1; Pei-Hsuan Chen and Yang Lee bt Aarja Chakraborty and Sathwika Sama 6-4, 6-4].

Who says golf is an old man's game?
","I have often been asked why I play golf when it is clearly an old man’s game. Now consider this, the golf swing is pure physics. The upper body coils round the lower body creating torque. When this torque is released through the golf club with the club head speeds reaching up to and beyond 100 mph, kinetic energy is transferred to the ball allowing it to fly long distances. The hips, shoulders and arms must all rotate in sync to harness your core strength to achieve this. Merely powering the club with the arms by flinging it will only have negative effects including compression of your spine. So while one can still enjoy the game at an advanced age, being of sound mind and body is the key to being able to play golf at higher levels.
The synchronisation of the body occurs through a proper address position. The knees need to be flexed just right, as needs to be the forward tilt of the spine. The waist, shoulders and hips are to be parallel to the ball to target line and not in an open or closed position (trick shots being the exception!). The top professionals and amateurs go back to their address position when things are not going well. More often than not, the fault lies there.
Some of the most salubrious surrounds that I have seen are at golf courses. The R&A, the apex body for golf, spends substantial resources on what it calls “sustainable golf”. Its stated objective is to work to protect the enjoyment of the game and to safeguard the financial operations of golf facilities in a manner that preserves natural environments and enhances community engagement.
As the Technical Delegate for Golf at the 17th Asian Games at Korea in September 2014, I recently visited the Dream Park Golf Course at Incheon. Built on a low-lying area and the land filled with only the waste generated by Incheon City over eight years, this course is a standing example of how humans can work alongside nature to create a thing of beauty.
A typical golf course needs 125-150 acres of land and will cost about Rs 60 crores to build. So when you visit a golf course, do take time to appreciate the effort, thought, planning and care taken to create something environmentally sustainable.
This game is calling you to take it up. The handicap system allows all levels of players to compete against each other and against the difficulty of the course. Time to get started.

Bowlers are going back to the basics in T20, says Eric Simons
","Eric Simons has spent his life honing the skills of a variety of fast bowlers. As a coach, he has tracked and analysed the changing facets of fast bowling in the Indian Premier League (IPL) to conclude that the trade is returning to its basics in the shortest format of the game.
In an exclusive interaction with The Hindu here on Friday, Simons described how fast bowling had completed a full circle in T20 cricket.
“It has changed in phases. I think originally a lot of fast bowling conversations were around pace and bowling different lengths.
“It went to lots of variations and strategies around batsmen in different situations and how they play.
“I think it has gone so much back again to be a little more simple. The guys are realising that a good Test line or length is good in any form of the game.
“You don’t often find guys bowling six different balls in an over.
“It happened two or three years ago. They are getting back more to the basics of bowling.”
Simons, who has been a key part of Delhi Daredevils over the years, is assisting head coach Gary Kirsten this year and hopes that DD’s bowling unit, which is yet to realise its potential, will prove its worth in forthcoming matches.
“I always judge a bowling performance on three levels — what is your plan, the execution and then the outcome. You can plan to bowl a perfect yorker, then bowl a perfect yorker and an inside edge can go to be a four. You can’t just look at what the outcome is.
“We believe we have got better plans now, we are executing a little better and we are keeping simple game plans. As the tournament goes on, we will be better and better.”
Simons, who worked with Kirsten as a bowling consultant of the Indian team a few years ago, showed a lot of faith in Mohammad Shami and Jaydev Unadkat.
The 52-year-old South African said Shami could be a very useful bowler for DD in various stages of a match.
“It is the execution of the things — getting back to his ability to swing the ball, which is his natural talent, and to execute with confidence the yorkers or the slow bouncers in the final phase. If plans and executions are right, then you win 80 per cent of the battle.”
Unadkat, according to Simons, had learnt from his experience. “He has become intelligent as a bowler and has grown in his decision making. He has got some great slower balls. He has always been a thinking bowler. He has grown in confidence.”
Simons relished his long relationship with Daredevils and hoped that under the leadership of Kirsten DD would turn into a formidable side.
“It is about finding ourselves as a unit. A team like Chennai has its continuity where they have five players for most of the seven tournaments. That’s important.
“That’s where Delhi wants to get to — build up a core of players to carry the essence of what we are as a team. It is great to be with Gary again...We want to empower the players so that they make their decisions,” said Simons.

Power-hitting, the stand-out aspect of T20 cricket
","The sixes have been bludgeoned rather than timed in the on-going Indian Premier League. And there has been a flurry of them.
The ball too has travelled long distances; beyond the stadium on occasions. From Glenn Maxwell to Kieron Pollard, big hitters have dented bowling figures and egos.
Yet, with modern bats, batsman-friendly rules, and shrinking grounds, has the concept of six-hitting been actually diluted?

The Hindu caught up with some prominent cricketers to seek answers.
Former India pace ace Javagal Srinath said: “You have 10 wickets to get and there are only 20 overs. The batsmen start with a huge psychological advantage. Everything favours the batsmen, from the bulkiness of the bat. They, consequently, have been emboldened. Now you have a Tillakaratne Dilshan scooping the ball over the ropes. The rate of scoring in cricket, across formats, has become quicker.”
Srinath also indicated that the quality of bowling might have come down too. “(The development of) Batting and bowling are inversely proportional,” he said.
Former India all-rounder Robin Singh, a telling hitter in his time, said: “The batsmen have more licence to play shots these days. It’s a mind-set thing. Batsmen now attempt to hit sixes in practice sessions. In my days, the emphasis was on playing along the ground in the nets.”
Asked about sixes being clobbered off deliveries that were previously considered hard to hit — such as the yorker outside the off-stump — and from different lengths, Robin replied: “There’s a lot more technology being used to study different balls, and come up with responses. There’s a lot more emphasis on execution. The batsmen also undergo gym training to further improve power-hitting.”
Being the batting coach of the Mumbai Indians, Robin has seen the likes of Pollard from rather close quarters. “He (Pollard) backs his ability. Don’t forget that, since there are only 20 overs, the ball remains hard and travels quickly off the bat all through,” he said.
Former Indian off-spinning great Erapalli Prasanna believed the spinners still have a chance. “If the batsman tries to hit you out for a six, as a spinner you have an equal opportunity of getting him out,” he said.
“You need to beat the batsman with either flight or with spin, or a combination of both. Many of the present-day spinners are not imparting sufficient revolutions on the ball,” said Prasanna.
He also spoke of the mind-set of a spinner. “These days, spinners, wrongly, seek to only restrict in Twenty20 cricket. They should attack the batsmen. If you pick wickets, the run-rate goes down automatically. Even if the bats are so good and the boundaries short, you can still fox the batsman with your skill.”
Among the spinners in the present edition, Prasanna said, R. Ashwin and Sunil Narine were performing better than the rest.
Former India paceman Venkatesh Prasad lamented the lack of quality in bowling. “If you are talking about Indian pacemen, the standards have come down, in terms of variation and execution,” he said.
“Many of the Indian pacemen do not send down an effective yorker. And they change their length too soon. I mean, if a good delivery is struck for a six, there is no need to alter length. You need one good stock delivery, one effective variation,” he said.
While much has been said about ‘Super Bats’, former India fitness trainer Ramji Srinivasan threw light on another important factor — bat speed. Power packed willows are not the only reason for even mis-hits clearing the ropes. Bat-speed contributes too.
“There are specific drills for wrists, forearms and shoulder. How the batsmen transfer their body weight to the bat is crucial. The focus for Twenty20 cricket is on high-end explosive speed,” he revealed.
Sixes have the crowd on their feet. These are days though when the odds favour the batsmen; rather overwhelmingly.

Irrepressible Wirral stakes its claim to yet another piece of history
","What is the worst thing that can happen to you on a cricket field? Injury apart, for a batsman I would imagine it is being run out without facing a ball. And to be run out thus twice in the same match makes it four times as bad (cricket statistics do not always follow the logic of numbers).
But what if the first 10 players all fail to score and a team is dismissed for three runs, two of them being leg byes, thus ensuring immortality of sorts for Connor Hobson, at least at trivia quizzes in pubs around Wirral in England? Hobson was the only batsman to score in the Cheshire League (Division 3) for Wirral against Haslington, thus ruining the figures of Ben Istead who finished with six for one. Clearly he has made a case for promotion in the batting order.
For those who value detail, the match lasted eight-and-a-half overs and was watched by 40 spectators, which is 10 times the audience at some of the first class matches in India. It is useful to remember that Victoria, which made a world record 1107 in a Sheffield Shield match against New South Wales was dismissed for 35 in the return game a month later. All eyes are now on the return match between Wirral and Haslington slated for July. If more than 40 spectators turn up, it will surprise no one.
But as so often happens to our heroes, the sole run-maker’s name has two versions. Some newspapers have credited the run to “Hobson”, others to “Hodson”. Horatio, you might remember had no such problems after his heroics on the bridge — he was not called “Horato” or “Horashio” depending on whether the newspaper was conservative-religious or liberal-secular.
Ten ducks all in a row have put Wirral on the cricketing map, although to be fair, it had already found a spot there as the birthplace of Ian Botham. It was a son of Wirral, Crapper, who is credited with inventing the modern toilet, and nothing its cricketers can do is likely to send the village’s reputation down its best-known product. The first American president George Washington’s grandparents are reputed to have lived in Wirral.
Such a rich historical and cultural heritage was nothing against the 17-year-old college student Istead who, with that gift for understatement which is nearly famous in Wirral, said, “To get six wickets for one run was pretty good.” In the same vein, the opponent’s manager said: “They didn’t play too badly.” But maybe he was being ironic.
Trained to look at the bright side of life, it is possible that Wirral fans may celebrate not getting to where the Somerset club Langport did in a match nearly a century ago when it was dismissed for zero. Till the ICC invents a way of negative scoring (minus one, for getting a partner run out, for example, or minus two for sledging), that will have to remain the unbeatable record.
Meanwhile, the 
Liverpool Echo informs us that Wirral CC has gone back to the nets. Life moves on. How long before it puts up a statue to Hobson (or Hodson), and sells merchandise connected with the biggest rout on a cricket field since archers lined up at Lord’s for the Olympic competition?

Younis to be Pakistan’s new head coach
","PCB Chairman Najam Sethi has confirmed that former Test captain Waqar Younis would be taking over as head coach of the national team later this month.
Sethi said two-year contracts have been offered to chief selector cum manager, Moin Khan and Younis.
Sethi also said that he felt that the combination of Moin and Waqar would work well for the national team.
“It was never a Moin or Waqar option for us as formulated by Akram (Wasim). The new formula has both former players in a format that we think will produce better results. That’s why I have now given them two-year contracts like (Dav) Whatmore earlier,” Sethi said in an interview to the “Express Tribune”.
Younis, who has also coached the Pakistan in the not too recent past, met Sethi on Wednesday in Lahore where he said he had confirmed his desire and availability to work with the Pakistan team.
Younis, who has also formally applied for the head coach position, insisted that he had no differences with anyone including Moin and was keen to work with the team to produce positive results.
Sethi disclosed the reasons for choosing the new coaching panel that includes Moin Khan and will recommend names for the head coach, fielding coach, batting coach and spin consultant positions to the board by May 6.
He felt that the old committee formed to hunt for a new coach and which functioned under former chairman Zaka Ashraf and included former captain Wasim Akram failed to deliver the desired results.
“I inherited two options [either Moin or Waqar] from Ashraf and Akram and had to select one on the eve of the team’s departure to Dhaka to play the Asia Cup and the WorldTwenty20.
“I put the matter before our managing committee and they chose the option led by Moin Khan which Akram had listed at number one. Not everyone was happy with the decision, but we let it go because there was no time to constitute a new committee and come up with different choices.”
Sethi added that instead of choosing the path of vindictiveness, the board decided on making only a few necessary modifications in the team management after the World Twenty20.

For one, Stanislas Wawrinka won his first ATP 1000 Masters title at Monte Carlo beating compatriot Roger Federer in the finals and denying him his first title at Monaco. Fernando Verdasco had earlier captured the US Claycourt championships title at Houston with a win against fellow Spaniard Nicolas Almagro. And, Kei Nishikori won the Barcelona Open title beating Santiago Giraldo to become the first non-Spanish player to win there since 1996.
In the WTA events, an injury-plagued Andrea Petkovic won her first title in three years by winning the Charleston Open. Maria Sharapova took her first title of the season by winning the Stuttgart Open.
Meanwhile, the Fed Cup and Davis Cup play-offs resumed in April with Germany making it to their first Fed Cup finals in 22 years. They convincingly beat Australia in their semi-final playoff to meet Czech Republic in the finals. The Czechs scored a 4-1 win against defenders Italy.
In the Davis Cup quarterfinals play-offs, Switzerland beat Kazakhstan 3-2 to secure a semi-final match against Italy which beat Great Britain (3-2). Holders Czech Republic rampaged through Japan (5-0) in the quarters to set up a semi-final date with France, who beat Germany (3-2).

That was exactly what happened, as India, undefeated till then in the tournament, succumbed to the Lankans in the final. Virat Kohli, player of the tournament and the backbone of India throughout the World Cup, acceded that Sammy was right. It was fitting that it was Sangakkara who led them to the victory in the final, ending a major trophy drought that has been stretching back for years. Australia, meanwhile, completed a hat-trick of WT20 titles in the women’s format.
Ten days after the final, and foes were now friends. The first leg of the IPL took place in the United Arab Emirates, but the crowds thronging the stadium made it look like it is at home. At the end of 20 matches, defending champions Mumbai Indians are still struggling to find a win, while Kings XI Punjab are on the other end of the spectrum, having won all five of their matches so far. The action now shifts to India in May.

With two games to go, Liverpool are the current leaders in England with 80 points, followed by Chelsea, who are two points behind. Manchester City are third with 77 points, but they have a game in hand and a superior goal difference. David Moyes, manager of defending champion Manchester United, was sacked, to be replaced by interim manager Ryan Giggs (picture).
Former Barcelona coach Tito Vilanova died of throat cancer at the age of 45 and an emotional Barca team paid tributes for the late manager. They are now second in the league with 84 points, four behind Atletico Madrid with three matches to go. Real Madrid are third with 82 points, with a game in hand.
If it was an all-German final in the Champions League last year, there is a shift of power towards Spain this time around. There will be a Madrid derby on May 24 at Lisbon, Portugal as Atletico knocked out Chelsea and Real accounted for holders Bayern in the semi-finals.

Pacers clip Hawks to force game 7
","David West’s late-game heroics saved the Indiana Pacers’ season - for now.
West scored 24 points, including the go-ahead layup with 46.5 seconds left in a 16-4 closing run, and the top-seeded Pacers forced a decisive game 7 with a 95-88 road victory over the eighth-seeded Atlanta Hawks on Thursday night in their Eastern Conference opening round playoff series.
“We were in desperation mode and had to get this game to go back to our building for a tough game 7,” explained West, who added 12 rebounds and six assists. “We’re trying to advance.”
The Pacers host winner-take-all game 7 on Saturday at Bankers Life FieldHouse, where they had the league’s best regular season home record. But the Hawks have already taken two games in the series in the building.
Paul George also scored 24 points, Lance Stephenson added 21 while George Hill put up 14 for the Pacers, who avoided becoming the sixth team No. 1 seed to lose an opening round series to a No. 8 in history thanks to West.
The Pacers trailed 84-79 with 3 minutes 16 minutes remaining. But West (eight) and George (four) combined for 12 points in the 16-4 finishing kick.
After Hill’s driving layup put Indiana ahead 85-84, Atlanta’s Pero Antic’s free throw tied it with 1:24 remaining for the last time.
The resilient Hawks, however, are confident they can win for a third time at Indiana.

Oklahoma City Thunder 104, Memphis Grizzlies 84

","Benfica and Sevilla dramatically edged their way into the final of the Europa League on Thursday, at the expense of Juventus and Sevilla.
Ten-man Benfica battled out a 0-0 draw away to Juventus - and went through on a 2-1 aggregate – while Sevilla lost 3-1 at Valencia but went through on the away goals rule thanks to an injury-time strike from Stephane M'bia.
Juventus had been keen to go through since the final will be played in their own new stadium on May 14.
Nonetheless, they showed little urgency in their bid to overturn the first leg 2-1 deficit, until the final minutes.
In the 68th minute, Benfica had midfielder Enzo Perez sent off for a second yellow card offence, a foul on Arturo Vidal. Juventus tried to lay siege to the visiting goal but - despite the presence of veteran playmaker Andrea Pirlo - lacked the craft and precision to create many clear chances.
Juventus sub Dani Osvaldo had a late goal disallowed for offside, and Benfica managed to play out time despite finishing with nine men due to an injury to defender Ezequiel Garay.
They will be without suspension victims Perez, Lazar Markovic and Eduardo Salvio in the final.
""We deserved to reach the final. We had everything against us tonight but we managed to come through,"" said Benfica midfielder Nico Gaitan.
""We showed true character tonight, to come through in such difficult circumstances.""
Benfica lost the Europa League final last season 2-1 to Chelsea.
The other semi-final was even more dramatic, with M'bia headed in a crucial away goal for Sevilla in the fifth minute of stoppage time after being set up by defender Federico Fazio.
The teams played to a 3-3 aggregate draw, but Sevilla scored more goals away - just one, M'bia's desperate header - and went through.
""To experience this is unique. Tonight what saved us was a lot of heart and faith,"" said delighted Sevilla boss Unai Emery, who was in charge of Valencia from 2008 to 2012.
""We really had to suffer tonight. Now we want to enjoy the final ... We started out in this competition on August 1. It has been a long and hard road.""
Meanwhile, Sevilla hero M'Bia said, ""That is the most important goal of my career so far. I dedicate it to my parents, who are not having an easy time of it back in Cameroon.""
The only Valencia player who would speak afterwards was Jonas, who simply said, ""This is really horrible, dreadful. We have lost in the cruellest possible way.""
Sofiane Feghouli gave Valencia an early lead, then Sevilla keeper Beto made it 2-0 with an own goal when trying to keep out a header from Valencia's Jonas.
Defender Jeremy Mathieu made it 3-0 to the hosts and put Valencia ahead in the tie for the first time. However, Sevilla poured forward desperately for an away goal to save them - and M'bia silenced Mestalla with his last-gasp header.
Sevilla won the old UEFA Cup in 2006 and 2007.

Hockey: Indian women lose 0-1 to USA in quarterfinal
","The Indian women’s hockey team put up a tough fight but eventually ran out of steam, losing 0-1 to USA in the quarterfinal of the Champions Challenge 1 in Glasgow on Friday.
In the first half, Katie O’Donnell was the driving force behind the USA team, but all too often her teammates were sloppy with the final ball, and the young India side took full advantage.
Ritu Rani, the India captain was a creative force in midfield and tried to create some moves but opposition’s defence denied any scoring chances.
In the 60th minute, Dawson took the opportunity and successfully converted the penalty corner for USA. Seconds later Paige Selenski had the chance to double the lead for USA, but Indian goalkeeper made a good save this time.
India got a chance to level the score in the last minute but the penalty corner strike hit the cross—bar.
India will play their next match against Belgium on Saturday.

India’s top squash players put on a show
","When the best players take the court the rest watch in awe. This was the scene at the Indian Squash Academy courts on May Day when top three Indian players Saurav Ghosal, Dipika Pallikal and Joshna Chinappa, along with Harinder Pal Sandhu, came on to play doubles as part of a special camp.
The Academy was bustling with activity with a junior tournament on in addition to several junior-level trials. All of the courts were busy before two courts were rearranged for the doubles session. The four stars — Ghosal (the World No.15), Dipika (No.12), Joshna (No.21) and Sandhu (No.82), all part of the Indian team for Commonwealth Games to be held in July in Glasgow — had taken time off from their busy professional circuit commitments.
SRFI consultant coach S. Maniam and National coach Cyrus Poncha were in attendance too as Dipika and Ghosal played Joshna and Sandhu in a gruelling one-hour match, the final session of the short camp.
For the many junior boys and girls this was a spectacle as the pros put on a show of power, precision and poise.
Maj. Maniam seemed sastisfied with the way the players have shaped up; after all, it was he who has been tuning them up from their junior days, along with Poncha. His watchful eyes were glued to the action as the four went through the grind.
“Considering the quality at the Commonwealth Games, India’s best bet for a medal lies in the doubles,” said Poncha.
According to Maj. Maniam, who is also director-coaching with the World Squash Federation, India has a good chance of a medal in Glasgow because each player has risen in ranking and the confidence levels will be high.
Consequently, he said, the stress will be on the doubles.
“This camp, which got over on Thursday, will be followed by another later this month, and possibly another before the team leaves for the Games,” Maj. Maniam said.
From the seriousness on display, the quartet seemed keen to sharpen coordination in doubles play.
“Winning medals for the country is our primary aim,” said Ghosal, the highest ranked Indian male player.
Dipika spoke of the charm of playing for the country and bringing home laurels, though the sport was not exactly high-paying (“We hardly have any savings.”).
Joshna said more academies like the ISA would do a world of good to broadbase the sport, like in Egypt — the top force in squash — where 90 per cent of those who take to the sport end up being professionals.

Women paddlers fail to cross quarterfinal hurdle
","India’s challenge at the World Table Tennis championships ended after the women paddlers were beaten 1-3 in the quarterfinals by Brazil in Tokyo on Saturday.
After a brilliant performance in group events of Stage 1 in second division, the Indian girls were expected to give some fight in the knockout stage.
But, except for Manika Batra, who is in the best form of her life, none of the other girls could withstand the pressure built by the Brazilians.
The beginning for India was the kind which neither the girls nor their coach Bhawani Mukehrjee would have wanted.
K Shamini, who played well, was unable to come to terms against Gui Lin who made use of most of her rival’s mistakes at crucial junctions.
Shamini, despite taking two games of her opponent of Chinese origin, lost 8-11, 11-7, 5-11, 11-9, 7-11.
But Manika, brushing aside the pressure, restored parity beating Ligia Silva 13-11, 7-11, 11-4, 12-10.
Playing an attacking game Manika kept pushing Silva to the brink. However, Ankita lost her singles to Caroline Kumahara 4-11, 8-11, 11-7, 6-11 without much fight.
Once again, the pressure was back on Manika, who had to play her reverse singles against Brazil’s No. 1 player Gui Lin, and could not sustain the pace generated by Lin and succumbed 12-14, 7-11, 12-10, 5-11.
The coach appreciated Manika’s excellent form in the championships but rued the failure to make further progress in the championships.
“I would have wanted them to make it to the semifinals at least. Though that was not to be, we are in a happy frame of mind. Now we will look ahead to the CWG at Glasgow before working on the Asian Games at Incheon,” said Mukherjee.

Maheswary nominated again for Arjuna Awards
","Triple jumper >Renjith Maheswary, who has been stopped from receiving Arjuna Award under controversial circumstances on charges of dope violation last year, has again been recommended by the Athletics Federation of India (AFI) for the coveted honour this year.
A top AFI official told PTI that >Maheswary’s name has again been nominated for this year’s Arjuna Award on the ground that the Sports Ministry’s eligibility rule does not bar him from getting the coveted honour.
“Sports Ministry’s eligibility clause says that any athlete who failed a dope test conducted by a WADA or IOC accredited laboratory will be barred from getting the award.
But Maheswary’s case relates to a test conducted in 2008 while the NDTL got WADA accreditation in 2009 only,” the official said.
“So, we have recommended Maheswary’s name again for this year’s Arjuna Award. Let us see what the new government does this time,” he said.
Interestingly, this same eligibility rule (4.2) of the Sports Ministry for conferring Arjuna Awards was considered when the controversy over Maheswary being barred from receiving the coveted award cropped up in September last year.
The eligibility rule (4.2) for >Arjuna Awards as amended on March 15, 2010 states that “sportspersons found positive for use of drugs banned by the International Olympic Committee in any laboratory accredited by the IOC will not be eligible for Arjuna Award”.
Maheswary also has the performance to show as he won a silver in the Pune Asian Championships in July last, besides winning a silver and a bronze in the Asian Grand Prix last year.
After a detailed investigation, the Ministry had come to a conclusion in September last that Maheswary was found to have used ephedrine during the 46th National Athletic Championships in Kochi in 2008 and hence he would not be conferred with the award.
The Ministry had said then that there was some doubt regarding the acceptability of the test sample from Maheswary.
It had said that the report of National Dope Testing Laboratory might not have been an acceptable ‘Adverse Analytical Finding’, and that the chain of custody of the sample might not have been sufficiently foolproof.
However, the Ministry had noted that Maheswary had never protested against the findings of the inquiry committee or the punishment awarded by the competent authority. His acceptance of the punishment, despite the flaws in collection and analysis of the sample, had made the punishment final.
A Kottayam-based organisation, Navalokam Samskarika Kendram had filed a Public Interest Litigation in the Supreme Court seeking intervention in the Maheswary case and Sports Ministry had given its response after being issued notice by the top court.
Maheswary, on his part, said that he wanted to silence his critics by his performance.
“I am concentrating on my training at NIS, Patiala now. I want to answer my critics by doing well in the upcoming Commonwealth Games and Asian Games,” he said.
“I have been told by my friends that Sports Ministry has admitted before the Supreme Court that the WADA had doubted the dope testing procedure on the ground that the chain of custody of my urine sample was not foolproof. I am told that the Ministry said that even the IAAF did not lend any credence to the findings of my dope results.
“I am sad to hear all these, but I just want to move forward,” he said.

Gay suspended 1 year, returns Olympic silver medal
","Sprinter Tyson Gay accepted a one-year suspension on Friday after testing positive for a banned substance nearly a year ago and returned the silver medal he won in the men’s 400-meter relay at the 2012 London Olympics.
USADA announced on Friday that Gay’s one-year ban began on June 23, the day his sample was collected at the U.S. championships.
As part of the penalty, Gay, the American record-holder in the 100, also accepted loss of results dating to July 15, 2012, the date of when he first used a product that contained a banned substance. He was a member of the relay team at the London Games that finished second to a Jamaican team led by Usain Bolt. The Americans set a national record with a time of 37.04 seconds. He has given his medal back to the United States Olympic Committee.
USADA said in a statement that upon receiving notification of his positive tests, Gay voluntarily withdrew from all competition prior to the 2013 world championships and has not competed since.
The 31-year-old Gay could’ve been given a penalty twice as long, but received consideration after assisting USADA in the investigation into his positive test. USADA said he tested positive for the presence of an exogenous androgenic anabolic steroid.
“We appreciate Tyson doing the right thing by immediately withdrawing from competition once he was notified, accepting responsibility for his decisions, and fully and truthfully cooperating with us in our ongoing investigation into the circumstances surrounding his case,” USADA CEO Travis Tygart said in a statement.
In a statement released by USA Track and Field, CEO Max Siegel said the organization is “gravely disappointed any time an athlete uses performance-enhancing drugs, and Tyson Gay’s case serves as a lesson about the consequences of making poor decisions. We appreciate that Tyson accepted responsibility and has assisted USADA by providing information to help battle the use of PEDs.”
There are no major international meets in track this summer, but U.S. championships will be held June 26-29 in Sacramento, California. And while Gay could become eligible for that meet, the disqualification of his results dating to 2012 has taken away his qualifying time for the meet. He could petition the track and field committee for consideration, but USATF has said it hasn’t received such a petition yet.
Gay has until June 16 to enter a petition in order to gain entry into the meet.

","The opposition continued to be strong but there was a marked improvement in the attitude of the Indian girls as they went down to top seed Australia 0-2 in the match for the third place in the Asia Oceania World Junior under-14 girls tennis tournament here on Saturday.
Though Shivani Ingle and Sathwika Sama managed to eke out only five games, there were many rallies that showed that the Indian girls were willing to work to bridge the gap in terms of quality.
Shivani took three games off Baiing Lin, all of them in the first set.
She did break the Aussie in the eighth game when the latter was serving for the first set.
Sathwika in the rallies long against Destanee Aiava, even though the match lasted only 45 minutes.
It was impressive the way Sathwika kept improving through the match and hammered four winners in holding serve in the sixth game of the second set.
With a little more tuning in terms of anticipation and athleticism, the Indian girls hinted that they could not only match the Aussies but also take the fight to them. Easy goingIn the final, Chinese Taipei pulled it off against China in style, without dropping a set. The player holding the key to the Chinese fortunes in the tournament, the lanky Tang Qianhui played well but could not capitalise on the favourable flow as the diminutive Pei-Hsuan Chen threw back everything and hit with punch.
The Chinese tended to err far too often and did not have the motivation to make a fight of it.
Once she lost the first set and dropped serve early in the second, there was no recovery.
In the second singles, I-Hsuan Cho showed that she was easily the best girl in the tournament, with her strong serves and strokes, as she dropped just a game while outclassing Nima Zhuoma.
Welcome sightIt was a welcome sight as the players mixed freely at the end of a hard week of competition and had a lot of fun while waiting for the presentation ceremony.
The top four teams qualified for the World Group competition to be staged in the Czech Republic in August.

The results:


Final: Chinese Taipei bt China 2-0 (Pei-Hsuan Chen bt Tang Qianhui 7-5, 6-3; I-Hsuan Cho bt Nima Zhuoma 6-0, 6-1).

Third place: Australia bt India 2-0 (Baijing Lin bt Shivani Ingle 6-3, 6-0; Destanee Aiava bt Sathwika Sama 6-0, 6-2).

Final placings: 1. Chinese Taipei, 2. China, 3. Australia, 4. India, 5. Japan, 6. Kazakhstan, 7. New Zealand, 8. Hong Kong.

Sania, Cara win first title of season in Portugal
","Sania Mirza and Cara Black won their first title of the season with a hard-fought 6-4 6-3 win over Eva Hrdinova and Valeria Solovyeva in the final of the WTA Portugal Open, here today.
The top seeded Indo-Zimbabwean pair, playing their third finals of the season, was tested by the Czech-Russian team in summit clash, which lasted one hour and 18 minutes.
Before, this Sania and Cara had ended runners-up at Indian Wells in March and at Stuttgart event, last week.
Courtesy an early break, the top seeds raced to 3-1 lead in the opening set but Eva and Valeria raised their game by a few notches to not only break their rivals back but also snatched lead by the seventh game.
Stunned by the fightback of the Czech-Russian pair, Sania and Cara broke Eva and Valeria in the eight game to make it 4-4 and one more time in the 10th to pocket the first set.
After trading a break each, the two pairs were 3-3 in the second set. A double fault by Cara put the top seeds down a breakpoint but they saved it to be up 4-3.
They broke the fighting rivals in the next game and Sania served out the match in the ninth game.
Sania and Cara shared euro 9,919 as prize money and earned 280 ranking points each for the win.

FIFA vetoes Fernando’s request to play for Portugal
","Football’s governing body FIFA has vetoed a request by Porto’s Brazil-born midfielder Fernando to play for Portugal in the World Cup.
The 26-year-old was granted Portuguese nationality last December having represented Porto since signing from Brazil’s Vila Nova in 2007, reports Xinhua.
But in a statement released on Friday, the Portuguese Football Federation revealed FIFA had dashed the player’s hope of representing his adopted country at this year’s World Cup.
“FIFA considered that the player did not hold Portuguese nationality when he played for Brazil in the under—20 World Cup qualifiers, as required by federation regulations,” the statement said.
Fernando had hoped to join a long list of Brazil-born players to switch their allegiance.
Recent examples include Deco (Portugal), Marcos Senna (Spain), Pepe (Portugal) and Diego Costa (Spain).

Decision to pull out is silly: Vicky Chandhok
","“It’s nonsense and a silly thing (to do),” said Madras Motor Sports Club (MMSC) vice-president Vicky Chandhok on the decision some riders have made to pull out of the second round of the National two-wheeler racing championship.
Two-wheeler riders have long held that their sport hasn’t been as aggressively promoted as four-wheeler racing. The decision not to take part in the second round, scheduled to be held at the Irungattukottai track near here from June 6-8, was based on a lack of live television coverage of the Nationals, among other things.
Multiple-time National bike champion Rajini Krishnan has often argued that despite doing well in several international events and being the best in the country, his career hasn’t progressed, both monetarily and profile-wise. “I have remained in the same place,” he said.
Matters had reached a flashpoint early this year when drivers said they would boycott the first round if their demands for better organisation and promotion of the sport were not met. MMSC promised to address the riders’ grievances. But not satisfied with what was offered, many teams pulled out of the first round held on February 15-16.
With the deadline for entries for the second round fast approaching, some teams have joined the MMSC bandwagon.
“We are not happy but satisfied,” said P. Rajesh of Sparks Racing. “What we asked they’ve (MMSC) done. MMSC has promised television coverage (not live) on a Tamil channel and on Neo Sports.”
Rajesh further said MMSC has promised to give new set of tyres after two rounds for a single entry and better food and increased guest passes for each team. Performance Racing’s K. Manivannan, too, said his team will be racing in the second round primarily to fulfil the commitments to its sponsor, JS Engineering (New Delhi).
Manivannan listed out several offers made by MMSC to all the teams such as the 10 per cent reduction in the entry fee for an individual and team entry, 50 per cent reduction in pay-and-practice sessions, among other things. “All these were made before the first round,” said Manivannan.
Moto Rev director Bala Vijay, Rajini, Moto 46 worx’s Ameen Nawaz Khan and Pro-Lap racing’s E. Ganesh have decided, in principle, not to take part in the second round.
Bala Vijay insisted that the offers made now will not have a big impact. He said after being in the sport for a long time, the returns have been minimal and the sport hasn’t witnessed a change for the better. “We have not been given the platform to exhibit our talent. For the sport to flourish, live TV coverage is a must,” he said.
Ganesh concurred. “Whenever we approach sponsors, they ask where’s the coverage and we don’t have any answers,” he said. Basically, Ganesh said there is no respect for two-wheeler riders.

The defence

Chandhok, however, said MMSC has met all the demands of the riders given its limitations. “We don’t have big ad expenditure. Ours is a non-profit organisation. We do not have budgets for advertisements at least for the next two years,” he said.
The National Federation, FMSCI, said it will wait-and-watch as to how the situation unfolds before taking any decision. “If there is poor participation from the teams even in the second round, we will come down hard (on the organisers),” said Akbar Ebrahim, Member and Co-ordinator, two-wheeler racing commission.

“There will be different courses and we will encourage kids from all over the world to come to take up the course for two weeks. I am going to fund a lot of disadvantaged kids and will have a hands-on approach towards the academy,” the former England batsman added.
India is also in his wish list as far as setting up his ‘Kevin Pietersen Academy’ is concerned.

In his letter, Verma has alleged that ICC has kept its “mouth shut” on IPL “scams” and should prevent the Tamil Nadu strongman from attending its meetings till the final verdict is announced by the Supreme Court.
In his letter, Verma questioned the ICC’s decision of not enquiring about the IPL related issues.
“As per ICC conduct rules, if any player’s name comes up in any illegal acts, it is the duty of ICC to investigate. But I am sorry to say, ICC is not taking any interest till today,” Verma was quoted as saying in a letter.
Verma also sarcastically commented that ICC has now become ‘India Cement Cricket’.
“Has the ICC become India Cement Cricket?” he asked.
He urged ICC to stop Srinivasan from functioning as chairman of the ICC’s executive board till the probe is over.
“Once again I am requesting on the behalf of my CAB to immediately intervene and take appropriate action against guilty persons. ICC must respect the Indian law, the apex court of the country has stopped the BCCI president from functioning till the probe concludes.”

Fleming credits high-quality players for success
","Stephen Fleming’s modesty is arguably his most conspicuous trait. It marks his pronouncements often and the charm of his humility doesn’t slip away.
Attributing Chennai Super Kings’ success to the high-quality players at his disposal rather than his coaching methods, Fleming is deeply proud of the side’s consistency.
The Kiwi is also amazed by the skill sets of today’s cricketers. He wonders whether he could have reverse-swept a wide yorker by Shoaib Akhtar during his playing days and replies in the negative.
Perhaps, if Fleming still had been playing, the Twenty20 format would have ensured he developed at the current rate of evolution of the game.
T20 cricket has also made players more courageous, adds the 41-year-old. “When the IPL began, T20s provided a release for the cricketers from other formats. Now, skill development has gone through the roof. And it flows into ODIs and Tests. Earlier, athleticism wasn’t a high priority for the players from the subcontinent. But the fielding of the current young Indian cricketers is a joy to watch.”
CSK’s recent flirtations with controversy perhaps required the players and coaches to put up a brave front in a different sense and Fleming admits that there was anxiety over the franchise’s future when the Supreme Court proposed suspending the team.
“There was nothing special said or done when we got together at the start of the season. But there was huge relief and excitement when we learnt the decision.”
The presence of various channels of leadership in the side helps CSK to combat the myriad issues it has or may face. Fleming firmly believes that the experience of his long stint as the New Zealand captain has helped him to do his current job better.
“It helps me to understand what’s required. Dhoni has been a captain for a long time so there’s some synergy between us. There’s trust between us as he realises that I’ve faced similar challenges in the past. I understand where he’s at in his career.”
In addition to the duo, Brendon McCullum, Faf du Plessis and Dwayne Bravo have also acquired the taste of leading their country. When asked about his compatriot, Fleming was quick to point out the different positives brought to the side by Brendon.
“Brendon’s looking to maximise his resources for NZ while Dhoni has a set pattern group of players. Brendon would seem to be more dynamic with his changes. Dhoni has been more calculated and works on consistency, rather than the flamboyance we associate with Brendon.” The recent success of Dwayne Smith and Brendon bears testimony to the ease with which new players buy into CSK’s culture because of the side’s consistency. “Players know what they’re coming into. For a team, six years are enough to put runs on the board. We pick players who’ll fit into our system and not the ones who’ll need to be moulded.”
This success has also given Fleming a lifestyle that makes him “incredibly happy.” The idea of coaching an international side, although appealing, will have to wait.

Chennai Super Kings will look to extend its winning streak
","Chennai Super Kings perhaps knows the art of winning better than any other side.
This year too, CSK has bounced back from an early loss to win five matches in-a-row and occupy the top slot with 10 points and better net run rate.
“Perennially, we have been slow starters. So, to get a start like this has been excellent,” said coach Stephen Fleming as CSK practised at the Ferozeshah Kotla here on Sunday ahead of its Indian Premier League engagement against seventh-placed Delhi Daredevils.
CSK’s key to success has been its choice of players in the auction and roping in Dwayne Smith has turned out to be master-stroke. So far, he has served the side well with some fine knocks, including three half-centuries and two 29s, and a few wickets.
Another noteworthy performer for CSK has been New Zealand skipper Brendon McCullum, who has played some important innings apart from enriching the side with his knowledge of the game.
Captain M.S. Dhoni, West Indian Dwayne Bravo, Suresh Raina and R. Ashwin have been loyal to the team over the years and have contributed in building it as a strong unit. Ashwin, an integral part of the team, has been outstanding with his highly-economical spells studded with crucial breakthroughs.
All-rounder Ravindra Jadeja has again proved his worth with his fabulous bowling figures (two four-wicket hauls) and useful runs, while paceman Mohit Sharma has benefited from Dhoni's guidance to turn into a match-winner.
With its insatiable hunger of victories, CSK will be determined to extend its winning streak.
For DD, the primary task will be to overcome the odds within. Captain Kevin Pietersen’s injured finger is still hurting him as well as the side. The team has to look beyond J-P. Duminy and Quinton de Kock to strengthen its batting. Mohammad Shami, Wayne Parnell and Jaydev Unadkat have to find ways to sharpen their bowling.
DD, which has managed four points from six matches, often falters in maintaining the intensity. It has to arrest that trend in order to put up a fight against the formidable CSK.

We have been lucky with our team selections: Stephen Fleming
","After enjoying an excellent first half of the IPL-7 in the UAE, the Chennai Super Kings coach Stephen Fleming is happy that selection decisions have paid off and hopes that the yellow brigade continue with their winning momentum.
“It is a lot of hard work that goes into it. We have been very lucky with our selections and the players have repaid the faith already,” said Fleming on the sidelines of the teams’ practice at the Feroz Shah Kotla today.
“If you ask me that five wins in six games, I would definitely take it. We are perennially slow starters but this season has been different. To get a start like this has been excellent,” he added.
Having featured in five of the six IPL finals, two-time champions CSK have performed like a well-oiled machine under the captaincy of M.S. Dhoni, but coach Fleming wants to remain cautious due to the unpredictable nature of the format.
“Touchwood, most departments are going well. We have bowled well, fielding has been excellent and batting has been good. But we know how form can be fickle in the T20 format. We have always been cautious of making statements like that, but at this stage things have been going well in all departments,” said the former New Zealand skipper.
The opening pair of Dwayne Smith and Brendon McCullum has been super consistent for the Dhoni-led side and Fleming, who has been CSK’s coach for six seasons now, admits that well begun is half done.
“He (McCullum) has leadership qualities and an energy to him that is quite infectious. His combination with Dwayne and Faf du Plessis along with the Indian fielders has provided some electricity to the fielding. Certainly his runs and the opening partnership has been the highlight so far this year,” said a beaming Fleming.

Delhi face uphill task to stop rampaging Chennai
","Delhi Daredevils face an uphill task of stopping a rampaging Chennai Super Kings as the two sides gear up to lock horns in an Indian Premier League match at Feroz Shah Kotla ground, in New Delhi on Monday.
The Mahendra Singh Dhoni-led CSK is on a song with five victories on the trot while Delhi hardly have anything to rejoice with four defeats in six outings so far.
Even the return to their home turf failed to change DD’s fortunes as they copped a five-wicket defeat against Rajasthan Royals on Saturday night.
Delhi has failed to click as a unit and that is a major reason for their misery in the Twenty20 League. In complete contrast, Chennai have been outstanding be it in batting, bowling or fielding.
In batting, South African southpaw JP Duminy, and in bowling, India spearhead Mohammed Shami, along with Wayne Parnell, have been the saving grace for them.
Sitting just above the bottom-placed defending champions Mumbai Indians in the eight-team competition, Delhi need a miracle of sorts to move up the ladder and be in reckoning for the knockout stage.
Delhi were humiliated by Chennai in the UAE-leg when they lost to them by an embarrassing 93-run margin after being all out for a paltry 84 in a chase of 178.
There has been only one match -- against Sunrisers Hyderabad -- against whom the manner of defeat was not embarrassing as almost all batsmen contributed even though the effort proved insufficient in the end.
Now Daredevils are in such a mess that they need Ross Taylor, Dinesh Karthik and most importantly skipper Kevin Pietersen to do something special if they aspire further progress in the tournament.
Quinton de Kock and Murali Vijay have got runs on and off but there is no time to relax.
However, it is always easier said than done when a team is going through a rough patch. Moreover, they have a team to contend with which can be described with only superlatives.
Right from the top to middle and lower order, the batting line-up is equipped with match winners. Dwayne Smith and Brendon McCullum have given the side the never-before solidity and in the middle order they have players such as Suresh Raina, Dhoni himself and Faf du Plessis.
CSK’s attack is also formidable with Ben Hilfenhaus leading from the front. Mohit Sharma has been a revelation while the wily Ravichandran Ashwin always has a trick or two up his sleeves to restrict the rival batsman.
If that is not enough, Ravindra Jadeja is there as a big asset for the team with his all round ability.
The best way for Delhi is to put pressure on CSK batting line-up and restrict them to a gettable total but saying is one thing and doing it is another.

Teams from


Delhi Daredevils: Kevin Pietersen (C), M Agarwal, N Coulter-Nile, Q de Kock, JP Duminy, K Jadhav, D Karthik, S Kaul, Milind Kumar, Mohammed Shami, S Nadeem, J Neesham, W Parnell, HS Sharath, R Sharma, LR Shukla, R Shukla, R Taylor, MK Tiwary, S Tiwary, JD Unadkat, M Vijay and J Yadav.

Rajasthan start favourites against KKR
","The last time they clashed, Rajasthan Royals edged past Kolkata Knight Riders in perhaps the most nerve-wrecking contest of this season’s IPL and it promises to be another humdinger when the two teams with fluctuating fortunes square off in Ahmedabad on Monday.
Their most recent head-to-head took place on April 29 in >Abu Dhabi, which was among three UAE cities which played host to the IPL’s first leg.
That clash turned out to be a battle of epic proportions.
Both the teams ended their regulation overs on the same score, before also finishing level in the Super Over.
Finally it took a boundary count back to decide the match which was won by Royals in final analysis. And it would be interesting to see whether KKR would be able to pull themselves up from the slumber and extract revenge for the heartbreaking loss.
Royals are better-placed as far as morale is concerned.
The team chalked out a thumping win over Delhi Daredevils only last night with discovering a match-winner in young >Karun Nair, who slammed a 50-ball 73.
KKR, on the other hand, were thoroughly outplayed in their 34-run defeat at the hands of Chennai Super Kings in their most recent match.
The biggest strength of Royals going into Monday’s match is their in-form batting. The team is on a three-match winning streak and given the dismal form which Kolkata is battling, a fourth victory on the trot does not look unlikely.
Royals’ batsmen have been in fine form but more would be expected of the likes of Shane Watson and Sanju Samson, both of whom have been making decent contributions but yet to come up with something really big that they are famed for.
On the bowling front, they have discovered the brilliance of leg-spinner Pravin Tambe, who has been making crucial breakthroughs. Pacer James Faulkner has spearheaded the pace department rather well with some good support from Dhawal Kulkarni and Kane Richardson.
In contrast, Kolkata have been living a nightmare, having suffered three back-to-back defeats. Their biggest concern right now is a floundering batting line-up.
Skipper Gautam Gambhir has quite simply flopped, failing to produce a single innings of significance so far, along with veteran Jacques Kallis, who has also been far from impressive.
In their previous match against Chennai, Robin Uthappa and Yusuf Pathan did come up with innings of substance but it would take a lot more than that to notch up wins.
On the bowling front, KKR have relied too heavily on spin duo of West Indian Sunil Narine and Bangladesh’s Shakib Al- Hasan. Their pacers, led by R Vinay Kumar, have failed to cause any major discomfort to the opposition line-ups.
Given the contrast in their recent form, Rajasthan would start hands-down favourite even though given the unpredictability of the tournament and the format, KKR can spring a surprise.

Teams (from):


Rajasthan Royals: Shane Watson (c), Ajinkya Rahane, James Faulkner, Stuart Binny, Sanju Samson, Brad Hodge, Steven Smith, Abhishek Nayar, Ben Cutting, Kane Richardson, Tim Southee, Unmukt Chand, Ankush Bains, Vikramjeet Malik, Rahul Tewatia, Ankit Sharma, Amit Mishra, Deepak Hooda, Rajat Bhatia, Kevon Cooper, Iqbal Abdulla, Dhawal Kulkarni, Pravin Tambe, Karun Nair, Dishant Yagnik.

Karun thrives on encouragement from Watson, Dravid
","Rajasthan Royals batsman Karun Nair, who fashioned the team’s emphatic win over Delhi Daredevils in the IPL, says encouragement from captain Shane Watson and mentor Rahul Dravid is helping him perform as an opener.
With Dravid now watching the action from the sidelines, Nair has been batting alongside Ajinkya Rahane at the top.
The Karnataka batsman’s unbeaten 73 off 50 balls not only ensured the team chase Daredevils’ 152 for five with ease, the solid knock could help him establish his place in the Rajasthan playing eleven.
“There is always pressure when you have got quality batsmen waiting in the dug-out. I was looking to give myself little more time in the middle and Watto and the support staff backed me to do well. That really helped,” Nair said of his effort.
“Even Rahul (Dravid) just told me to play with confidence and take more time at the centre. He has been of great help,” said the 22-year-old, who last year scored three hundreds for Karnataka in his debut Ranji Trophy season, helping his team win its first Ranji title in 15 years.
Asked how has the experience been as an opener after coming lower down the order for Karnataka, Nair said, “I used to open at the junior levels but there was no opening slot in the Karnataka Ranji team. Back opening again, I think have I adjusted really well.”
Talking about his IPL team, Nair felt Royals are gelling well as a team under Watson’s leadership,
“He encourages all the youngsters. We play as a team and are not depended on a particular player. I think that is why are winning most of the matches,” said Nair of his team which is third in the points table with four wins out of six games.
Nair signed by saying that it will be interesting to see how the team plays at its new home in Ahmedabad, leaving the ‘fortress’ at the Sawai Mansingh Stadium in Jaipur.

Overpriced Anderson feeling pressure: Doull
","Former New Zealand cricketer Simon Doull feels compatriot >Corey Anderson has not been able to express himself in the star-studded Mumbai Indians as he is feeling the pressure after being bought for too big a price tag in the IPL players’ auction.
“It was always going to be hard for Corey to fire in his first IPL as Mumbai Indians paid a lot of money for him which added the pressure on him,” Doull told PTI in New Delhi in an interview.
“They are not the team they were last year so now there is more pressure on Cory to perform which is not how it should be for a young man still finding his way in the early part of his career,” he said referring to the defending champions dismal run this season.
Mumbai Indians, a franchise which has a support staff as high-profile as the men in the middle, bought Anderson for Rs. 4.5 crore at the auction after he created a sensation in the cricketing world by smashing the fastest ODI hundred off 36 balls against the West Indies in January.
The management opted for the New Zealand all-rounder rather than retaining the likes of Glenn Maxwell and Dwayne Smith, who are doing well for their new teams -- Kings XI Punjab and Chennai Super Kings respectively.
“Look how Smith and Maxwell are doing now. Theirs are a good example of how a more relaxed atmosphere can help you perform better,” said Doull, who is now a well-known commentator.
While the on-field line-up includes proven international names like Kieron Pollard, Lasith Malinga, Rohit Sharma, Michael Hussey and Harbhajan Singh, Mumbai’s the support staff boasts of team icon Sachin Tendulkar, mentor Anil Kumble, advisor Ricky Ponting, fielding coach Jonty Rhodes and coach John Wright.
Maxwell has already said that he is much more relaxed at Kings XI Punjab, in the absence of plethora of stars.
To be fair to Anderson, the 23-year-old from Christchurch, has not done that bad considering the whole team is struggling at the moment.
He has scored 108 runs in six games at an average of 18 besides taking four wickets at 26.75, not the kind of numbers he was expected to deliver.
“I think Mumbai paid too much money for Corey. He is a good kid but you have got to give him time to develop as an international player. He needs at least two years more to improve his game. He has just started playing for New Zealand.
Even the fastest hundred he scored was in a shortened game,” said Doull.
Anderson has represented New Zealand in seven Tests, 12 ODIs and as many T20 Internationals.

Karun Nair does the star turn for Royals
","Karun Nair, who made a valuable contribution in his debut season to help Karnataka win the 2013-14 Ranji Trophy title, proved that he belonged to the big stage. The 22-year-old showed tough temperament to notch up his maiden half-century (73 n.o., 50b) in the Indian Premier League and guide Rajasthan Royals to a seven-wicket win over Delhi Daredevils at the Ferozeshah Kotla here on Saturday.
After Shane Watson inserted Daredevils in and the home side posted 152 for five, Royals needed someone to take up responsibility and handle the run chase smoothly. Nair did just that and cemented his place in RR’s future journey.
With his impeccable shot selection, Quinton de Kock provided a solid start to the home side. Often, the left-hander hopped across the off-stump to play spectacular scoops to the boundary. A superb flick off Watson for six and a couple of fours off Stuart Binny and Rajat Bhatia delighted the home fans.
In four overs, de Kock and Murali Vijay gathered 33 for the first wicket. Vijay looked promising before perishing to an ill-timed shot in James Faulkner’s opening over. Kevin Pietersen’s stay at the middle was eventful. The DD captain received a ‘life’ in Bhatia’s first over. As the ball struck Pietersen’s pads, RR wicketkeeper Sanju Vishwanadh collected it in a flash and disturbed the stumps with a direct throw.
Even though the RR fielders appealed for a run out, umpire Sanjay Hazare did not refer it to the third umpire. The visitor rued its luck as television replays suggested that Pietersen should have been given ‘out.’
An accurate Tambe once again proved his utility. After removing Pietersen, he took a sharp return catch to get rid of the dangerous de Kock three balls later. Faulkner was the other bowler who hit the good length frequently to check the run flow and provided two crucial breakthroughs.
DD relied on J.P. Duminy’s responsible knock (39 off 31) to reach a decent aggregate. The South African, who added 46 crucial runs with Kedar Jadhav (28 off 14), batted sensibly at the critical time and shifted gear in the death overs to help DD put up a fighting total.
He slotted four boundaries to different parts of the park and a six over square leg before being brilliantly caught on the fence by Bhatia off Kane Richardson. In reply, RR lost Ajinkya Rahane early, but Nair and Vishwanadh (34 off 28) gathered 51 for the second wicket to keep the required run rate within reach. Vishwanadh’s innings was a mix of aggression and caution. He stepped out to hit left-arm spinner Shahbaz Nadeem for four and pulled one for six off consecutive deliveries before being stumped in the same over. Nair’s was a story of determination. He reacted according to the situation and switched between his roles beautifully. While collecting runs predominantly on the off-side, he hammered eight fours and two sixes and saw RR home with nine balls to spare.

Juventus seals third straight title after Roma loss
","Juventus clinched its third straight and 30th overall Serie A title on Sunday without even playing. With second-placed Roma losing 4—1 at Catania, Juventus’ eight-point lead became insurmountable because Roma only has two matches remaining.
Juventus, which has three games to play, can celebrate when it hosts play Atalanta on Monday.
The title was a bit of a consolation for Juventus after it was eliminated from the Europa League semifinals by Benfica on Thursday.
In Sicily, Mariano Izco scored for Catania in the 26th and 34th minutes. Gonzalo Bergessio also netted for the hosts in the 55th after Roma captain Francesco Totti pulled one back in the 37th. Then Pablo Barrientos added another for Catania in the 79th.
The loss ended Roma’s nine-match winning streak.

We need to bat better, says Delhi’s Jadhav
","Delhi Daredevils batsman Kedar Jadhav feels his team needs to post bigger scores and take wickets upfront to get its floundering campaign back on track in the IPL.
“We are not getting enough wickets with the new ball. …I think we were 20-30 runs short. We had to setup an attacking field as the score was less and the bowlers ended up giving runs,” said Jadhav after Daredevils lost to the Rajasthan Royals by seven wickets after putting up 152 for five on board.
The Delhi team, second from bottom in the points table with two wins from six games, is relying on its home games at the Ferozshah Kotla to make a comeback in the tournament. The Daredevils play the mighty Chennai Super Kings on Monday.
Asked about how the wicket played in the opening game at Ferozshah Kotla, Jadhav said: “It was comfortable to play the fast bowlers but the spinners were getting a lot of grip from the surface. The bounce was also okay.”
On what he thinks about the match against Chennai Super Kings, Jadhav said, “They are surely a better team on paper but it will be about who plays better on the day.”
Star players like skipper Kevin Pietersen not finding form and lack of an extra specialist spinner is also adding to the team’s woes.
“Pietersen will take some more time to get into the groove as he is returning from an injury. And I have heard leggie Imran Tahir is coming…But… if there are not enough runs on the board, it will be tough for most spinners unless you are a Shane Warne or Sunil Narine.”
Jadhav’s 14-ball 28 at number six helped Daredevils get past 150 on Saturday.

Feels good to take Pietersen’s wicket: Tambe

The couple of wickets he took proved crucial in Rajasthan Royals’ thumping win over Delhi Daredevils and leg-spinner Pravin Tambe said it feels good to come out trumps against the likes of Kevin Pietersen after enticing them to target him.
Tambe’s crucial wickets of Pietersen and Quinton de Kock helped RR restrict the hosts to 152 for five — a target which his team overhauled in 18.3 overs after losing just three wickets. “His (Pietersen’s) wicket was very important because he is a big player and everyone knows that. And if he stays at the wicket, he can turn things around for his team. We knew that he would target at least one bowler,” Tambe told IPL’s official website.
“I was the only spinner, so I thought he would target me. I knew the areas that I had to bowl in, and I bowled according to the plan and got his wicket,” he said.
Asked to elaborate on ‘the right areas he tries to bowl in, Tambe said it is all about inviting the batsman to hit him.
“T20 is a game where even a small mistake will cost you. So I try and see that I don’t let the batsman swing the bat. If he tries to hit, then I would get his wicket. So I try to cramp the batsman; I try and work on that area.
“So when I pitched it in the right area and Pietersen tried to hit me, I got the wicket as he mistimed it and was caught near the ropes at long-on,” he explained.

City tops Premier League; Fulham, Cardiff down
","Manchester City hurdled its last big obstacle en route to the English Premier League title by winning 3-2 at Everton, while heavy defeats condemned Fulham and Cardiff to relegation on Saturday.
Two home wins, against Aston Villa on Wednesday and West Ham on Sunday, separate City from a second championship in three years after coming from behind to win at Goodison Park a stadium where it has traditionally struggled with just one victory from its last 15 visits.
Sergio Aguero’s goal cancelled out Ross Barkley’s brilliant 11th-minute opener for Everton, then Edin Dzeko scored twice in a five-minute span bridging halftime to help City go top for a day at least on goal difference from Liverpool, and two points clear of Chelsea.
All three teams have two games left, with Chelsea playing Norwich on Sunday and Liverpool at Crystal Palace on Monday.
“Three points is a huge step for us,” City manager Manuel Pellegrini said. “It’s a decisive moment, but we haven’t finished yet.”
Aguero gave City a scare by limping off in the 28th minute soon after scoring his equaliser but said on Twitter that he came off as a precaution and he was “fine.”
Everton’s defeat dealt a major blow to the title hopes of neighbour Liverpool, and ensured Arsenal clinched fourth spot and Champions League qualification for the 17th straight season.
Resurgent Sunderland’s surprise 1-0 win at Manchester United pulled the team three points clear of third-from-bottom Norwich, gave interim United manager Ryan Giggs a reality check, and also consigned Fulham and Cardiff to the second tier.
Fulham lost 4-1 at Stoke, and Cardiff was defeated 3-0 at Newcastle, leaving both sides unable to climb out of the relegation zone.
Sunderland has taken seven points from trips to Man City, Chelsea and United in the past three weeks, with Sebastian Larsson’s 30th-minute goal clinching a first league victory at Old Trafford since 1968.
Already out of contention to qualify for the Champions League, United is also struggling to make the Europa League as it is six points behind sixth-place Tottenham, which lost 2-0 at West Ham.
Aston Villa moved six points clear of Norwich after beating Hull 3-1 thanks to Ashley Westwood’s goal after 58 seconds and a pair of headers from Andreas Weimann just before halftime.
Southampton beat Swansea 1-0 away thanks to Rickie Lambert’s injury-time goal.

Griffin, Paul lift Clippers over Warriors
","When the embattled Los Angeles Clippers finally vanquished the Golden State Warriors, Doc Rivers could no longer contain himself.
Rivers began pumping his fists and shouting, then gave high fives to fans. It was a rare but understandable emotional outburst from the coach of the Clippers, who overcame the biggest distraction any NBA team has ever faced to advance in the Western Conference playoffs.
Playing under the cloud of disgraced owner Donald Sterling, the third-seeded Clippers fought off the visiting sixth-seeded Warriors, 126-121, in Game 7 of their first-round series on Saturday night as Blake Griffin scored 24 points and Chris Paul added 22 and 14 assists.
“I just thought this team really needed the game,” Rivers explained. “I just thought with all this stuff, this team just needed this win.”
“You could tell that he really had a sense of relief that this was over,” Griffin said.
The teams traded the lead four times down the stretch before the Clippers brought back “Lob City,” their high-flying act featuring the dunks of Griffin and DeAndre Jordan.
Jordan converted a lob from Paul before two free throws by Stephen Curry gave the Warriors their last lead at 109-108 with 2:22 to play.

 I just thought this team really needed the game. I just thought with all this stuff, this team just needed this win. 
The block triggered a fast break capped by a lob to Griffin. Jordan added a follow slam for a 114-109 lead with 1:15 remaining.
Jordan hammered home a lob from Griffin to keep the margin at 120-115 with 22 seconds left. The Clippers made six free throws down the stretch to offset a flurry of three-pointers by the Warriors.

Oklahoma City Thunder 120, Memphis Grizzlies 109

Kevin Durant made 5-of-5 three-pointers and scored 33 points and Russell Westbrook had a triple-double with 27 points, 16 assists and 10 rebounds for the second-seeded Thunder, who overcame a slow start at home to win Game 7 of their West series.
The Thunder reached the conference semi-finals for the fourth straight year and will face the third-seeded Los Angeles Clippers. Spain's Marc Gasol scored 24 points for the seventh-seeded Grizzlies, who were without suspended star forward Zach Randolph.

Indiana Pacers 92, Atlanta Hawks 80

Paul George had a playoff career-high 30 points and 11 rebounds as the top-seeded host Pacers shut down the eighth-seeded Hawks in Game 7 of their East series, advancing to the conference semi-finals for the third straight year.
Lance Stephenson added 19 points and 14 boards for Indiana, which next faces fifth-seeded Washington. Kyle Korver scored 19 points for the Hawks, who made just 11-of-44 three-pointers and shot 30 percent overall.

I’m a more precise driver now, says Gill
","He still has that crazy streak running in him, something that sees him take huge risks, but Gaurav Gill, the country’s best rally driver ever, believes he is a changed man now.
“With age and with time, my driving has become more precise now, that is what is required at this level of driving,” said Gill, the country’s first Asia Pacific rally champion, in a chat with The Hindu at the scenic Rajah Island, near Chavakkad.
“We don’t get faster, we get more precise. So, when you’re more precise, you’re able to do the same thing, at the same time, at every corner throughout the rally stages. That’s very important. Not to have ten corners right and three corners wrong, that’s how you grow up in this sport.”
So, does that mean that the ‘craziness’ has gone out from his driving?
“You need to be crazy as well. If you’re not crazy, you can’t be fast. You have to be scared at the same time, if you’re not scared, you are being stupid. So, these are all small, small things in rallying that attributes to a good drive,” said the 32-year-old.
Gill is the APRC series leader after his Rally of Whangarei triumph in New Zealand last month and one thought that the champion would be under less pressure while driving in the event now.
“No, it’s a bigger challenge because people expect the moon from you. That means you’re always on your toes and you’ve got do it in your own style,” revealed Gill. “Because, you are a champion now and they expect a lot from a champion. So, it’s an even bigger task.”
Gill had plans to drive in the newly-introduced World Rally Championship-2 last year but it didn’t work out in the end.
“We tried to race in the WRC last year but the car was still in the container and the logistics didn’t work out and we couldn’t make it on time. But we are hopeful, we should be able to drive next year,” said the star who drives for MRF Tyres banner in the APRC.
But despite the delay, and the uncertainty, Gill made it clear that he was not getting impatient.
“I’m not getting impatient, am thankful to my sponsors, at least I’m getting to drive the best cars in the world and get to beat some of the best drivers in the world, so that is good.”
However Gill, who is driving a factory-backed Skoda from the Czech car-maker, feels that his return to the WRC would be a lot easier and faster if he gets a big push from Skoda India.

Arjuna award: SC refuses to interfere with govt decision
","The Supreme Court on Monday refused to interfere with the government’s decision withdrawing Arjuna award from triple jump athlete >Renjith Maheshwary, hours before the presentation ceremony last year.
“This is not a subject matter of judicial review. You cannot bring such matter for judicial review. It is not justifiable,” a bench headed by Chief Justice R.M. Lodha said.
The bench also questioned Kerala-based organisation Navalokam Samskarika Kendram, Kottayam, which had filed the petition saying “is it a fundamental right to get Arjuna award?”
“What is your fundamental right which has been violated?” the bench asked when senior advocate Gopal Subramanium was arguing for the organisation.
“There are much more deserving persons who do not get and could not make it to Arjuna award and there are also some who get, though not deserving,” the bench said while further elaborating that “even if you have not got Arjuna award, a person can be a good sportsperson”.
The bench, also comprising Justices M.B. Lokur and Kurian Joseph, declined to go into the issue that “the present refusal (in 2013) should not come on his way (this year)”.
The court was told that Maheshwary has again been recommended by the >Athletics Federation of India (AFI) for the coveted honour this year.
In the petition, the Kottayam-based organisation said Maheshwary’s name was in the award list released on August 14, 2013. On August 29, he came to Delhi from Chennai and stayed at Hotel Ashoka, along with other award winners, and participated in a rehearsal at Rashtrapati Bhavan for the function.

Ex-tennis player Elena Baltacha dies of cancer
","Elena Baltacha, a former top-50 professional tennis player, who had been fighting liver cancer since retiring from the game, died on Sunday. She was 30.
The former British No. 1 died peacefully surrounded by family and friends, the Women’s Tennis Association said on its website. Baltacha, who represented Britain at the 2012 London Olympics, was diagnosed with the illness in January, two months after retiring from tennis and only weeks after she married her long-time coach Nino Severino.
“We are heartbroken beyond words at the loss of our beautiful, talented and determined Bally,” Severino said in a statement. “She was an amazing person and she touched so many people with her inspirational spirit, her warmth and her kindness.”
“Elena’s journey was never an easy one and yet she consistently showed her strength, good humour and indomitable spirit,” WTA chairman Stacey Allaster said.
“We have lost a shining light from the heart of British tennis — a true role model, a great competitor and a wonderful friend,” former Fed Cup coach Iain Bates said. “We have so many special memories to cherish, but this leaves a gaping hole for everybody in both British and women’s tennis, and words simply cannot express how saddened we are by this news.”
Baltacha had already planned a tennis charity event in June, “Rally for Bally,” to raise money for a cancer hospital and her tennis academy. It will go ahead in her memory, with competitors, including childhood friend Andy Murray, Martina Navratilova and Tim Henman.

60 years on, the romance of a boundary-busting feat endures
","Sixty years later, Roger Bannister is busy reliving the four minutes that still endure as a transcendent moment in sports history.
It was on a wet, blustery spring day ‘May 6, 1954’ that the lanky English medical student became the first runner to break the fabled 4-minute barrier in the mile, a feat that many had thought was humanly impossible.
“It was a target,” Bannister, now 85 and fighting Parkinson’s disease, said in an interview at his Oxford home, a short distance from the Iffley Road track where he made his name. “University athletes had been trying for years and it just didn’t seem to be capable of being broken. There was this magic about four symmetrical laps of one minute each. It was just something which caught the public’s imagination. I think it still remains something that is of interest and intrigue.”

Greatest exploit

Bannister’s record lasted just 46 days, and he considers his victory over Australian rival John Landy a few months later as his greatest running exploit.
Yet, as Tuesday’s 60th anniversary attests, Bannister’s 3:59.4 remains part of track and field lore, a symbol of boundary-busting endurance that stands the test of time.
It’s only a slice of Bannister’s life story. He retired from running at the end of 1954 and went on to pursue a long career in neurology that he considers more significant than anything he accomplished on the track.
“Medicine without a doubt,” Bannister said when asked about his proudest achievement. “I wouldn't claim to have made any great discoveries, but at any rate I satisfactorily inched forward in our knowledge of a particular aspect of medicine. I’m far more content with that than I am about any of the running I did earlier.”
The man knighted Sir Roger in 1975 is slowing down as the years pass. He’s coping with the effects of Parkinson’s, a neurological condition that falls under his medical specialty.
“I know quite a bit about it, which is both helpful and unhelpful,” Bannister said, sitting in his living room lined with photos and mementoes of his running and medical career. “But I’m 85 and something has to happen.”
Bannister’s right ankle was shattered in a car accident in 1975, and he already had been unable to run since then. Now, he walks with crutches inside his home and uses a wheelchair outdoors.
The next barrier in the sport? Bannister believes the 2-hour mark in the marathon will be broken in the next few years. The fastest time stands at 2:03.23, run by Kenya’s Wilson Kipsang in Berlin in 2013.
“It involves a two per cent improvement,” Bannister said. “It has to be run on a day with the right temperature and on a course which isn’t too hilly, preferably a course which is a single line with the wind at your back all the way. It’ll be done.”
Bannister and his wife of 58 years, Moyra, will mark Tuesday’s May 6 anniversary at Oxford University with family and friends, a lunch at Exeter College, where Bannister enrolled in 1946, and a ceremony at Vincent’s Club, an elite 150-year-old sports club.
Missing will be Bannister’s pace makers, Chris Brasher and Chris Chataway. Brasher, who founded the London Marathon, died in 2003 at the age of 74. Chataway passed away in January at 82.
“I miss them very much,” Bannister said. “We used to meet on the anniversary on May 6 with our wives and sometimes with children and have a kind of party and reflect.”
Bannister has just come out with a new autobiography, Twin Tracks.
The book “which grew out of letters to his 14 grandchildren” traces his family’s origins in Lancashire in northwest England, his years growing up in the London borough of Harrow and the story of his athletic, medical and academic life.
“If I don't write my autobiography, there may be biographies written, and I think I’d rather like to tell it myself,” he said.
Bannister went to the 1952 Helsinki Olympics as a favourite in the 1,500m, the shorter metric mile distance run in the Olympics, but struggled with the addition of an extra day of heats and finished only fourth.

Chasing the mark

Retirement plans were put aside, and Bannister decided to run for two more years and chase the 4-minute mark. Swedish runner Gunder Hagg’s mile record of 4:01.4 had stood since 1945. Landy and Wes Santee of the United States had both run 4:02 and were competing with Bannister to be the first under 4 minutes.
“At one point, Landy said, ‘It's like a brick wall. I’m not going to attempt it again’.”
Bannister said, “I, as a medical student, knew there wasn’t a brick wall. If you could run it in 4 minutes and 2.2 seconds, then you would find somebody else somewhere who trained a little better, had better conditions on the day, was able to use the pace judgment better, and they could do it. That was the frame of mind in which I approached it.”
Bannister chose to make his attempt during a meet between Oxford and the Amateur Athletic Association. He lined up Chataway and Brasher as pace setters. The weather was cool and windy. Bannister only decided to go ahead with the race after the gusts died down.
After going through the first three laps in 3:01, Bannister knew he had to run the final lap in under 59 seconds. He described the final, gruelling 300 yards in his book: “I felt at that moment that it was my chance to do one thing supremely well. I drove on, impelled by a combination of fear and pride. ... Those last few seconds seemed an eternity. .... I leapt at the tape like a man taking his last desperate spring to save himself from a chasm that threatens to engulf him. Then my effort was over and I collapsed almost unconscious, with an arm on either side of me.”
When Norris McWhirter read out the winning time, the crowd drowned him out when he announced the first number: “3....”
Landy lowered the record to 3:57.9 six weeks later in Finland.
The two men then went head-to-head in August in the ‘Mile of the Century’ or ‘Miracle Mile’ at the Empire Games in Vancouver. Bannister passed the Australian on the final bend and won in 3:58.8. Landy clocked 3:59, the first time two runners went under four minutes in one race.
Bannister capped his remarkable year by winning the 1,500 at the European championships in Berne. He then retired to go full-time into medicine.
“By then,” Bannister said, “I could feel that honour was satisfied.”

‘Anand-Carlsen match on schedule’, no bid notwithstanding
","The World chess championship match between Magnus Carlsen of Norway and India’s Viswanathan Anand, FIDE (world chess governing body) says, will be held from November 6, but it is not yet sure where.
FIDE’s deadline for receiving bids ended recently without a single bid. FIDE vice-president D.V. Sundar, however, assured that the Word championship would be held as per the schedule. “We will find a venue soon,” he said. “Sometimes, such things do happen, but FIDE is confident of staging the World title match at the proposed time.”
That FIDE has not found a venue, or a sponsor, for a World championship match involving a charismatic reigning champion like Carlsen and a popular challenger like Anand has surprised the chess world.
“It is surprising that a match featuring Carlsen hasn’t any takers at all,” said veteran Grandmaster Pravin Thipsay. “We can understand why Norway has not bid. If there is no match, Carlsen could retain his title, so it is not the headache of Norway to find a sponsor.”

India ruled out

Since Chennai had hosted the last World championship match last November, India could also be ruled out.
“I think FIDE should have tried to market this match more, though we have to consider the fact that there never has been too much interest from business houses to sponsor World title matches,” said Thipsay. “I believe the sport is becoming even more marketable with it is being played in schools across the world.”
Not surprisingly, former World champion Garry Kasparov, never a fan of FIDE or its current president Kirsan Ilymuzhinov, has criticised sharply the world governing body’s inability to find a sponsor for the Carlsen-Anand match. “It says everything when Ilyumzhinov’s FIDE cannot find sponsorship for a World championship match with charismatic young World champion,” he tweeted.
Kasparov, who is fighting Ilyumzhinov in the FIDE elections, also tweeted that “Many Western sponsors don’t want to deal with Kirsan's FIDE and some of his usual backers are facing sanctions.”
Thipsay, however, believes that the World championship would go ahead. “Kirsan has been the biggest sponsor of FIDE ever since he took over as its president,” he pointed out. “If he does not find a country or sponsor for the World championship match, he would organise it himself. It is too prestigious an event for FIDE and Kirsan.”

The partnership is slowly falling back into place, says Ashwini Ponnappa
","Badminton player Ashwini Ponnappa, who recently resumed her successful doubles partnership with Jwala Gutta, stated that the union is “slowly falling back into place”. Jwala had taken a break from the sport after the 2012 London Olympics.
The pair won a bronze medal in the women’s doubles event at the Asian Badminton Championship at Gimcheon (South Korea) two weeks ago — their best show since the duo’s return. “It is slowly falling back into place. We have just started playing together (again), and things worked out well,” Ashwini said at an event hosted by the Tom’s Badminton Academy here on Tuesday, where she conducted a free badminton clinic with fellow India international Anup Sridhar.
“I was very happy to reach the semifinals at the Asian Championship, but once you reach the last-four, you want to do even better. I am a little disappointed with the way we lost,” she said.
Asked if the outspoken nature of her partner Jwala affected her performance on the court, she replied: “No, never. Everyone knows that Jwala is outspoken and dynamic in nature. That is way she is. At the end of the day, it is about getting good results and playing good badminton.”
The doubles specialist remarked that the bronze medal comes “at the right time”, ahead of important events like the Commonwealth Games (July-August), the World Championship (August), and the Asian Games (September-October).
One event which has been pushed out of the calendar is the Indian Badminton League (IBL), which was launched last year. The IBL — it was set to take place in September — has been postponed due to a crowded international schedule. The move has disappointed Ashwini, who played for the Pune Pistons in the first edition.
“The IBL was a good event. I got to learn from many fine players, and the exposure was fantastic. Also, it was taken to a lot of different cities around the country, unlike earlier events which were centred around Delhi. I hope it does not get postponed again,” she said.

It’s up to the ministry now to decide on Renjith
","The Supreme Court’s decision to not entertain a petition filed on behalf of triple jumper Renjith Maheswary against the Sports Ministry with respect to the Arjuna Awards has put the ball back in the ministry’s court.
The petition was filed by an organisation called Navolayam Samskarika Kendram, alleging Maheswary’s name was removed from the list of the awardees on the morning of the ceremony in 2013 following the charge of an old doping case.
The Sports Ministry had eventually decided to not consider Maheswary’s case after investigations confirmed he had tested positive for ephedrine, and he was banned for three months in 2008. 
The Athletics Federation of India, however, has re-nominated him for the Arjuna award this year.
A ministry official, on Tuesday, played down the talk about the government having already decided to not consider his case.
“While the reasons for his rejection last year continue to exist, the final decision will only be taken by the awards’ screening committee, which is yet to be formed. How can we arbitrarily reject an application that has come through the national federation?” a senior Sports Ministry official asked.
Maheswary has insisted he that is innocent since his samples were not tested by a WADA-accredited laboratory, the same argument the AFI has used to re-nominate him. 
The AFI, on Tuesday, held an emergency meeting to discuss the possibility of withdrawing Maheswary’s nomination after the Supreme Court’s decision but ultimately decided to leave the decision up to the ministry.
“We discussed every possibility but finally decided that, since the nomination has already been sent to the ministry and there is also a judicial angle to this whole issue, we should let things follow due course,” AFI secretary C.K. Valson said.
The Kerala athlete’s dope offence is a matter of record. The ministry had noted that Maheswary had not only been placed under suspension by the AFI pending an enquiry into allegations in October 2008, he was also informed of a three-month ban w.e.f October 13, 2008, after a competent authority heard him. He was also barred from participating in the 2009 all-India Railway Athletics Championships.
In fact, the Sports Ministry, at one point, had even considered action against the AFI for recommending Maheswary in 2011, 2012 and 2013 despite lack of proper records and sloppy work in assisting the ministry in its enquiries but eventually dropped the idea.

Selby beats O’Sullivan to win world snooker championship
","Mark Selby beat five-time world snooker champion Ronnie O’Sullivan 18-14 to win the World Championship for the first time.
Selby staged an astonishing fight-back Monday to win 13 of the last 17 frames after trailing 3-8, 5-10 in the first day’s competition Sunday, reports Xinhua.
O’Sullivan, bidding for a third consecutive victory, crumbled under pressure and failed to hold on to his 10-7 overnight lead as Selby won five of the six frames in the third session.
The 30-year-old Selby won the last three frames and sealed victory with a stunning clearance. The win earned him a record 300,000 pounds of top prize and took him back to top of the world rankings.
Selby, who reached the final in 2007 when he lost to John Higgins, also completed a Grand Slam of UK Championship, the Masters and the World Championship and became only the ninth player in history to achieve this feat.

IOA serious about hosting 2019 Asian Games
","The Indian Olympic Association on Tuesday expressed a strong desire to stage the 2019 Asian Games following the withdrawal of Vietnam capital Hanoi and is banking on the next central government to approve the plan, IOA Secretary General Rajeev Mehta said.
Mr. Mehta said in case India hosts the 2019 Asian Games, the IOA will not exercise financial powers and will only organise the multi-sporting event, a remark which appeared to stem from the experience of 2010 Commonwealth Games corruption scandal.
“We want to host 2019 Asian Games after Vietnam’s withdrawal. We will take a final decision in IOA General Body Meeting which will be held most likely next month. We are waiting for the new government to be formed and hoping to get its approval,” Mr. Mehta told PTI in an interview.
“We have all the infrastructure in Delhi. I feel it’s a matter of getting government approval,” he added.
Hanoi was chosen in 2012 to host the 18th Asian Games ahead of Indonesia’s Surabaya but last month, the Vietnamese capital withdrew due to economic pressures.
Indonesia has expressed its willingness to step in as a replacement and a final decision on the host city will be decided on September 20 during the Incheon Asian Games.
India had bid for hosting this year’s Asian Games but had lost out to Incheon in 2007.
Asked if the IOA has sounded out Olympic Council of Asia expressing India’s willingness, Mr. Mehta said, “We are having communication through unofficial channels with OCA. The important thing is to get government approval. So let the new government be formed first.”
He said in case India hosts the 2019 Asiad, the IOA will not exercise financial powers but will only be involved in organisational and technical matters.
“We don’t want to get into controversies and we will ask the government to exercise financial powers by themselves or by any other they may decide. But we won’t exercise financial powers. We will just organise the Games and get involved in technical things,” he said.
In recent times, National Games have been delayed several times due to incompletion of infrastructure and Mr. Mehta said the IOA has decided to impose hefty fines on such host cities.
“We have now decided to include in the host city agreement that a venue will be fined Rs 3 crore for delay in hosting the Games. The IOA will also have the power to strip that city of hosting rights and award it to another city,” he said.
“There will be time frames for completion of various stages of infrastructure building and the IOA committee set up for the purpose will report to the IOA. All these will be confirmed at the GBM,” he added.
Asked who was in the reckoning to become IOC member from India in place of Randhir Singh, Mr. Mehta said, “There are many eminent and senior administrators in the IOA who can become IOC member, including the president (N. Ramachandran) and IOA vice-president Narinder Batra.
“It’s a prestigious post. If the president (Ramachandran) himself wants to become IOC member, we will support it. I will be happy if my president becomes IOC member. The GBM will take a call on it but I am not in the fray. He (Ramachandran) is an experienced and proven sports administrator. He has an excellent rapport with IOC officials as he is also World Squash Federation chief. It will be a matter of pride for the country if he becomes the IOC member,” he said.
“He is a strong candidate. I will try my best but this will be the decision of the General Body. There are also other experienced and eligible persons. (Narinder) Batra has also done good work for the IOA. So, let the General Body take a decision,” Mehta said, adding that there would not be any problem for the boxers to play under the Indian flag in the Commonwealth and Asian Games even if the international federation (AIBA) does not recognise the national body (IBF) by then.
“The ad hoc body was formed by IOA after getting consent from the AIBA. So the boxers will take part under Indian flag, no matter the IBF is recognised or not by AIBA by the time of CWG and Asian Games. That has been agreed by the AIBA itself.”
He said the IOA will take decisions form new Athletes Commission and Ethics Commission during the upcoming GBM.
“We are going to form an Athletes Commission and we are considering to even include an eminent athlete in the Executive Committee with voting rights. Not only the IOA, all the National Sports Federations will now need to have Athletes Commission.”

Aiming to qualify for World Chess Olympiad: Adhiban
","A silver at the Asian Continental Championship earned him a shot at next year’s World Cup but Grandmaster B. Adhiban is not looking too far ahead and is focussed on becoming a “better player” to qualify for the Chess Olympiad in August this year.
“I think it’s still too early to have ambitions for the World Cup 2015. I want to concentrate on my immediate tournaments and focus on becoming a better player by the time of World Cup,” Adhiban told PTI.
“I will be representing India in the Asian Teams in Iran and then I would like to qualify for the Indian team for the World Chess Olympiad on August this year which is a premier event.”
The 21-year-old Indian finished with 6.5 points out of nine to win silver at the Asian Continental Chess Championship in Sharjah and gained an entry to the World Chess Cup 2015 to be held in Baku, Azerbaijan.
Adhiban said it was a great moment and his preparation helped him to hold his nerves in crucial moments.
“It was indeed a great moment qualifying for the World Cup 2015. I prepared well before the event both physically and mentally and it helped me keep my cool in crucial moments of the tournaments,” he said.
“I am happy with my performance, but in the last round maybe I could have played even better and win the last round.”
Asked about the crucial moments of the match, Adhiban said: “Losing to Ni Hua was a crucial moment. But I was quite confident of coming back in the next round and I managed to do it. Last round was very tense, the position kept on changing and eventually it ended in a draw.”
Talking about five-time world champion Viswanathan Anand, Adhiban said: “It is a great inspiration for the chess fraternity. Vishy Anand has showed that the comeback is possible irrespective of the situation you are in.”
Asked how can the huge gap between Anand and the rest be bridged, Adhiban said: “I think it is because of the huge competition at the World level.
“Young budding talents (either by pressure from the coach or parents) are focusing too much on the Category events and hence feel very disappointed and depressed when they are not able to perform well in such events and lose the motivation to keep playing. I would like them to aim very high in Chess. They need lot of international exposure, for instance bringing the World Championship last year to Chennai was a big step wherever I went, it was the talk of the town. So more tournaments like that in India would greatly improve the popularity of the game, inspire players and also to bridge the gap after Vishy Anand.”
Adhiban also expressed his gratitude to his family for his success.
“I owe my success to my parents, family, friends, All India Chess Federation and my employer Indian Oil Corporation for the continuous support in my career,” he signed off.

Federer withdraws; Li, Sharapova advance
","Roger Federer became the second of the world’s top four to pull out of the ATP Madrid Masters on Tuesday as he has decided to stay at home with his wife Mirka as they await the birth of their third child.
The 17-time Grand Slam champion’s withdrawal comes just two days after world No.2 Novak Djokovic also decided not to compete in the Spanish capital due to a wrist injury.
“I’ve decided to withdraw from Madrid to be with my wife Mirka during these next few exciting weeks for our family,” he said on his official Facebook page.
“I apologise to my fans and hope to be back in Madrid next year. I’ll be training near my home, and am excited to rejoin the Tour soon!”
Federer’s withdrawal could benefit Wimbledon champion Andy Murray as the Scot is now the highest seeded player left in the second quarter of the draw.

Star power

There is still plenty of star power on show in the women’s WTA Madrid Open as Li Na and Maria Sharapova moved into round three with wins.
Sharapova won her first tournament of the season on her return to clay in Stuttgart two weeks ago and looked in fine form as she raced through the first set 6-1.
However, McHale responded well to take the second 6-4 and led 4-1 in the decider.
Sharapova, though, wasn’t to be denied by the world No. 57 as she reeled off five straight games to set up a meeting with Spain’s Garbine Muguruza or 2011 US Open champion Sam Stosur in the last 16.
Earlier, Australian Open champion Li had a more simple task as she swept aside fellow Chinese Zheng Jie 6-2, 6-3.
Zheng led the head-to-head record between the two 4-3 before the match, but Li has now won the last four meetings between the pair in straight sets and will face 16th seed Sloane Stephens in the next round.

The results:

Men: First round: Igor Sijsling bt Tommy Haas 3-6, 6-1, 6-4; Kevin Anderson bt Radek Stepanek 3-6, 6-3, 6-4; Ernests Gulbis bt Jerzy Janowicz 7-6(5), 3-6, 6-2; Juan Monaco bt Jurgen Melzer 6-4, 6-3; Nicolas Almagro bt Andrey Golubev 6-3, 6-7(9), 7-6(4); Alexandr Dolgopolov bt Fabio Fognini 7-5, 4-6, 6-3.
Jo-Wilfried Tsgona bt Edouard Roger-Vasselin 6-3, 4-6, 6-3; John Isner bt Teymuraz Gabashvili 7-6(8), 6-4; Dominic Thiem bt Dimitry Tursonov 6-4, 6-2; Marinko Matosevic bt Philipp Kohlschreiber 6-2, 6-2; Mikhail Youzhny bt Benjamin Becker 6-3, 6-4; Albert Ramos bt Nicolas Mahut 6-1, 7-6(7); Giles Simon bt Benoi Paire 2-0 (retd.); Fernando Verdasco bt Andreas Seppi 6-3, 7-6(3); Feliciano Lopez bt Federico Delbonis 7-6(4), 4-6, 6-2; Santiago Giraldo bt Leyton Hewitt 7-5, 4-6, 6-2; Grigor Dimitrov bt Pablo Carreno Busta 6-2, 6-4.
Women: Second round: Lucie Safarova bt Magdalena Rybarikova 6-1, 6-2; Li Na bt Zheng Jie 6-2, 6-3; Maria Sharapova bt Christina McHale 6-1, 4-6, 6-4; Sloane Stephens bt Petra Cetkovska 6-4, 2-6, 6-3.

Illyas restored as chief selector
","Another crisis is brewing in the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) after former Test batsman, Muhammad Illyas was today restored as chief selector by the Islamabad High Court. Uncertainty prevailed in the board over the position of Moin Khan as chief selector after the verdict of the Islamabad High Court.
“The court has accepted my petition and restored me as chief selector. But I am willing to work with this board under Najam Sethi and also with this selection committee,” Illyas said. Illyas was given a contract by the former chairman of the board, Zaka Ashraf in January this year. But Ashraf then demoted him to the post of chief selector of junior teams after appointing Aamir Sohail as senior chief selector.
But in February the government sacked Ashraf and appointed Najam Sethi and a 12-member managing committee to manage cricket affairs.

Ex-chief Pawar slams BCCI for suspending RCA
","Former Board and ICC president Sharad Pawar has slammed the BCCI’s decision to suspend the Rajasthan Cricket Association after banned IPL Commissioner Lalit Modi was declared as the chief of RCA in Jaipur on Tuesday.
“I was shocked to hear about the decision. I think it is a very harsh decision by the BCCI,” the former BCCI president and senior politician told PTI.
Just hours after Mr. Modi was declared the president of the RCA, the BCCI “indefinitely” suspended the state association and appointed an ad-hoc body to run its cricket affairs.
“For the sake of one individual to suspend a whole organisation is really shocking. I hope (BCCI’s interim president) Shivlal Yadav will show some spirit in the organisation and respect the views of the judiciary,” added Mr. Pawar, who is on a visit to London this week.
The RCA elections were conducted in December last year but the results were sealed following a Supreme Court directive. After much deliberation, the result was finally announced by a court-appointed observer.
As expected, Mr. Modi won by a landslide margin, polling in 24 out of 33 votes, while his opponent Rampal Sharma earned just five.
The banned administrator, who has been living in London for the past four years, was allowed to contest the RCA elections held on December 19 last year under the supervision of a Supreme Court-appointed observer.
Mr. Modi, on his part, criticised the BCCI for initiating such a hasty step.
“I am happy to take over the organisation. The BCCI’s action has been in haste without any cause or notice. It should have engaged with the RCA,” said Mr. Modi, as he vowed to carry on fighting.
“What the BCCI has done is completely wrong and we will not sit quiet. We will fight it all the way to the end. I will not let cricket be the sufferer in this kind of matter,” he added.

RCA to move court over BCCI’s suspension
","Within hours of former IPL commissioner Lalit Modi being declared president-elect of the Rajasthan Cricket Association, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) on Tuesday >suspended the RCA, appointing an ad-hoc body to administer its day-to-day affairs.
While elections to the RCA were held in December last year, >the ballots were sealed and results declared only on Tuesday.
As was being speculated, the >""Lalit Modi camp” won a landslide victory in the elections, with Mr. Modi getting 24 out of the total 33 votes polled.
His nearest rival, a confidant of former RCA president C.P. Joshi Rampal Sharma, got five votes, while four were declared invalid.
Less than two hours of Mr. Modi being elected, the BCCI communicated to the RCA about the “disciplinary proceedings” the former had initiated.
“By the letters dated 4th Oct 2013, 16th Dec 2013 18th Dec 2013 you were called upon to initiate steps against Nagaur Cricket Association (of which Mr. Modi was the president) and were advised that Mr. Lalit Modi being expelled by the BCCI was ineligible to hold any position in any member association of the BCCI. Despite the above letters you have failed to take any steps to prevent the election of Mr Modi as your president,” stated the BCCI’s letter.
“Disciplinary proceedings are being initiated against you for serious charge of misconduct. Your further participation and continued membership at this juncture will be highly prejudicial to BCCI...hereby suspend (ing) your membership,” it said.
While Mr. Modi did not interact with the media, his lawyer and newly elected Deputy vice president of the RCA, Mehmood M. Abdi, said the former IPL commissioner could “easily run” the affairs of the RCA from London.
It was decided during the meet that the RCA would challenge the BCCI's decision in the courts.
“The elections were held under the Rajasthan Sports Act...the BCCI has no authority to take such an action,” said Mr. Abdi.
“We will seek legal recourse... Mr. Modi is in touch with some influential members the BCCI... we had hoped things would have changed after N. Srinivasan's exit but it is clear he is still calling the shots at BCCI,” he said.
With the BCCI indefinitely suspending the RCA, the future of local cricketers seemed to be in jeopardy.
“There are vested interests in BCCI that are conspiring against Mr. Modi,” Mr. Abdi told The Hindu.
Asked who these vested interests were, he said, “N. Srinivasan and his coterie.”
High drama was witnessed during the RCA elections held on December 19, last year, with >Mr. Modi’s nomination cleared just a day ahead of the polls.
The former IPL Commissioner’s candidature had been objected to by several parties, including the BCCI, but it was cleared along with that of his aide Pawan Goyal by Justice N.M. Kasliwal, the Supreme Court-appointed observer for the elections.
The BCCI, which had banned Mr. Modi for life over charges of financial irregularities in September this year, had then warned the RCA of dire consequences including withdrawal of privileges and suspension of affiliation, if Mr. Modi was elected.
Hours after being declared elected, Mr. Modi addressed the newly-elected executive of the RCA, via videoconferencing, from London.
During the meet, Mr. Modi said the RCA would set up eight world class cricket academies across Rajasthan.
Mr. Modi also said the next meeting of the executive would be held in London.

Kaneria’s life ban upheld by London High Court
","In another jolt to Danish Kaneria’s chances of returning to professional cricket, the London High Court dismissed the Pakistan leg-spinner’s appeals against his life ban from the sport on Tuesday.
Kaneria, who is charged by the England and Wales Cricket Board for encouraging a teammate to under perform during his county stint with Essex, is fighting a hard legal battle to prove what he calls ‘his innocence’.
The ECB had charged Kaneria with inducing another Essex player to “deliberately concede” runs in a limited-overs game against Durham in 2009 and with bringing disrepute to the game.
An ECB disciplinary panel found that charges had been proved after a hearing in 2012. An appeal panel set up under ECB disciplinary regulations upheld the decision to impose a life ban in 2013
Kaneria took high court action — claiming that the ECB appeal panel had been wrong to uphold the life ban — and wrong to order him to pay the ECB legal costs of 200,000 Pounds.
Justice Hamblen said the appeal panel had not exceeded its powers. He said there were no grounds for suggesting that an error of law had been made.
Kaneria was not at the hearing. A lawyer told the judge that he was in Pakistan.
The ECB took disciplinary action against Kaneria after the former Essex pacer Mervyn Westfield agreed to “spot fix” and was jailed, the court heard.

Lalit Modi elected as RCA president
","Former IPL commissioner Lalit Modi was on Tuesday elected president of the Rajasthan Cricket Association, setting the stage for yet another round of legal tussle between him and BCCI, which had threatened to ban RCA in anticipation of this result.
The election was conducted in December 2013 but the results were sealed following a Supreme Court directive. After much deliberation, the result was finally announced by a court-appointed observer in Jaipur on Tuesday.
As expected Modi won by a landslide margin, polling in 24 out of 33 votes, while his opponent Rampal Sharma earned just five.
Among other office-bearers, Somendra Tiwari was elected as the new secretary, while Pawan Goyal won the treasurer’s post. Mehmood M Abdi, counsel of Modi, has been elected as the deputy president of the RCA.
Modi was slapped with a life ban by the BCCI on September 25, 2013, year after its disciplinary committee found him guilty on eight charges of “indiscipline and misconduct”.
After Modi entered the fray in the RCA elections, BCCI had challenged the Rajasthan Sports Act, 2005, which allowed the former IPL chief to contest the presidential polls despite being banned for life by the Board.
Challenging the election, the BCCI pleaded that Modi should not have been allowed to contest and the election be quashed.
But the Supreme Court, in April, cleared the decks for the declaration of RCA’s election results.
Brushing aside the BCCI’s objection, a bench headed by Justice A.R. Dave directed the registry to send the results, in a sealed envelope by its appointed observer Justice (retd) N.M. Kasliwal.
The court, however, has said that anyone aggrieved of the outcome can challenge it before an appropriate authority.

I owe a lot to Robin Singh: Dwayne Smith
","It was Dwayne Smith’s blistering 79-run knock that enabled Chennai Super Kings to chase down a huge 179-run target against Delhi Daredevils, but the modest opening batsman credited Robin Singh for his success, saying that his old mate has helped him become the player he is. “I did a lot of work with Robin Singh and I respect him a lot. Unfortunate he is not with us in Chennai but he has done a lot of work with me and I thank him a lot for what he has done, especially in the sub-continent,” said Smith in the post-match conference.
Former Mumbai Indians player Smith enjoys a good rapport with Trinidad and Tobago-born RobinThe two struck a bond when Robin was coaching Barbados in the Caribbean Premier League and Smith fondly remembered the times.
“Once again I would credit Robin for working with me, especially helping me get control of my game. To survive in international cricket or any type of cricket you need to score runs. And you can’t score runs just by smashing around. In between you have to work around the singles and twos to keep the scoreboard ticking,” said Smith.

Battle of the Kings: Part II
","The historic Barabati Stadium will provide a beautiful backdrop to the most sought after league encounter of IPL-7 between table topper Chennai Super Kings and Kings XI Punjab here on Wednesday.
Kings XI caused a sensation after winning all its five league matches in the UAE leg, but was made to eat humble pie by Mumbai Indians in the first match of the Indian leg. Two-time champion CSK, having lost the first match of the season to KXIP at Abu Dhabi in a high-scoring game, gained from strength to strength thereafter to post six victories on the trot to emerge the new favourite. Since arriving in India, CSK has won two games with consummate ease.
Like the first encounter between the two, the return game too is likely to be a high-scoring affair with the ground staff preparing a hard, grassless pitch. Having played on the practice pitch, Kings XI captain George Bailey was pleased with the condition of the ground. 
Wednesday’s battle will again highlight the batting strength of both sides. Kings XI, who rode on the talented Glenn Maxwell, David Miller, Virender Sehwag and the captain himself in earlier matches, will be looking for another strong display to outshine the powerful batting line-up of CSK, whose openers Brendon McCullum and Dwayne Smith have been outstanding.
The intelligent play of Suresh Raina, the powerful strokeplay of Faf du Plessis and the rampaging style of M.S. Dhoni will combine to steal the show from the Punjab team. The plus point for the host is that its wicketkeeper-batsman Wriddhiman Saha is in fine nick.
The two teams, more or less, match each other on the bowling front, but CSK’s better spin options will give them an edge. Bailey admitted that he too has a spin option, but would prefer to finalise the team before the toss.  
Dhoni will not like to disturb the winning combination, while Bailey is likely to make a change or two depending on the condition of the pitch. When the two teams met last time, it was CSK’s fielding that let the team down, reprieving Maxwell who proved to be the match-winner.
Wednesday will be another day. It remains to be seen whether CSK will be able to extract sweet revenge or KXIP continue to dominate the yellow shirts.

Inconsistent sides seek to stay in the hunt
","Kevin Pietersen is trying his best to keep Delhi Daredevils’ morale high in IPL-7. The team has reached the halfway stage of the league and the below-par showing of its bowlers has continued to hurt its chances badly.
As Daredevils prepared for its third home match, against Kolkata Kight Riders at the Ferozeshah Kotla on Wednesday, Pietersen backed his team despite the disappointing loss to Chennai Super Kings on Monday. “I am proud of the way we played (in the high-scoring match) against CSK,” said Pietersen.
The Daredevils batsmen, particularly Dinesh Karthik, Murali Vijay, Jean-Paul Duminy and Kedar Jadhav, powered the side to a big total and the bowlers, too, overcame the early onslaught of the CSK openers to stretch the match to the last over.
Though Daredevils’ four-wicket victory over Knight Riders in their last meeting in Dubai gives it a slight edge, two successive defeats on home turf is a cause for concern.
Laxmi Ratan Shukla looked meaningful in patches and Wayne Parnell emerged as the most economical bowler against CSK. It will be interesting to see what changes the Daredevils think-tank makes against Knight Riders.
Some dramatic batting collapses have affected Knight Riders’ journey this season. The shocking loss to Rajasthan Royals on Monday, after the openers Gautam Gambhir and Robin Uthappa added 121 while chasing a target of 171, would have hurt the side badly and it needs to regroup itself while taking on Daredevils.
Robin Uthappa, Manish Pandey and Jacques Kallis have been the primary run-getters for the side while Gambhir has started to find his feet after a dreadful start. Knight Riders will look to Shakib Al Hasan and Yusuf Pathan to fire on all cylinders.
Despite the presence of Umesh Yadav, Morne Morkel, Sunil Narine, Piyush Chawla, Vinay Kumar and Kallis in its ranks, the KKR attack is yet to find consistency. As the two teams, on four points each, prepare for the clash, the batsman-friendly Kotla wicket promises a run feast.

We are still trying things: Duminy
","Although he finds himself in a rich vein of form, Delhi Daredevils batsman Jean Paul Duminy is content with his batting slot in the lower middle-order.
“I’m enjoying it. I have batted in different situations this season. It has been a great success individually. We have a high-class top order. So, I will bat in the same position. It’s normal for me since I bat there for South Africa too,” said the left-hander on the sidelines of the Idea Cellular Delhi Daredevils fan page launch here.
Though he’s content with his batting display, Duminy admits his side has failed to succeed collectively. “In matches where we have bowled well, our batting has let us down and vice-versa. It’s a new squad so we are still trying things. If we get a couple of wins, we will get some momentum going. We have an outside chance of qualifying for the playoffs.”
Looking back to the defeat against Chennai Super Kings on Monday, Duminy said, “With the start we had, we should have probably got to 200. But it was a par score. It’s tough to defend at the Ferozeshah Kotla as it is a small ground.”
“We needed to dent CSK’s top order. But we did well to take it to the final over. We have a young bowling attack and it was good to see that they stuck to their plans,” added Duminy.

I have not seen this kind of cricket: Gambhir
","A miffed Kolkata Knight Riders captain Gautam Gambhir on Monday described his side’s 10-run loss to Rajasthan Royals in an IPL match here as something which he has never seen on a cricket field.
In one of the most dramatic turnarounds in the history of IPL, Rajasthan came from nowhere to register an improbable victory against KKR.
Chasing a victory target of 171, KKR was sailing along at 121 for no loss with Gambhir (54) and Robin Uthappa (65) cruising before losing an incredible six wickets for the addition of just two runs in a space of nine deliveries, which led to the disappointing loss.
“It’s a hard pill to swallow. I have not seen this kind of cricket,” Gambhir said after the match.
“We have to move on. We still have eight games left. We still need to work on bowling as apart from Sunil Narine and Shakib Al Hasan, others need to take the responsibility,” he said.

Tambe praised

Rajasthan captain Shane Watson praised hat-trick man Pravin Tambe for his fine bowling show.
“It was a nice way to close out a game. That’s what we talk about in our team set up. PT (Tambe) just keeps going and going, getting big batsmen out all the time. He deserves a pay rise and he is making my life easier for sure,” he said.
Asked about his three-wicket burst in the same over — 15th — which opened the floodgates for his side, Watson said: “Definitely, few things went my way in that over. Had not had much of an impact with the ball, so it was good to get those wickets.”
Man-of-the-Match Tambe, who also took the purple cap for becoming the highest wicket-taker, said, “The confidence the team gives me, I will never forget. This was my first hat-trick. At this level you have to keep the energy throughout.”

Ravindra Jadeja’s success mantra
","Ravindra Jadeja has been consistently performing well with the ball for Chennai Super Kings and the allrounder says his mantra to success is to bowl in good areas and mix up the deliveries.
Stating that a bowler always adjusts according to the given conditions, Jadeja said: “If the ball is turning then that is one way of bowling and if there is no turn then it is a different ball game.
“I try to bowl dot balls and bowl in the good areas and mix my deliveries. Vary the pace and at times bowl outside the off-stump,” he said.
Jadeja was the most economical bowler with figures of 4-0-23-1 for the Super Kings here on Monday night against Delhi Daredevils, which ended up posting a competitive 178 for five.
Although he conceded 13 runs in his second over, the left-arm spinner dismissed Murali Vijay when handed the ball again and bowled a miserly second spell.
“After giving away those runs in the second over I was only thinking about not bowling any loose deliveries in my next over. From the end I was bowling it had a shorter boundary,” Jadeja told IPL’s official website.
“This is T20 cricket and they were going to take their chances. I was thinking of not bowling to their strength. My effort was to try and bowl where the batsman can’t hit the big shots and luckily I was able to bowl in right areas.”
Speaking about the dismissal of Vijay, Jadeja said: “He hits well over midwicket and mid-on in the slog overs so I thought of bowling to him outside off-stump. If he hits a good shot then there is nothing much I can do.”
Jadeja said the Super Kings were expecting to restrict Daredevils to 160-165.
“When DD were 108 for three and lost a couple of wickets at the score of 120, we thought of restricting them to 160-165 runs. We also knew that the boundary is a bit small and there is dew and it was drizzling also so we would benefit while chasing,” he said.
The Super Kings’ top-order is having a dream run at the ongoing IPL-7 but Jadeja says he is prepared to score some quick runs whenever he is needed to.
“I put in extra time in the nets. Considering that there could be a situation where I am needed to score 15-17 runs off the last over, I should be ready,” said Jadeja.

Saurabh Tiwary ruled out of IPL with shoulder injury
","Burly Jharkhand batsman Saurabh Tiwary has been ruled out of the remainder of the seventh edition of Indian Premier League due to a shoulder injury.
The left-hander, who has not played a single game for Delhi Daredevils this season, has been ruled out as what was thought to be a shoulder niggle turned out into a full-fledged injury. He has been sent home and will probably go to NCA for a rehab programme.
“Tiwary was having problems with his throwing arm. He was having pain while throwing from the deep. It does not look like as if he would be featuring any further in this edition of the Indian Premier League,” an IPL source informed PTI on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, DD skipper Kevin Pietersen said that they can’t take KKR lightly despite the team’s poor show in the current edition.
“Any teams that lose consistently are more desperate to make a comeback and KKR will be no different. We can’t afford to take them lightly,” the skipper said.
Pietersen also defended his bowlers saying that it’s impossible for them to maintain consistency considering the fickle nature of the format.
“I don’t believe in blame games. It is very difficult for the bowlers in this format. I believe that we are very close to a win and it will come soon,” said the skipper and coach Gary Kirsten also echoed his statements.
On a different note, Kirsten was asked about India’s tour of England in July, and the South African was evasive.
“I had enjoyed my time as India coach for three years. This job gives me a chance to be with my family more. As far as the England tour is concerned, any away series is tough but I don’t see any reason why India can’t do well,” Kirsten said.
Daredevils’ South African leg-spinner Imran Tahir’s visa problems have beeen sorted out but it is unlikely that he will feature against KKR in Wednesday’s game.

Smith’s blitz at the top sets up Super Kings’ sixth win on the trot
","Chennai Super Kings looks unstoppable in this edition of the Indian Premier League. The two-time champion banked on the brute power of West Indian batsman Dwayne Smith to extend its winning streak by snatching an eight-wicket victory over Delhi Daredevils at the Ferozeshah Kotla here on Monday.
Smith (79) put up an extraordinary exhibition of power-hitting as he notched up his fourth half-century of IPL-7, and put CSK on the patch to achieve a target of 179.
The major highlight of the DD innings was the 71-run partnership between Dinesh Karthik (51) and Murali Vijay (35).
After a blitz from Quinton de Kock (24) was ended by a run out and Kevin Pietersen departed for a first-ball duck, the two Tamil Nadu players joined hands to rescue DD from a dismal 36 for two in the fifth over.
The two complemented each other well and relieved the pressure on the team. Vijay’s role was to hold one end up while Karthik’s was to keep the scoreboard moving.
The pint-sized wicketkeeper-batsman, who has not been able to make an impact with the bat in the last four matches, dazzled by mixing perfect cricketing shots with extraordinary improvisation.
Karthik brilliantly punched and flicked to score on both sides of the wicket off Ishwar Pandey, and accelerated further by pulling Ravindra Jadeja for a six and a four.

Rub of the green

 Karthik did enjoy a slice of luck; when on 11, he launched Jadeja towards the mid-wicket boundary where Ben Hilfenhaus made a valiant effort to take a diving catch but the ball popped out of his hands to go over the ropes.
In the 13th over, Karthik shuffled across to scoop Hilfenhaus for a six, and struck a four on the offside four balls later. However, the Aussie soon had the consolation of grabbing his tormentor’s wicket, Mohit taking a sharp catch diving forward at square leg.
A late charge by the reliable middle order pair of J-P. Duminy (28 n.o.) and Kedar Jadhav (29 n.o.) boosted the host further and restored some pride for the side which was bundled out for 84 in its previous match against CSK.
Jadeja turned out to be the most economical bowler for the visiting team.
DD’s bowling lacked the discipline it needed to stop CSK batsmen. The touring team’s openers relished the opportunities that came their way.
Brendon McCullum (32) was in no mood to spare any loose delivery, and found the onside fence regularly.
Smith was in his usual self, ruthlessly clubbing Jaydev Unadkat for three consecutive sixes — two over square leg and one to the sightscreen.
With the situation getting out of hand, Pietersen even gave his boys a pep-talk in the first available break.
However, the McCullum-Smith combine continued to flourish, with the West Indian effortlessly hammering Shahbaz Nadeem for two more sixes.
They had forged 82 runs before Laxmi Ratan Shukla got rid of McCullum. The Kiwi, when on 23, had been let off by Kedar Jadhav off Shukla.
When Smith left, CSK needed 11 off eight deliveries. Suresh Raina (47 n.o.) and M.S. Dhoni (12 n.o) ensured that their team reached the target without too much trouble.

Granada salvages 1-1 draw at Sociedad in Spain
","Granada salvaged a 1-1 draw at Real Sociedad on Monday, earning a valuable point in its bid to avoid dropping from the Spanish league.
Odion Ighalo turned to flick a weak shot beyond goalkeeper Claudio Bravo for the 93-minute equalizer that moved the Andalucians three points above the drop zone.
“Staying up is still a possibility,” Ighalo told Spanish broadcaster Cuatro after scoring from what TV replays showed could have been an offside position. “We’re going to fight right until the end.”
Granada was reduced to 10-men in the 54th when Recio was shown a second yellow card for protesting, just three minutes before Sociedad defender Mikel Gonzalez also exited after his hard challenge earned a straight red card.
Sociedad had gone ahead in the 77th when Carlos Vela squeezed a cross inside the near post, but Ighalo’s late dramatics meant the Basque club must wait another round before its place in next season’s Europa League is secured. Sixth-place Real enjoys a five-point advantage over Villarreal for the league’s last European place and sits two points behind Sevilla.
Granada, meanwhile, has 38 points to sit above Almeria and Getafe, which share 36 points. Osasuna is 18th with 35 points in the final drop spot.
Atletico Madrid leads on 88 points, while Barcelona has 85. Real Madrid has 83 points but plays one more game than Atletico and Barcelona, at Real Valladolid on Wednesday.

HI cracks down on erring players, officials
","The disciplinary committee of Hockey India, on Tuesday, decided to impose sanctions on various teams, individual players and officials for breach of code of conduct during recent domestic tournaments.
Taking a serious view of assault and misbehaviour by the Rajnandgaon XI team during the first all-India VHA-Nagpur Gold Cup, the committee imposed a 12-month ban on team manager Koshor Diwar and one of the players, Rahul Yadav, with effect from May 6, 2014.
The incident happened on April 23 during a game against SEC Railways, when Yadav assaulted an opposition player, while Diwar repeatedly used foul language and walked his team off the field.
The two will also be on probation for a year after the ban is completed.
A six-month ban was also imposed on the other 15 members of the team.
In another incident, Hockey Bhopal general secretary Jalaluddin Rizvi was warned and put on one-year probation for publicly criticising tournament regulations during the fourth Hockey India junior women’s national championship in Mysore.
Tournament director Davinder Bhatia was also put on probation for being unfairly biased against international umpire Anupama Puchimanda.
The guilty can appeal to the Athletes Dispute & Grievance Redressal Committee within 30 days.

Saina and Srikanth to spearhead Indian challenge
","Saina Nehwal and K. Srikanth will spearhead the host in the Thomas Cup and Uber Cup world team badminton championships beginning at the Siri Fort Complex here from May 18.
As per the list of team members released on Wednesday, world No. 1 Malaysia’s Lee Chong Wei and world and Olympic champion China’s Lin Dan will be part of the field for the first time since last year’s world championship.
In the Uber Cup, favourite China has chosen to field the world’s top three players — Li Xuerui, Wang Shixian and Wang Yihan.
In the Uber Cup, where India’s prospects of reaching the knock-out stage looks better, much depends on the form and fitness of Saina, P.V. Sindhu and the doubles combination of G. Jwala and Ashwini Ponnappa.
India will face Thailand, Canada and Hong Kong in the league phase.

Gopi Academy trainees

India’s Thomas Cup squad is made up of mainly the trainees from Gopi Chand Academy after the country’s No. 4 Ajay Jayaram failed to make it.
In the preliminary league, India is clubbed with Malaysia, Korea and Germany.

The teams:


Men: K. Srikanth, P. Kashyap, R.M.V. Gurusaidutt, Sourabh Varma, B. Sai Praneeth, Pranaav Chopra, Manu Attri, Arun Vishnu, Sumeeth Reddy and Akshay Dewalkar.

Tintu keen to shake off ‘box’ worries
","She has never been near the square ring but ‘box’ could well be the big thing running in Tintu Luka’s mind as she takes on a strong 800m field at the IAAF Diamond League series opener in Doha on Friday.
The 24-year-old has found herself being ‘boxed’, trapped in the middle of the pack and unable to break away, by taller and more experienced rivals a few times in major international meets and this has been affecting her rhythm and results. The 2012 London Olympics semifinal is a classic case.
“Since she doesn’t have much experience, she is probably worried that she could get boxed in the middle of the pack,” said Tintu’s coach P.T. Usha. “She has to get her rhythm, whether she is running in the front, middle or back.”

World’s best

The Diamond League series brings together the world’s best athletes and the field in Doha includes Kenya’s World champion and World No. 1 Eunice Sum Jepkoech, the very experienced former World champion and Olympic silver medallist Janeth Jepkosgei, a determined Brit Jenny Meadows, a former world indoor silver medallist who is returning after a series of injuries, and the young Kenyan Agatha Jeruto.
Seven of the 11 runners in the fray have run below two minutes and four of them have a faster personal best time than Tintu (personal best 1:59.17s).

Season opener

Unfortunately, the Doha run, which could do a world of good to her world ranking if she does well, will be Tintu’s season-opener.
“Of course, it would have been nice if Tintu had run a race or two before the Diamond League but our national meet comes late. We tried to get into a meet in Jamaica but it didn’t work out,” said Usha.
“Still, it should not be a big problem. Now, everybody seems to be in the 2:01 range, Tintu is in that range.”
It’s clear that Tintu needs to get a lot of international exposure to get sharper, better and faster.
“It doesn’t matter whether she wins or loses but she needs to run a lot more races. We are planning to run a few races in Europe before the Commonwealth Games,” said Usha.
One still remembers Tintu’s stunning start in the 2010 New Delhi Commonwealth Games with an impressive front-running style only to mess it all up in the second half of the two-lap event as seasoned stars went past her one by one. It shattered her, as she did not have the will or the strength for that final push.
Tintu has now virtually given up her front-running style at the majors.
“But she has to get used to feeling comfortable running within the lead pack and then attempt to strike in the end. This is where she needs more experience,” added Usha.
With the Commonwealth Games in Scotland and the Asian Games in South Korea coming close to each other, this is a very crucial season for Tintu, who was overall 11th at the 2012 London Olympics.

Double periodisation

“She could also be running the Continental Cup (formerly known as the World Cup) which makes it three between July and September. If we don’t train properly, she could be worn out in one of the majors. That is why we are starting speed work late this year,” explained Usha.
“She will have to do well in the Commonwealth Games and maintain it in the Asian Games. We will have to go for double periodisation, where the athlete will be in a sort of peak form twice a season.
“It’s a bit of a difficult task, we’ll have to take a lot more care, see that she doesn’t get injured. We’ll have to plan the competitions well. And plan the training between competitions well.”

Saina, Srikanth to lead Indian team in Thomas, Uber Cup
","London Olympics bronze medallist Saina Nehwal and Thailand Grand Prix champion K Srikanth will spearhead the Indian challenge at the Li-Ning BWF Thomas and Uber Cup Finals to be held at the Siri Fort Sports Complex here from May 18 to 25.
The 24-year-old Saina will lead charge in the Uber Cup competition and world No. 18 Srikanth will be shouldering the responsibility in the Thomas Cup as India went with five singles and five doubles players in both the squads, selected on the basis of world rankings.
With the maximum number of players allowed in the squad being 10, many teams have gone for four singles and six doubles players.
Besides Saina, other singles members in the Uber Cup team include world champion bronze medallist P V Sindhu, National Games champion Arundhati Pantawane, world No. 57 Tanvi Laad, world No. 65 P C Thulasi.
Commonwealth Games gold medallist pair of Jwala Gutta and Ashwini Ponnappa, who recently won a bronze at the Asian Badminton Championship, will lead in doubles while others in same section include Aparna Balan, N Sikki Reddy and Pradnya Gadre.
“Uber Cup is the biggest tournament in India and we are focussed to do well. We have got a decent draw. We need to focus and give our best and play with confidence and I am sure we will do well,” Ashwini told PTI.
In Thomas Cup, the other singles members include world No. 21 Parupalli Kashyap, world No. 30 R M V Guru Sai Dutt, world No. 35 Sourabh Varma, while world No. 52 B Sai Praneeth have been selected ahead of world No. 42 H S Prannoy and world No. 49 Anand Pawar.
“It is a prestigious tournament and there are no easy draws here. It is difficult to predict where we will finish in the tournament. The team will give their best in every match and I think we should get into the last-eight stages in Uber Cup,” chief coach Pullela Gopichand said.
“The men’s draw is tough. But I think except for Lee Chong Wei, every singles match we have a chance,” he added.
Meanwhile, world champion Lin Dan and world No. 1 Lee Chong Wei will lead the parade of star badminton players when the prestigious biennial team championships gets underway for the first time in India.
Dan, who won his fifth world title last year, has not been very active on the international circuit this year, but he has been still named in the Chinese squad as their fourth singles player. This would mean that the world No. 58 can only play the third singles in any match.
As per the rules of the tie, the singles players are nominated to play the rubbers according to their world rankings and hence the last ranked player in the team has to play the third singles.
The other singles members in the Chinese team include world No. 2 Chen Long, world No. 6 Pengyu Du and world No. 16 Houwei Tian, who has been picked ahead of world No. 7 Zhengming Wang as the defending champions look to rewrite history by becoming the first team to win the Thomas Cup crown for a sixth successive time.
In the Uber Cup, the Chinese have named a formidable team with Olympic champion and world No. 1 Li Xuerui leading the charge along with world No. 2 Shixian Wang and world No. 3 Yihan Wang.
Apart from having a top-class Chinese feast, the badminton lovers will also get to watch the likes of world champion Ratchanok Intanon (Indonesian), who has recovered from her heel injury, world No. 5 Ji Hyun Sung and Yeon Ju Bae, both from Korea.

India squads:


Men: K Srikanth, P Kashyap, RMV Guru Sai Dutt, Sourabh Varma, B Sai Praneeth (singles) Pranaav Jerry Chopra, Akshay Dewalkar, Manu Attri, Arun Vishnu and B Sumeeth Reddy (doubles)

Women: Saina Nehwal, PV Sindhu, Arundhati Pantawane, Tanvi Laad, PC Thulasi (singles), Jwala Gutta, Ashwini Ponnappa, Aparna Balan, N Sikki Reddy and Pradnya Gadre (doubles).


At 5 p.m. IST IANS story says



India can make Thomas Cup quarters: Kashyap

Top shuttler >Parupalli Kashyap says India have an outside chance of qualifying for the quarterfinals of the World Men’s Team Championship for the Thomas Cup, though they are bracketed with Malaysia, South Korea and Germany in a tough Group C.
“We have an outside chance of qualifying for the quarterfinals on the strength of our singles play. If we have to make the knockouts we must win all our singles,” >Kashyap told IANS on Wednesday.
“Malaysia will be tough as they have World No.1 Lee Chong Wei, but it is 50-50 against the other two teams. Even against Malaysia, their other singles players are beatable.”
A Thomas Cup tie comprises three singles and two doubles matches.
“Our confidence against South Korea and Germany stems from our performance against their singles players. Both Kidambi Srikanth and I have defeated them and have good chances against them, though it will be a tough ask,” said the 2010 Commonwealth Games bronze medallist.
India is hosting the prestigious biennial event for the first time May 18-25 and to prepare the team for the tie, chief national coach Pullela Gopichand will hold a special training camp at the Siri Fort Sports Complex here from Thursday.
India doesn’t have a great record in the tournament but the 27-year-old Hyderabadi feels that the home advantage can change it all.
“Home court advantage does help. We have a week-long camp to acclimatise better than our opponents. You also feel a lot confident playing at home with the crowd cheering us. We all players always love playing at home and have done well too,” said Kashyap, who has dropped to >World No.21 from a career-high No.6 in the rankings.
“The team event should be a good experience in familiar surroundings. We keep playing individual events throughout the year but there is national pride playing as a team for the country.”
Asked about his own form and fitness, the Gopichand protégé said he is gradually getting better at his game and wants to peak during the Glasgow Commonwealth Games (July 21-Aug 4), Copenhagen World Championships (Aug 25-31) and the Incheon Asiad (Sep 19-29).
“I am doing well. I have just been trying to maintain my form since the All-England Open. There have been a series of tournaments and now you have the Thomas Cup. I am working with Gopi sir to fine-tune my game, eliminating errors and planning new strategies,” said the player from Andhra Pradesh.
“I am gradually getting better and want to peak at the CWG, World Championships and Asian Games. There are players who initially do well but don’t peak when it matters most. I am confident that before the big tournaments, I will be back in the top-10,” concluded the former World No.6.

Mercedes’ rivals eager to close gap in Barcelona
","Mercedes’ rivals hope a busy three weeks of tinkering on their slower cars and the move to European tracks will be enough to at least threaten >Lewis Hamilton’s and >Nico Rosberg’s stranglehold on Formula One.
The Mercedes pair head into Sunday’s Spanish Grand Prix after sweeping the first four races in impressive style, with the most compelling driving coming between the teammates while the pack puttered away in the distance.
The switch to V6 turbo hybrid engines has dislodged Red Bull as F1’s dominant team after four seasons, and Mercedes was also dealing far better than the rest with the new power train and other rule changes.
“We are now four races into the 2014 season and hold a strong position in both championships,” Mercedes team executive director Toto Wolff said. “However, the first European round of the year always provides a prime opportunity for teams to arrive with improvements to their cars. Of course, we are no different to any other team in that respect and our aim must be to increase the advantage we enjoyed at the last race in China.”
Neither Hamilton nor Rosberg has yet to win at the Circuit de Catalunya, although they did take the top two positions in qualifying here last year.
Rosberg, who has a four-point lead over Hamilton in the championship, said that after years of racing and preseason tests at Barcelona “there is probably no other track in the world” that he knows better.
“I also have some good memories of race weekends in Barcelona,” Rosberg said. “Last year (...) I started from pole position so I’m looking forward to going back there again, and maybe repeating that particular feat. Each team will have been pushing hard during the break to find some extra performance from new parts. So it will certainly be an interesting weekend.”
Red Bull will be counting on making strides after a dismal start to Sebastian Vettel’s title defence.
Vettel has yet to finish better than third place, and has twice been ordered by his team to let new teammate Daniel Ricciardo pass him for higher finishes in the last two races.
Vettel said a lot would depend on doing well in Saturday’s qualifying because the track design offers few chances to challenge front-runners.
The Montmelo circuit features one long straightaway before the first corner, which is considered the best for overtaking. It is also known to be tough on tires.
Paul Hembery, the director of tire provider Pirelli, said that despite the track’s abrasive surface and high temperatures they expected teams to need only three pit stops instead of four as they have made in the past.
Ferrari’s Fernando Alonso proved last season that wise tire management and smooth pit stops can be enough to compensate for a lack of overall speed.
Alonso enters the race in a distant third place, with 41 points to Rosberg’s 79 and Hamilton’s 75, but after managing to finally reach the podium at Shanghai in Ferrari’s first race under new team principal Marco Mattiacci.
The two-time former world champion has a strong record in front of his home fans, with wins here both last year and in 2006 to give him seven career podium finishes at the Spanish GP.
“With Fernando we’ve seen an extraordinary level of performance, scavenging every possible point at every possible opportunity,” Ferrari technical director James Allison said. “We are learning how to get performance out of this new set of regulations, and hopefully to make this car more competitive. The key to a successful season is to keep improving your car at every race.”

Kolkata ISL franchise christened Atletico de Kolkata
","The Kolkata franchise of the much-anticipated >Indian Super League was on Wednesday christened >Atletico de Kolkata, taking a cue from their Spanish co-owners and UEFA Champions League finalist Atletico de Madrid.
Owner and CEO of the Champions League finalist Miguel Angel Gil Marin along with his city based co-owners former India captain Sourav Ganguly, industrialists Harsh Neotia, Sanjiv Goenka and Utsav Parekh unveiled the team but said they were yet to finalise the jersey as it has to get an approval of the ISL.
There’s also a proposal to get the Atletico Madrid squad to play a friendly match here once the city team is formed.
“We are also looking for a pre-season training in Madrid for the Kolkata franchise,” Neotia said.
Also unveiling the name of the consortium as the Kolkata Games and Sports Private Limited, the five parnters pledged to take Indian football to the next level.
“Atletico breathes football, lives around football. It’s a great idea to expand our brand and reach a new market. India is China are huge markets. Atletico also collaborates in different countries through Alteitco de Madrid foundation. We will try to support many kids who want to develop football.
“We are trying two different ways, one through academy and another side through the franchise and play professional football,” Miguel said handing over an official La Liga football with autographs of the team members.
The Atletico officials also handed each of the four city owners their official Atletico Madrid jerseies with their respective names but a common number of 19 -- which belongs to their most popular player and captain Diego Costa.
“It will be a proud moment for us if we can take the Indian football to where it belongs. It will be a great moment for us if one day a Kolkata footballer is able to represent Atletico Madrid. We are planning to build an academy here and give them a window of an opportunity,” Ignacio Aguillo, director of coprorate development at Atletico, said.
Ganguly said, “Our club will try and bring together the best talent to form a team with the driving thought of ‘playing to win’ Kolkata has been central to football in our country and our objective is to ensure that we re-gain the position.
“This time round, the difference will be to give football audiences a level of play which is par international and creates a pride and passion similar to what we see for global leagues and tournaments.”
Asked why they chose to invest in a country whose ranking hovers around 150 and FIFA had termed them a ‘sleeping giant’, Aguillo said: “You have a massive population and if you combine that with passion and discipline, you are bound to have results. We have seen that in many countries.”
Giving example of world champions Spain, he said: “They don’t have population but they have achieved with the right infrastructure and discipline. There is no reason why India can’t live up to its true potential. It’s numbers game at the end of the day.”
Terming this a new beginning, former India captain Ganguly said: “We all grew up kicking a football. I’m sure it’s same with a lot of kids in the state. It’s a beginning of something different, give a push to the city. This will revolutionise football in this part of the world.
“We always had the passion but did not have the talent to match the passion for the game. I thank Atletico Madrid to be a part of us. We hope they liked the city at first sight.”
Ganguly further wished Atletico all the best for the Champions League final and the Spanish League in which they’re leading the table.
“I also congratulate them for the wonderful season they had. They have a very very important month in front of them.
From all of us and, the entire Kolkata wants you do well.
“We want them to be champions so that we start the season saying we’re already champions. Good luck for that. We are extremely proud to have you with us.”
Asked how he sees the initiative vis-à-vis the hugely popular IPL in cricket, Ganguly said: “We don’t want to compete. We just want to play. We want to bring football to Kolkata. Kolkata is the place for football besides Kerala and Goa. We want cricket to be as popular as it is but at the same time we want to develop football as well.
“I don’t think two popular things can’t go together. The standard of football has to be good and I am sure popularity will follow,” Ganguly said.
Briefing about their discussions, Neotia said the members said they were okay with the infrastructure in Saltlake Stadium and Barasat Stadium on the northern outskirts.
“They feel the foundation is appropriate to build on the stadium. We should not have any difficulty in hosting any match in the present infrastructure.”
“We hope to get support from state government. But with elections, we are yet to talk to the state government.”
“On coach, our desire is that the main coach be from Atletico, but we need an approval of ISL. If they approve then there would be a second coach from India with working experience in our country. We have met some people, discussions are going on.”
“We are seeking clarity on players. The Spanish team will be happy to provide players if FIFA and ISL approve of it. We have requested Atletico.

HI to felicitate living legends of 1975 WC winning team
","Continuing with its initiative of recognising the efforts of players who have brought laurels to the country, Hockey India (HI) will felicitate the greats, who won the only World Cup for India on May 14, 1975, at Kuala Lumpur .
Besides felicitating the players, HI will also announce the Indian squad for the upcoming FIH World Cup to be held in The Hague, Netherlands from May 31 to June 15.
Hockey India has invited all 13 living members of the 1975 World Cup winning team in the capital, where they will be presented with a token one-time payment of Rs. 1,75,000 each.
Speaking on the occasion Narinder Batra, Secretary General, Hockey India said, “It’s a great honour for us to felicitate the legends who made us proud of being the Champion Holders of the 1975 World Cup. These initiatives are an effort to make the present team believe that they too can do what their seniors have achieved in the past.”
HI started the initiative of felicitating players in 2012, when all the living Olympic gold medallists were invited and presented one-ime payment of Rs. 2 lakh, on the occasion of wishing the then Indian squad, which was representing the country during the London Olympics that year.
And now as the present squad is all set to compete in the FIH World Cup, HI has invited the members of only team to have won the prestigious Cup, to come and wish the team before they leave for The Hague.
The lists of invitees include Ajit Pal Singh, who captained and led the team to victory during the 1975 World Cup. To his credit, he has represented India in the prestigious tournament on three occasions -- 1971 World Cup, Barcelona wherein the ream bagged the bronze and 1973 World Cup, Amsterdam where they bought back the silver.
He was also a part of two Olympics Games in Mexico 1968 (bronze) and 1972 (bronze). He won the Arjuna Award in 1970 and Padamshree in 1992 for his contribution to the sport.
Ashok Kumar, son of legendary late Major Dhyan Chand, is the first of two Indians who represented the country in four World Cup tournaments, including Barcelona 1971 (bronze), 1973 Amsterdam (silver), Kuala Lumpur 1975 (gold) and Buenos Aires 1978.
He was also instrumental in scoring the winning goal for India against Pakistan in the finals of the 1975 World Cup.
Ashok Kumar also participated in the two Olympic Games in Munich 1972 (bronze) and Montreal 1976.

Walsh looks at the positives
","Despite the disappointing results on the recent European tour, Indian men’s hockey coach Terry Walsh, on Thursday, insisted there were a lot of positives to take back. He was also optimistic of the team’s performance at the upcoming World Cup at The Hague, the Netherlands.
Speaking to the media on the sidelines of a training session at the National Stadium here, Walsh said the success of a tour depended not just on results. “Most people here rate the success of tours on results, but tours are not only about that. I would rate the tour as very, very useful.
“According to estimates, sufficient improvements have been made. Tours are about exposure, finding out what you have and what you need, and how to go about the entire development process,” Walsh said.
He admitted the tour will have a positive impact on the players’ World Cup performance.
“The players have a lot of self-belief now — much more than what they did three months ago and significantly better than during the World League Round four. Statistically, we were very close to two of the top teams in the world. I would rather win games when it is important than on tours,” he added.
“We have to rotate players for the betterment of the playing group. We have to pick and choose tournaments and for us, the two big events this year are the World Cup and the Asian Games.”
Captain Sardar Singh observed that the European tour was part of the final selection process for the World Cup and, in that sense, had been far more useful than the results indicate.

Li Na, Serena Williams reach Madrid quarterfinals
","Australian Open champion Li Na advanced to the Madrid Open quarterfinals coming back from a set down, while two-time defending champion Serena Williams won more routinely on Thursday.
After a poor opening set, the second-ranked Li overcame a slew of unforced errors and a bothersome toe problem to beat Sloane Stephens of the United States 2-6, 6-3, 6-2 on the clay at the Magic Box tennis centre.
“After the first set I was like, ‘calm down,’” said Li, who needed two hours to pull out the win. “I say, ‘OK, I cannot only think about what happened for the game, you have to look forward otherwise you cannot make it.’”
Williams earned her 650th career victory with a 6-2, 6-3 win over Carla Suarez Navarro, who couldn’t carry over the success of winning her first career title in Portugal on Saturday to the Spanish capital.
Williams, in pursuit of her 60th title, hit 27 winners to her Spanish opponent’s five, while securing seven break points in the sun.
“She made me work for every point and it wasn’t an easy win,” the top-ranked American said. “She just won last week, so she is definitely not an easy player to play.”
Williams goes on to play 2011 champion Petra Kvitova after the fifth-seeded Czech beat countrywoman Lucie Safarova 6-4, 6-3.

Dutee and Navtejdeep corner glory
","The last event of the Junior Federation Cup athletics meet, held under fading or rather dim lights, at the Nehru Stadium here on Friday, saw a memorable performance from Odisha’s Dutee Chand.
The 18-year-old ran a wonderful race to emerge a comfortable winner in the girls’ 100m with a remarkable time of 11.63s and erased the listed national junior record of 11.75s held by Saraswati Dey since 1996. Moreover, Dutee qualified for the Asian and World Championships.

Shakti Solanki of Delhi finished second (17.93m) to qualify for the Asian championship. Malkeet Singh, finished third with a heave of  17.38m.
Pinki upset the fancied Kerala runner P.U. Chitra to win the girls’ 1500m event in 4 minutes 27.26 secs. Her time was well within the world junior standard of 4:28.00, but was half-a-second slower than the Asian junior  bronze medal grade!

Lahiri looks to book U.S. Open spot
","The chance to compete with the best at the prestigious U.S. Open will add impetus to Anirban Lahiri’s campaign at the ICTSI Philippine Open, which starts on May 15 at Manila.
Lahiri requires a top-three finish at Manila to qualify for the U.S. Open — one of the premier events in the sport.
India’s highest-ranked golfer, in fact, made a late entry into the ICTSI Philippine Open to stay in the hunt. “Initially, I was not scheduled to play at Manila, but I decided to compete because it gave me a chance to qualify for the U.S. Open,” the world no. 65 told The Hindu here on Friday.
The strong field, however, will pose a challenge. With the likes of Thailand’s Prayad Marksaeng (an eight-time winner on the Asian Tour), reigning Indian Open champion Siddikur Rahman (Bangladesh) and home-town favourite Angelo Que in the race, Lahiri is aware that he has his task cut out. “There is huge competition on the Asian Tour; anybody can take the title. I will have to play some of my best golf to do well,” he said. Unlike the British Open, where golfers have a chance to enter the field through a round of qualifiers, the field at the U.S. Open is decided purely on world rankings. “I am thrilled to have this opportunity. Just to be in this position, where my ranking alone allows me to fight for a U.S. Open spot is tremendous,” he said.
Lahiri remarked that his victory at the Indonesian Masters two weeks ago — his first title outside India — gave him a sense of “relief”.
“I did not obsess over the fact that I had won three Asian Tour titles in India, but none abroad. This idea was built up by the media and by people around me.
“I did not pay it much attention at first, but when you hear it over and over again, it starts to play on your mind. When I eventually got over the hurdle, it was a relief,” he said.

Goal is to win a Major, it’s a step by step process: Lahiri
","On a high after reaching World No. 65th, Anirban Lahiri is now determined to enter the top-50 list to earn a shot at the World Golf Championships and Majors but the top Indian golfer said it is a step by step process which will take a lot of harder.
“The Asian Tour Order of Merit is one of the few goals that I have for this season and I’ve put myself in a good position. It’s still a long season ahead,” said Lahiri, who earned $240,900 so far this year to current sit at the top of Asian Tour’s Order of MeritTour.
“I want to push and see how far I can go. The sky is the limit. I don’t know where I want to get to, I just want to go forward. Everybody’s ultimate goal is to win a Major or more than one. I just need to get into more Majors for now and then hopefully have a chance to win. It’s a step by step process.”
It has been a interesting journey for Lahiri from being a wide-eyed young golfer playing in his rookie year in 2008 to becoming the country’s best golfer in 2014 with four Asian Tour titles so far.
Back in November of 2008, Lahiri couldn’t believe his luck when he got into Singapore Open as the first alternate following Ian Poulter’s withdrawal at the 11th hour. Lahiri then stepped onto the first tee in the company of Major champion Phil Mickelson and Asia’s great Thaworn Wiratchant.
“That was my claim to fame back then,” Lahiri laughed.
It was indeed a baptism of fire which backfired as rounds of 80 and 76 saw him finish ahead of only six other golfers in the field of 150.
Cut to 2014 and Lahiri started his season with a superb victory at the CIMB Niaga Indonesian Masters, courtesy of a sensational eagle on the 72nd hole, and three other top-10s.
The 26-year-old has taken enough trips to the hard luck saloon and suffered knocks in his fledgling years that he reckons those experiences has shaped his career.
Lahiri believes if he can stick with the winning recipe, it will take him to a Major victory.
“I was just a fledging, a newbie and I’ve learned so much since then,” said Lahiri of his first brush with fame in Singapore.
“It was a humbling experience, playing with Thaworn and Phil at that time. My game wasn’t rounded back then. I didn’t know what was going on around me. I was totally in awe of Phil and those 36 holes went by like a flash. I probably had something like 75 putts or more during those two days!” Lahiri said.
He admitted he was too young back then to learn from the experience of playing alongside two greats of the game. It was only in 2009 that Lahiri’s career took a steady climb up the fairways to golfing excellence.
“It’s been a gradual climb and improvement for me. It was a lot of hard work and dedication. I’ve taken small steps. I have to give credit to the Professional Golf Tour of India as well as I started out from here,” said Lahiri, who contributed two points in Team Asia’s dramatic draw with Europe in the inaugural EurAsia Cup in Malaysia in March.
“People expected me to win on my first year as a pro but it was only in 2009 when I started improving, after playing professionally for a year and a half. Playing week in week out, I was playing 18 events on the PGTI and 10 on the Asian Tour which was 28 weeks compared to my amateur days when I played like 11 or 12 events a year. I didn’t know how to manage my game.”
After an uneventful rookie season on the Asian Tour in 2008 bar the Singapore sling, he enjoyed better fortunes in 2009, which included a third place finish at the Hero Indian Open after a final day 64 and finished 24th on the Order of Merit.
But in 2010, he struggled and kept his card only at the penultimate tournament in Cambodia where he said he faced the most “intense pressure” of his young life.
“I was outside the top-60 with two events to go and I was out of form. In Cambodia, I had some serious pressure and I needed to make like $10,000 to $15,000 in those two last events. I played out of my skin and under such intense pressure as the guys on the bubble were grouped together and I managed to finish fourth that week. That was a huge mental victory for me,” he recounted.

Hamilton quickest in first practice for Spanish GP
","Lewis Hamilton led the way in the first practice session on Friday for Sunday’s Spanish Grand Prix.
The Mercedes driver, seeking a fourth straight Formula One race win, was 0.868 seconds faster than fellow Briton Jenson Button in a Mclaren.
Red Bull’s Daniel Ricciardo was third fastest, ahead of Ferrari’s Fernando Alonso, Hamilton’s team-mate Nico Rosberg, Kimi Raikkonen (Ferrari), Kevin Magnusson (McLaren), Pastor Maldonado (Lotus), Sergio Perez (Force India) and Felipe Massa (Williams).
Four-time world champion Sebastian Vettel had to pull out after just four laps on the Circuit de Catalunya after an electrical problem with his Red Bull.
Overall championship leader Rosberg also experienced a technical problem, with the Mercedes hybrid system overheating, which limited the German to nine laps.
Rosberg, who won the season’s opening race in Australia when Hamilton retired with a technical defect, has a four-point lead in the standings -- 79 to 75 -- going into the fifth race of the season and the first in Europe.
A second practice session is scheduled later in the day, with qualifying on Saturday.

Lewis Hamilton steered his Mercedes to the fastest lap time of 1 minute, 27.023 seconds, while teammate and F1 leader Nico Rosberg was limited to only nine laps due to a cooling issue.

‘First goal is to reach quarterfinals’
","Notwithstanding the odds stacked against India going far in the upcoming Thomas Cup and Uber Cup finals, there was no dearth of optimism for chief coach P. Gopi Chand. “Our first goal is to reach the quarterfinals (in both sections),” Gopi said.
The premier team competition will he held here from May 18 to 25. The Chinese men will be seeking their 10th Thomas Cup triumph, and sixth in succession. In the Uber Cup, 12-time winner China is the defending champion.
India will be hosting the finals for the first time after having conducted the qualifying phase in 1988, 2000 and 2006. In 2010, India reached the quarterfinals in both sections.
“Our strength is obviously singles,” said Gopi, pointing to the presence of K. Srikanth, P. Kashyap and R.M.V. Gurusaidutt, while talking to mediapersons a day after the team began its preparatory camp at the venue of the competition.
“Our doubles combinations have been playing well but there is not much to show in terms of results. Everyone is keen to perform and the team spirit is good. Our singles players beat many higher-ranked players in the Indian Badminton League, and that was good for their confidence.”
Up against the world No. 1 Lee Chong Wei-led Malaysia, Korea and Germany in the league phase, India will have to finish at least second in this four-team group to reach the last-eight stage.
Unlike in Thomas Cup, the Indian hopes of advancing in Uber Cup rest on the success of the doubles pair. The combination of G. Jwala and Ashwini Ponnappa will be expected to pull off a victory to complement the expected wins of Saina Nehwal and P.V. Sindhu in the best-of-five matches.

Marco Materazzi to open CDC
","Valerio Ringoli will head Inter Milan’s City Development Centre (CDC) at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium, slated to be opened by Italian World Cup winner Marco Materazzi on May 22.
A former youth team player at Inter, Ringoli has played professionally in Italy and Australia and been a part of the club’s coaching setup over the past three years.
Speaking about the importance of the centre, Materazzi told The Hindu: “It’s essential to have strong basics in football and for this it’s necessary to get the opportunity to participate in organised camps, which teach you the best way to approach football and learn the correct technical skills.
“Moreover it will give the kids a chance to showcase their talents to qualified professional scouts.”
The centre, which will act as a feeder to the club’s main residential academy in Hosur (expected to be fully functional by September 2014), will be operated on weekday evenings and weekends, mainly for kids in the age group of six to 14.
Inter has also signed up with five schools in the city for its school outreach programme and 20 kids from each school will be a part of the city development centre.
A similar project will be up and running in Bangalore from June 1, with Hyderabad, Kochi and Mumbai joining the fray soon.
The club, which claims to be committed to grass-root football development in India, plans to select 20 players for a two-month-long training and exposure trip to the San Siro.
“The chosen players will get a chance to experience the European football culture and a lucky few might even get a chance to be part of the Inter youth setup in Italy,” Materazzi said. Aldo Montinaro, director of Inter Campus, who spotted a seven-year-old Edin Dzeko and trained him for two years, is slated to arrive in Mumbai on May 14 and help with the selection of players for the advanced training.
Efforts are also on for organising an exhibition game in the first week of September, involving the Inter Forever (Inter Milan Legends) team, prior to the launch of the Indian Super League.

Manipur challenge for Delhi girls, Orissa face Jharkhand
","Seeking to reach their maiden final, first-timers Delhi will lock horns with heavyweights Manipur, while Jharkhand take on Orissa in semifinals of the 20th Women’s National Championships in Golaghat on Friday.
Delhi have been the surprise element of the nationals with their superlative performance against the likes of two-time champions West Bengal and stronger opponents like Kerala and Bihar.
“We are pinching ourselves,” team captain and India striker Jyoti Ann Burret said.
“It’s been a valiant effort for us to reach this far overcoming the likes of Bengal. The Team gelled really well and we stuck to a plan. We can draw a lot of inspiration from this effort,” she added.
According to the 24-year old marksman, Delhi Coach Paritosh Sharma’s ‘modern outlook’ has played a vital part in the team success.
“He is a very modern Coach with the latest training methods. He has put in a lot of effort to play in a certain style and that had clicked for us.”
Jyoti, who was part of India’s AFC Asian Cup Squad last year, has so far scored three goals so far in the tournament with a brace against Bihar.
Delhi take on 16-time champions Manipur in the semifinals and Jyoti feels the job at hand is enormous.
“Manipur are a top side. Their record in the Tournament speaks for itself. It will be baptism by fire for us. But I feel the fact that there were no expectations from us as such helped a great deal and it will be the same in the semis.”
The capital state women’s team, whose best finish in the nationals was back in 2003-04 when they reached the quarterfinals, remained unbeaten throughout the group matches.
National women’s team coach Anadi Barua stated the “exuberance of youth” is helping Delhi a lot.
“They are a wonderful bunch of girls. It’s so heartening to see them combining well on the field,” he said.
In the other semifinal of the day, both Jharkhand and Defending Champions Orissa will look to seal a berth in the summit clash. Both the outfits have kept clean slates going into the last-our tie.
In fact, both are yet to end on the wrong side of the spectrum with Orissa triumphing in all their matches and Jharkhand dropping only two points from their quota of five matches.

Real Madrid’s Pepe doubtful for Champions League final
","Defender Pepe is doubtful for the May 24 Champions League final with a torn calf muscle in his left leg, his club Real Madrid said on Friday.
Real said he will be out of action for around 15 days, which makes him touch-and-go for the Lisbon final against neighbours Atletico.
To make things worse for the whites, Pepe’s natural replacement Raphael Varane is also injured and has hardly played this season.
Pepe, 31, suffered the injury in Wednesday’s disappointing 1-1 draw at Valladolid which left Real in third place in La Liga and virtually out of the title race.
Strikers Cristiano Ronaldo and Angel di Maria also suffered muscle injuries in Valladolid and will probably miss Sunday’s visit to Celta Vigo, though they should be fit well in time for the final.
In addition, defender Alvaro Arbeloa is fit again, though young striker Jese will not play until next season.

Mourinho fined for mocking referee
","Chelsea coach Jose Mourinho was fined $16,900 by the English Football Association after he made improper comments about match officials.
Mourinho sarcastically described referee Mike Dean’s performance as “unbelievable” and “fantastic” as his side lost 2-1 to Sunderland in an April 19 Premier League match, reported Xinhua.
His assistant Rui Faria was sent to the stands and later given a six-match stadium ban.
The FA on Thursday found that Mourinho’s comments did not question the officials’ integrity but amounted to disrepute and improper conduct.

Baan not to extend AIFF contract
","AIFF technical director Robert Baan will not extend his contract which ends in November this year. The 71-year-old Dutchman cited old age and demands of travelling in a big country like India as reasons for his decision.
Speaking to The Hindu on the sidelines of the AFC’s ‘D’ license instructors course at the LNCPE, Kariyavattom, Baan said he was satisfied that he had put in place a framework at the ‘top’ for his successor to work on. “We have put things in order at least at the grassroots level as the youth development programme is going on in full swing at a few centres. We have also started the ‘D’ license programme for coaches, where men in the age group of 35 were trained. It gives us confidence that they are teaching the right kind of skills to kids at the grassroots level.”
“My successor, preferably a youngster, should concentrate on the competition aspect. At present, there is virtually no competition for the seniors and the under-15, under-17, under-19 and under-21 teams. With India slated to host the under-17 World Cup in 2017, providing competitions to the junior teams is a must,” he said.

Sachin Dalal, Navjeet Kaur set new marks
","“A little!” quipped Sachin Dalal, when asked if the field was competitive. The 18-year-old Haryana lad truly outclassed the field in the discus throw with a heave of 58.11m in the Junior Federation Cup athletics meet at the Nehru Stadium here on Saturday. With the feat, he broke the National record held by Kripal Singh (58.10m) by one centimetre and also made the Asian and World qualifying mark.
“I am excited to make the grade for both,” he said. With the gold, Dalal will be ranked No.1 in Asian juniors.

Having sealed the first place and being satisfied with the new mark, Navjeet skipped her remaining rounds and chose to egg on her teammate Manpreet Kaur Jr., who bagged the silver with 13.53m.
Uttarakhand’s Ramanpreet Kaur was third with 13.50m.
Dipika of Tamil Nadu bagged the gold medal in the girls’ 100m with 14.19 seconds while Meghana Shetty (Karnataka) and Dhanalakshmi (TN) finished third.

Hamilton makes it four-in-a-row
","Lewis Hamilton put Mercedes on pole position for the Spanish Grand Prix on Saturday with a fourth successive win and the overall championship lead beckoning on Sunday.
Teammate Nico Rosberg, who is four points clear of Hamilton but has finished runner-up in the last three races, qualified second with Australian Daniel Ricciardo starting third for champion Red Bull.
Hamilton, celebrating his fourth pole of the season and 35th of his career with a time 0.168 seconds quicker than the German, will wrest the overall lead from Rosberg if he wins for the first time at the Circuit de Catalunya.
Ferrari’s Fernando Alonso, winner in front of his home fans last year, qualified seventh and behind teammate Kimi Raikkonen in sixth.
Finland’s Valtteri Bottas starts fourth for Williams, with Frenchman Romain Grosjean fifth for Lotus.

Vettel qualifies 10th

Red Bull’s quadruple world champion Sebastian Vettel will line up in 10th place on the grid after stopping on track in the final phase of the session.
Vettel has switched to a different chassis for the start of the European season after a difficult opening four races in Asia and the Middle East but his luck has, if anything, taken a turn for the worse.
He managed only four laps in Friday practice before being sidelined by an electrical problem and on Saturday the gremlins returned at the crucial point.
Qualifying was twice red flagged, the second stoppage triggered by Vettel’s failure and the first coming right at the start when Venezuelan Pastor Maldonado speared his Lotus into the wall.

Starting grid: 1st row: Lewis Hamilton (Mercedes), Nico Rosberg (Mercedes).

2nd row: Daniel Ricciardo (Red Bull), Valtteri Bottas (Williams).

3rd row: Romain Grosjean (Lotus), Kimi Raikkonen (Ferrari).

Conditions will favour my aggressive game: Kashyap
","The most experienced player in the Indian team, Parupalli Kashyap on Saturday said his team will be second to none at the Li Ning Thomas Cup and home conditions will help him and compatriot K. Srikanth turn up the aggression.
India are drawn in a group which also comprises Malaysia, Korea and Germany and Kashyap said the hosts are capable of qualifying for the knockout stage of the event, starting May 18, riding on the back of singles performance.
“It is a tough draw, all teams are tough. Germany has two singles player in Marc Zwiebler and Dieter Domke, who are good. Mark has been consistent over the years to be inside the top 20. He has played here during IBL and Domke is also a good player. Doubles is obviously good,” Kashyap told PTI in an interview on the sidelines of a training session at the Siri Fort Complex.
“Even Korea have good singles and doubles player. Malaysia obviously have Lee Chong Wei and other two players are also decent. So it is evenly matched in singles. So we have an outside chance of reaching the quarterfinals.
“Since we bank on our singles, we will have to win all the singles. If we can pull out a doubles from somewhere it will be a bonus for us. But we will surely look at all the singles against Germany and Korea. I think we are capable of beating them,” he added.
India will be hosting the Thomas and Uber Cup Finals for the first time and Kashyap is banking on home conditions to do well in the tournament.
“Playing at home really gives me a push. Training for a couple of weeks ahead of the tournament really helps. Even homely Indian food, the climate, all these factors matters.
Also at home, with the crowd cheering for you and the whole team also rooting for you to win your match for the team to qualify is a different feeling,” he said.
“At Siri Fort, these courts are different, so I have been trying to focus on my attacking and aggressive game. I play good in these conditions, it was more condition specific training. I focused on getting back to good fitness.
“I am happy that these conditions are going to help both me and Srikanth. We are aggressive players, we like top smash more and right now my shoulder is also in right condition and so I can smash,” he added.
Though Kashyap is the senior most player, Srikanth will play the first singles being the top ranked shuttler in world and Kashyap said it will be favourable for the team.
“I tried to qualify as the first singles for Thomas Cup. If I would have achieved that if I could have won the second round at ABC because there are just 100 odd points difference between me and Srikanth. I wanted to take that responsibility as a senior player,” Kashyap said.
“But nevertheless, Srikanth has been in good form. He has beaten Son Wan Ho, so he will be confident against him and it will be favourable for us.”
Kashyap will be playing the second singles against Korea’s Lee Dong Keun, Malaysia’s Chong Wei Feng and Germany’s Dieter Domke.
Asked about his opponents, Kashyap said: “I lost to Lee closely in Singapore. He is a steady player. He is getting consistent results. Right now, he is as consistent as me. I am getting better right now but I think I will give myself advantage.”
“The Koreans have a steady sort of game. They are not very stroke-oriented or skillful but very steady. So it is going to be tough. We always had a 3-2 or 2-3 contests against Korea and I hope this time three is ours.
“Chong Wei Feng has got good results against all the Indians. I always had close games with him. I feel I am playing better than before, I am back to full fitness. So I think it is evenly matched,” he added.
A veteran of four Thomas Cup tournaments, the 26-year-old Indian is relishing the additional responsibility of being a senior shuttler in the team.
“When I played Thomas Cup for the first time, there were many senior players in the team and I feel seniors have to take additional responsibility. We all play individual events all through the year and so it is a different event. In team events, team spirit and taking responsibility helps in getting good results,” Kashyap said.
After a good run early in the season, Kashyap lost in the first and second round of Singapore Open and Asian Badminton Championship but the Commonwealth bronze-medallist said it was the tight schudule which took a toll and he is now back to his full fitness.
“It was a hectic schedule. I didn’t get time. Whenever I get around 4-5 weeks time to train, I do well. There are issues about my ranking and qualifying for Commonwealth Games, so it was important to play a couple of events so that I can take time off before major events,” he said.
“I have come close now so I think in 5-6 months I should be back in the top 10. In June, again there are three tournaments, so I will skip one. I have sent entries but if I do well in the first, I might pull off from the next.”

Sharapova to face Halep in Madrid Open final
","Maria Sharapova secured her place in the final of the WTA Madrid Open for the second consecutive year with a comfortable 6-1, 6-4 win over Poland’s Agnieszka Radwanska on Saturday.
The four-time Grand Slam champion will face Romanian Simona Halep in Sunday’s final as she recorded a hard-fought 6-7(4), 6-3, 6-2 victory over fifth seed Petra Kvitova.
Sharapova has slowly begun to hit form in recent weeks on her return to clay conditions after a difficult start to the year and she stormed through the opening set for the loss of just 11 points.
The Russian was dominant again at the start of the second as she raced into a 3-0 lead, but Radwanska battled back to take four straight games and lead 4-3 with a break.
Unfortunately for the third seed, though, she gifted the break straight back and Sharapova also took the next two games to round off victory in little over an hour.
Earlier, Halep booked her place in her first ever final of a mandatory event after outlasting Kvitova after over two-and-a-half hours on court.
After just one break apiece it was Kvitova who edged a first set tie-break and the Czech looked on her way to her first final of the season when she led 3-1 early in the second. Halep responded by taking the next seven games to level at one set all and go an early break ahead in the decider.
The fourth seed then broke the Kvitova serve once more to move ahead 5-2 and served the match out in the next game.
Meanwhile, Kei Nishikori defeated Feliciano Lopez 6-4, 6-4 to make the Madrid Masters semifinals on Friday.

The results:


Men: Quarterfinals: Rafael Nadal bt Tomas Berdych 6-4, 6-2; Roberto Bautista Agut bt Santiago Giraldo 6-3, 6-4; David Ferrer bt Ernests Gulbis 7-6(3), 6-3; Kei Nishikori bt Feliciano Lopez 6-4, 6-4.

Women: Semifinals: Simona Halep bt Petra Kvitova 6-7(4), 6-3, 6-2; Maria Sharapova bt Agnieszka Radwanska 6-1, 6-4. Quarterfinal: Agnieszka Radwanska bt Caroline Garcia 6-4, 4-6, 6-4.

Sammy quits Test cricket after being sacked as captain
","All-rounder Darren Sammy has announced his retirement from Test cricket, in a stunning development after he was sacked as the West Indies skipper.
The St Lucian all-rounder was on Friday axed as Test skipper and replaced by wicketkeeper Denesh Ramdin, after a near four-year stint in charge, reports CMC.
However, the West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) subsequently announced Sammy’s decision to end his Test career, while noting that the Twenty20 captain would remain available for selection to the other formats of the game.
“Darren Sammy has formally notified the West Indies Cricket Board of his decision to retire from Test cricket,” the board said.
“Sammy has also informed the board of his decision to continue to make himself available for selection for the other formats of the game. Sammy, in his communication to the board thanked the directors, the selectors and team management for the confidence shown in him as a player and captain which he served as from October 2010 to May 2014.
“Sammy said that he will always cherish the memories of representing and captaining the West Indies in Test cricket.”
Sammy led West Indies in 30 of his 38 Tests, winning eight, losing 12 and drawing ten matches, and was credited for returning discipline and stability to the regional side.
However, West Indies have remained eighth in the Test rankings and heavy defeats on the tours of India and New Zealand last year, placed Sammy’s captain under fresh scrutiny.
The WICB said it was thankful to Sammy for his contribution over the last four years.
“The West Indies Cricket Board thanks Sammy for his service to West Indies Test cricket both as player and captain and looks forward to his continued involvement and contribution as an ODI player and T20 captain and player,” the board release said.
The 30-year-old Sammy made 1323 runs in Tests at an average of 21, and a highest score of 106 against England at Trent Bridge in 2012. With the ball, he took 84 wickets at 35 runs apiece, with four five-wicket hauls. There was speculation Sammy could not command a place in the West Indies Test side outside of his role as captain.

IPL final shifted to Bangalore
","The Pepsi-IPL-7 play-off final will be played at Bangalore on June 1 and two play-off matches (qualifier 1 and eliminator) scheduled to be held at the M.A. Chidambaram Stadium on May 27 and 28 has been allotted to the Cricket Association of Bengal (Kolkata) and Cricket Club of India (CCI) Mumbai.

Reserve days

The Mumbai Cricket Association (MCA) has been allotted the second qualifier on May 30. The IPL has provided a reserve day for qualifier 1, eliminator and the final play-off matches.
The practice so far has been to allot a play-off match and the final to the home association of the previous year’s title winning team and the other two play-off matches to the previous year’s runner-up team.
Unresolved stadium related issues between the Tamil Nadu Cricket Association (TNCA) and the local municipal corporation has compelled the IPL to relocate the two play-off matches.
BCCI Secretary Sanjay Patel said in a press release: “The TNCA has informed the IPL-governing council the M.A. Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai is not available for the ongoing season of the IPL. The GC has also decided to move CSK’s two home matches — scheduled on May 18 and 22 — to Ranchi. CSK has been using Ranchi as its alternative home venue and will continue to do so for the remainder of the season,” he said.
The BCCI release also explained that since 20 matches of the IPL-7 were played in Abu Dhabi, Dubai and Sharjah, the GC had decided to take the play-off matches to different centres.
The CAB, which withdrew from hosting the KKR-MI match on May 14 because the police would not provide security (the match will be played at Cuttack now), has been compensated with a play-off match.
There are a number of reasons being given for the final being moved to Bangalore , but sources The Hindu spoke to said that demand for a large number of accreditations from the MCA, fire hazard issues raised by the broadcaster and restrictions on the use of the public announcement system after 10 p.m. had forced the GC to review the venue for the final.
“Moreover fireworks will be on display after the final which will go beyond the 10 p.m. restriction time and we are planning to invite international dignitaries (from UAE) for the final. All considered we took a decision to move the final to Bangalore ,’’ said a top IPL official.

Unpleasant incident

The GC which met here on Saturday also expressed unhappiness at the incident involving Mumbai Indians’ Kieron Pollard and Royal Challengers Bangalore’s Mitchell Starc in a league match played at the Wankhede on May 6.
“The members expressed dismay at the incident and unanimously expressed the view that the game in question was not played in the right spirit.
“It was decided to address these concerns to all the captains, coaches and team managements featuring in the Pepsi IPL 2014 tournament.”

KSCA welcomes decision

Meanwhile, Karnataka State Cricket Association secretary Brijesh Patel welcomed the news.
“We are happy to host the IPL final and it is also a great opportunity for the public in Bangalore. I am sure the BCCI, in their evaluation, found the Chinnaswamy Stadium appropriate for the big game. If RCB can qualify for the final then that would be the icing on the cake,” Patel said.

Fans the losers

TNCA secretary K.S. Viswanathan said: “I feel bad for the cricket loving public of Chennai. The fans are the biggest losers. Considering Chennai Super Kings is the most successful team in the IPL, its cricketers are extremely popular here. There is tremendous support for the side at Chepauk. We hope for the best next year.”

The revised schedule:


May 27, 8 p.m.: Qualifier 1: 1 v 2, Eden Gardens, Kolkata, reserve day, 4 p.m., May 28; May 28, 8 p.m.: Eliminator: 3 v 4,  Brabourne Stadium, CCI, Mumbai, reserve day, 8 p.m., May 29; May 30: Qualifier 2: Q1 loser v Eliminator winner, Wankhede Stadium, Mumbai (no reserve day); June 1, 8 p.m.: Final:  Q1 winner v Q2 winner, M. Chinnaswamy Stadium, Bangalore and  reserve day, 8 p.m., June 2.

A royal battle crucial to both teams
","Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) will look to re-launch its IPL campaign when it takes the field against Rajasthan Royals here on Sunday, after a series of failed take-offs so far.
Despite a stellar cast of match-winners, the team has flattered to deceive. Now joint-fourth on the points table after losing five of its eight matches, the team sits precariously close to the elimination zone.
In the five days since the super win against Sunrisers, the home side has lost an away fixture at Mumbai, before plummeting to a one-sided 32-run defeat to table-topper Kings XI Punjab here on Friday. The party — which was just beginning to gather steam — was forced to a halt.
The likes of Chris Gayle and captain Virat Kohli have yet to take full flight, while southpaw Yuvraj Singh looks a pale shadow of his former flowing self. If ever there was a time to turn the corner, it is now.
“We have some world-class cricketers; we need to switch on and compete again,” all-rounder Albie Morkel said, after the loss to Kings XI.
Rajasthan Royals — which leads RCB by four points — has some breathing space. The side is in third-place, and looks a settled unit. A loss against Sunrisers in its most recent fixture proved to be a setback, but the players are hardly in a state of panic. “We have won most of our matches, and I think we are in a decent position,” its Australian import Steve Smith said here, on the eve of the match.
A confident Smith, however, was wary of dismissing RCB’s chances, saying: “They (RCB) do have a few match-winners who can turn it on at any time.”
RCB will seek to justify Smith’s trepidation, for another defeat could see its hopes of gaining a play-off spot veer further off course.

Sunrisers shine through rain interruptions
","Frequent rain interruptions led to a farcical situation in the Indian Premier League contest between Delhi Daredevils and Sunrisers Hyderabad at the Ferozeshah Kotla here on Saturday.
Players and umpires kept moving onto and out of the ground, groundsmen ran in and out with the covers, super soppers remained hyperactive and the target was kept revising before SRH finally achieved the required 43 runs in 4.2 overs under the Duckworth-Lewis method and won the match by eight wickets.
This was SRH’s second consecutive victory and fourth overall. DD suffered its fourth successive loss, all on home ground, and seventh overall, which virtually ruled the team out of the race for a spot in the playoffs.
Even though the going had been tough for DD and for himself, Pietersen showed a lot of character and opened the innings with Quinton de Kock after being asked to bat first.
de Kock was dismissed before he could settle down, but that did not affect the determination of Pietersen. The seasoned batsman took some time to get a hang of things before showcasing his trademark clean hitting. Two boundaries from a Bhuvneshwar Kumar over warmed him up.
Pietersen hit Karn Sharma over long off for his first six and cut a short delivery for a four. Then he chose Moises Henriques for a similar treatment, lifting the Aussie majestically over long on and then driving with a straight bat for a four to charm the Kotla spectators.
Pietersen, who recorded his highest score (35 off 19 balls) of IPL-7, looked in ominous form and it seemed as if DD, which had gathered 52 runs in the six overs, would post a massive target before SRH.
However, Amit Mishra struck twice in successive overs to thwart DD’s progress. Pietersen played a leg-break delivery to Shikhar Dhawan at cover to become Mishra’s 100th IPL scalp. Mayank Agarwal (25), who gave solid support to Pietersen to put up 44 runs, swiped Mishra to David Warner at deep midwicket.
Dinesh Karthik and Laxmi Ratan Shukla rotated the strike nicely and put DD back on track. The host’s innings was interrupted for more than one hour by a bout of rain and when play resumed, with DD on 103 for three in the 14th over, Karthik pulled Karn for a six and a four to push the scoring rate upwards.
The Karthik-Laxmi duo contributed 55 runs for the fourth wicket before Henriques removed both in his third over. Karthik’s lofted stroke was caught by a jumping Steyn on the long off fence, while Laxmi’s ill-timed pull was gladly accepted by Warner at deep midwicket.
The SRH pacers did a tremendous job in the death overs. If Henriques provided the crucial breakthroughs, Bhuvneshwar excelled with his accuracy, Pathan kept it tight and Steyn finished it off in style by claiming Kedar Jadhav off the last delivery. DD managed just 11 runs at the expense of two wickets in the last three over to finish at 143 for seven.
Another spell of rain enforced meant that the target was revised to 117 runs off 15 overs. But the target kept changing before settling at 43 off five overs.
SRH, which had scored 17 for one by then, finally came out with a task of making 26 runs from 18 balls and achieved it without much trouble.

Royal Challengers need to bat better: Morkel
","Their back against the wall after just three wins in five outings, Royal Challengers Bangalore all-rounder Albie Morkel said the star-studded team will have to sort out its batting woes to have any chance of making the IPL semifinals.
To be in the top four in points table, Bangalore have to win all the remaining six games, Morkel said.
“We need to win six games. We have struggled as a batting unit. Our batsmen score in 30s and 40s, but no one carries through and scores a 75, which is needed if you want to win games consistently,” he told reporters here.
“It is important to stay positive and switch on to compete again with world class players at their disposal,” Morkel stated.
For the team to gain confidence, Morkel said it should stay positive instead of sulking over the crushing defeat they faced last night at the hands of a rampaging Kings XI Punjab.
“We should not be sulking around with such a defeat. We have to stay positive,” he said.
Morkel further said it is in their hands to win the next six matches to qualify for semifinals.
“Losing by 30 or 50 runs is a big defeat in T20 cricket. We have to look in the mirror. It is in our own hands now. If you can win five to six in next games we will enter the semifinals and anything can happen from there,” he said.
Morkel said Punjab probably got 10 to 20 runs too many, but refuted suggestions that his team’s bowlers bowled badly while conceding 198.
“I think they probably got 10 to 20 runs too many. I don’t think we bowled badly,” he said.
“We struggled to really drag it back. Every new (Punjab) guy was looking for boundaries from ball one. It was just that type of wicket, a little slow good enough to score runs,” he explained.
The South African all-rounder also blamed it on the bad start Bangalore made while chasing a massive target of 199.
“The main thing is that if you are going to chase such a big total, (then) 50 for four -- then you are going to struggle,” he stated.
Morkel felt the back-to-back dismissal of Chris Gayle and Virat Kohli was the turning point of the match.
“Two big wickets -- Gayle and Kohli -- in two balls is massive for the fielding team,” he said.

Rampaging Kings XI lock horns with Kolkata
","The erratic >Kolkata Knight Riders will look to challenge the seemingly unstoppable force of table-toppers >Kings XI Punjab when the two sides clash in an IPL match in Cuttack on Sunday.
The last time the two sides faced off, it turned out to be a low-scoring affair but even in that Punjab came out trumps after doing the job well with the ball.
But given the sparkling form the duo of Glenn Maxwell and David Miller are in, KKR’s bowlers are likely to be put to the sword in tomorrow’s game at the Barabati stadium.
On paper, it looks a lop-sided contest given that Punjab have a batting line-up, which has been in marauding form. If Maxwell and Miller were not a big enough headache to deal with for rival teams, out-of-form veteran Virender Sehwag is also slowly rediscovering his touch.
In fact, batting alone makes Punjab an intimidating side to take on and more so for KKR, a team struggling to find its feet even though the win over Delhi Daredevils in its previous match has come as a morale-booster.
For once, Kolkata’s batting clicked with skipper Gautam Gambhir, who had been facing a barrage of criticism for poor form, leading the way with a half-century.
Robin Uthappa and Manish Pandey also did their bits to take KKR to an elusive win over Delhi Daredevils and they would be keen to carry that form into the match against Punjab on Sunday.
On the bowling front, KKR can draw some confidence form the fact that they managed to restrict Punjab’s marauding batsmen the last time the two teams clashed against each other. Mystery spinner Sunil Narine would once again be their trump card.
Punjab, on the other hand, would be relying on batsmen to come good yet again and keep the pressure off bowlers, who, to their credit, have not done too badly.
Pacer Sandeep Sharma has been in consistent form and is currently third in the list of top wicket—takers this season after scalping 13 in six matches.
After a slow start, even Australian import Mitchell Johnson is in decent form now.

Teams (from):


Kings XI Punjab: George Bailey (C), David Miller, Manan Vohra, Virender Sehwag, Mitchell Johnson, Cheteshwar Pujara, Shaun Marsh, Wriddhiman Saha, Thisara Perera, Glenn Maxwell, Rishi Dhawan, Anureet Singh, Sandeep Sharma, Akshar Patel, Beuran Hendricks, Karanveer Singh, Murali Kartik, Shivam Sharma, Shardul Thakur, L Balaji, Parvinder Awana, Gurkeerat Singh Mann, Mandeep Singh.

Kings XI Punjab’s merry march continues
","With an army of strong hitters on both sides, this contest had offered much hope to the M. Chinnaswamy Stadium of being a run-heavy blockbuster.
As it turned out, most of the fire came from one direction as a rampant Kings XI Punjab laid waste to Royal Challengers Bangalore here on Friday.
David Miller and man-of-the-match Sandeep Sharma played leading roles as the home team, in pursuit of 199, sank to a dire 32-run defeat.
The win was Punjab’s seventh in eight games in the Pepsi IPL, its two-point lead at the top of the table now restored. RCB, meanwhile, will seriously worry after a fifth loss in the competition.
The outcome was never truly in doubt during the run chase, RCB crumbling to 50 for five inside 10 overs. That the margin was limited to its eventual extent was largely due to the fire-fighting efforts of A.B. de Villiers, who made a valiant 26-ball-53.  

Sandeep strikes

Sandeep bothered RCB just as he had in Dubai last month, removing Chris Gayle and Virat Kohli cheaply off consecutive balls. Kohli was deemed caught-behind, after a slight delay when the umpires waited to see if Wriddhiman Saha had held it cleanly. Parthiv Patel was Sandeep’s next victim, the bowler finishing with figures of three for 25 from his four overs.
Yuvraj Singh’s troubles seem incessant. He was a picture of agony here, needing seven balls to get off strike, struggling to score off the 20-year-old debutant Shivam Sharma. The same bowler finally ended his suffering, claiming Yuvraj for three (11b). de Villiers and Albie Morkel launched a few into the night sky, but with the enormity of the target, their efforts were never going to be adequate.
Asked to bat, Punjab soared away on the back of a robust opening partnership, Virender Sehwag and Mandeep Singh adding 60 runs inside six overs.
Sehwag may not be the unstoppable force of old but he still treats the new ball with the same irreverence. He struck five boundaries in his 30, before the openers fell in the space of seven balls.
The tornado that is Glenn Maxwell then made landfall. The Australian walked out to a huge roar — a sign of his burgeoning reputation — and put away his first delivery past point for four. He then tore into Yuvraj, striking successive, clean sixes in an eighth over that brought 19 runs.
Maxwell was dismissed, however, before he could completely alter the aspect of the contest. He fell for an 11-ball-25, sweeping Yuzvendra Chahal straight to Mitchell Starc at deep midwicket.
Any delight at containing Maxwell, though, evaporated as Miller stepped on the pedal. Varun Aaron was hit for three fours in one over and Harshal Patel, who had a miserable evening with the ball, clubbed twice for six. The second of those strikes off Harshal sailed over the roof, taking Miller to a 23-ball fifty.
The South African was removed by Aaron, caught sharply on the offside by Chahal for 66. Punjab had managed only 33 runs between overs 10 and 15, but 58 came off the last five as the total swelled. Its charge would not be halted.

I’m really rooting for Germany in FIFA World Cup: Kohli
","As World Cup fever grips soccer fans across the globe, people from all walks of life are excited and cricketers are no exception, as India’s vice-captain Virat Kohli is ready to root for Germany in the upcoming mega-event.
“This time I am really rooting for them (Germany) because they have got one of the most dangerous sides in the world. Hopefully this will be Germany’s year,” he told reporters in Bangalore.
Kohli said Philipp Lahm is his favourite German footballer as he creates most of the opportunities for his team.
“I like Philipp Lahm. I like his work ethic. Probably he is one of those guys who creates most of the space for Germany,” said Kohli at the sidelines of a function, organised by Adidas.
Kohli said Christiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi are his two favourite international footballers.
“Christiano Ronaldo is my favourite, as well as Messi because he is also associated with Adidas. It will be great to meet both of them and those are obviously on top of my list,” he said.
Replying to a query, Kohli said Ravindra Jadeja is the most funniest footballer in the Indian squad as he is all over the place and thinks he is as good as Ronaldo.
“It is really funny to see some of the guys trying different skills, especially Ravindra Jadeja. You should watch him play football...you will have a laugh. He thinks he is as good as Ronaldo when he gets the ball. I mean you should watch him. It is hilarious,” he said.
While Jadeja plays in all positions, Kohli said he plays as a mid-fielder.
“He (Jadeja) plays everywhere. I sort of play mid-fielder but I have to eventually go forward to try and score some goals. Once you give the ball to Jadeja there is no getting it back so I have to sort of take that role over,” he said.
Kohli said it was a great experience to play with international footballer Didier Drogba during an exhibition match in New Delhi in June last year.
“Yah, it was a great experience to play with him.”
Mahendra Singh Dhoni is the best footballer in Indian team, Kohli said while replied to a query.
He also said the Indian team members follow international football matches with great interest.
“Everyone follows pretty cleanly with a lot of interest. We have foreign coaches who have lot of interest in the English Premier League. Our fielding coach Trevor Penney is very passionate about Liverpool. We make groups and there is a lot of bantering around,” he said.

Worker’s death halts World Cup stadium construction
","The organisers of the 2014 FIFA World Cup halted construction at the Arena Pantanal stadium in the Brazilian city of Cuiaba due to the death of a worker at the site.
An investigation was launched on Friday following the death of Muhammad Ali Maciel, 32, due to electrocution on Thursday at the stadium while installing lights, reports Xinhua.
According to local labour ministry chief Jose Almeida, construction has been halted until the company responsible for the work, Etel, proves that health and safety standards were met.
“What happened in this sector can also happen in another because procedures might not have been followed. It’s a preventative measure,” Almeida said in a statement released by the public ministry of Brazil’s Mato Grosso state, whose capital is Cuiaba.
According to the ministry, Maciel was performing “a typical” duty without using appropriate safety equipment at the time of the accident.
The incident has raised fresh doubts about whether Brazil’s stadiums will be ready in time for football’s showpiece event, which starts June 12.
Apart from ongoing work on its electric and lighting systems, Arena Pantanal is still awaiting the installation of several thousand seats.
Construction work is also ongoing at Sao Paulo’s Itaquerao stadium, which will host the tournament opener between Brazil and Croatia, and Curitiba’s Arena da Baixada.
Arena Pantanal will host four World Cup group matches, the first being Chile’s clash with Australia, June 13.
