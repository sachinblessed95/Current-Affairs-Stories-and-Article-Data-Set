Fierce like a drag queen
"," We’re all born naked and the rest is drag. Those are lyrics from drag superstar RuPaul’s song ‘Born Naked’ and a line frequently quoted on his show RuPaul’s Drag Race. The words, as per her own declaration, have changed Mumbai-based comedian Supriya Joshi’s life. “It essentially means you can be anybody,” she says right after squealing Miss Vanjie, a famous contestant’s name. “It was like a light bulb moment [when I heard them] and I have never looked back.” The comedian, who was bullied her entire childhood and well into her late teens, accepting her physical appearance took a long journey. It’s one that hasn’t quite ended yet. 
Growing up, Joshi was never exposed to anyone she could relate to in the mainstream. She was constantly bombarded with negativity. “All I heard was that I’m not good, I’m ugly or I’m disgusting,” she reminisces. The message was received and stayed embedded. The constant hammering hasn’t ceded yet. So much so, that there are still days when she doesn’t like how she looks. But thanks to Rupaul’s life lessons, there’s been a shift. “I watched these fat queens [on the show],” she laughs. “All of them are fierce competitors and they love themselves and their bodies.” Joshi will pay it forward this weekend with a talk titled ‘How To Love Yourself When You Are Asked Not To’. As a self-admitted bad planner, there’s no guarantee of Rupaul talk, so you’ll just have to be there to find out. Joshi will, however, talk about her own experiences and engage with the audience. 
As a comedian, she’s often in the spotlight, making her an easy target for Internet trolls. But the barrage of constant insults about her physical appearance though hasn’t dampened her swagger. “I am now at a place where I love my self and I can say it out loud, especially when people like me are expected not to,” she says. “There are so many like me who will hear [that this Sunday] and find strength in that and begin their own journey toward self acceptance and self love.” Reaching out is one of the reasons Joshi, unlike her peers, deliberately makes it a point to document the low moments in her life on social media. 
While her confidence is obvious in our conversation, Joshi’s journey is far from over. The effects of bullying and years of conditioning hardly vanish without a trace. Although her panic attacks have significantly reduced, the social anxiety remains. “I still don’t really like going out that much,” she laughs at how it directly contradicts her chosen profession. “You can be anybody and still feel shitty about yourself.” Nonetheless, she’s hoping to become more approachable as the next step in her journey. And we could all take a leaf out of Joshi’s book parting with words from the very wise RuPaul: 'If you don't love yourself, how in the hell you gonna love somebody else?’ 
Supriya Joshi drops some truth bombs
Start watching Rupaul’s Drag Race, your mind will expand and so will your vocabulary.
Take small steps towards learning who you are and don’t hold yourself back from doing the things you want to do, unless it’s killing somebody. Then you should definitely hold yourself back. 
Who gives a sh** who’s laughing at you? You’ll never see them again. 
Don’t be so hard on yourself. 
If you think ‘I can’t do this because I’m fat and ugly’, then that moment is gone and it will never happen again and you might regret it. 
How To Love Yourself When You Are Asked Not To will take place on Sunday June 10 at Kala Studio, Khar West at 5 p.m. Entry is priced at ₹150; more details at 9892075622

These TV shows bring mental illness to the forefront ","Because the Netflix algorithm has started to know me a little better, earlier this year I was aggressively wooed by two stories in particular: the controversial TV show 13 Reasons Why (whose second season was released recently), and the much lesser-known 2011 documentary The Woodmans, about the life and works of Francesca Woodman, a photography prodigy who committed suicide at 22. Both of these narratives prominently feature themes of anxiety, depression and suicidal tendencies (The Woodmans also throws in the art/artist dichotomy in the mix). They are part of a growing wave of recent films and TV shows that places mental health issues front and centre: BoJack Horseman, Jessica Jones, This Is Us, Shameless, Broad City, Please Like Me and many, many others.
Rewind to the ’90s
This is not surprising by itself: after all, back in the ’90s, after the stigma around HIV-AIDS was beginning to dissipate, we saw a bunch of excellent stories that involved AIDS, including the Tom Hanks classic Philadelphia, or the assorted works of artist and AIDS activist David Wojnarowicz. What is surprising about television in 2018 is that in most cases (This Is Us and Jessica Jones, in particular), the depiction of mental health issues is sensitive, often directly helpful for patients or caregivers. And in several cases, it is conceptualised by writers with first-hand knowledge of, say, the mechanism and physical symptoms associated with a panic attack. Nick Sheff, one of the writers of 13 Reasons Why, wrote a Vanity Fair op-ed not too long ago, defending the show’s treatment of its protagonist Hannah’s suicide (the scene, although well-shot, makes for deeply uncomfortable viewing). Sheff pointed out that the depiction was drawn accurately from the writer’s own suicide attempt — and similar experiences that he knew of.




It is not as if mental health issues were never touched upon by previous generations of filmmakers. But two things held back the quality of these stories. First, the undeniably widespread nature of the stigma against it. Second, the lack of scientific knowledge meant that characters on the entire mental illness spectrum were all painted with the same broad brushstrokes of ‘madness’ or ‘paagalpan’ in the Indian context. Take Beyhadh, the smash hit Sony soap opera of last year, for example: almost every episode has somebody slagging off the show’s villainous leading lady for being a ‘paagal aurat’ (mad woman).
Modern narratives
Today, however, things have changed for the better. The iconic mental health narratives of the ’70s and the ’80s had focussed steadfastly on the ‘covert’ or ‘private’ aspects of mental illness. Stories were set in lunatic asylums (Asylum, One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest), and key scenes invited viewers into the deeply private moments of mentally ill protagonists (think of Robert De Niro’s masterful mirror scenes in Taxi Driver and Raging Bull). The premises of the asylum were very important because the malefactor, the unspeakable mental illness itself, must be ‘contained’ effectively.




The major mental health narratives of the ongoing epoch are, conversely, concerned with the public — the negotiation of public spaces (schools, offices) while being mentally ill. BoJack Horseman must figure out how not to melt down while talking to Charlie Rose on primetime television. Hannah Baker (from 13 Reasons Why) curses the day she read out her confessional poetry (dealing with anxiety and peer pressure, among other things) in private to a friend; she is soon ‘outed’ as an anxious, probably depressed person.
Public vs private
The case of Jessica Jones (from the eponymous show) is the most instructive one. She is a private investigator recovering from PTSD (posttraumatic stress disorder) — on the surface, the kind of person who would never be publicly noticed. It is her business, after all, to be discrete, hidden away. But her other life, that of a superhero, forces her to take on viable threats in an ‘open and notorious’ manner: the climactic battle of the show, notably, is an open-air sequence with the oodles of space emphasised.




Jones must negotiate the outside world and all that it can throw at her, while being mindful of her PTSD. Her best friend and foster-sister Trish Walker’s case is the converse, although it also involves PTSD. Trish is a radio show host and former child actor, a blond, attractive celebrity. She is also a survivor of physical and mental abuse at the hands of her mother. As an adult, therefore, she is secretive, paranoid, almost to the point of being anti-social. Her flat has panic rooms and deadbolts.
For both Trish and Jessica, the public has bled into the private, against a backdrop of mental illness. And that is the primary conflict that reels in viewers: we see our own stories in these characters’ struggle to function in the public sphere.
Trigger warnings
This is not to say that there aren’t missteps along the way. For all its peccadilloes, I found 13 Reasons Why extremely compelling in parts. However, I do agree that Netflix goofed up big time initially, by not tagging the show with trigger warnings. If you are making mental illness one of your show’s draws, it is surely germane to anticipate the impact on your target audience? In this case, we had a show with brutal, unflinching depictions of rape, clinical depression and suicide. And for a while, it was easily accessible to anyone, without a single trigger warning. Thankfully, this was corrected soon after users spotted it and called out Netflix for the oversight.
Closer home, we do have the odd feature film like Margarita With a Straw or A Death in the Gunj, that treats this subject with empathy. But looking at the likes of Beyhadh, it is fair to say that we will not be getting a This is Us or a Jessica Jones of our own anytime soon.

‘13 Reasons Why’ renewed for season three "," Netflix has green lit the third season of its controversial hit series,  13 Reasons Why.
According to The Hollywood Reporter, the teenage drama will return next year with 13 new episodes.
 The announcement comes less than three weeks after the show, one of the most streamed ones on Netflix, returned for its sophomore season. 
 The core cast, including Dylan Minnette, Miles Heizer and Alisha Boe, among others - are all expected to return, except Katherine Langford.
 Langford, who played the lead Hannah Baker, confirmed her exit from the series after its second season bowed out.
 The first season of 13 Reasons Why explored why Hannah committed suicide and the follow-up installment saw the aftermath of her death - her ghostly manifestation for Clay (played by Minnette) or his delusions.
Season two ended with Bryce serving only three months of probation after being arrested on charges of felony sexual assault; gearing up to leave Liberty High School and Clay thwarting a mass shooting at the hands of Tyler - a ticking timebomb. 
Production will resume later this year.

U.S. networks agree to end casting couch ","The largest U.S. actors’ union and the four major television networks on Saturday agreed to limit auditions in private hotel rooms and homes, ratifying a guideline the screen actors’ guild had enacted on its own following the #MeToo uproar, the union said.
SAG-AFTRA, which represents 1,60,000 actors, and management from ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox reached a tentative agreement on a three-year contract that also includes an array of pay increases, the guild said in a statement. 
The networks and union agreed to language similar to that from the union’s own Guideline No. 1, issued in April, which called for an end to auditions, interviews and similar professional meetings in private hotel rooms or at private residences.
SAG-AFTRA President Gabrielle Carteris said at the time the goal was to eliminate the potential for “predators to exploit performers behind closed doors under the guise of a professional meeting.”
The so-called casting couch has long been used by men seeking sexual favours from actors in exchange for roles in films.
The measures followed the industry outrage after news reports of sexual misconduct by Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein were published.

Priyanka Chopra apologises for ‘Indian nationalists’ terror plot in ‘Quantico’ ","Priyanka Chopra apologised for a recent episode in Quantico, following online backlash for the ‘Indian nationalists’ terror plot line in her show.
The 35-year-old actor took to Twitter to clear the air around the episode, titled ‘The Blood of Romeo’, which received a lot of backlash from Indian fans of the show, who criticised her of being a part of the storyline that showed India in a negative light.
Calling herself a “proud Indian”, Chopra said she is “extremely saddened” and that hurting sentiments of people was never her intention.
 
I’m extremely saddened and sorry that some sentiments have been hurt by a recent episode of Quantico. That was not and would never be my intention. I sincerely apologise. I'm a proud Indian and that will never change.

“I’m extremely saddened and sorry that some sentiments have been hurt by a recent episode of ‘Quantico’ That was not and would never be my intention. I sincerely apologise. I’m a proud Indian and that will never change,” she tweeted.
Chopra’s remarks come a day after ABC’s statement where the network apologised for stepping into a “complex political issue” with the latest episode of Quantico, which showed ‘Indian nationalists’ planning to carry out a terrorist attack in Manhattan and frame Pakistan for it days before a summit on Kashmir.
The producers said the actor was not to be blamed for the episode as she did not have a creative control over it.
Chopra, who became the first Indian actor to play a lead role in an American TV series, portrays FBI agent Alex Parrish on the show, which is currently in its third and final season.

Care for some Black magic?
"," He can charm the crowd with a spell, conjure umbrellas from thin air, make things disappear and also dances a fine jig. Magician, illusionist and dancer Alex Black from Russia is a master of all trades. Combining choreography with 3D mapping magic, acrobatics and juggling with comedy and illusions, the magician brings a blend of entertainment in his shows.
Touring the country for the first time with a full-fledged team, Black performed to packed audiences at Sir KP Puttanna Chetty Town Hall over the weekend after which he took time off for a chat with MetroPlus.
Black shows a lot of respect for India and its magical culture. “I do my own version of the rope trick that originated here in India. It is popular abroad. Of course, the original Indian rope magicians used big ropes. Maybe next time I’ll try to use a rope too. India is a great country for magic. People here love it and even fellow magicians from here have seen us and appreciated what we do.”




Black is quick to point out that magic is not like it used to be. Agreeing that pulling a rabbit out of a hat is now child’s play, he says: “Magicians now have to work harder to impress their audience. It’s also important to keep yourself updated on new technology and constantly innovate. Sometimes it is hard to do new things. For me, because this is my life, it comes like second nature. From the time I wake up till I sleep, I’m always trying to create something new magically. I wake up in the morning and think about magic and go to sleep doing the same.”
Black goes on to say that just doing magic is not enough anymore. “Entertainment is the key and you need to bring the full package when you are on stage. If you are not a good performer or you don’t connect with your audience, it can never be a good show. Dance works for me. It is my way of being different.”
He leans in and shares a little secret about his dance act: “Today, just before the show, I think I broke my little toe while practising a stunt. I have it bandaged tight. It hurts, but the show must go on. When you are on stage, what has to happen has to happen.” He continues on how dance became his passion: “I graduated from the Circus University in Saratov, Russia many years ago. That is where we learnt all disciplines from dancing to juggling. That is where dance clicked for me. I’m also a big Michael Jackson fan. He is my inspiration and that is why I do the moonwalk with the iPhone in one of my tricks.”




The 29-year-old says: “When I finished school, my father wanted me to study law since he was a lawyer. However, my calling was magic. I was already doing card tricks and I took my passion to the Circus University. After that, there was no turning back. I got in and put in a lot of hard work for the four-and-a-half years of training there. Soon after, I started my own show that took me across Russia for three years. Then, we took the show abroad, including the US, Germany, Dubai and China. Now I’m happy to be here in India.”
The conjurer points out that he would love to return to India with new tricks. “I’m testing the ground here with a balance of serious stuff and comedy. The blend between entertaining and thought-provoking acts is what makes a show successful. In fact, almost all of our routines have a concept. One thing I strongly propagate is the need for peace and not war.”




Going back to the marriage of technology and magic, Black says he loves to mix and match. “If you are a street magician, you’ll do only street magic. But I try to do everything from street performances to TV shows and close-up sleight-of-hand to dramatic big escapes. It is important for science and magic to work hand-in-hand. One cannot do without the other.”
He adds: “It’s a shame when people open up our secrets. If it’s not your idea, you shouldn’t reveal it. For us this is our livelihood. They are trying to kill the beauty of magic. This, however, pushes us to innovate all the time. It is challenging and we have to change the programme every time someone discloses a secret.”

A date in the dark for Ayushi
"," There are many reasons why Fever FM’s, city-based RJ Ayushi agreed to participate in MTV’s Dating in the dark (DITD). One, she is nictophobic (fear of the dark), afraid of love and wanted to be the first RJ from Hyderabad on a show for MTV. The show, DITD, is a dating reality show that could be a daring adventure to remember or could mean nothing at all to some. Based on the famous international TV show with the same title, DITD gives a chance to three single men and three single women to get to know each other by losing all their inhibitions and trusting their instincts. A group date is set up in the dark, for the singletons to talk to each other, feel each other, smell but certainly not see each other until the time is up.
With the available knowledge and after viewing the international show it wasn’t just Ayushi who was apprehensive. Her team members and family too wanted her to reconsider her decision on entering the show. “I approached the programme heads of the show with my doubts and they assured me that while the idea is the same, the format was planned and designed keeping in mind the Indian sensibilities,” says Ayushi
Assured, Ayushi made up her mind to participate in the show. She was a bundle of nerves and excited at the same time. “I knew I would play my game with words and I wanted to know how and what would my date do to win me. Since we were all in one room and we would require to spend a good amount of time, we were all smelling good,” laughs Ayushi.
On the first day of the show she met the girls in one room and shared a lot of gossip. “Actually that made us look forward to meeting the guys. Falling in love in a day or in a meeting or two is not what I would agree to. Having had not so pleasant experience with love, I had decided to go with my guard on,” says Ayushi.
After the first meet with all the participants, the contestants invite one another for a romantic one-on-one date in the dark. It is all fun and games until it gets real with the contestants finally coming face to face with each other in the revealing process. The participants can touch and feel each other and smell as well, how did Ayushi agree to that, “I touched face and hand. One guy I could tell, works out and had good biceps. The other had a beard and wore beads, so I guessed he was into music. My guess came out right. I was especially impressed with one of the guys who got jelly for me. I also loved the way he spoke, made me feel special,” recollects Ayushi.
Did she allow anyone to feel her, “No, I didn’t let anyone touch my face. I wasn’t ready to ruin my make up and surprisingly the guys were very understanding, “ says Ayushi.
And what happens in the end? “Each episode climaxes with the contestant either meeting their potential partner in the balcony of the house or exiting the house straight through the front doors,” she adds.

Deriving the happiness quotient "," 
Dhanya Varma has scored a perfect 100 and her happiness knows no bounds. Well, when one is anchoring a talk show called The Happiness Project, the happiness has to spill over into the lives of the participants as well. Dhanya, hostess of the show on Kappa TV, which began in October 2017, has hosted 100 guests in her programme, all of which revolved around one’s definition and pursuit of happiness. 
Sharing experiences
“It has been a learning experience that has given me innumerable takeaways. Many of the guests, young and old, newcomers and veterans, have had deep, insightful views to share and each brought in a different USP to the show,” she says. 
It was not only the celebrities who had nuggets of wisdom to share with the viewers. There were pioneers, leaders and survivors, all achievers in one way or the other. 
“For instance, visually challenged Tiffany Brar is not all that well-known to our viewers. We showcased her and her story of courage and it was one of our popular episodes. There was so much one could learn from her. In the same way, Uma Preman has been and continues to be such an inspiration. Her indomitable courage and determination have touched the lives of so many people,” says Dhanya. 
Conceptualised by Sumesh Lal, content head of Kappa TV, the show has a mix of celebrities and bravehearts from different walks of life. Hosted by Dhanya with a great deal of grace, her style of conversation and questions put the guest at ease while they discuss myriad aspects of happiness. “Each guest has his/her happiness quotient. Young actor Kalidas Jayaram pointed out how important it was to spare at least one hour every day for your body. Apparently, his personal physical fitness instructor had impressed him with this simple explanation on the importance of fitness. I thought it was a piece of advice all of us could use. It was such an interesting insight on happiness,” she says over the phone from Kochi, where the full-time, hands-on mother of two lives. 
Refusing to choose a favourite among her guests, she says it would not be fair because all the guests are special and have some kind of inspirational quality or the other. So, how are the guests chosen? “We should feel like talking to them and getting to know them better,” pat comes the answer.
So there was Harish Sivaramakrishnan, lead vocalist of Agam, smiling from ear to ear while talking about the day his daughter was born. That, he said, was the happiest, moment in his life. 
Then there was writer P. Balachandran talking about his tryst with happiness, actor-model Kani reflecting on what keeps her inner light aglow, Nimisha Sajayan on her choices and so on. “V.K. Prakash was another delightful speaker. He says he is able to juggle so many projects because he never wastes time mulling over things. There is so much of positivity and energy about him,” she recalls. 
The only time Dhanya thought she had stumbled was while conversing with musician Shahabaz Aman.
 “It was on a very different level. Although I greatly enjoyed the episode, I wondered how viewers might take it. Later, I was pleasantly surprised when I won a lot of compliments for that particular episode,” she recalls, obviously pleased with the end result. 
She says it is a special privilege to be invited into the personal spaces of the guests. Unlike other interviews where the focus might be on work, family and other issues, in this show, the guest permits viewers to take a peek into his inner self and his mindscape. 
So, where does the show go from here?
“Wait and watch!” she laughs, signing off on a happy note.
(The Happiness Project is telecast on Saturdays at 9.30 pm and on Sundays at 10 am)

How to go crazy: a day at the ‘Bigg Boss’ house before season 2 kicks off "," It was a watershed moment for Oviya’s fans when she left the sets of Bigg Boss last season, citing mental health reasons. Her critics, however, claimed it was all an act and that she was being puppeteer-ed by the show’s producers. I spent one day inside that house, and I must say, I side with Oviya. Jump into the pool? Why, I would have climbed the walls.
Let me go back 24 hours to explain why.
It’s five minutes before I enter the Bigg Boss house and I have been blindfolded. So the burst of colour when I first step into the house is disorienting.




At first glance, the set looks much the same as in the previous season from outside — the house with the Bigg Boss hoarding, the swimming pool to the right, the sofas and treadmill to the left and the synthetic grass. It’s like stepping into a gaudy resort. 
However, there’s one addition: on the right of the entrance is a jail with one iron bed and no mattress. It’s a literal prison inside a figurative one. It remains to be seen which of the presumably volatile participants that Vijay TV has roped in will be sent here for flouting rules.
The interior arrangement has been shuffled around a bit to give it a new look, but essentially has the same rooms: two bedrooms (one looks like a pink bubblegum volcano erupted inside it, coughing up butterfly bodies on the walls), with an additional attached bathroom this time, the kitchen area, the living room area, the seating area facing the television screen and of course, the sci-fi-looking confession room. This is going to be the 15 contestants’ world for the next 100 days, starting this Sunday.
Random projections hang on the wall: gear-props to wallflowers. The table in front of the TV is designed like the face of a watch, as if to mock the contestants’ total ignorance of what the time really is. We were looking at the sun for answers. Imagine living in a drab grey-walled house for 100 days.




Even one day in the House throws up material enough for a two-level study: individual psychology and community anthropology. As the hours pass by, one can make out the introverts, the initiative-taking leaders, the loyal followers, and the non-committal loners.
If you thought Season 1 was the depiction of an invasive totalitarian regime, here’s a fun fact. The cameras in the place have been almost doubled from around 30 to 60. Bigg Boss is watching. From more angles this time.
In 1961, a year after the trial of Nazi war criminal Adolf Eichmann, Stanley Milgram began a series of now-famous experiments that demonstrated the ease with which people submitted to higher authority. The contestants of Bigg Boss are living, breathing proof of that.
Bigg Boss’s low, controlling voice booms out of the speakers: Assemble in the living area, Come to the confession room, Sit down on the sofa, Don’t stand, Don’t sleep. When Bigg Boss says something, you comply; no questions asked.
The most interesting of all is what the human mind can come up with when all their toys — phones, laptops, books, pen, paper, and even literal playthings — are taken away from them. It was a digital detox, a futuristic dystopia set in cavemen times. At least cavemen had rocks.




One of us began fiddling with a water bottle for fun. Soon, that turned into a game of flipping the bottle to make it land vertically without toppling. Once we got bored with that, we took to throwing a hairband as a hoop with the bottle as a target.
By lunchtime, we took the game outside, creating a game of bowling, with four bottles as pins and decorative wooden pebbles as our ball. The most popular ones though were the trustworthy games of catch and cricket that we designed with tissue paper balls and tray bats. In one of our quieter moments, we collectively observed a fly. Yes. A fly.
The most challenging part of Bigg Boss is the complete lack of control over your sleep habits. Every so often, one sleep-deprived journalist, lacking stimulation, would nod off to sleep, only to be forcibly woken by the sound of barking dogs over the speaker. Never in my life did I imagine that I would hate an AR Rahman song when Mersal’s ‘Aalaporaan Thamizhan’ blasted over the speakers in the morning to wake us up. I glared at the cameras glaring at me, until we were locked in a stare match which I lost.
As usual, it took the darkness of the night to draw gossip out of people. It was after lights-out that bonding began, secrets spilling out, one hand covering the mike. The elimination rounds once again proved humans are designed to be social animals. It was the introverts, the ones sitting alone that got eliminated the first.
When we stepped out of the house 24 hours later, and were handed our belongings, the notification tings and bings filled up the room — it was a happy reunion of our phones and us. But more importantly, it was then that I scratched my nose red with impunity, with no cameras around.
Bigg Boss airs on Vijay TV from this Sunday evening at 7 pm. The show runs from Monday to Sunday at 9 pm

Stand up for dad
"," Putting a comic spin on Father’s Day, which is tomorrow, Chennai Comedy presents Laugh off at Backyard, a stand-up show featuring a group of comics who want to take a dig at dads. “The main objective of a themed show is to use the subject being performed as a hook to invite audiences. You sell the concept, as opposed to a comic,” explains Sudarshan Ramamurthy, from Chennai Comedy, a platform aimed at promoting stand-up across the city.
Widening the spectrum
The first wave of stand-up comics in India — think Sorabh Pant, Kanan Gill, Aravind SA and Aditi Mittal — made a splash. But for successors, competition is very stiff. While it is the big names that draw large crowds, themed shows help bring in new audiences for emerging artists. 
“When there’s a specific theme, a new crowd comes in,” shares Akshaya Chittybabu, co-founder of Backyard, which has been hosting stand-up comedy for over a year. “We usually see a recurring crowd when the show is marketed based on the artiste performing,” he shares.
“We had a family of three in our last show, and it was clear that the parents hadn’t watched live stand-up comedy before,” says Ramamurthy. “When the comic talked about not being able to understand his wife, the woman of the family spoke up and said, ‘Let me show you a WhatsApp forward I received about this’. They weren’t heckling; they were just being earnest. These are the people we want to bring into the audience spectrum,” he shares.




Performing for parents
City-based comic Manoj Prabakar, presenting the closing performance for the evening, says theme-based shows place some pressure on the comic to write content revolving around a specific subject, like Father's Day. “Most comics taking the stage now are in their 20s. The way they look at comedy is very different from those in our parents’ generation. So it’s often difficult to crack an older crowd,” he shares.
In 2016, Bengaluru-based Arnav Rao quit his career as a lawyer in the Madras High Court to pursue stand-up comedy full time. “Since my father is currently paying my rent, I don’t think I should make jokes about him,” chuckles Rao, who will be hosting the show. “As a host, your job profile shifts a little. You need to break the room to warm up the audience for the performing comics, and if someone doesn’t do well, it’s your job to bring the energy back to the room. As a comedian, one of the skill sets you develop is to gauge the room and improvise accordingly. The beauty of stand-up comedy is that you can lie, embellish and exaggerate for effect,” he adds.

'Black Spot': a potpourri of mystery and mysticism ","Streaming services are really the friends you need right now, for they unearth treasures and bring them to your desktop or mobile screens. Can your real friends do that? I don’t think so.
Until a week ago, I hadn’t heard of the French series Black Spot. I had no clue of its existence. I stumbled on it, quite fortunately if I may say so, on Amazon Prime and binge-watched the eight-hour crime drama with frequent breaks between the episodes. By the end of the show, I was tired and thirsty, but it was worth it.
Black Spot brought several gritty images from another acclaimed European show, The Bridge, before my eyes. The multi-season, no holds barred, gut-puncher of a series set a bar of sorts for solving crimes on television. The cases, like in Black Spot, weren’t the regular ones. They were as dark as the night could get.




The French offering, created by Mathieu Missoffe, charts its own course and emerges as a fitting addition to the growing popularity of the genre. For a show of this nature, there isn’t too much blood, or gore, on-screen. And that’s a willing diversion the makers seemed to have taken. The magical strokes are mostly in the details (in the revelations, to be precise).
Unlike psychopathic killers that populate the landscape of detective-thrillers, the murderers here apologize for their acts – the truck driver who kills his wife and buries her in the garden just outside his house, the rape victim who shoots down her attacker after she’s denied justice through the legal system, and so on. Closer home, Tamil filmmaker Mysskin uses this trope to convey the inability of the characters to do anything else at those particular moments.
The killings are usually tied to emotional reasons rather than monetary gains. This emotion – deprived of cinematic grandiloquence – works excellently as it humanizes the proceedings. If you think Game of Thrones kills characters in every episode, you should devote a minute to the number of heinous deaths that occur in Villefranche (a small fictional town where the entire action takes place).
The huge trees in Villefranche’s forest that cover the land and the sky might remind you of the heavenly escapades in Kerala, but you shouldn’t get fooled by its façade. While the green belts of the Western Ghats hold natural beauty in their long arms, the mystic grey forest in Black Spot resembles a mini version of hell. The forest has secrets nobody has the answers for, and dead bodies nobody knows how they ended up there.




The series, unusually, begins and ends with the case of the disappearance of the Mayor’s daughter. However, it isn’t the only case that Laurène Weiss (Suliane Brahim), the town’s sheriff, is busy looking into as every hour has a mysterious element tucked into it. Laurène acts on her instincts, and relies little on the facts and the accounts of witnesses she’s presented with. Her methods wouldn’t have gotten an A+ by Sherlock Holmes, but that doesn’t matter as her instincts have always pointed toward the right direction.
Black Spot will appear like an anthology, at first, if you don’t pay attention to it. It might also get a bit confusing since the sub-plots and the case of the missing girl aren’t related. It takes some time to get adjusted to the show’s writing. And, though, Brahim stars as the lead, almost every actor has got something important to do. From the District Attorney (Laurent Capelluto), who drops in to collect information about the Mayor and his misdeeds, to the town’s doctor (Naidra Ayadi) who performs autopsies, all the characters are well-defined.
The second season is currently under production, and I hope they take Laurène Weiss’s character to uncharted waters in it.

In a fantasy zone ","“I wouldn’t worry too much about the consequences. I choose to do whatever makes me happy.” This is Karishma Tanna’s response when asked if artists should alert and mindful of the social consequences of their art. Karishma has just returned to television serial space with Naagin 3 (Colors) and will now be seen in Qayamat Ki Raat on StarPlus. In the horror series, which is about a young couple and the ordeal they have to face because of a tantrik’s curse, Karishma plays the role of Gauri alongside Vivek Dahiya who plays her on screen partner. 
“I didn’t have to think too much before accepting the show because it is produced by Balaji, the place I had begun my journey from. I didn’t want to do a regular daily soap and Qayamat provided just the opportunity. It is a bi-weekly show where you can’t afford to drag the storyline.” 
A huge fan of horror genre, Karishma lists Chucky and The Exorcist amongst her favourites. She feels that after a really long time a good fantasy thriller is being narrated on the small screen and is hopeful about a positive reception. Inspired by the Ramsay style of horror, international make-up artists have been roped in to employ prosthetics.
On Naagin, a show which has been panned by the critics as regressive and perpetuating superstition, Karishma, who showed her opinionated side in Bigg Boss, says, “We are only trying to entertain people. People know that there can’t be a ‘rakshas’ in real life or that a person cannot possibly turn into a snake. People should watch the show, get entertained and not think too much about it.” 
Life is hectic for the young actor who is juggling between two T.V shows but she is not complaining. However, if she were to have a day to while away, watching television is one of her options. And her choice, interestingly, is Netflix. She opines that Indian television has a long way to go before it can hope to be at par with international television shows. Having said that, she adds, “There is only so much you can experiment as after all human emotions remain the same. We try to portray those emotions within different storylines.”

Quest for the unknown ","An animal lover since childhood, Nigel Marven is one of those fortunate ones who manage to turn their passion into their profession. The renowned television presenter, producer and author has anchored several nature-related shows such as Ten Deadliest Snakes with Nigel series, Untamed China, Wild Colombia and Jaguar Adventure. 
He is now back on Animal Planet with Nigel Marven’s Wild Philippines, a three-part series that takes a close look at the flora and fauna of the archipelago. What makes the series special is that some of the species on show have never been captured on camera before. 
In an interaction, Nigel talks about the series, importance of conservation and the need to involve local communities in preserving the environment.
Excerpts:
How did the series come into being?
Earlier I had done a programme for Discovery called Ten Deadliest Snakes which was shot in India and Philippines besides other countries. While making this programme, I realised that there were so many extraordinary animals in Philippines, many of which have not been filmed before. So I decided to bring them in this show. We start with the Luzon island, where the capital Manila is located. We explore corals and the endangered Philippine crocodile there. Next is Palawan, located in the west and close to Borneo, and here we see special animals including a giant pitcher plant – a insect eating plant inside which we found a dead rat. Although there are thousands of islands, we took up the seven largest ones.
The show covers from tarantulas to eagles, amazing coral reefs, tarsier, a nocturnal monkey which eats insects, colourful birds, whale sharks, some of which are 10 metres long and feed on the shrimps, among others. We also shot an amazing procession of buffaloes in the town of Pulilan, in which they are of them are painted and walked through the town to pass by a church for farmers to pay their respect to the shrine. The series has several plants and animals never seen before and that is precisely what is exciting about it.
What new species will the global audience get to see in this show?
I have already mentioned about the tarsier. One will see tarantulas which glows blue in the torch light, a number of birds never shown before, including a colourful peacock. Exploring the coral reefs, we watch some unique underwater life. Among the birds we will showcase the world’s largest eagle, the Philippine eagle which the country’s national bird. It is critically endangered and is being bred in captivity. Interestingly, the eagle grows to become so large and powerful that it is able feed on monkeys. I end the show with an eagle on my hand.
Apart from this we get to see the Philippine sailfin lizard which runs on water making those scenes extraordinary. Then there are some amazing snakes, including a cobra in lovely golden colour. Taking to the waters, I dive with the whale sharks, one of the largest fish in the sea, and handle a sea krait. We also shot a seahorse, pink in colour, and it looks fantastic. One last thing I would like to add, which is extraordinary and would be loved by the audience, are the tamaraw or the Mindoro dwarf buffalo, whose habitat is found in high mountains. 
Share with us the challenges and dangers faced while shooting the series
The main challenge was that of the budget. We had to be very sure that we are going to find the animals at the right place and time and that required intensive research. Filming thresher sharks which have long tails in deep waters was indeed challenging. That was first time in my life I saw a thresher shark.
As regarding dangers, there weren’t too many. Over the years I have learnt to take calculated risks. Having said that, I would like to add that more people die driving four-wheelers on the road than because of attacks by animals.
Tell us about some of your unforgettable moments while making the show
One was the experience with the thresher shark. I was sitting on the edge when this shark came out of the blues towards me. Another was the buffalo festival in Pulilan in which I saw for the first time water buffaloes in such large numbers in a procession. Besides, these, filming mountain buffaloes will always remain etched in my mind. Last but not the least is the truly amazing experience of Philippines eagle sitting on my hand. 
Do you think the series will add to conservation awareness?
I hope it to create awareness both globally and locally amongst people about the rich flora and fauna of the Philippines and how important it is to conserve it. The main issue there is the loss of rain forests since its unchecked destruction will result in loss of their national bird, the eagle. The region is endowed with some of the best coral reefs in the world like the Tubbataha one which we have shown. 
It is well patrolled by the rangers who are very strict with enforcing laws. That is the reason why there are so many fishes there. It is one of the best places I have ever dived.
How can we strike a balance between development and conservation?
That is definitely an important issue to be addressed and one hopes that people realise that there is a need to integrate development and conservation. We need to emphasise that protection of ecology is always beneficial for the present generation and the future one. This is where one needs to replicate the Indian example, where a network of national parks have been created to protect environment. It is not just the laws but their strict implementation that is must. In the Philippines there is a move to save the rain forests and it is bound to pay dividends considering that the logging companies are not as powerful as they used to be. 
How important is the involvement of local communities in conservation?
That is of vital importance and that is what will sustain the conservation in the long run. Protected areas yield revenue as it attracts wildlife enthusiasts, natural life photographers and international and domestic tourists. This boosts the local economy generating employment and business. The crux is that forest and wildlife protection pays in the long run. Also forests yield a lot in terms of food and fuel that can be used by the local communities.

Subtle tones
"," “All along the history of arts, artistes have been struggling to liberate themselves. If someone says ‘you have to sing with this many words’, I will make sure I sing with much lesser. I will try and escape from as many words as possible. If I am told ‘you have to stick to this rhythm’, I will move far away from it in an attempt to create something different. Rules and rituals get created. Centuries go by, and they keep changing. The history of arts means a never ending struggle between those make rules and those who seek to break them. It is a relentless battle. How else will one experience the sweetness of creative freedom? Rules are important. They have been devised by great scholars, and nobody intends to abandon them. It is not possible either. Moreover, an artiste cannot achieve anything by violating rules totally. His search for freedom moves in a different route. That is where the new styles blossom.” In one of his lectures on music, the eminent, but less-known Bhaskar Chandavarkar made the above observations. These, are not general observations about a tradition and how an artiste negotiates with it, it is also Chandavarkar’s own, personal negotiations. If there was something very unique to this composer, it was his deep understanding of the various systems of music, and how he, in the most inconspicuous way, found his autonomy without cutting away from it.
Chandavarkar learnt from Pt Ravi Shankar, and one sees in his music the great impact that the legendary figure made on him. He met Ritwik Ghatak fairly early in his life with whom he went to FTII, getting introduced to the best of world cinema. “I then served a longish stint as a teacher at the FTII, also learning the craft of cinema in order to teach my students better. For me, making music transcends the fundamental research demanded by every project and also involves looking at the internal structure of the film itself — the script, camera movement, editing, and so on. I feel this is where my FTII teaching experience comes in handy,” Chandavarkar had said an interview. 
This is indeed true of his music. Though Chandavarkar followed the Western style of making film music – in terms of motifs and the nature of composing – he produced a sound quality that was truly Indian. There are hardly any instances of Bhaskar Chandavarkar using elaborate orchestra, in terms of the number, say 25 violins. His expression was subtle: it always worked complementary to the narrative, never literal as was the case with most background scores. Ondanondu Kaladalli, for which he made music, is remarkable. The extraordinary background score, its perfect folk idiom, the use of the folk drum and flute is mesmerizing. It is said that when Satyajit Ray watched the film, he was struck by its music and when Aparna Sen invited him to compose music for her film Paroma, Ray told her that he had found a “better music director” than him, which was Bhaskar Chandavarkar. 
Listen to his music in Thodasa Roomani Ho Jaaye or Maya Darpan or Kandahar – Chandavarkar paints abstract colours. There is nothing that you can predict in his music: shorn of grandeur and embellishment, it takes a self-reflective route. A composer who was intimately connected to theatre, Bhaskar Chandavarkar believed in constructing a new music theory. “There is that mechanical path where you drag art to fit into the rasa theory. Instead, why can’t we expand rasa theory to suit different expressions of art? When you expand theory it remains contemporary. Similar to expanding the meaning of words to keep a language relevant. The only way for art and the individual to survive is to go on enlarging theoretical meanings.”
In today’s world of hybridity, Chandavarkar may sound insipid. To understand his music, one must be tuned to the silences of one’s culture.

‘The perfect shot showcases pure, raw, unfiltered emotion and intensity,’ says Shitabh Pillai
"," Walking into a gig, photographer Shitabh Pillai doesn’t know what to expect. But on recceing the site, he starts to read the atmosphere, the crowd, the performers and the venue’s employees — that alone sets the tone for the next few hours of frenzy.
In his early days in 2013, the Chennaiite tried to establish himself by being a one-man marketing machine, explaining, “I used to play drums so that pull towards the music scene was very natural. I went to my first gig where Retrospect were playing and I can recall the utter chaos. So whatever pictures were good to me, I’d send them directly to the bands on Facebook. Concert photography is oriented around social media; the way I click something, it’s to preserve and provide a memory. Initially, from people and bands, I’d gotten a lot more criticism.” The 24 year-old observes not much of a city-based community of this realm of photography, explaining there aren’t a lot of people who’d work gigs for a living. 
Discovered a year ago by music events manager Mayur Jalan at a show in Fubar, Shitabh who’d long been working the gig scene was finally catapulted into a whole new calibre of photography. His parents have been his biggest supporters, for which he is grateful.




The equipment
As expected, Shitabh’s gear is as adapted for the gig scene as he is. Tight spaces, moving subjects and very low lighting is part of the package. “I’m constantly switching lenses. In the beginning, it was a nightmare where I’d shoot from the front and the back of a venue, very typical shots. Over the years, I realised I can do that with one lens instead of two. Right now I’m using an ultra-wide lens where if I stand even an inch away from you, I can capture the walls around you, the crowds around you, everything. That’s really advantageous in a small space.” The self-proclaimed product junkie stays up-to-date with the latest in the tech realms, exploring his social media feeds for new information and new styles. “I particularly am a fan of Jared Polin, but I also keep in mind to explore other types of photography which inspires what I snap at gigs, mimicking intensity.” 
Expect strong contrasts and pops of colour in Shitabh’s photos, creating an edgy blend of grit and glamour.




All about environment
So, besides the right gadgets, what does it take to prosper in such a niche subculture? “Adaptability,” the 24 year-old says promptly, “You need to bloom where you’re planted: you have to consider the crowd’s attitude, the management’s strategies, and so on. There have been managers who have run up to me, held me and prevented me from taking photos at certain angles because of where I was standing. The Moonshine Project, though, is a great venue for my work because the management is encouraging. One time, I had to stand on a table and while I was clicking away, I saw the owner running up to me and then he held me by the legs and, to my surprise, said ‘take the photo!’ The perfect shot for me, which I have achieved a few times thankfully, is one that showcases pure, raw, unfiltered emotion and intensity. I’ve captured a man lick a band member’s guitar, lots of memorable head-banging, and kids watching their parents play too.”




For the most part, there is a symbiotic relationship between concert photographers and the bands they shoot. Shitabh, through his photographs, never portrays an objective angle; his goal is to capture raw emotion — be it in multitudes or in the singular. “Skrat from Chennai are a band which can really get a crowd going, let me enjoy the show and let me capture great moments. That’s something that never happens to me.”
Crowd perception to concert photography has evolved too. Shitabh says when he would go on stage to snap a couple of shots, he would get heckled by the crowd, but now he is pushed to take pictures by the crowd itself. “I used to get really irritated when I first started, I’d reprimand them for being awful to me. I was young then and later I grew to understand they’re not in their senses.”
A year from now Shitabh hopes to take his shows on the road, and go on tour with a band, capturing the varying lifestyles on and off the stage. He’s got the world’s stages in his lens and is excited to contribute what he can to the music world he loves so unconditionally.

Web TV by and about Kannadigas "," Entertainment today come in various avatars. The competition out there has made creators come up with various ideas to capture the market. 
The latest to join the entertainment bandwagon is Sirinadu, a Web TV channel, exclusively by Kannadigas about Kannadigas.
The founders Rajashekar Kambar, Sangam Dev and GN Rajashekara Naidu Gudibande, launched the channel officially. “It can be watched on a smart TV or by downloading the app on your mobiles. I would call it an Infotainment channel as we will have programmes that not only entertain but are also informative,” explains Kambar. 




The channel kickstarts with programmes such as Nivedana (a bhakti programme by well-known scholar Dr Bannanje Govindacharya), Mane mane ruchi (a cookery show), Ruchi Vilasa which will feature chefs sharing their recipes, Book Nodi book (featuring newly published Kannada books each week), Bhale Bhale (showcases the adventurous feats by Kannadigas across the state), Hale ruchi hosa Bage (traditional recipes with a twist). 
“This is the first effort in Kannada. You have Netflix and others in English, but, we wanted a Kannada streaming platform because we want to cover a wide range of topics. It will be a platform to present our culture, heritage along with issues related to farmers and women,” adds Gudibande. 
They assure us that they will telecast original programmes and “not repeat shows from regular TV channels. We will be creating our own content. There will not be daily news, but we sure will cover politics. The idea is to bring dominant issues to your finger tips with short programmes, which will not cross the 12-minute limit,” explains Kambar. 
“Mobile media should be brisk, short and snappy. People don’t want to use up their data. So we as a channel have understood what they want. Hence relevant issues will be to the point,” adds Gudibande. 
The channel will not have celebrities as its face nor will they host any programmes as “we cannot afford to pay them”. Nor will they telecast films but will cover film news. “Especially, those with new ideas and themes. We want to laud young filmmakers for their efforts, and the freshness they are bringing in with their ideas and experimental cinema. Sirinadu will be a platform to promote them too,” says Gudibande.
Kambar adds that in the future they may plan for a few web series too. Sirinadu, which has taken off, is free and can be downloaded as an app from Google playstore. It will be available on Android, IOS and online on www.sirinadu.com

Get set to LOL
"," Zee Kannada will telecast the grand finale of its comedy reality show Comedy Khiladigalu Season 2!
This time, the show will be telecast live from Bijapur. The show has garnered enough attention because of its panel of judges — Jaggesh, Yograt Bhat and Rakshita. 
The finalists of the show are Appanna, Manu Madenoor, Mantanna, Sadhanandh, Suraj, Vani Chenaraya Patanna, Surya, Barkath Ali, Chidambar Raunchier and Raghu. The finale will be hosted by Master Anand. 
Jaggesh, who is looking forward to the release of 8mm is thrilled to be a part of this reality show. 




In between shoots, he takes time off to talk to Metroplus over the phone. “This show is a complete family entertainer. It has completed two successful seasons and we have discovered some of the best comedians here. The good news is that they are already acting in films.” The actor then lauds the channel’s effort to create such platforms for budding actors adding, “Comedy is difficult. The dialogues, the punch, the timing and body language, all have be coordinated in a split second. It is easier to hurt people and make them cry rather than make them laugh. Laughter is the best medicine and has positive effects on one’s health, so my message by being a part of this show is to tell people keep laughing and smiling, no matter what life throws at you. The best part of laughter and comedy is that it has no age limit.”
Jaggesh, is now an experimental spree and has landed himself a role in Shruti Naidu’s Premier Padmini, with Bollywood actor Madhoo and Sudha Rani. 
“Yes, I feel like trying out something new at this age and am glad that Comedy Khiladigalu Season 2 has presented me as a comedian to the younger generation,” states the actor.
The grand finale will be telecast on June 24 at 6 pm on Zee Kannada

On stage, exams must be more than memory
"," About fifteen thousand dance and music learners appear every year for exams conducted by Karnataka Secondary Education Examination Board (KSEEB) under various categories all over the State. Karnataka has been the only State in the country to have had the tradition of holding cultural exams at such an enormous scale. It has almost become customary for learners in most cultural institutes in the State to apply for these exams after they are adequately trained. While most gurus acknowledge the constitution of these exams for a variety of reasons, they equally observe serious impediments that are hindering their quality and propagation. The Hindu strikes a conversation with some of the noted Bharatanatyam, Kuchipudi, Carnatic music and percussion gurus and learners in Bangalore on the state, working and the relevance of exam in these performing arts. 
Serious practise of any performing art can be done without an examination system in place, as the legendary masters did in the earlier times. “But the idea of exam helps children get more engrossed in the art,” says Harini N.R. who teaches Carnatic music at the Percussive Arts Centre, Jayanagar. As children in their young age would not have developed sincere inclination towards anything in particular, it is easier to make them concentrate, learn and remember in the name of exam, she feels. “It sets a time-frame for students within which they are required to master a set of things prescribed by the syllabus. This streamlines learning which otherwise would take its own time depending on the student’s interest and calibre,” observes Harini, under whose guidance about 70 students have so far written junior and senior exams in Carnatic vocal category. 




“When it comes to performing arts, what is visible to the bare eyes is just the performing part of it. Students are astonished to know that there exists ‘theory’ for dance too!” observes budding Kuchipudi danseuse Prateeksha Kashi. It is the aspect of theory, emphasised by these exams, that acts as an eye-opener for many, including parents, she says. “When they take up junior exams, children realise that like any other subject they study in school, dance too is a discipline in itself and as expansive as the ocean,” she adds.
Another aspect that the dance exams make students learn is the application skills. For example, she explains, “though students would have tried out many hastas in adavus or items, when they get to know why these mudras are used, they begin to think.”




“It is not that teachers do not impart knowledge about dance, its various forms, styles, lineage of gurus and more in the regular classes, they do, at least those who are committed to disseminate their art form. But most of it gets dispersed in the air,” says Prateeksha. Only when the students have had the experience of attending one of these examinations, they pay heed to what is being taught, she feels. Therefore, for Prateeksha, exams have been responsible for transforming the attitude of some children which otherwise would have been an arduous task to achieve. “If some pay attention to their anga shuddi, others make sure they know the meaning of the sahitya they are dancing for, which are changes to be desired in any learner,” she states from the experience she has had at Shambhavi School of Dance, Kengeri.
As the performing items are often different from the traditional ones, a student of dance will get to learn the full margam of a particular style of dance, says a student who has given her senior exam in Bharatanatyam this year. 
As far as syllabus is concerned, the gurus state that it has been quite challenging at every level as it has been revised regularly by the luminaries in each field.




No doubt the intention of these exams which is to promote dance and music forms, provide job opportunities in public and private sector is a noble thought and has translated itself in the lives of many artistes by playing a prominent role in their career in performing arts, there are some systemic issues to be addressed by the Board, feel eminent gurus. 
The problem, firstly, is in the infrastructure and administration, points out Kiran Subramanyam, an established Bharatanatyam teacher. The practical exams are conducted in elementary school classrooms that are badly maintained. “Hygiene and aesthetics are essential for a dance presentation and that forms dignity for the art,” he claims. 
Over the decades, there has been a drastic reduction in the number of senior teachers as examiners. “The disrespectful treatment coupled with meagre remuneration has made many experts not to engage with the Board,” informs Kiran. 
As a result, the quality of experience that the student is required to undergo during the exam gets diluted, observes Kuchipudi exponent Vyjayanthi Kashi. Recalling her own experience of being watched by personalities as tall as U.S. Krishna Rao during the exams conducted by Sangeet Natak Academy, she reveals, “remembering those moments of dancing in front of them, still brings goosebumps for me.” For Vyjayanthi Kashi, the ambience of the room which includes the examiners should be a lifetime experience for anyone attempting this exam. It should be considered nothing less than an arangetram, she adds.
“Given the lack of engagement of senior gurus, the Board is forced to employ those who have just passed vidwat, as examiners for the coming year’s vidwat exam or a senior pass student to sit as an examiner for junior exam,” observes eminent mridangist T.A.S. Mani. He argues that they might have excelled in performance but in order to ask questions in the capacity of an examiner needs years of teaching experience.
For this reason, in Vyjayanthi’s observation, many well-known artistes do not send their own children and students to these exams as they are not convinced of the credibility of the examiners. 
“I have even heard that inexperienced examiners sometimes ridicule students which makes them feel embarrassed and rejected,” states Mani, who has trained hundreds of professional percussionists in India and abroad. 




Mani who has been imparting music education since five decades through Karnataka College of Percussion along with his wife Ramamani, famous vocalist, makes a couple of suggestions for the enhancement of quality of music exams. 
“Every year the committee should meet to verify the application of examiners and appoint adept judges for practical exams. The committee should make sure that the examiners are remunerated adequately and rotated once in two years,” he says. The involvement of prominent gurus to appoint examiners will not only regulate quality but institutionalises the process, keeping favouritism and corruption at bay, feel students.
Other than aiding to gain mastery over the art forms, the music exams lead the way for many to become art teachers in government and private schools. In addition to this, Kiran Subramanyam proposes that students who have passed such exams should be recognised for their extra skills during their higher education as in the US where certain credits are allocated for any special training. “This would take the music exams to a totally different level,” he adds.

‘Bigg Boss’ on Malayalam television
"," 
Sixteen contestants, 100 days, one big house and… all eyes. As Bigg Boss Malayalam, hosted by Mohanlal premières this Sunday (June 24), the Malayali audience will get a look at celebrities going to stay under the same roof for over three months in a show of camaraderie and battle of wits. Cut off from the rest of the world, the “housemates” will be seen and judged only through the eagle eyes of cameras as the ‘Bigg Boss’ acts as the conscience-keeper between the participants and the audience. The show is modelled on the Dutch reality game show Big Brother.
Once in, the house becomes ‘the world’ for the contestants. “They hand over their belongings and every single accessory sealed in a basket before setting foot in the house. All 16 contestants are then safely ‘locked’ in by the host in the opening day. They live together in the same house under the same conditions doing different things and it gets as real as it can. This is a show where you don’t have any retakes,” says Reghu Ramachandran, senior vice-president of Asianet.
With no access to newspaper, cable television, Internet or mobile phones in line with the show’s format, the contestants’ only door to the outside world is through the Bigg Boss. “Their only connect to the outside world will be through the ‘voice’. All the contestants, once they enter the house as the show starts rolling, are supposed to be a family. Everyone only sees each other as they wake up every day. But that’s where the unpredictability comes in. We wait and see how they start regarding each other as the show progresses and how they nominate for a co-participant’s eviction,” says Reghu.
The host “appears” before them, of course only virtually, twice a week for eviction nominations and “confessions”, and unbeknown to the contestants, eliminations are based on “voting” from the audience. “Voting lines through SMS and online voting will be open for the public till the last minute of the eviction on a particular week. Ultimately, it’s the show’s followers who get to decide who goes out on a weekly basis until the last man standing,” says Hafiz Shamsudeen, associate creative head of the show.
At the film city in Mumbai, better known as Dadsaheb Phalke Chitranagri, the stage is set. Purpose-built in about 40 days for an “undisclosed budget”, the fully furnished “isolated house” is tailor-made to host the 16 dwellers. Brainchild of architect Shyam Bhatia, who has previously worked with Bigg Boss Hindi and Bigg Boss Kannada, the house itself is a work of art with a kitschy interior décor and a sophisticated “behind-the-scenes” monitoring system that incorporates a comprehensive network of cameras and microphones to capture each and every movement and sound.
The Bigg Boss house comes with a single large hall in the middle that triples up as living room, dining area and kitchen. Two separate large bedrooms with glass partitions for male and female contestants adjoin. Separately, there’s a pool, a gym area and ‘smoking area’ outside. The highlight is the ‘confession room’, where the housemates get to “speak and confess” to the Bigg Boss. This is also where they put in their nominations for elimination. 
A touch of Kerala
Artworks display a mix of the experimental and the traditional. “We wanted the experiences, the life, the wonder and the pleasures of Kerala on a canvas and we have tried to capture this through the intricate interior artworks and murals, especially on the bedroom walls. We have also represented the traditional art forms of Kerala there. The idea is that the contestants will become conscious of the artwork around and hopefully this will reflect in their behaviour too, though physically they stay miles away from the State,” explains Shyam. The experimental part comes in on the flooring and ceiling. “They are done in a triangular-chequered pattern. There’s a lot of research work that went into their conceptualisation. You’ll know all that one you see the house for yourself on Sunday,” says Shyam with a chuckle.
Keeping round-the-clock watch on the contestants are about 60 cameras, both wall-mounted and hand-held ones fixed on trolleys. Each contestant will also be wearing a lapel microphone, except when sleeping or taking a shower. “The entire house is encircled by a camera gulley on the other side of one-sided mirrors. The housemates cannot see these cameras but we see them all the time. If any member of our technical crew has to enter the camera gulley, we follow a dress code of black to avoid any possibility of detection by the contestants,” says Shounak Ghosh, director of the production control room. Replenishment of provisions are done at a ‘store room’ and contestants are informed of re-fuels via ‘alarm bells.’
However, the biggest surprise will be the contestants, and the makers of the show are keeping the list as a guarded secret until the première. “But rest assured, it’ll be a mixed gang and for the first season of the show, we can expect only Malayali contestants,” says Hafiz, while indicating with a smile that that is all the information he’s ready to provide for the time being.
 Bigg Boss Malayalam season 1 premières this Sunday. The show will be telecast Monday to Friday 9.30 pm and Saturday and Sunday 9 pm on Asianet.

Ed Harris’ field of dreams
"," It is ironic that Ed Harris picked a film on a dying technology to make his foray into the world of Netflix. Yet, it is a paradox that best explains the actor: marching into the future with values of the past. His character in the 2017 Netflix drama Kodachrome has a bone to pick with the obsolescence of modern technology. Harris plays Benjamin, a terminally-ill photographer who takes a road trip with his son (Jason Sudeikis) to the last lab still developing Kodachrome film to develop photographs. “I’m glad we shot [Kodachrome] on film,” he says, over a phone conversation from Malibu, California. “The feeling of film — the texture and the way it is shot — I just find it more immediate and more involving with the crew.” While he concedes that digital is more accessible and simpler, allowing young filmmakers to experiment, he is quick to remind me: that “I’m still old-fashioned in that sense.” 
Over four decades in Hollywood, Harris — who plays the “Man in Black” in the dystopian sci-fi television series Westworld — has appeared in over 70 films, earned two Golden Globes and four Academy Award nominations, been part of innumerable stage performances, and even dabbled with producing and screenwriting. “I started out wanting to become the best actor that I could,” recalls the 67-year-old actor about the start of his career in the mid-’70s, where he performed in small Los Angeles theatres and appeared in television shows. His big screen debut came in 1978 with Coma. He has, since then, proved his chameleonic ability to inhabit any character, with memorable roles in films like Nixon (1992), A Beautiful Mind (2001), and Snowpiercer (2013).




Introduced to the life and work of artist Jackson Pollock by his father, Harris carried the story with him for a decade before he made his directorial debut with Pollock (2000), Essaying the titular character, he portrays the tortured, alcoholic artist with a melancholic charm. “The whole directing thing came about mainly because I had worked so hard and long on the project, and the directors I had spoken to had their own ideas, so I didn’t want to hand it over to anyone,” recounts the actor. 
Since then, Harris has only directed one more film: Appaloosa (2008). “I hope to direct [again] this coming August, if I work out the finances, so I am very excited about that possibility,” he shares.
Indie-strong
Harris’œuvre, with its brooding roles and bold choices in indie cinema, has famously earned him the reputation of the “thinking person’s sex symbol”, even as he continues to receive mainstream attention for his role in Westworld, the Anthony Hopkins-starrer set in a futuristic amusement park.




With an enigmatic character, the Internet is, of course, rife with geeky theories and interpretations about Harris’ role in the show. “I know a lot is written about it, and I am glad people are fascinated, but I don’t pay any attention to it, to tell you the truth,” he confesses. What fascinates the actor more is the show’s behind-the-scenes rhythm, where directors keep rotating, and where self-destructing scripts battle spoilers. “By the end of the second season, there were certain days when you had three to four crews shooting different portions, maybe five different episodes [at once],” shares Harris. 
Evergreen acting
Even with the rapid changes that the film industry has experienced during his career, for this veteran, the craft of acting remains the same as it was four decades ago. “I just hope I am getting better at what I do,” he says modestly, adding, “But the nature of film and theatre, — of inhabiting a character, of penetrating material and getting to the deepest place you can with your character — that hasn’t changed at all.” Yet, technology in the age of streaming and binge-watching has certainly evolved, and Harris’ films have periodically commented on the transformation. Take for instance, Peter Weir’s The Truman Show, which analysed the rise of simulated reality and reality television at the fag end of the last century, or even Westworld, which casts an eye on the darker side of artificial intelligence and robots. “The progress happening in the world of technology is unbelievable and so fast that it is outpacing human ability to deal with it. Sometimes it is frustrating,” says Harris.




Looking beyond
In his long career, Harris has worked with a range of acclaimed directors. Some, like Polish director, Agnieszka Holland. have become long-time collaborators. “I’ve done three films with her and I really love [her] as a human being and director,” he says and proceeds to mention Ron Howard and Peter Weir among his favourites. After watching Spike Jonez’s 2009 film, Where the Wild Things Are, Harris wrote a letter to the director saying “I wish to work with you some day”, a hope that he still harbours, given that retirement is not in sight for the actor. He has so much more to do, including working with Martin Scorsese and Steven Spielberg, he insists, reminding me of the scene from Pollock, where, in answer to a question about when a painting is truly complete, the artist says, “How do you know when you're finished making love?”

'Killing Eve' review: a delightfully witty spin on a usually gruesome genre
","I stumbled upon the British comedy, Crashing, a couple of years ago — a sitcom about 20-somethings living on the premises of a defunct hospital. Apart from the wacky setting, the show had some of the most dysfunctional characters I’d seen, and some outrageous sequences. The lead character, and creator, a woman named Phoebe Waller-Bridge, went on to create and play the titular role in Fleabag — another comedy about a damaged protagonist. Both these shows were star-making turns for Waller-Bridge who, as writer, thrives on giving a bizarre twist to the most mundane occurrences.
Waller-Bridge’s latest work as writer/creator is on BBC America’s show, Killing Eve, an adaptation of Luke Jennings’ novella series, Codename Villanelle, about the battle of wits between an MI5 officer, Eve Polastri, and a contract killer, Villanelle. I haven’t read any of Jennings’ novellas, but Waller-Bridge’s quirky, feminist stamp is unmissable.
The first refreshing aspect here is that both, the detective and the killer, are women (female detectives, in fact, are a norm on shows like The Fall and Top of the Lake, but the antagonist is almost always a man). Gruesome murders, inter-departmental rivalry, and the fear and paranoia attached to other serial killer dramas are all part of Killing Eve’s DNA. But even while keeping these familiar tropes alive, Waller-Bridge makes the genre seem fresh with an inventive approach and loads of biting humour.
Killing Eve is the kind of show where, during a discussion about a spine-chilling murder, the protagonist is more concerned with finishing off a croissant, because it’s possibly her first meal of the day. Or when a character storms out of a room after an intense discussion, it turns out he’s only out looking for chocolate.
Waller-Bridge isn’t cast in any of the roles here, but you see facets of the characters she played on Crashing and Fleabag in both Eve and Villanelle. Eve, played by Sandra Oh, isn’t an ambitious detective; she in fact holds a desk job. But her fascination for specific killings around the globe, all of which — it turns out — have been committed by Villanelle, is what draws her to the case. Similarly, Villanelle (Jodie Comer) seems content wiping people off Earth’s face while leading a charmed life in her Paris apartment, but finds herself drawn to Eve’s investigation into her, and Eve specifically.
Both characters experience a deep sense of awe and mutual respect for each other, making it impossible for either to imagine their lives without the other. It’s a love story-cum-dark comedy-cum-procedural, all rolled into one, and the good news is: there’s a Season 2 on its way.

Sugar, not spice "," Laughter is probably humanity’s greatest weapon against the vicissitudes of life. Ask stand-up veteran Amin Ahmed and he’ll give you a loud, resounding ‘whoop!’. Better known by his stage name, Sugar Daddy, Amin is best known for his candid take on personal experiences and life. 
A proper Bengaluru boy, the veteran comic talks of growing up in the city and how it shaped his sense of humour. “I was born in Bangalore in 1965. You can imagine how beautiful the city was. Everyone knew one another. If someone new came to the neighbourhood, you could ask anyone and you’ll get that person’s entire history. That was the old Bangalore. Frazer Town, Cox Town, Cooke Town; we had Anglo-Indians, Germans, Italians and British – we were surrounded by Western culture. It was also the dawn of the indie era so we had plenty of good music. Those were happy days with jam sessions and stories.”
Insisting that we don't mention his age, he quips: “I’m 18 till I die. I feel like it too and even have a show with the same name. The whole vibe of Frazer Town ebbs in me. I meet a lot of old friends and we notice we talk a little differently compared to the current generation.”




Comedy wasn't his first job though. “I started working at an early age. I went to St. Joseph’s College of Commerce after schooling in St. Germain High School. I did one year in college, and my best friend Gordan and I dropped out. We joined a travel agency. He went in the courier line and I became a travel guy. I became the youngest regional manager at SOTC at 23. That, however, was my last job. I went to the States. I started a company when I returned. All kinds of things happened – Personal life, family life, work life. Life got serious. I had no choice. I went into comedy.”
Life took a turn for the better when another of his friends, Perry Menzies, (who owns Urban Solace) asked him to try a hand at comedy. “What did I have to lose? When I started talking about my problems on stage instead of talking to a psychiatrist, people started clapping. They seemed very happy to hear about my problems. That’s how it all started. Since then, it has been a fantastic journey, lots of shows around the world.”
On whether comedy has helped him cope, Amin says, “Among various darknesses, I had a silver lining from above called comedy. I was not driven by ‘I am funny’ or ‘I want to become a great comedian’. It was more about ‘I have to keep myself positive’, so the funny things actually helped personally. But it also carved out a place for me professionally.” On stage, Amin covers a wide time span. “I talk about what the past was, what life was then and how technology came into situations. We didn’t have any of that back then,” he comments on technology. “We used to climb a tree and scream. There was nothing else to do. Even Arnab Goswami was born during that same time. We used to invent games.”
The journey he hopes, “is taking me to more money,” he laughs. “Money is good. I also hope to do more gigs.”




Commenting on the scene, Amin says: “Whoever came first is sitting on top. Many are talented and others are not. There is plenty of politics when someone new tries to enter. As a result, the scene is breaking up into different factions. I’m connected with my network. They may not be the most famous but they are funny. I get to do a lot with underdogs. I’m also in a position to push them. I don’t want them to go through what I did.” He points out that it is not fair that people don't get the opportunity they deserve. “Within comedians, there is a lot of insecurity. For me, age, mental conditioning and maturity, has helped me surpass all that.”
Of his moniker Sugar Daddy, Amin says: “I make fun of growing old. I don’t want to be a normal old man. I want to be someone special. So I start off with a joke on being called a sugar daddy. I make fun of my name and how it translates into other languages, like chinni papa rasgulla' or 'rasgulappa'. It’s just a spin on life and a great way to start a show.”
Amin says open mics are entry points. “They are difficult to get. Stage time is often just five minutes. There are tons of comics out there and they are all talented. You wonder why they’re not famous. But it is a tough world and I am doing all I can to help.”
Catch Sugar Daddy live at a special show in XU, Leela Palace, on July 1 called ‘18 till I die’ with Suhas Navaratna and Kartekeya Fatwani. Tickets on B"

Not a godly tale ","The late 80s and the early 90s was a time in Indian history defined by riots and bombings, tussles over mandir and masjid, the rise of Hindutva as a political tool and so on. Smugglers and dons held sway over Mumbai and the city bore the brunt of the conflict, with the riots and the subsequent blasts changing the character of the city forever. It is this Mumbai of corrupt cops, slimy politicians, shady underworld dons, that is showcased in the first few episodes of Sacred Games, the first Netflix original series from India. Sacred Games delves into the city’s intricate web of organized crime, corruption, politics and espionage that lie beneath the image of India’s rise as an economic powerhouse. Saif Ali Khan plays Sartaj Singh, a cop with a broken family and a middling career, whose life changes, when he receives a call from an underworld don, Ganesh Gaitonde, essayed brilliantly by Nawazuddin Siddiqui. The series follows two timelines, one set in 2014, where Sartaj with the help of his trusted aide Katekar, and RAW agent Anjali Mathur (Radhika Apte) try to stop the destruction of Mumbai; and another which focuses on the rise of Gaitonde, from a toddy salesman to the don of Mumbai. It is helmed by directors Vikramaditya Motwane and Anurag Kashyap.
The plot and the characters differ significantly from the book, and the action is much more fast-paced and rushed. Gaitonde seems more menacing, and more focused on his goal of emerging as the top dog in the battle for Mumbai. Nawazuddin is excellent in his portrayal of Gaitonde and brings in the grey shades to his character. He makes you invested in the evolution of the gangster and keeps the audience on tenterhooks about his next move. His relationship with God and religion is also explored well, as is his gameplan of displacing the incumbent mafia boss, Suleiman Isa. 
In the parallel timeline, Saif Ali Khan is on the money as the hassled Sartaj but remains a character who is hard to empathise with. His reactions to specific situations, such as throwing a plate in rage at home or moping around in the city at night in his car make it hard to connect with him. The fact that his issues with his wife and superior officers are hardly explored also adds to the disconnect. His sidekick Katekar, seen as someone who struggles to maintain work-life balance is far more relatable. Issues the police force grapples with, including the spectre of fake encounters, the toxic mix of mafia and high end corruption is also showcased and draws a parallel to another Netflix series, Narcos, where the drug lords try to buy out the state. 
Religion and the city of Mumbai are characters in their own right. The religiosity of the masses is mocked at by Gaitonde, the fact that the G company is ‘secular’ is constantly emphasised, and there are plenty of references to the craze over Ramayana and the rise of Hindutva in the late 80s. The Bofors scandal, the corruption in Indian public life, and the communal tinderbox also make an appearance. Religious symbols are much more pronounced in the series, unlike the book where religion is always in the background. In one of the stand-out scenes, a group of characters, playing gods on television gulp down Apna Cola, a soft drink promoted by Gaitonde, for a TV commercial, even as the don indulgently looks on. Mumbai appears dark and menacing in both timelines. I quite enjoyed the setting, of the neon-lit shady dance bars of the 80s. Radhika Apte seems fairly settled in her role as the RAW operative, facing up gender stereotypes and focussing on the task at hand. 
The series scores on the screenplay and writing, and despite marked changes from the book, keeps you engaged. The scenes are short, cliffhangers are aplenty and there is enough to keep the viewer hooked. However, the assembly line of starlets constantly being harassed by the dons and their henchmen was a little repetitive and could have been awvoided. With its multiple story arcs, the massive cast of characters and parallel storylines, the first few episodes of Sacred Games seem to be hit the sweet spot. 
All episodes of Sacred Games premiere on Netflix today.

From mike to the camera "," Sunethra Nagaraj, popularly known as RJ Nethra, has a gift of the gab; her successful career as an RJ is proof of it. Having interviewed many celebrities during her career and also being the elder sister of actor Rishi (Operation Alamellamma, Kavadu Daari ), it does not come as a surprise that Nethra too has been bitten by the acting bug. 




Having bowled over her listeners with her chatty shows, Nethra will be seen in the thriller 6ne Maili (sixth mile) which releases this Friday. The film is directed by See Ni and she shares the screen with the National Award winning actor Sanchari Vijay. 
Nethra is not new to acting; 6ne Maili is her third film after Aatagara and Ring Road Shuba. 
Ask her what the film is all about and the RJ says, “The film looks at the urban habit of going on weekend treks. Two groups go missing while on a trek in the Western Ghats. A few people get together to find out what actually happened to the missing trekkers.”
Nethra plays one of the missing trekkers. “There is a twist to my character in the second half. Sanchari Vijay’s character and my character have two distinct shades.”
Nethra doesn’t see much of a difference between being an RJ and an actor. “We are constantly emoting — with our voice, face and body. We are creative even when we interact with people and are spontaneous in the manner in which we react to others.” 
What she found challenging was to look good and fresh all the time on screen. “As an RJ I just had to sound good,” who adds that late night shoots were taxing for her. “I always thought I was a night owl, but, during the shoot, I discovered that I tired out easily at night. We had no network as we were in the middle of a forest. We would get lost and had to walk a few miles to reach the next point. We faced many challenges. We had to run in the jungles where there was absolutely no lighting. So certain parts were scary too,” laughs Nethra, who says she will continue with RJing and acting as “RJing is what has made me what I am today.”
He treks on differently




Sanchari Vijay, who has won accolades with his acting prowess will now be seen as a trekker in 6ne Maili. The actor, who won awards for his performance as a transgender in the film Naanu Avanalla...Avalu, says, “6ne Maili is a thriller. My role is challenging. I could relate to it. As a youngster I would take off on trips on my bicycle. These days people drive. Most don’t know much about the destination they are headed towards, but take off randomly and face difficulties once there. The film is about how they face such problems and tackle it.” 
Describing the film as “a director’s film,” Vijay says, “the story is the hero. The background score, the cinematography and every character is important in this film.” 
Talking of the plot, Vijay says, “There is a particular place called 6ne Maili where people disappear. We are 60 artistes in this film and every character will stay on in your mind even after you leave the theatre.” 
The film, reveals Vijay is produced by a neurosurgeon and a certain amount of profit from the film will go towards charity. “It is also technically very well handled. I am a little uncertain if I have done justice to my character as this is very different from all that I have done in the past.” Vijay then gives credit to the make up artist Uma Maheswar for giving him a new look in this film.
“People will connect with this film, which also has a tiny message for every trekker. Except for Nethra and me, every character is chosen to depict their own profession on screen. Like we have a Dr Janaki play a doctor in the film too.”

'Sanju’, a cinematic gift from Rajkumar Hirani to friend Sanjay Dutt "," 
Most biographies are convenient rather than cathartic confessions, written not to convey regret but convince about reasons for transgressions, moral and criminal if any. You can say it’s a little like history, interpretive and the perspective of the person recording it. Biopics are compressed versions, with a wider reach, condensed and coloured. Somewhere the wafer thin line between reality and what’s being related depends on the perception of the consumer which is what makes the whole process fascinating. Every person feels the vicissitudes he/she has experienced is fit for public consumption in whatever form but very few get the privilege. It could sometimes be more about the struggle than the success. None of us is born with a user manual and it’s the consequences of our choices and decisions that reflect the quality of our lives ultimately.
 

Ranbir Kapoor's 'Sanju' all set to cross ₹200-crore mark


I was not thrilled when I heard Sanjay Dutt’s story thus far was going to be immortalised in celluloid. Honestly, I’m not a fan of Raju Hirani’s cinematic recipe of simplistic solutions like a hug and chanting ‘All ish well’. His films are innocuous but for all his success I’d not bracket him with Hrishikesh Mukerjee or Basu Chaterjee. The most compelling reason to wait for and watch the film is the gifted Ranbir Kapoor and the challenge for him of playing an actor far less talented. It helped to be of similar height but the physical transformation, voice, gait and slightly stoned look are remarkable. Believe me, it’s not easy wearing a hangdog expression constantly.




‘Sanju’ is a cinematic gift from Raju to a friend he obviously adores. Blaming a drug peddler for addiction is like holding ITC responsible for smoking. Ironically Sanjay made all his choices as an adult. It’s not unlike superstars playing anti-hero in a film with a flashback justifying his indiscretions. Sanjay did not imbibe anything more than physical features from his highly respected parents. Raju Hirani paints him as an innocent sucked in by circumstances, but how can someone who doesn’t listen to his best buddy or father be called that. I was not amused by Hirani’s ‘bhalathkar’ brand of humour in ‘3 Idiots’ and there’s a similar sequence here too. The most serious indiscretions are treated lightly like bedding his best friend’s girlfriend and blaming it on her. It’s always a person, the press or the fact that he’s stoned and oblivious of his transgressions, moral or criminal. You can empathise with a star whose family is being threatened but he could have requested for police protection. You could buy a gun legally instead of sourcing it from the mob. Stars hobnobbing with gangsters were common in the nineties. Some did it to flaunt their connections while others were at their beck and call under duress. There is a terrific confrontation scene with Sayaji Shinde when Sanju refuses to attend a ‘visarjan’. This reminded me of Shahrukh Khan relating a similar sequence when I interviewed him. “I was invited to a religious function by people I thought were from the underworld. I declined since I was busy shooting. The next day they landed up at my shooting. I shouted at them for visiting my sets. They took me aside and pulled a gun. I was immobile, numb. I’ve never felt like that in my life. I always felt if someone pulled a gun I’d scream and push them away. But I could not move and he could have killed me. It turned out to be a lighter and they were there to apologise for trying to force me. It was like a scene from a film,” said Shahrukh. The genuinely engaging scenes are few and far between in a cinematic exercise to prove that Sanjay Dutt was not the villain he was made out to be. He was a victim of circumstances, bad company and a monstrous press. You can understand when a celebrated biographer in the film is sceptical to come on board when Sanjay’s wife approaches her to write her husband’s story. Her biggest worry is that truth will be a casualty.
Now I know why Kamal refuses to pen his autobiography. “I cannot be honest and if I am it will hurt a lot of people.” I also understand why Mani Ratnam smiled and murmured, “I’ll think about it,” diplomatically when Sanjay Dutt sidled up to him at a party after his first incarceration and said his life story would make an interesting script. Mani had a far more ambitious and interesting tale in mind about two close friends who turn into political foes. ‘Sanju’ comparatively is like a filmi gossip rag edited by a filmstar!

A comedian’s responsibilty is only to stay true to himself, says Aravind SA
","Aravind SA is an expert when it comes to selfies, angling the phone with careful precision to get the best shot. “This side okay va? Light and all?,” he asks one of his interviewers, to a roomfull of laughter. 
SA, who says he has given up on media ever since his first solo show, Madrasi Da, and its ‘controversial’ lungi dance bit was out, requested a quirky interview; something ‘out of the box’. After running through several alternatives, we decided to gather people — who may or may not be his fans — and give them a chance to ask some, hopefully, tough questions.
After multiple phone calls, about seven people gather at newly opened Novotel, Chamiers Road, patiently waiting for SA to walk in. He arrives, fashionably late by 10 minutes — ‘cinema style’, as he likes to call it. 
Shoot!
“For a stand-up comic, I understand that language is the greatest tool for communication. So, does being a comic from Chennai restrict your canvas when you travel elsewhere?” asks Shreya Subramanian, officially initiating our seemingly serious discourse on comedy. SA answers that in his initial days, his shows were well within the boundaries of familiarity, sprinkled with local references. 
“It was easy for people to write off Madrasi Da because the name itself suggested that there are only regional references in it. With I Was Not Ready Da, which I am touring with now, I have made the conscious effort to workshop it in unfamiliar areas like Bombay or Gurgaon,” says SA, adding that the challenge lies in straying away from the established format but sticking to the relatable elements at the same time.
When Anagha Natraj asks about how funny he was as a kid, SA chuckles, “I don’t know about funny but I was definitely dramatic all my life.” Reminiscing about his days at school, he says he believes that drama is the essence from which any form of expression takes shape. 




“I was always in the thick of things everywhere and in retrospect, I realise that I was a big attention-seeker. The funny guys played off my jokes; I was the Senthil to a Goundamani,” he quips much to the delight of the company who nods in appreciation of the fitting allegory.
 SA does not see his journey to being a stand-up comic as one that was born out of sacrifice or great difficulties. To Swetha Girirajan’s question of how he turned his passion into profession and his family’s reaction, he replies, “I did not plan any of this. Truth be told, I just realised that I was bad at pretty much everything else. It took my parents two years to realise that I am doing stand-up comedy for real,” he chuckles. 
“Was filmmaking a planned venture or was it exploratory?” asks Naveen Kumar. SA replies, nodding his head fervently, “I had so much of drama in me that I felt the need to express it somewhere and cinema was that canvas,” says SA, adding that Nayagan is one of the few films that inspired him greatly during his school days. 
“It’s a movie that I cried to. Each time the song ‘Thenpaandi’ played, I would go to my mom crying and ask her if all of us would die someday,” laughs SA. However, he says that cinema is a field that youngsters get easily lured by, not fully understanding the actual task at hand. 
As the conversation steers back to his stand-up comedy, SA reveals that he is often shown contempt by some audiences with high and absurd expectations.
“Some people accuse you of reusing your content. How do you respond to this?,” asks Prasith Babu. “Accusation is a strong word,” quips SA, explaining, “People come to the same show in different months and ask me why I am repeating jokes. That doesn’t make sense at all. Some audiences don’t know how the ecosystem works.” 
Finally, SA, responds to the argument that it is a stand-up comic’s responsibility to question power-structures, “A comedian’s responsibilty is only to stay true to himself. If he thinks that it is an extension of his voice, then great! But if you feel these are all expectations that are projected on to you, it is the comedian’s decision to take it up or not.”

Fawning around the world, Sanju style
"," Since India has welcomed with open wallets a fawning biopic about an erstwhile film star and convicted criminal, let us look around the world at more such examples. Just a couple of months ago, the venerable Cannes Film Festival allotted a slot to Gotti, a hagiographic account of the New York mob boss that whitewashes him and his many crimes. Sound familiar? John Travolta plays Gotti. My chief interest in the film is that Kevin Connolly, the actor who memorably played Eric in Entourage, directs it. Best to watch Entourage reruns instead of Gotti. 




Unlike Laura Poitras’ riveting Oscar and BAFTA winning documentary on American whistleblower Edward Snowden, Citizenfour (2014), renowned filmmaker Oliver Stone’s Snowden (2016) amounts to little more than adulation. Coming from Stone, this is strange, given that he has delivered two masterly biopics, JFK and The Doors (both 1991), but not so much when you consider Nixon (1995), that erred on the side of fawning. While on the subject of US presidents, there are plenty of lionising biopics including PT109 (1963) that looks at JF Kennedy as a war hero; Southside with You (2016), an embarrassingly saccharine look at the young Michelle and Barack Obama; and Primary Colors (1998) that hero-worshipped Bill Clinton.
Actress Barbara Windsor is one of Britain’s national treasures, known for her Carry On movies and the long running television soap EastEnders. Babs (2017), the BBC television film on Windsor, is an enervating, reverential version of her life. At least the Australian television mini-series Olivia Newton-John: Hopelessly Devoted to You (2018) makes its veneration clear in the title itself. 
Or, look at the documentary Chasing Madoff (2010), about how investigator Harry Markopolos spent a decade trying to expose stockbroker Bernie Madoff’s fraudulent dealings. My amazement on why the film ends up deifying Markopolos swiftly vanished when I realised that the documentary is based on his book. 
Thankfully, the number of more-or-less objective biopics far outnumber the fawning ones, exposing some warts at least. It is a long list that includes the likes of Lawrence of Arabia (1962), Malcolm X (1992), The Last Emperor (1987), The Social Network (2010) and Amadeus (1984), to name just a few. In some cases, these can be downright disturbing like Paul Schrader’s Mishima: A Life In Four Chapters (1985), a reimagining of the life and art of Japanese author and playwright Yukio Mishima who publicly committed seppuku in 1970. 




Perhaps what prompts filmmakers to make fawning biopics time and again is that their audience wants to see sanitised versions of their heroines and heroes on screen, in the face of a cruel and uncaring world. If there is money in pabulum, make it, appears to be the mantra. After all, there is no god greater than mammon. Which brings us neatly to the upcoming Freddie Mercury biopic, Bohemian Rhapsody. The trailer promises a greatest hits highlight reel, and millions of Queen fans, including me, will go and watch it as soon as it releases, fawning be damned.

Comedy over cash flow for Sonali Thakker
"," Chartered accountancy was not Sonali Thakker’s cup of tea. As she waited for her results, she found a creative outlet in stand-up comedy. Starting off at open mics while working as a freelance writer, the 28-year-old is now a full-time comic. Pursuing a career that was considered “commercial suicide” in her typical Gujarati family, she says that she is the first in her family to be in a creative field. “A comic’s day starts when everyone else’s day ends. It’s a very confusing and different lifestyle, but it’s all worth it to be on stage,” she says.
Bringing her one-hour stand-up special, Almost There, for the first time to Chennai today (and Bengaluru tomorrow), she says the latter is one of her favourite cities to perform in (after Mumbai). Coming up with a one-hour special is a big milestone in any comic’s career. “Since I’ve been in the circuit for a while, people started asking me if my show was ready. And I kept saying that it is ‘almost there’,” she says with a laugh, adding that she will be talking about family, relationships and travelling.
Jokes that count
Thakker has an interesting take on being a woman in the industry. “I feel very special because no man is asked how it feels to be a man in the industry,” she says, deadpan. She had never thought of it as a dynamic until it was pointed out to her. While she feels that the industry itself is indifferent, it is the audience that must change its perception. “If a male comic flops, they are having a bad day. If the same thing happens to a female comic, people go back thinking that all women are not funny.” Yet, she takes this prejudice as a challenge to make herself a better comic. “Laughter is an emotion that you can’t hold back. If someone cracks a funny joke, irrespective of their gender, you will laugh.”
Saying that she is “eternally grateful to Mark Zuckerberg”, Thakker feels that social media has been a saviour for comics. Although she is very active on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter, surprisingly unlike most of the other comics today, she is not on YouTube. “I prefer live performances because it provides a blank slate for me to perform in front of people I don’t know. I like it when they come without any preconceived notions. If they like my performance, then they experience the joy of discovering a new artist,” she says, describing it as one of those unplanned encounters while travelling, that turn into some of the best experiences. “I have never felt the need to upload anything on YouTube and obviously that leads to a lesser turnout, but I prefer that. These are the people who have come out to watch comedy and not just because they’re a fan,” she added.

Waging war against Trump: A review of 'The Good Fight'
","There’s something about the Kings and great elevator scenes.
The Kings — Michelle and Robert, spouses and writing partners — created The Good Wife a decade ago; about a lawyer, Alicia Florrick, who gave up her practice to settle for a life of domesticity, but whose politician-husband’s sex scandal forced her back into the courtroom. The show had a stellar run of seven strong seasons, and even though it was created before the current spate of cutting-edge TV shows became a norm, The Good Wife has aged rather well.
One of the show’s most memorable scenes had all its major characters — Alicia, her estranged husband, the woman her husband slept with, and Alicia’s current partner — stuck in an elevator. The uncomfortable pleasantries and awkward silences told us more about these men and women than reams of dialogues could and the Kings showed, in other instances, they had a penchant for crafting simmering drama within the closed confines of a lift.
It’s no surprise, then, that The Good Fight, a spin-off that’s once again shepherded by the Kings (along with Phil Alden Robinson), has some terrific moments staged inside elevators. One of them has the protagonist, Lucca, stuck with an attorney she’s up against and who’s, ironically, the father of her unborn child. The tension is similarly palpable, and the banter bitingly funny.
The Kings, though, have managed to inject more than one winning quality of the original show into the DNA of the spinoff. Much like its origin material, The Good Fight excels in weaving in sociopolitical talking points, and taking a firm anti-establishment stance. While the first season, which premièred last year, flirted with the changing face of America under a new regime, the latest season takes on the administration head-on.
The consequences of ‘Trump’ aren’t just talked about in hushed tones, or serve as abstract plot points, anymore. Instead, The Good Fight takes its title all too seriously, and puts its protagonists on a collision course with several arms of the government. The trio of Diane Lockhart (the inimitable Christine Baranski), Lucca Quinn (Cush Jumbo, adorable) and Maia Rindell (Rose Leslie) have to fight off immigration laws, gun control and a grand jury indictment within a span of 13 tight-knit episodes, and even though they often come up short against an all too-powerful force, their hard-fought survival makes for compelling TV.
What The Good Fight does differently from The Good Wife — and why it will have carved out a respectable place for itself, independent of the original, in time — is wrapping hard truths and uncomfortable realities in a steady dose of humour and wit. A delightful thread running through the season has Lockhart resorting to mind-altering substances that lead to bizarre hallucinations which, ironically, seem to fit in perfectly with the reality of America (and, at times, that of India).
It’s like the Kings know, and want to remind us, that the personal battles of Alicia Florrick (awe-inspiring and enthralling as they were) have no place in the current world, where the fight for survival itself is top priority. In this new world, even the good guys have to get their knuckles dirty.

Sartaj Singh and Ganesh Gaitonde enter the Netflix universe
"," Vikram Chandra is amused at my opening question. I’ve asked him about the whereabouts of one of his protagonists from his 2006 Bombay Noir novel, Sacred Games – a somewhere-in-his-40s mildly successful divorced police officer with a grand sounding name – Sartaj Singh. Chandra bubbles over with laughter, “I tried very hard not to think of what he was trying to do. A lot of readers [love Sartaj] and especially women have a special relationship with Mr Singh. He has plagued me in that way,” he replies with dancing eyes and an indulgent look.
Singh is all set to play out in the streaming universe with actor Saif Ali Khan essaying the sardar inspector this Friday. Khan along with Nawazuddin Siddiqui and Radhika Apte headline the first original Netflix show to come out of India which is adapted from Chandra’s novel. The book, drenched in Mumbai’s politics – gangsters, the police and the film world – has an epic scale, neat storylines, is driven by plot and is replete with endearing characters – primary among whom is Singh and the gangster Ganesh Gaitonde (Siddiqui). I recently re-read the book, in anticipation of watching the show and feel possessive of its vast, well-researched material, its inside gaze on a city we all love to hate. How will it translate onto screen with integrity, I ask Chandra with some concern. He responds with surprising detachment, “I decided very early that [I] have to let go of the book. When [you] translate from one medium to another, if you do a literal translation you’ll leave all the poetry behind. It’s got to be a recreation. Even that is a bad word – it’s a transcreation for something like [Sacred Games] where [the Netflix show] exists in its own universe in its own right. They have done a fantastic job of achieving that. It’s quite compelling,” he says convincingly. I’m reminded of Chandra’s description of a Buddhist mandala being drawn by Tibetan monks, keenly observed by Singh in the book. The mandala, representative of the universe is meticulously drawn out and then later destroyed.




Room for ambition
Chandra moved to Mumbai after a longish stint at Mayo College, Ajmer, “I was sick of boarding school, the discipline and the tightness,” he shares. He spent three years studying at St Xavier’s College and fell in love with the city. “It felt like home. Thousands of people come everyday from all over the country of various classes and statuses and everyone finds a place. Then they develop this weird hate/love attachment [to Mumbai]. There’s an energy, that is very compelling and you thrive on that. There’s room for ambition – all of [which] make for a very heady mix,” shares Chandra while emphasising why Mumbai feels like home. At one time, he would come to Mumbai several times in a year, now reduced to two annual trips owing to school and teaching schedules. Both Chandra and his wife, writer Melanie Abrams teach at the University of California, Berkeley and have two children ages eight and ten. Chandra is also busy with his software business, Granthika that is in its beta stage. The software connects text with the knowledge created in it — born from the need of an author like Chandra writing a novel, like say Sacred Games – has potential to be applied to legal writing, journalism, corporate documentation and scientific publishing.
Writing an epic
So where did the spark for Sacred Games come from? “I had this very strange persistent image of Sartaj talking to a gangster on an intercom. I had no idea who that guy inside was,” he says. The image was recalled from a visit to a gangster’s den during the close-to-ten years of research that Chandra undertook for the book. “He had CCTVs up and down the street and this bank of monitors. He had been able to see us walking up the street from half a mile away. He had an armoured door and an intercom. That is where it started,” he says while describing the writing process. “I start asking questions about characters – who is the guy inside? Why is he there? It [was a] very slow process of discovery.” A discovery that was helped by friends like journalist Hussain Zaidi and police officers, several of whom have been acknowledged in the book.
Chandra had watched — like everyone else in the city during the 80s and 90s — the growth of organised crime, the increasing levels of violence. “That [in]famous (1991) shootout at Lokhandwala? We were living [in Lokhandwalathen] and my father and I were driving home one day. Suddenly, there was this automatic weapons fireechoing off the buildings. It was about three blocks down from our house and we had no idea what was going on.” Chandra has strong links to the film industry, which was under extortion threats at the time. “I had colleagues and friends who were targets. I knew people who had paid up, I knew people who had been shot at. I was curious about why it was happening. I asked my friends, Hussain Zaidi and a couple of cops that I was friends with to introduce me to people so that I could understand what [was] going on.” The intense research led to a sprawling novel that crisscrossed the country (and sometimes the globe) in its narrative and yet tied up all its loose ends in Mumbai. As he says, “It’s not like [I was] making a documentary but [I did] want to convey the feeling of texture of someone’s life.”
Pivotal to narrative
The show is being made 12 years after Sacred Games was published. So is it still relevant? Chandra’s response is quick, “Crime and corruption is ongoing, the use of religion and modern media in politics – all of which are as alive as ever. [The writers and directors] have done a wonderful job of integrating all of that in a re-visioning of [Sacred Games]. As stated before Chandra wasn’t a part of the writing of the series, but attached as a consultant to the show. “They’ve got a wonderful, hugely talented team of writers [Varun Grover, Vasant Nath and Smita Singh] and they would send me ideas and I would react to it. I think long-form television is the proper medium for [Sacred Games] – we are living in golden age of television. Chandra credits this kind of long-form content with doing what Victorian novels did, which is exploring an entire culture but cinematically. He’s also delighted by how the series has turned out to be a multilingual one. “There are entire scenes in Marathi and Punjabi. It’s the way that we Indians actually live and talk. The writers have done that effectively.” And what about the casting? Chandra’s approval is swift, “The performances from everyone, all the characters [are] just brilliant. I am very pleased and happy.”
Mumbai as a character
Did he ever think of the city of Mumbai as a character in the book? “Not consciously but I was aware how much the characters had a relationship with the city. Especially Ganesh [Gaitonde] in that he comes from outside as an orphan and tries to use this karmbhoomi make his way forward.” While Singh is the son of Partition refugees, another pivotal character Zoya Mirza is from Lucknow. “Then the local inhabitants have a very particular relationship with the city. Katekar is an old-time Maharashtrian guy, I was trying to get at their understanding of the city and in that – that inadvertently created Bombay as a character.” For Chandra, the beauty of the city lay in its details, “If Sartaj has spent his day on his motorcycle driving from one end of the city to the other then what does that feel like? When you do that naturally the city enters,” he states.

Hannah Gadsby’s ‘Nanette’ leaves you both uncomfortable and exhilarated
","Around a third of the way through, Nanette, the Netflix stand-up comedy special by Australian Hannah Gadsby, transforms. No longer just a carousel of set-up followed by punchline, it takes on a greater meaning. We, the viewers, are forced to take stock. We’re made to look within, to examine the role of women in society and our own flawed worldviews. Nanette resonates with so many people across so many oceans because the things Gadsby says matter. The way she says them makes us both uncomfortable and exhilarated.
It’s a fine line to tread. Personally, the primary purpose of comedy is to make people laugh, even if it’s on the inside. It has to be, in a word, funny. Then come all the accompaniments: whether it makes the viewer think, its social impact (if any), why it exists. Humour is a tool for change because you take something back with you. The uncomfortable laughter can be scrutinised and assessed later, perhaps to understand the world a little better. But if I don’t laugh, I won’t think. 
Gadsby seems to understand that. She starts off with stories about her life both inside and outside the closet. And she takes us across difficult terrain — homophobia, mental health, art history — through her assured delivery. The jokes are elevated thanks to her wry, world-weary, ‘well, what’re you gonna do?’ style of expression. She presents a look of mild, disaffected surprise — perhaps even contempt — at how terrible the world is. But then she flips things. She tells us she’s not going to make any more jokes. That she’s not going to be endearingly self-deprecating any longer.
Male ‘genius’
The first act is merely an appetiser, a way to ease viewers into the material she wants to explore. (Content warning: Gadsby talks extensively about abuse and gendered violence through her set.) The dramatised camerawork reveals her increasing exasperation. She’s getting angrier with each passing sentence. The classic “angry comedian” trope is employed, which she points out has always been the domain of the male comic. She tackles so-called male geniuses, and the way their misogyny gets swept under the rug (Pablo Picasso gets a particularly thrilling takedown). It’s time, she says, for men to pull up their socks. Gadsby pulls no punches while delving into loaded subjects, allowing her personal experiences the space they deserve, articulating her thoughts with biting wit. But, simultaneously, she sprinkles them with throwaway one-liners, finding that perfect counterpoint to her anger.
Stand-up comedy, by its design, requires a certain suspension of disbelief. As the audience, we’re expected to function on the premise that the jokes we’re getting are spontaneous and off the cuff. We’re not supposed to think about the comic standing in front of a mirror night after night, rehearsing her material and fine-tuning it to make it sound even more impulsive and free. How the sausage is made is a secret best left unexplored. This unspoken understanding gets further muddled when the comic attempts pathos and tragedy. The acclaimed Homecoming King from last year, a special by Hasan Minhaj in which he outlines the brown immigrant experience and the racism he faced growing up in the U.S., is one such example. It was a moving story which, I felt, was a little too theatrical, too hammy, too melodramatic in its performance for my tastes. For so many others, that wasn’t the case. 
A vital narrative
Rehearsed anguish or fury is a lot harder to project to an audience than comedy. It can, at times, come across as insincere. Like the comic is playing a “role”, and not actually being who she is. But Gadsby doesn’t appear to be faking it in any way. It’s not a TED Talk; she’s not pontificating. She’s talking to us. Her delivery, practised as it may well be, reveals a side of her she’s brave enough to show. I’m less concerned with the ‘performance’ of it, and more with her personal journey and the message she’s presenting. 
And that’s where she succeeds. The jokes remain, though sporadic, but there’s an underlying thought of forward motion that resonates with the viewer during Nanette. She points a mirror at the oppressor — most prominently in her set, the straight white male — and centres the equally (if not more) vital narrative of the oppressed. Being a privileged, English-speaking, Hindu-born male in India, I understand that my place in society is similar to that of the former. So I won’t do Gadsby the disservice of coopting her message or claiming I found it emotionally relatable. Instead, her force of personality is such that I could appreciate viscerally, truly feel, the catharsis that she — and countless others through her — felt during Nanette. It makes you look inward.

Sacred Games: same soul, different body
"," A mandala is a metaphor for the cosmos, or a city. An intricate geometric pattern, it consists of squares and circles, used in Hinduism and Buddhism to denote a sacred space, one which is representative of an entire microcosm. In Vikram Chandra’s definitive Mumbai novel, Sacred Games (2006), one of the lead characters Sartaj Singh, a middle-aged Sikh inspector in the Mumbai police force, observes some “Tibetan Sadhus” patiently and meticulously and gracefully creating an intricate mandala.
It is heartening to note that Netflix’s first Indian original, Sacred Games adapted from the book, creates the world of Singh, the gangster Ganesh Gaitonde and the city formerly known as Bombay, in much the same manner as the Tibetan monks — patiently, meticulously and indeed very gracefully. As a lover of Sacred Games, I was wary that the book’s inner voices and intricate patterns, didn’t lend themselves with alacrity to be adapted into a filmic medium. But after watching all eight episodes of the first season, I am happy to report that the Netflix show, is inhabited by the same soul as that of the book, but has its own distinct body.
Recreating an epic
 The writers, Varun Grover, Smita Singh and Vasant Nath, take the story of a cop, a gangster and a city set in the late 1990s/early 2000s and retell it in, 2018, with a sense of urgency, impetus and sensitivity. What stands out is the inclusivity with which the writers re-imagine the book. A throwaway character in the book is the bar dancer, “Kukoo” and is no way significant to the plot, yet represents a distinct Bombay personality. The writers have instead elevated Kukoo in their narrative, giving her a share of the spotlight and the audience a beauteous Bombay character in the bargain.
The first season of the show, which roughly covers about one third of the 950-page book, moves briskly, but makes time to include the many back stories and inject atmospherics into the proceedings to make sure that you are watching an authentic Mumbai show. Bollywood, politicians, religion, the underworld, the corrupt, the rich, the high-rises, the slums, the chawls, the dance bars, the dives, the fine-dine, it has it all in its embrace, but more importantly, it’s been rendered in an aesthetic which is authentic. To cite two examples, I’d point to the multilingual nature of the show, where Marathi, Hindi, English Punjabi and Gujarati all co-exist like the many languages a true blue Mumbaikar uses to navigate the city. Or the respect and warmth with which the working class, their dwellings and their lives are shown.
Acting crew
 Of course, Nawazuddin Siddique is a class act. He becomes Ganesh Gaitonde from the time he commits his first murder. This is familiar territory for Siddique, but Chandra’s writing had always brought to mind, a “Nana Patekar in his prime” kind of Gaitonde. Saif Ali Khan as Singh meanwhile executes a tough role — a forty-something overweight cop, he’s the “hero” fighting greys, not just in his beard, but also the bleak moral zones that his job makes him inhabit. He is divorced, on anxiety pills and is one badly executed encounter away from oblivion in the police force. Yet Khan brings alive his character’s midlife crises and the many compromises Singh makes to inhabit a “good cop” zone with skill and dexterity.
The book is about all the smaller characters and their arcs, against which the leads defined themselves. Therefore it’s the finely cast ensemble, which truly defines this show. Jitendra Joshi as Katekar, Singh’s loyal and long-suffering sidekick, Kubra Sait as Kukoo, Shalini Vatsa as Kanta Bai the moonshine-maker-turned-advisor for Gaitonde and Richa Sharma as Singh’s mother, Navneet Kaur. All of whom, add colour and bring alive the myriad plot contours and the city.
Past present
 The show follows two strands, one which is set in the present, focussed on Singh, directed by Vikramaditya Motwane and the other which narrates Gaitonde’s backstory directed by Anurag Kashyap. The Gaitonde narrative seems a tad filmy, but then isn’t every gangster’s story just that? In comparison, Motwane’s narrative is taut yet sensitive — he directs thrills, confrontations, deaths and life with an inherent sense of place and more importantly, innate human dignity.
Aloknanda Dasgupta’s background score is atmospheric and moody, adding to the much needed texture which is created by the supporting crew, whether it’s the turban drapers or the costume designers. There are many Bombays in this city and it is to the crew’s credit that they bring them alive so evocatively. It’s fortunate that Sacred Games, has been created by an international streaming major, this means that life can be depicted as it is lived.
Besides the colourful patois, there are uninhibited and furtive sex scenes, nudity, random and planned violence, as it unfurls everyday in the metropolis. Interestingly the book was written when the NDA government was at the helm, and the Hindu right had entered cultural spaces with their ideologies. In 2018, the scenario is not very different, religion has invaded the popular discourse again and we are constantly made to calibrate individuals and actions against the binaries of religion. There is no better time then, to have this mandala of a show, which accords viewers a grand view of the city, its multifarious ticking parts and the several games which are played out in the name of religion.

I am always interested in playing characters with grey shades: Nawazuddin Siddiqui on ‘Sacred Games’
","For actors Nawazuddin Siddiqui and Radhika Apte, bagging roles in Netflix’s Sacred Games, a series adapted from Vikram Chandra’s book of the same nameand helmed by Anurag Kashyap and Vikramaditya Motwane, was a great opportunity. “It is great to get a series released in 190 countries across the world,” they say. 
Radhika Apte, who plays a RAW officer, Anjali Mathur, points out, “My character is different from the version in the book. I did not read the book since I did not want to carry any bias about the manner in which the character would shape up in the series.” She adds that one of the toughest things was to learn about officers in RAW. “Adapting to different characters is part of an actor’s job and I enjoyed essaying this character, grappling with her issues and yearning to be a field officer, like her father.”
Nawazuddin, who plays Ganesh Gaitonde, an underworld don, says, “I am always interested in playing characters with grey shades. I have never enjoyed romantic movies filled with conventional black-and-white characters. Real people have shades of grey and that must be highlighted. I think the new crop of directors in Bollywood are making movies that no longer pander to stereotypes.”
He goes on to explain that Gaitonde becomes a don due to certain circumstances. “He has an unhappy family life in a small town in India and ends up in Mumbai. Since Sacred Games is a series, it allowed us to bring about more facets of the character on screen.” 
Does he fear being typecast with gangster roles? “Not really. I have acted in three gangster movies. One of the greatest actors, Robert De Niro has acted in plenty of movies, where he played gangsters. I look at gangsters as humans and enjoy playing them. There is good and bad in everyone.”
On whether content-driven cinema is finding its voice with the rise of streaming platforms such as Netflix, Nawazuddin says, “There is an audience for all type of content in India, be it masala entertainers, content-driven series or the regular saas-bahu fare.”

Baggy's Kungfu Bonda comes to Madurai "," So, sometime early last year, Bhargav Ramakrishnan or Baggy as he’s better known, turned 30 and that’s when he realised adulthood had hit him. “It was significant to feel like an adult, finally. There were myriad emotions running in my mind and I started to write them down,” he says. That’s how Baggy’s first solo special shaped up. “I ended up writing a 100-minute comedy show and started touring with it last July. Titled Kungfu Bonda, it’s sure to make you roll on the floor.”
After nearly 40 shows across cities in India and Malaysia, Singapore and the UK, Kungfu Bonda is coming to town this weekend. Baggy is excited about his first show in Madurai. “I’ve never performed in Madurai before and am curious to know how the market for stand-up comedy is evolving in small towns. Kungfu Bonda has gained popularity over the past year. One reason for the show’s acclaim is that people easily identify themselves with the topic — growing old.”
As a typical Chennai boy, Baggy signed up for Engineering but was always interested in the Arts. “Right from my college days, I was active in theatre. After joining arts company Evam in 2011, I came up with a show that could be easily transported and performed in any given space,” he says. “Unlike a typical play that involves logistic issues like props, sets and a background, my show was minimal in every sense. By that time, stand-up wasn’t popular in India except in maybe Delhi or Mumbai and we called our solo shows as comedy monologue. As I approached it from a theatrical perspective, I used to direct people in comedy monologues.”
Attending ‘The Weird Ass Pyjama Festival’ in Mumbai in 2014, opened up a world of opportunities for Baggy. “I was exposed to the sheer variety in stand-up comedy and met many performers from India and abroad. I was someone who always liked being on stage and that’s when I realised that it’s high time I wrote and acted in a show on my own.” Ever since, Baggy has become one of the popular names in Chennai’s stand-up scene.
“Stand-up is a humble and spontaneous art form and is the opposite of elitist comedy. It comes from the open mike culture and offers an opportunity for anyone who wants to give it a shot. Moreover, stand-up is much about personal funny experiences that one shares and that’s why I love doing it ,” beams Baggy. “The show Kungfu Bonda retires in September, after which there will be no live performances. I will shoot it and release it online.”
The show, organised by Eight-O-Eight, is on at JC Residency, Lady Doak College Road on July 15, 6.30 pm. Tickets are priced at ₹499 and 750 and are available on baggythecomic.com. For more details call 7373000034, 8892750257

'Alexa & Katie': For teens and the teenager in you
"," Alexa & Katie is a departure from the crime shows I’ve been devouring of late. This is an absolute teen series, a genre that’s free from the clutches of violence and deceit.
Netflix is producing shows of all kinds for audiences of all ages. This latest multi-camera sitcom is targeted at the generation that is going to school now. The first episode starts off with Alexa (Paris Berelc) getting treated for cancer. She isn’t sober as the atmosphere would like to demand. Had the series been set before this time period, say at the stage of diagnosis, the stories would have been full of misery and concern. I’m not saying concern isn’t a big part of the series as it is, but the halo around the phase of recovery is generally less gloomy compared to the time it takes for the idea of cancer and the related issues to sink in.
Katie (Isabel May), from the other half of the title, is the girl who visits the hospital like she’s always known the place, the nurses, and the other patients there. By now, you might have figured that Alexa and Katie are best friends. The show doesn’t dig into their friendship through flashbacks, or throwback pictures, but grand gestures in grander scenes like Katie shaving off her head to present a face of solidarity – as Alexa loses clumps of her hair due to chemotherapy – are what make this sitcom a truly enjoyable one.
When Friends hit the world of American television twenty four years ago, critics and pop culture trackers pointed out that the all-white cast had robbed the series of tales associated with people of other races and colors. This is 2018, and we’ve sitcoms like Fresh Off the Boat, Master of None, and Alexa & Katie, where Asian-Americans are roped in as the headliners. Doesn’t this mean that the television industry in the West is broadening its scales to tell the stories of non-white people?




Alexa & Katie has a traditional TV structure. Even when the situation calls for a group hug and a loud cheer, it ends with a simple voice-over from Alexa. The ubiquitous laugh track tells you how you should consume the show as it, mostly, stays in the bubbly-zone. Throughout the 13-episode scripted series, the prism of optimism shines bright. This has got to do with how the people around Alexa look after her, and how everything turns out to be alright at the end of the day. Her mom (Tiffani Thiessen as Lori), like every other mother on the planet, constantly checks up on her; and her best friend is literally just a window away (Alexa and Katie are neighbours who go to each other’s houses via a tree that connects their bedrooms).
Though, Alexa doesn’t want to be merely defined as the sick girl, she subtly expects the people around her to be with her through thick and thin. 
And, sometimes, she uses her shaved head (an indicator of her illness), to get out of troubles. These themes are also a major part of another hit television series, Speechless, that stars Micah Fowler (he plays JJ DiMeo) as a high-schooler with cerebral palsy. JJ, too, is a naughty teenager with a tendency to pull pranks on his friends and family members. But Alexa and JJ manage to get away with it because of the empathizing lenses they are put under, and, are, instead, respected for their courage and strength despite the odds that are stacked against them.
Sitcoms like Speechless and Alexa & Katie show how the sun rises even during the darkest of times.

I was initially uncomfortable in Bigg Boss: Ananth Vaidyanathan
"," Ananth Vaidyanathan is a familiar face on television, having been associated with the Super Singer show on Vijay TV. He’s now in the limelight for participating in the latest season of Bigg Boss, from which he was voted out recently. Excerpts from an interview:
You must be happy that you’re out of the Bigg Boss house. Why did you choose to enter in the first place?
 Initially, I was very reluctant to take it up. It’s such a huge show and you have no control over what would happen. I am frankly not a people’s person. I’m very shy and hyper sensitive, and I look for people I’ll be comfortable with. When I signed up for what is essentially a social situation, I knew I’d be a weak person. I succumbed to it within the first few hours in the house.
So why did you say yes?
 Because I wanted to walk through all that I was afraid of. At 62, I cannot afford to have fears. 
The three weeks inside the house saw you go through an uncomfortable environment. Your discomfort was evident.
 Yes, I was very uncomfortable in the first 72 hours. That also let to my first nomination for elimination. When you’re silent in a crowd, it is interpreted as being arrogant. So, I decided I have to come clean; and I shared with the contestants about how painfully shy I was, and how it was a big challenge for my career growth. Everyone was overwhelmed when I did that. For me, it was the breakthrough moment of self acceptance. 
Who was your confidante, with whom you discussed everything?
 Ponambalam. I used to share a lot with him. The man has a lot of innate wisdom. 
If that’s the case, why did you nominate him for the ‘jail sentence’, something that most viewers didn’t take to kindly?
 I am a very strong champion of women’s rights. It is in this background that I approached the situation. On one of the episodes, he made one statement: “Ava edhuvum yezhakka tayara iruka (She’s ready to let go of anything).” That had serious connotations and it upset me a lot. 
But posts on social media are trolling you for doing that...
 If the Ponambalam issue blows up — and I know there is a serious possibility of that happening — I just don’t care. 
Who would you bet on to become the winner of the show?
 Yashika. She has character... as does Aishwarya. They stand for something. 
So, what are your plans now, now that you’re out of Bigg Boss?
 I’ll surely get back to teaching singing at my academy. Also, I started off as a singer...so whatever years I have left, I’d like to do justice to my classical singing.

Netflix topples HBO in Emmy nominations, but ‘Game of Thrones’ still rules
"," HBO’s medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones may have led the nominations for the Emmy Awards on Thursday that spanned satire to the supernatural, but streaming service Netflix knocked HBO off its 17-year pedestal as the network with the most nods.
A slew of first time Emmy contenders included Sandra Oh as the first Asian-American lead comedy actress nominee for her role in quirky spy series Killing Eve, and Rachel Brosnahan’s 1950s housewife turned comedian in The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel.
Female-led shows and stories also did well as television continued to lead the way in reflecting social change, while the likes of Donald Glover, Tracee Ellis-Ross, Penelope Cruz, Antonio Banderas, Issa Rae, Regina King, and John Legend headed a racially diverse acting line-up.
Games of Thrones, a worldwide hit, got 22 nods, including for the top prize of best drama series. It was followed by NBC’s sketch show Saturday Night Live and HBO’s sci-fi series Westworld with 21 nominations each, and Hulu’s dystopian vision The Handmaid’s Tale with 20.
Just five years after the launch of its first original series, House of Cards, Netflix ended HBO’s 17-year streak as the most Emmy-nominated network.
Netflix gathered 112 nods for shows that ranged from supernatural drama Stranger Things and British royal show The Crown to female wrestling comedy GLOW, new Western drama Godless and reality makeover series Queer Eye.
HBO, which was recently acquired by wireless carrier AT&T Inc, had 108 nominations, and noted in a statement that it was the eighth year it had gathered 100 nominations or more. NBC shows earned 78 nods.
Netflix campaigned heavily for the Emmys, the highest honours in television, and says it has budgeted $8 billion for programming in 2018.
Stranger Things executive producer and director Shawn Levy said the streaming service was a joy to work with. “They follow our lead and they don’t make us live inside a box either creatively or financially, and that is almost unheard of among networks and movie studios,” Levy told Reuters on Thursday.
The Emmy awards will be handed out in Los Angeles on September 17 hosted by Saturday Night Live cast members Michael Che and Colin Jost.
Game of Thrones will compete for best drama with last year’s Emmy champion, Hulu’s The Handmaid’s Tale, which also won nods for actresses Elisabeth Moss, Alexis Bledel, Samira Wiley, Ann Dowd and Yvonne Strahovski.
Bruce Miller, executive producer of The Handmaid’s Tale, acknowledged that the show’s vision of a theocracy where women are treated as property was hard to watch.
“You are basically writing a show about the way you pray that the world won’t go, and then it starts going that way. We sit around and pray for irrelevance,” Miller told Reuters.
Other best drama contenders include The Crown, NBC’s family drama This Is Us, Cold War spy series The Americans on FX and Westworld.
Game of Thrones was out of the running in 2017 because the show aired later than usual.

The Crown: Netflix releases first look at Olivia Colman as Queen Elizabeth II
","Netflix on Monday unveiled the first image of actor Olivia Colman as Queen Elizabeth II in the third season of the hit series The Crown.
The photo shows Colman at the breakfast table, with a cup of tea.
Colman will play the role of Queen Elizabeth II for the third and fourth seasons of the show, which will showcase the queen’s middle years during Harold Wilson’s time as the British Prime Minister and Princess Margaret’s five-year affair with Roddy Llewellyn, who was nearly two decades younger than her. The show is also set to cover Prince Charles’ marriage to Princess Diana and his subsequent affair with Camilla Parker-Bowles — now the Duchess of Cornwall — and the Margaret Thatcher era.
Colman is replacing actor Claire Foy, who played the queen in her younger years, from coronation through the Suez Canal crisis. Helena Bonham Carter will play Princess Margaret in seasons three and four, replacing Vanessa Kirby.
Colman will be accompanied by Game of Thrones and Outlander alum Tobias Menzies as Prince Phillip, replacing Doctor Who actor Matt Smith. Marvel actor Paul Bettany was earlier slated to play the role, but he bowed out as he was “unable to commit” to the show because of the eight-month-long shooting schedule, according to Vanity Fair.
Season three of The Crown is set to premiere in 2019.

China’s mostexpensive film an epic flop
","With a $113-million budget, the most expensive Chinese film ever made has become a flop of historic proportions, pulled from theatres on its opening weekend after bringing in a paltry $7.3 million.
Alibaba Pictures’ special effects-heavy fantasy film Asura was intended as the first instalment in an epic trilogy inspired by Tibetan Buddhist mythology, part of a drive by authorities to promote works bearing Chinese culture.
The film cost $113.5 million to make, State media said, and opened on Friday, but Chinese ticketing platform Maoyan said it only took in just over $7.3 million at the weekend. 
The estimated loss of $106 million would make it the fifth-biggest flop ever worldwide.

Celebrating abstracts ","While Bengaluru is a haven for realistic painting, according to theatre artist and painter Ranji David, “We need to realise the importance of abstract art.” 
David, founder of the theatre group Organisational Theatre, is on a mission to introduce lesser-known artists. Organisational Theatre has started a documentary series, Geniuses of Bangalore. The 10 minute documentaries depict the life and work of abstract painters. “I thought I could shine a light on abstract painters.” The first video on abstract artist Bharath Rajpal is uploaded on social media where it is doing well. 
“Rajpal’s convex three-point perspective, is worth dwelling upon. My documentary is not a lengthy biography of the artist. It is a peep into their lives to introduce their work. Doing this within a 10-minute framework was a challenge.” 
Most of the abstract painters that Bengaluru is home to, according to David have not been profiled. “We have shied away from showcasing them. The works of these unsung heroes need to brought into the public eye as it would help record their work for posterity. People will then realise the strengths of abstract painting.”
And why is the theatre man dabbling with art, with a concern for paintings? He spent a good 15 years as a trainer in a top corporate and relished the way he ‘engaged’ with people. Instead of getting locked in front of a system in his routine work, his inventive urge made him quit his job for theatre. And while he was seriously directing and acting, his passion to handle the Hungarian-Indian painter Amrita Sher-Gil’s life in his theatrical production made him extend his persona to learn all about ‘abstract art’ by joining a course at Chitrakala Parishath. And his intrinsic love for the abstract soon has him take up a docu-series on these painters!
The theatre practitioner studied Theatre for Change at London School of Performing Arts and Clowning and Mindfulness from the University of Essex. “My all time passion, I realised, is theatre. I wanted to have my path chalked out this way. But what happened while in theatre with respect to Amrita Sher-Gil is incidental. I am happy that I further stretched my bandwidth for knowledge to appreciate abstract art.” David plans more educative sessions to familiarise people with the form. “It will help people figure out what makes up abstract art.” 
Regular jobs have restrictions, David feels. “When you are on your own, there is more to explore and experience.” Some of his adventures come from meeting and collaborating with theatre practitioners across the globe. “The Handlebards, the cycling Shakespeare troupe, were a real find and I’ve been able to get them to tour India.” 
David offers corporate training focusing on theatre-based interventions and conducts theatre-in-education projects. His radical handling of Shakespeare, his favourite playwright, is progressive for this contemporary age. His explorations include an adaptation of Hamlet for children, Macbeth, on corporate politics, Romeo and Juliet for young couples, Othello for married people and King Lear for senior citizens.

Taylor Swift cast in film version of Cats
","Pop superstar Taylor Swift will take to the silver screen alongside Jennifer Hudson in a film adaptation of the popular hit musical Cats, reports said on Friday.
The movie is the latest project for British filmmaker Tom Hooper, who brought novel-turned-musical Les Miserables to the big screen and won an Oscar for directing The King's Speech.
Cats, composed by Andrew Lloyd Webber and featuring the classic musical ballad Memory, opened in London in 1981 and originally was staged on Broadway from 1982 to 2000, the fourth-longest run in history.
Based on poems by T.S. Eliot, Cats tells of a feline tribe — in human form on stage — called the Jellicles who decide who among them will make a fateful ascent into a new life.
Cinema industry news site Variety said that Hudson would play Grizabella, a formerly glamorous cat who longs for acceptance.

I have seen many Katekars in life, says Jitendra Joshi of ‘Sacred Games’ fame
","Recently, Netflix unleashed its first-ever Indian original series, Sacred Games, starring Nawazuddin Siddiqui, Radhika Apte and Sailf Ali Khan in central roles. One of the characters of this eight-episode soap that has fascinated critics and binge-watchers alike is Katekar - a not-so-ambitious but loyal constable – played by popular Marathi theatre and film actor Jitendra Joshi.

 ‘Sacred Games’, a coming of age for Indian television

The story, adapted from Vikram Chandra's novel of the same name, is the story of a policeman Sartaj Singh (played by Saif Ali Khan) in pursuit of gangster Ganesh Gaitonde (played by Nawazuddin Siddiqui). The character of Katekar, Sartaj’s colleague, is flawed and yet real. His loyalty toward Sartaj is admirable and yet his dislike for a community, which eventually leads to his demise, is more than just a chink in his armour. In a telephonic interview, the actor spoke to The Hindu about his approach to the role and how life has changed post the massive success of the show. Excerpts:
(Laughs) I don’t go seeking work; in fact I am just busy living life to the fullest, and meanwhile circumstances create jobs for me. It’s too early to say. People in the industry might notice my work and more opportunities will come my way (like) just how Sacred Games happened. I took up the project because I was excited about working with Anurag Kashyap and Vikramaditya Motwane. I had no idea about Netflix’s existence until my friend Nikhil Mahajan (an established Marathi filmmaker) made me realise how big a deal this is. It’s (the online streaming site) a beast and I am overwhelmed by the number of messages and wishes I have been receiving from strangers and fellow artistes. But, I have no inhibitions about language or industry; I will take up whatever the best comes my way, doesn’t necessarily has to be Bollywood.
I have seen many Katekars in life. I grew up in Pune where my neighbour was a police constable, so a few of Katekar’s traits come from there. Then I am friends with a few policemen in Mumbai, I have observed them very closely – their belief systems, usage of abusive language and other things. Even in a normal conversation, they use cuss words and especially at home. Katekar isn’t a typical hawaldar, I kept him very human and simple. It shouldn’t look like an act but just another real person in reel scenario.




Motwane is one of the best directors to work with; he knows where to set you free and to tether you down. So there are moments and actions that were improvised, for instance a few curse words were my own addition as I speak the language (Marathi). But again, the writers of the show have done such an excellent job that just scratching the surface of the script gives you the character arc. When you work with actors like Saif (Saif Ali Khan), who has zero insecurity as an artiste, you can take liberties. So, experimenting becomes easy when one is surrounded with a team of ace players.
I love all of them, but you need guts to play Cuckoo. It will be very interesting to take on the role as a male actor, but it’s equally challenging for a female. Kubbra Sait is on top of her game and what a performance. Wow! But main Cukoo ka part karega (I would want to play Cukoo).



In Sacred Games, the apocalypse is near; there is no time to rest


I have a couple of plays to work on. First is a play written by Amir Nizar Zuabi, a Palestinian play writer-director, which is called Mai Hoon Yusuf Aur Ye Hain Mera Bhai. It’s a translated Hindi play to be performed at the Prithvi Theatre in September.
Writing is out of plain interest. I love music so much that I desire to pen down lyrics and it brings joy, but the true satisfaction I receive is through acting - it’s my passion. Having said that, acting is just a by-product of my life, it isn’t my entire life.
A few people wrote to me that they will treat police constables with respect henceforth, which I think is heart warming. There is a deep contentment in touching lives and shaping opinions, even if it’s just one person.

Rohit Roy enters the world of web series with 'Memories'
"," It isn’t everyday that an actor gets to play someone returning from a near-death experience and by a quirk of fate, has the power to travel through memories of someone else lying in comatose state. In Memories, the web series for Viu directed by Vikram Bhatt, actor Rohit Roy enacts Siddharth Sareen who’s equipped with this power and helps unravel a mystery.
Speaking to us about Memories, Roy remembers suspending his disbelief and listening in to Vikram Bhatt’s narration of the thriller: “The way Vikram Bhatt narrated it, the possibility of getting into others’ minds and tracking their memories seemed believable. It’s a well-etched character and story; when I learnt that there are cases of 37 people who’ve sprung back to life after being taken off life support for a few minutes, I was all ears. Certain things are beyond our understanding, maybe that’s why they are termed supernatural.”
He was required to be in almost every scene of Memories – either as an aggressive head of a television news channel or in spirit, witness to memories that unfold – and the actor says demarcating between the two was the key. Now that the first few episodes are out, he’s glad with the audience response. “A lot of people on twitter have noticed the nuances. When I agreed to work on this series, I instinctively felt it would be a winner,” he says.
Memories was originally designed for 10 episodes but went on to be 13. The series also helped him collaborate with Vikram Bhatt after 20 years. Of late, Bhatt’s cinematic journey has been synonymous with the Hate Story films. “I wouldn’t have minded working in one of them,” laughs Roy.
Bhatt and he have been good friends over the years and that rapport, he says, helped ease the exhaustion of an intensive work schedule. “The good thing about the digital platform is you have the entire script, unlike what happens with television. So that margin of errors is reduced. We’d be working 14 to 16 hours per day and since I am required in every other frame, it was tiring. But I won’t complain, because I knew what was expected of me. On one day I remember having a slanging match with Vikram on the sets. Since we’ve known each other for long, we didn’t make a big deal out of it,” he says.
Incidentally, it’s been 25 years since Rohit Roy was first seen on television, in Swabhimaan. He’s shifted between television, cinema and theatre before testing the web series zone. Cinema has been an unpredictable beast that continues to puzzle him. “I’ve been part of some big hits,” he says, referring to Shootout at Lokhandwala and Kaabil, “but I’ve never been able to follow up on the success with other films. I won’t lie that I got a few scripts, I am reading them and waiting for the right one etc. The truth is, barring a couple of offers that I didn’t like, nothing worthwhile came,” he admits.
The Telugu film industry has been reaching out to him on and off, he says, but he has stayed away so far. “I am scared, I have no knowledge of the language and don’t know how things work. Some truly interesting films are being made in the industry and I won’t rule out acting in a Telugu film sometime. If I set my mind on it, I can learn the language. I’ve acted in five Bengali films and recently completed my first Gujarati film,” says Roy, who will also be seen in an extended cameo in JP Dutta’s Paltan. The war drama is set in 1967 during the face-off between Indian and Chinese military forces at Nathu La and Cho La mountain passes. “I have the greatest regard for JP Dutta and I’ll even do a walk-on part for his film,” is all that Roy will reveal for now.

Giving a new look "," Telugu cinema has undergone a seemingly imperceptible transformation not only technically but also content wise and I credit Mahesh Babu for a tiny bit. He’s the first Telugu superstar to be seen on-screen wearing normal, classy clothes rather than the garish costumes. He ‘spoke’ rather than ‘deliver dialogues’ and there was casualness about his on-screen demeanour both disarming and charming. For Telugu directors it was always a struggle between their sensibilities and what was perceived as the audience’s taste. The change started probably with getting gifted cinematographers from the Tamil industry on board like Pawan Kalyan insisting on P.C. Sreeram for ‘Kushi’. Incidentally, the camera was cranked by Jeeva, Sreeram’s protégé for the Tamil original. Anyway with these cameramen came classy art directors who made even ‘sets’ look lived in. There were no painted hills and blue skies in the background. Cinematographers like Ratnavelu are revered because they insist on getting involved right from the script stage rather than sign because they’re paid a premium. If the rawness in ‘Rangasthalam’ was applauded then the fine blend of audience aspirations and cinematic chimera in ‘Bharat Ane Nenu’ has set the box-office on fire.
Mahesh Babu’s career, in stock market jargon is full of lower bottoms and higher tops! For every dud like ‘Sainikudu’ there was a blockbuster ‘Srimanthudu’. Growing up on a diet of Rajni and Kamal films while studying in Madras, Mahesh like many of his generation apparently aspires to be a blend of both. He hasn’t shied away from experimenting, by Telugu standards from accepting a psychological thriller like ‘Nenokkadine’ which went kaput. There was the emotional choice, ‘Brahmotsavam’ when he seemed to feel family emotions are what works and the over ambitious ‘Spyder’. All three were duds and pundits were busy writing him off but he’s back with a bang.




‘Bharat Ane Nenu’ starts with swift ‘establishment’ scenes. Bharat jogs to collect his fifth ‘degree’ in a London college like Nagarjuna in ‘Geetanjali’ and even breaks into a song after that. Things turn sombre with an uncle informing him of his father, the Chief Minister’s demise. There are sharply cut flashback sequences of his ‘never at home’ father and a doting mother who instils values in him. There’s a hint of illness when the father asks if she’s ingested her medicines. Mother passes away and enter, the indifferent stepmom. A kind uncle offers to take the lonely child to London and the expressionless father (Sarath Kumar) accedes. Cut to the present and Bharat, on a spin around town is dismayed at the constant honking, rash driving and two-wheelers driving on pavements. There’s political turmoil with his father’s friends and adversaries aspiring to usurp power. His father’s buddy and political advisor decides to thrust the crown on Bharat. The reluctant son ascending the father’s throne is as old as ‘Godfather’ or is it The Ramayana? Anyway Bharat takes his job earnestly and starts by imposing a small fortune as fines for traffic violations. This is when he’s not ogling the typical heroine slurping ice cream and giggling like she’s being tickled by an invisible being. There are the political opponents and father’s pal who turns adversary when he realises his puppet has snipped the thread. The scenes of political intrigue, chicanery and father figure turning foe are succinctly written. Of course, the producer seems to prod the director periodically to add a song here and a fight there. The fact that a good intention alone, even when in power is just not enough in politics is convincingly established. The film abounds with clichés but handled with sensitivity. The director manages to keep you engaged with some pithy lines. The reason for Bharat resigning is pretty weak though but his rant blaming the press effective.
Mahesh Babu is terrific. You can see he likes the character he’s playing and there’s great improvement in his sense of timing and dialogue delivery. He relies on his charming presence more than bone breaking stunts and dances. Prakash Raj as the wily kingmaker steals scenes effortlessly. Kiara makes a confident debut in Telugu. Ravi K. Chandran and national award winner Thiru have cranked the camera and you can see why they’re respected. They impart a touch of class to the briefest of scenes. 
The quality of art direction has improved by leaps and bounds. In the end, credit should go to Kortala Siva who’s graduated from the crass to lend a touch of class. He’s discovered the dialogue writer in himself.
‘Bharat Ane Nenu’ is unrealistic and Utopian. It’s like expecting Kamal to become the next chief minister of Tamil Nadu. Cinema is what we want to see not what reality is. I hope Siva churns out an equally engaging sequel.

Going beyond the “boy-meets-girl” pattern "," A lot has been written and debated about the new Netflix original series Sacred Games already. Ever since it hit the streaming platform, earlier this month, the online world has gone into a state of frenzy. While a section of the audience is showering the cast and crew with praises, another bunch is getting busy with the task of making and sharing memes. Either way, this is making the global giant, Netflix, a very happy company.
And, with his turn as the never-dying head of a gang, Nawazuddin Siddiqui, has officially become synonymous with crime dramas. He is, indubitably, the best person in Bollywood to play a gangster today. His character, Ganesh Gaitonde, has been crafted with so much sensitivity and cunningness that it gets hard to call him a heartless person. On the one hand, he kills scores of innocent people just to throw his weight around – and as part of revenge – and, on the other, he doesn’t shy away from acknowledging his love towards Kukoo. This form of duality is present in the other characters of the show, too. But, for now, let’s make Kukoo and Ganesh the centre of attention.
Kukoo isn’t a blink-and-you-miss character, or a passing cloud; she’s a trans-woman (played by Kubra Sait) who’s loved by a cis-hetero man. This phenomenon doesn’t happen every day in the Indian television space. It’s a Kodak moment, in the scripting-sense, that needs to be preserved and studied. The next-generation-filmmakers will take Kukoo as a point of reference to pen similar characters / storylines.
In a poignantly written-and-directed episode, this revelation comes like a storm and passes off like a breeze on the beach. Anurag Kashyap, who has directed these portions, throws breadcrumbs at us exactly minutes before going for the big-scene where Kukoo exposes her man-and-woman parts for Ganesh to look at, and for the bewitched audiences to understand her identity better.




Here’s how it unfolds: Kukoo smiles at one of Ganesh’s associates as he catches her peeing in a urinal in the men’s restroom. And, we think it’s funny because we aren’t accustomed to watching women do that often on-screen. But a heated argument is taking place between Ganesh and his friend (Paritosh, played by Muni Jha) behind a closed door where the latter is arguing about the disgust that Kukoo brings with her presence. He urges Ganesh to marry a “decent girl”. And, if Kukoo is still needed, he can keep her on the side, he states. Kukoo’s ears, unbeknown to herself, catch this piece of conversation. And, in a fit of anger, she walks off with sorrow and regret dancing on her face.
Kashyap uses this built-up tension to show how Ganesh’s heart is in the right place as far as Kukoo is concerned. Upon realizing that the love of his life might have gotten hurt due to Paritosh’s comments, he rushes down a flight of stairs to comfort her, and breaks open the door. After seeing her in a crumpled and hopeless situation, he takes a step forward to utter sweet nothings, and nudges her to “come out of the closet”. At his insistence, she unrobes a little to give a peek into her real-self, all the time yelling, she can’t give him children. However, Ganesh assures her that he’s not at all worried about that. He tells her he wants her, come what may, with a beatific smile.
This wonderful segment tells us that we’ve travelled a long distance in portraying relationships that go beyond the “boy-meets-girl” pattern on television. We’re no longer afraid of exploring newer pastures in the digital field. The makers couldn’t have taken up such subjects within the landscape of traditional TV. So, the onus has fallen on the streaming services to bring us these sets of groundbreaking stories. And, I hope their writers’ rooms are bustling with ideas to tell the tales of marginalized communities.

“I’m not going to talk about what to expect (from the final season) although it’s pretty great. I don’t think we’ve announced a date yet so sometime in ‘19 first half,” Bloys said.
 He also talked about five Game of Thrones spin-offs and said that network is currently only working on one of them. 
“We are doing a pilot that Jane Goodman wrote. Out of five, we’d be lucky to get one that we’re very excited about it. We’re just starting the search for a director (and) casting director,” he said.
 The hit epic fantasy series first premiered in 2011 and its eighth season will marks its culmination. The show is based on the hit book series by George R.R. Martin.

Angad Singh Ranyal’s guide to comedy
"," “Stand-up comedy has the potential to influence people,” says Angad Singh Ranyal, who is in town tonight with his new show Kaafi Filmy. “Comedians are generally very socially aware and if that message is mixed with jokes, it tends to stay in the audience’s mind for longer,” he adds.
Family and friends
In his own mind, however, this was not the top career choice when he went after an MBA in Mumbai, de rigueur engineering degree already in hand. But fate decided to introduce him to stand-up comedy and, soon, he was hooked. “Quitting my job and moving into comedy was a well-planned decision,” says Ranyal, who cleared his massive post-MBA student loan before announcing the career shift to his family. After four — startled — months to get their heads round the idea, they are now enormously supportive. 
He shares, amusedly, that even for poorly-received shows, his family finds a way to blame everything other than his performance. “Once they said, the auditorium has bad food, so… how can people enjoy good jokes after eating bad food?”
Another force that shaped him is East India Comedy. As an intern, the opportunity was crucial in polishing his writing skills. Now, he does web series, sketches and shows with them.
Local influences
Ranyal is no stranger to Chennai, having performed here twice before. But audiences at tonight’s show will no doubt find plenty of new giggles. “Being a movie buff, I will talk a lot about today’s movie watching-experience,” which will segue into “my first fight in school, how it’s difficult to make new friends at 30, and why I hate long drives. I do a lot more of story-telling today; it’s great fun to take the audience down your memory lane”.
If you thought telling jokes was easy business, think again: it requires time and plenty of practice. With the current tour, which began in March, Ranyal feels he hits new levels with every performance and that his performance-readiness is now at 90%. “The more you perform, the better your writing gets. When I look at some of my old jokes, I cringe.” 
He prophecies this will be the case again, when he looks back at his current jokes three years hence. “And if that doesn’t happen, it means I haven’t grown as a writer!”
Religion is a topic he keeps away from and he tends not to add too much “local” flavour in his pan-India tours. “I’m from Delhi but still haven’t added any Delhi references when I perform there. Of course, my manager thinks this is an excuse, and I’m just lazy!”
In reality, laziness is not an option, given that Ranyal does some 150 shows a year. How does he find the focus to go on? “Once you start making people laugh, you just can’t stop till people stop laughing!” 
Evam presents Kaafi Filmy by Angad Singh Ranyal, at Bay 146, Hotel Savera, tonight from 6 pm onwards. Tickets at ₹500 on in.bookmyshow.com

Priyanka Chopra, Nick Jonas engaged: US media reports "," Actor Priyanka Chopra and pop singer Nick Jonas are engaged after two months of dating, the US media reported.
People.com, on Friday, quoted a source saying the couple got engaged a week ago on Priyanka’s 36th birthday on July 18 while the two were in London.
Jonas closed down a Tiffany store in New York City to buy an engagement ring, according to the insider.
“They are so happy,” the source told People.com. A source close to Jonas said the singer is “very, very happy.”
“His friends and family have never seen him like this, and they’re all really excited for him. He’s definitely very serious about her,” the source added.
Priyanka and Jonas had made their relationship public earlier in the month of June, but they are yet to officially comment on it.
Meanwhile, Bollywood director Ali Abbas Zafar on Friday announced Priyanka’s exit from his film Bharat in a cryptic tweet alluding to her beau.
He said the reason for her opting out in the “Nick of time” was “very special”.
Over the last several weeks, Priyanka and 25-year-old Jonas have been spotted on several dates, including a dinner date in New York City and a Beauty and the Beast Live in Concert show in Los Angeles.
Priyanka was also seen celebrating July 4 — the American Independence Day — with Nick’s family. Nick earlier visited India with the “Quantico” actress to meet her friends and family. The couple has been sporting similar gold rings.

A room, a clue, a key, a lock — an experience
"," 

Peruse any mobile app store and you’ll find hundreds of these games where a few simple taps will clear you of the level. The difference is substantial when actually situating yourself in these rooms, because the pressure is clearly a lot more intense and, well, one can’t just hit ‘exit’ or the home button to leave and come back whenever they wish.
The trend of ‘escape experiences’ started in 2007 courtesy Takao Kato of the famous Real Escape Game — this got the ball rolling and now, globally, there are over 8,000 venues worldwide offering mystery junkies the opportunity to solve puzzles driven by narratives. 




The Hidden Hour on Road Number 36 in Jubilee Hills has a different atmosphere from the horror and tears-inducing themes common to these games. CEO of The Hidden Hour Aman Goel explains the more upbeat themes of the escape-rooms have invited a somewhat different demographic, adding “While we do get various groups of friends and corporate groups who want to build team-work skills, we do also get larger families, mainly across three generations.” The premises opened just three weeks ago and the team is already observing good feedback from participants, especially as they emerge from the rooms after successfully getting out. 
Gamemaster at The Hidden Hour, Prithviraj, just came back from a training at the franchise’s head office in Delhi where he learned about how to keep the sensors in the room at optimal functionality. “While our main team sits in Delhi, we have to be on call here in case something needs to be adjusted between games sessions because we do modify the games according to the variety of levels we offer.”




With over 18 branches across India, Mystery Rooms at SVM Mall in Jubilee Hills is popular for its hair-raising themes such as ‘Cabin In The Woods’ and ‘Hurt Locker.’ Operations manager Saikiran Royal says the venue is frequented by corporates from Deloitte, Microsoft and Google who want to build team-work skills and just get away from their desks for a bit. 
Families and friends also venture to Mystery Rooms, but more so during the weekends where slots get booked extremely quickly. 
“See, our concept is different from other escape experiences. The difficulty level is quite up there and people often underestimate how tough it is to get out of there,” he comments, “and while we do monitor their progress, we tell them during the briefing that they should start at basic level because even that’s pretty hard. We currently have five games here at this branch, and our next branch opening later in the year in Gachibowli will have another five. We like to immerse them completely in the experience; in the Cabin In The Woods one has no lights while the prison-themed one has participants dressing up in overalls that we provide.”




Another place which is a favourite with the corporates is The Great Escape formerly known as The Escape Hunt for two years prior to a fun rebranding the franchise underwent in May, and largely caters to people aged 21 till 40.
Divya Pitla, the onsite manager at The Great Escape in SLN Terminus Mall in Gachibowli, says their USP is that they have two rooms in for each game so they can have two different teams compete against each other.
What’s universal across all these venues is the strict ‘no phones inside’ policy. Aman elaborates, “We want our participants to get away from their phones, and really engage with each other and put on their thinking caps... and have a memorable and fun time, of course!”

Is Bollywood scared of Dalit love?
","In a country where only 5.82% of the population marries outside the community, the very idea of inter-caste marriage and choosing one’s life partner is fantasy. But it is fantasy and desire that are the two key ingredients of commercial Indian cinema. Not surprising then that a big production house like Dharma Productions grabbed the opportunity to remake the Marathi blockbuster Sairat,  which dealt with the theme of exogamy. The just-released Dhadak is Bollywood’s adaptation of Nagraj Manjule’s Marathi tale of a tragic romance between a Dalit boy and an upper-caste girl. 
Dhadak is the second mainstream Hindi film this year after Anurag Kashyap’s Mukkabaazto showcase inter-caste romance. So, are there winds of change sweeping through commercial cinema with major production houses daringly taking on the hot-button issue of caste? 
The answer is complicated. In Dhadak, for instance, the caste identities of the lead characters are different from those in Sairat. The hero, Madhukar Bhagla (Ishaan Khatter), is the only son of a lakeside restaurant owner, and the heroine, Parthavi Singh (Janhvi Kapoor), is the daughter of a renowned politician in Udaipur. 
It’s evident from their surnames that the young man and woman in Dhadak are both from the sacred-thread wearing upper castes. So, in Dhadak, the romance might be inter-caste but, unlike Sairat, both people are from privileged upper castes.
The other inter-caste romance of the year, Mukkabaaz, was also an upper-caste romance — Rajput boy and Brahmin girl.
Much bolder 
Unlike the mainstream films, in sharp contrast are some small productions that dared to centre the story on Dalit protagonists. Neeraj Ghaywan’s Masaan (2015) traced the lives of a Dalit boy and an upper-caste girl, both grieving the loss of their partners. The film ends beautifully on a promising note: the two find themselves on the banks of the Ganges in Allahabad and take a boat ride to the sangam. The ending is both optimistic and fantastical, all we see is the glimmer of a possible romance.
I explored two exogamous relationships in my film Chauranga (2016). One, which plays out as a fantasy, was between a Dalit boy and an upper-caste girl. The boy dreams of her, adores her, enjoys the sight of her but never approaches her. The day he writes her a letter, it turns his world upside down.




The second exogamous affair is shown as a possibility. The upper-caste man and the Dalit woman meet and mate in a cowshed, outside the confines of his upper-caste household. This realised fantasy meets a tragic end when the man accidentally kills her fearing the loss of his honour.
In fantasy
In Sairat, Manjule shows us in vivid detail how the love story of an upper-caste girl and a Dalit boy plays out in life. It looks like any other love story that breaks the ever-present societal barriers of caste and class, but the consequences of such transgressions soon become clear. 
Manjule’s first feature film Fandry also toyed with the idea of inter-caste romance. But it operated purely in the fantasy realm where a Dalit boy silently adores an upper-caste girl and never musters the courage to approach her. When he finally does, his caste and livelihood of rearing pigs is thrown in his face to show him his place.
The realisation of exogamy in Masaan, Chauranga and Sairat unmistakably involved migration to the city. In Sairat, the couple escapes a caste-ridden rural society to seek jobs and a possible future in urban factories. 
In Masaan, the boy and the girl migrate from a puritan Varanasi to Allahabad, the city of confluence. Interestingly, the girl finds a job in the railways and the boy is hired as a civil engineer, both professions distinct symbols of modernity. In Chauranga, the lone Dalit survivor boards a goods train carrying coal to save his life. The coal, train and migrant labourer, all three are necessary ingredients of modernity.
Unlike these smaller films that boldly dealt with caste and inter-caste relationships, the bigger Hindi films restrict their flings with caste to upper-caste romances alone. Clearly, their interest lies in only capitalising on the fantasy of inter-caste marriage and steering clear of the actual issue — the status of Dalits and their relationship with upper castes. Is Bollywood too scared to portray a Dalit love story?

YouTube to go up against Netflix and Amazon with original content for India and other markets
"," Alphabet Inc's YouTube is creating scripted series and other original programming for international markets including France, Germany, Japan, Mexico and India to try to draw new customers to its paid subscription service, a senior executive said on Friday.
The programming will come in the form of multiple genres such as music documentaries, reality series, talk shows and scripted series, Susanne Daniels, YouTube's global head of original programming, said in an interview. It will be produced in local languages and subtitled or dubbed for other markets.
Some of the programming will appear on YouTube Premium, the monthly subscription service formerly called YouTube Red. Other content will be available on YouTube's free service with advertising.
“We are targeting markets where we believe we have a tremendous upside in potential subscribers,” Ms. Daniels said.
YouTube already has released a handful of original shows in South Korea and one in India, a talk show in Hindi about cricket. Called UnCricket, the show has performed “beyond expectations,” Ms. Daniels said.
Ms. Daniels also said a reality show starring South Korean pop band Big Bang had boosted subscriptions, and that 50% of the new customers came from outside of Korea.
More details about the new international slate will be released in the coming weeks, she said.
YouTube will be competing with companies including Netflix Inc and Amazon.com Inc that are investing in local language programming for online audiences around the world.
The first original shows from YouTube debuted on its premium service in 2016, starting with series from some of the platform's most popular video creators. It added programming from Hollywood stars and also released a batch of children's shows including Emmy-winning Fruit Ninja Frenzy Force.
There are no current plans for more original children's programming, Ms. Daniels said. The YouTube Kids app serves that younger audience, she said, and the company does not believe children's content will drive subscriptions to YouTube Premium at this time.

In Star Wars virtual reality,you get to be the hero
","Imagine putting on a helmet, lowering the visor and being transported immediately from your humdrum day-to-day existence into your own Star Wars adventure.
The kind of fantasy that could once only be woven into the dreams of the young is coming to a theme park or shopping mall near you — perhaps sooner than you think.
The Void is the latest in a flood of businesses offering whole-body, fully immersive virtual reality experiences for about double the price of a movie ticket.
The company's Star Wars: Secrets of the Empire scenario instructs players that their mission is to recover Imperial intelligence critical to the survival of the Rebellion — yes, that Rebellion, of Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia.
In reality, the players are in a room full of cameras, movement sensors and other gadgetry in the shadow of Disneyland in southern California.
As far as they are concerned, they are rebels disguised as Imperial stormtroopers on the molten planet of Mustafar, battling giant lava monsters and generally taking care of business.
Wearing vests weighed down by high-tech hardware, the players can reach out and touch what they are seeing in their visors, feel the breeze on their faces and hear creatures scuttling around them. 
Designed in partnership with Disney-owned Lucasfilm, which makes the Star Wars movies, the experience involves all the senses, says marketing director John Kirkpatrick. “I really felt like I was in the movie,” says player Sean Oshima, 29, a technology consultant. 
“I was really amazed by this technology. You can really feel the agents shooting you.”
Cusp of a boom 
The experience — typically enjoyed in groups — costs about $30-35 for 10 minutes, and gets about 500 visitors a day in Anaheim. 
There are locations in North America, the Middle East and Europe and the company is still growing, with other scenarios including a narrative tour around the movie “Ghostbusters,” and a haunted house experience.

Classic comebacks in gaming
"," Legendary game developers Capcom, brought us the Street Fighter 30th Anniversary Collection recently. Plus Okami HD is scheduled for release next month and we have been hearing whispers of a Devil May Cry collection. Now they have brought us a new collection with their classic character Mega Man, bundling all his past games into a two-part legacy collection.
Mega Man X Legacy Collection 1 and 2




What’s it about?


Along with names like Mario and Sonic, has always been Mega Man, a thinking and feeling android created by Dr Light. Mega Man X marked an evolution of the character in 1993, bringing into the spotlight the character design we now know and love, making that iconic blue suit edgier with a gun arm. The X series débuted on the SNES and rose to fame. This is where the Legacy Collection 1 drops you. You start off playing the first four games, which are the best the series has to offer.
Legacy Collection 2 is where the nostalgia sort of peters off, as you play X5 to X8, mostly due to the inclusion of the not-so-good X7. The worst part of the collection though, is the splitting of it into two parts. Street Fighter 30th Anniversary Collection packed in 12 games into one bundle, why couldn’t they do the same with the Legacy Collection?
How does it play?
If you loved Contra in the arcades or on your old home machines, you will love Mega Man X. It’s a side-scrolling platformer, with a lot of bullet hell elements that make this a fantastic game. Playing X1 to X8, you can see the evolution of the series, as they pack in a lot more characters, storylines and gameplay elements into the mix, to make things fresh. Especially the evolution of the art style and the technology of that time, as the bits evolved from 16 to 32 and so forth.
Capcom has included a lot of fun stuff in the package. Mega Man X is a tough game and they have a Rookie Hunter Mode that lets you breeze through and experience the levels and story. This is especially great if you want a hard dose of nostalgia without going through the challenge. Undoubtedly, this is best played on the Nintendo Switch, as the game seems to be perfect for the plucky handheld. Whatever the console, be prepared for a lot of repetitive stress disorder from mashing the fire button in the first few Mega Man X games, which lack rapid fire.
Should you get it?
If you’re a fan of Contra and other side-scrolling games, you can indulge yourself in this collection, though first buy either the individual games or the first part of the collection to see if it’s your cup of tea.
With all the gaming giants showing off the same old, same old, No Man’s Sky stood out because it offered us something so vastly different. After a long and troubled development, No Man’s Sky launched in August 2016, with all the fanfare of a broken record — riddled with bugs, with no multi-player. While it still had the generated worlds, the game was almost unplayable. Fast-forward two years and the developers have kept at it, fixing the game slowly. To mark their launch on the Xbox One, Hello Games released a game-changer of a patch codenamed Next, which completely redefines the game. This is not just a patch, it’s a second-coming.
No Man’s Sky Next




What’s it about? 


Hello Games didn’t just dream a game, they dreamed an entire universe. That wasn’t all; it was a universe that would take you millions of years to discover yourself. They took their procedurally generated dream and wowed us collectively at every E3. The very thought of a program that created entire worlds filled with creatures, flora and fauna that were completely unique. Where you, along with millions of players across the globe, can discover together. That was No Man’s Sky.
That was not all. No Man’s Sky was inspired by the cover artwork of great science-fiction writers Isaac Asimov, Arthur C Clarke and Robert Heinlein. Adding that secret sauce made the game all the more compelling. While the launch did not go well for No Man’s Sky, the vision was there, everything looked beautiful. You could lose yourself in this game. Except, it just was not quite baked as yet. The spirit was and is still undeniably there, as players uncovered secrets and communities built bases and colonised those digital stars, while Sean Murray and his team at Hello Games got things right. Which they did in their next patch.
How does it play? 
“This is an important next step on our journey,” their patch notes open with. If you’ve been disappointed with No Man’s Sky in the past, think of Next as the first step. This is the game they wanted to build, this is the game that dropped our jaws, this is the game I fell in love with. 
In addition to the improvements in the graphics department, there are better base-building options and weekly challenges to keep things fresh. There is better multi-player too, and while you still can’t see players floating about, you can invite your friends over to your freighter to complete missions, dogfights or just discover and colonise new planets together. The feeling of jumping into your spaceship, accelerating towards the stars, each one of them a planet waiting for you to discover, is unparalleled.
Should you get it? 
If you have been turned off by the negative reviews of No Man’s Sky till now, you can ignore it. At this very moment, people are actively changing their Steam ratings to reflect this new patch, giving the game a fighting chance. Everything deserves a second chance and No Man’s Sky is high up on that list.
The writer is a tech and gaming enthusiast who hopes to one day finish his sci-fi novel

Kalki Koechlin’s Indian life
"," Sometime in 2017, Bollywood actor Kalki Koechlin received an email from Jon Manel of the BBC’s World Service. He asked if she would be interested in hosting a podcast focussed exclusively on Indian stories. Koechlin took more than six months to accept, thanks to her busy schedule. But she is glad she did. The culmination of months of research and hours of recording launches today, with the first episode of Kalki Presents: My Indian Life. With 10 episodes featuring as many guests (each clocking in at over 20 minutes) — Koechlin emphasises that the series is a collection of “compelling, personal stories about being young and Indian”.
In the pilot, we hear the chiming bells of Delhi-based belly dancer Eshan Hilal’s hip chain. Drawn to dancing at a young age, Hilal describes how he was physically beaten by his father even as he continued to practise the art form. There was mounting family pressure to stop. “I felt like a defective piece by God,” he recounts sombrely, going on to speak with Koechlin about how he stood his ground and stayed committed to dance as a profession.
Everyday stories
“These people are very much relevant to the changes that India has faced in the last 20 years,” explains Koechlin, about the podcast’s focus on young subjects. “Forward-thinking people from different fields doing things that we never expected.” Another episode features an ice hockey player from Ladakh, who recounts the story of how she and her team would spend an entire night pouring water into an enclosed space so that they would have an ice rink to practise on the next day. The topics covered in the series range from sexual abuse to caste-based prejudice to family discrimination.




Koechlin, whose own French heritage and upbringing in Auroville makes for a fascinating story about the different shades of India, is grateful for the podcast because it has helped her escape the social media echo chamber. “It really opened up my views. The kind of things I listen to are still very much connected to the people that I know. I am learning a lot,” she introspects.
While she opens with the lines, “If you are young and Indian, this is your podcast,” the actor believes that the stories will find resonance with non-local audiences, too. “These are human emotions that are universal,” she explains. “We have focussed on understanding what’s going on in India, but the problems described are not purely Indian.”
With the backing of a global media house and a spotlight on India’s diversity, My Indian Life stands to provide incredible insight into complex stories, similar to what Rukmini Callimachi’s The Caliphate, or series three of Malcom Gladwell’s Revisionist History, have achieved. Yet, the pilot disappoints. It feels clinical, with Koechlin’s studio voice booming in over live-sound recordings, translating an intimate conversation between Hilal and his mother from Hindustani to English. The host does not feel connected to the subject.
Exploring platforms
Koechlin has a well-established reputation for working across mediums. With a wide list of theatrical productions already under her belt, the actor, who was recently appointed Chevalier de Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, has embraced the podcast because of the anonymity it offers. “A person feels a lot less conscious talking into a recorder than being on video,” she explains. “It can get very intimate because you’re not feeling conscious of yourself. It’s an incredible medium in terms of just being able to listen to a person.” 
There is also the convenience of listening to a podcast, she points out. “I listen to them in the morning when I’m doing other things, and I find that (the information) seeps in without you noticing,” she says. Her current favourites are IVM’s The Pragati Podcast, as well as the occasional French podcast that her mother shares with her.
Koechlin, who recently completed filming for Zoya Akhtar’s upcoming film, Gully Boy, will also be seen in Amazon Prime’s upcoming web series, Made in Heaven. As for season two of My Indian Life, she says pensively, “I hope so.”

Murr in the house
"," Some might argue that James Murray has the best life — he spends all his time with his best friends, and plays pranks on them for a living. He travels the world with them, playing stages like the O2 Arena, Radio City Music Hall and Madison Square Garden. Currently, they are touring the US, and have just wrapped up the filming of season eight of their cult hit show, Impractical Jokers. Somewhere in the middle of all this, he has found time to co-author Awakened, a supernatural novel, with Darren Wearmouth. 
What Murray is looking forward to, however, is his first ever trip to India later this year. “We get more fan mail from India than from America, the UK, Australia and Italy combined. It’s unbelievable,” he exclaims. On the phone, he sounds exactly like he does on the show — hyperactive and always ready to laugh. Yesterday, he was on Comedy Central’s Facebook page for a live session, where hundreds of fans tuned in to ask him questions about his interests, advice on love and how he keeps the friendship with fellow jokers — Joe Gatto, Sal Vulcano and Brian Quinn — ticking. 


He will also be picking the line-up for Sunday’s marathon of the show on TV. Any other person would pick what shows them in a good light. Not Murray, though. “It will be 20 episodes, featuring some of my most embarrassing, and favourite, moments,” he says with his signature chuckle. Although the four comics have sizeable online followings, they have not been creating online content as frequently as they used to when they started out. But their approach to the medium is similar to how they put together their show, he says, explaining, “The show is just my best friends and I being ourselves. We don’t play a persona. And so for the web, we now prefer to do live video interactions over sketches, where our fans can see the real us.”
While tour dates and locations have not been announced yet for his solo visit to the sub-continent, Murray says, “I’ll be throwing a big party for our fans, where I can get to meet and interact with them in an informal setting. It will also be a chance for me to introduce my book to them.”

'Unsolved': No light at the end of this tunnel
","Spearheaded by the American Crime Story series, true crime anthology is the latest buzz in the American TV industry, and Unsolved is its newest addition. ‘The only thing more intriguing than the lives of famous people, are their deaths’ seems to be the mantra, and Unsolved dives into the conspiracies and investigations around the murders of 90s’ rappers Tupac Shakur and Christopher ‘Biggie Smalls’ Wallace. Both murders took place a few months apart, and while there was evidence to suggest they may have been related, investigative agencies failed to unearth a link. In fact, both murders remain unsolved to this day.
By its very definition, Unsolved is about botched-up police investigations and failed attempts; you know, at the outset, there will be no light at the end of the tunnel here. Yet, what Unsolved does well is break down the mechanisms of an investigation, twice over. The first, by the Los Angeles Police Department in 1997 after Wallace was shot, and the second in 2007, when the case was reopened by a Special Task Force. Both investigations unfold concurrently, alongside a third track revolving around Shakur and Wallace’s friendship, and eventual parting. 
This is a smart, even if complex, storytelling device, and what makes the show stand apart from its competition. Unsolved has neither the depth of the OJ Simpson story, nor the inherent thrill of Manhunt: Unabomber, but it has an infectious verve that keeps you invested, and actors who commit to their parts with ease. The standout among them is Jimmi Simpson (Westworld), playing the socially-awkward and obsessive detective, Russell Poole, working on the Wallace case in the ’97 chapter, and who speaks at all times — it seems — in a whisper.
What Unsolved also benefits from immensely is the involvement of Anthony Hemingway, who directed the OJ Simpson chapter of the American Crime Story series. Hemingway and the other series directors lend a distinct personality to each of the three timelines, shooting them in different hues and palettes, yet binding them together with consistently smooth transitions and seamless plotting. 
It takes a couple of episodes to fully grasp the various intermingling strands — the East Coast-West Coast rivalry among rappers in the 1990s; the interdepartmental tension between police forces; the several suspects, some of whose names crop up in both murders — but the narrative begins to settle down nicely once the framework is laid out. A sense of repetition creeps in midway through the season (but that may be by design), as characters go sniffing after new leads but end up right where they started. 
The finest police procedurals don’t just obsess over breakthroughs and revelations, but focus on the mundane and dry quality of an investigation before that eureka moment arrives (Bosch, on Amazon, is a shining example). The best moments of Unsolved, too, lie in tired conversations between cops at the end of frustratingly unproductive days, during long lookouts outside suspects’ homes, and at weekend barbecue brunches. Even true crime isn’t always glamorous, and that’s just fine.
The first season of Unsolved is now streaming on Netflix.

As long as your work is good, they won’t care: Varun Grover
","In Mumbai, your address says a lot about who you are. If you are one of the have-nots, it betrays exactly how much you do not have, and if you are one of those who has a lot, your choice of residence reveals how you see the world and your position in it. Varun Grover chooses to live in the northern suburb of Kandivali, far from the hustle and bustle of Mumbai’s heart, because even after a decade in the city — and a string of successes as a lyricist, screenwriter and stand-up comedian — he sees himself as an outsider. “I want to keep it that way,” he says. “Part of the struggle is reduced if you come with the notion that you don’t want to belong. If you’re okay with the idea of sitting out. If you’re okay with the idea that whatever you’re doing is a fleeting moment.”
By choosing not to belong, Grover gets to save on rent, but more importantly, he gets to be deeply political with his art: Masaan, his first film credit as a writer, dealt with themes like love, sex, and caste in Banaras. Netflix’s first original Indian production, Sacred Games, of which he is the lead writer, would be just another cops-and-robbers thriller without the religious politics embedded in its very core. Aisi Taisi Democracy, the stand-up comedy show that he performs with Rahul Ram and Sanjay Rajoura, is fearless and incessant in its attempts at ridiculing the powerful. As I write this, Aisi Taisi tweets “Lynching is BJP’s NREGA.”
It is Grover’s politics that has dragged me all the way to his living room. One of Grover’s three cats peeks out of another room cautiously, presumably trying to assess if I pose a threat. As Grover calls out to it, all the obvious questions flood my mind: Don’t strong political leanings make it hard for an artist to make it? How do you deal with the cloud of imminent violence that’s hanging over every screening, every performance?
“Many people believe that these things are going to be difficult. But they’ve not tried to be political and to see how people react. Most of the people who actually matter are chasing money and they are okay with compromising on politics if it gets them money and gets the work done. It may backfire someday, but as long as your work is good, they won’t care.”
Privileged space
In a country where a school bus full of children is attacked for a movie about a fictional queen; where artists are frequently kept in line and on-message by the threat of defamation and decapitation, Grover’s explanation for how he managed to carve out a small patch of relatively free space for himself strikes me as incomplete at best. I press further, asking if it is his privilege that allows him to adopt such a position. “Yes, absolutely. People who are privileged can take more risks because of that safety shield that privilege provides. I am Hindu, upper-caste, male, and able-bodied. So everything is on my side. That gives me the extra cushion that Swara Bhaskar won’t get. That is something I understand and acknowledge, which also becomes a reason for me to keep doing it. Because I know I have that privilege.”
Being political
Much as Grover might deny the everyday inconveniences of being political, the vast majority of his colleagues, even the ones with truckloads of privilege, don’t seem to conduct themselves as he does. “I don’t understand why people who have the most power, say people like Amitabh Bachchan, are silent on most issues. It’s probably too much to expect him to stand up for all Indians, or even for his fellow U.P.-wallas... I’m saying at least stand up for your industry. Even that he won’t do. Even on simple issues like censorship. Even with films involving his own family members. I’m not judging him; to judge I need to know why he’s doing that, I just don’t understand.”
Bollywood’s elites may shirk the responsibility, but it is probably fair to say that Grover and his fellow comedians are doing more than their fair share of challenging the status quo of public discourse in recent times. And though their numbers are increasing by the day, stand-up comics in India are an endangered species — their art form requires physical presence, which makes them easy targets for angry audiences.
A matter of time
“Right now, the whole stand-up comedy industry is surviving on pure luck. If you haven’t been dragged to a police station, or somebody hasn’t protested at your show, or if somebody has not cancelled your show, it’s just a matter of time.”
There are situations that can be controlled and others that can’t, he explains. If someone is there specifically to disrupt a show or if the atmosphere in the days preceding a show is particularly charged, there is little they can do to protect themselves. But “it’s always at the back of our minds. That something can happen. Which is why I feel safer doing Aisi Taisi Democracy because there are three of us. There’s a 66% chance of survival compared to when you’re alone and one bullet will be enough.”
Perhaps there was a time when a joke could not possibly have invited a bullet as a response, but this isn’t it. Today, there is a deep cleave in our society — Left and Right, Conservatives and Liberals, Patriots and Anti-Nationals, Hindus and Others — the labels vary depending on the context, but what remains true is that those on opposing sides do not merely disagree, they simply do not engage. In such an environment, does an artist who is political see it as his duty to go beyond milking applause from those who agree with him? To try and talk to the other side? To change people’s minds?
“No, because I don’t think people can change with stand-up comedy. But at the same time, I don’t think we are preaching to the choir. In any show, not everybody is completely with us on all the topics we talk about. We talk about Hindutva, and we talk about the problems with Islam also. If there are Muslims in the audience, laughing at the jokes on Hindutva, they will have to confront the jokes on Islam too.”
It is hard to tell whether this strategy of spreading the ridicule out evenly does anything to bridge the divides reinforced by the daily barrage of hate and distrust on our Facebook timelines and in our WhatsApp forwards. However, there is another subject that, according to Grover, invariably unites a large part of their audiences: patriarchy. “When you talk about that, it becomes personal. We don’t have any motive of changing people. But we like the tension in the room that comes when you talk about, say, how patriarchy leads Indian men to become rapists. There’s absolute silence across all ideologies. We like that tension, we like that moment when everybody’s silent and nobody’s clapping.”
Call-out culture
The flipside of the social media madness that defines our age is that although the democratisation of speech has divided us like never before, it has also led to a scarcely conceivable level of progress in a few isolated bubbles — which fuels further division since the people inside the progressive bubbles are so far removed from the norm. Grover’s own Twitter account, constantly active —and angry and funny and poignant — and ostensibly progressive, is an important part of his public persona as well as a potent platform for his politics. But to many, he doesn’t go far enough. As someone who has called others out and has been called out himself, Grover believes that call-out culture is justified when it is punching up, but ultimately problematic.
“There have been critiques of Masaan from a Dalit perspective and Sacred Games from a feminist perspective. I completely agree with them. In Sacred Games, I was one of the writers, so I didn’t have complete power, but still I am partly responsible for not casting a transgender person for the role of Kukoo, which many people called out. They are right in accusing me or anybody from the team of failing transgender people on that count and we can try harder next time.”
“Coming to the broader culture of calling out, I think it’s problematic just like any mob is problematic. Mobs take your thinking away and put things in a certain perspective. They don’t give you facts. They give you facts with a lens. And then, as a mob, you don’t have the opportunity to remove the lens. So you can never judge something objectively. I’ll probably take it because I know that ultimately my privilege will probably see me through, but I won’t indulge in that kind of thing even if it’s punching up. I’ve done it earlier, but of late I’ve given it a rethink. You may be right eight out of 10 times. But those two times are not really a good cost for those eight times.”

‘Facts of Life’ star Charlotte Rae dies at 92 "," Charlotte Rae, who played a wise and patient housemother to a brood of teenage girls on the long-running sitcom The Facts of Life during a career that encompassed many other TV roles as well as stage and film appearances, died on Sunday. She was 92. 
Rae died at her Los Angeles home with her family at her side, said her publicist, Harlan Boll. The cause of death was not immediately available, but Rae was diagnosed last year with bone cancer after beating pancreatic cancer, Boll said. 
She originated the character of Mrs. Garrett in 1978 during the first season of NBC’s comedy Diff’rent Strokes, then took Mrs. Garrett with her for the spinoff Facts, which premiered the following season. 
Initially set at a girls’ boarding school, that NBC series ran for nine seasons. Rae left after its seventh year, however, explaining later, “I needed some time for the rest of my life.” 
The Facts role came to Rae after years of theater and television performances. She earned an Emmy nomination for the part, and she was a two-time Tony nominee for her work on Broadway. 
Mindy Cohn and Kim Fields, who played members of Mrs. Garrett’s brood, recalled her lovingly. 
“She was my champion, a teacher, a proud example of the tenacity and perseverance needed to live as a creative, along with your talent and gifts. i love you char,” Cohn, who played Natalie, posted on Instagram. 
“Sorry, no words at the moment just love and tears... and yeah, smiles,” tweeted Fields, who portrayed Tootie. 
Tony Award-winning actress Audra McDonald tweeted- “She was so sweet, funny, wise, lovely, and brilliant. She will be so missed. Rest In Peace Sweet Charlotte Rae.” 
Todd Bridges, who was on Diff’rent Strokes, said on Twitter that she was beloved by all her colleagues and that the show “would not have been the same without you.” 
Edna Garrett provided kind if sometimes wry counsel to her Facts of Life charges (which, besides Cohn and Fields, included Lisa Whelchel, Nancy McKeon and Molly Ringwald) on a series that was praised for dealing with such sensitive issues of teenhood as sex, drug use, eating disorders and peer pressure. 
“I wanted to bring in as much humanity as possible, as well as the humor,” Rae told The Associated Press early in the show’s run. “I don’t want her to be Polly Perfect, because she must have human failings and make mistakes.” 
Entry into Broadway
Born Charlotte Rae Lubotsky in Milwaukee, on April 22, 1926, she had studied drama at Northwestern University, then moved to New York where, despite early plans to be a “serious” actress, she quickly found work doing satirical sketches in Greenwich Village clubs. 
It was there that Broadway producers, who frequented such bistros, discovered her, leading to her first Broadway musical, called Three Wishes for Jamie, in 1952. A few years later, she originated the srole of Mammy Yokum in the Broadway musical Li’l Abner. 
Rae made numerous TV appearances in 1950s drama anthologies including The U.S. Steel Hour, Playhouse 90 and Armstrong Circle Theater, sharing the black-and-white screen with such actors as Zero Mostel, Art Carney and Gertrude Berg. 
In 1961 she became a semi-regular on the New York-based cop sitcom Car 54, Where Are You? as the wife of the NYPD officer played by future Munsters grandpa Al Lewis. 
She received Tony nominations in 1966 for Pickwick and in 1969 for Morning, Noon and Night. 
In the early 1970s, Rae moved to Los Angeles with her then-husband, composer and music editor John Strauss, and their sons Andy and Larry. There she was cast in the short-lived Norman Lear sitcom Hot L Baltimore and a similarly unsuccessful variety show hosted by Rich Little before scoring Diff’rent Strokes, on which Mrs. Garrett was the family’s housekeeper. 
Rae stayed busy with film and stage appearances, including 1971’s Bananas from Woody Allen and 1979’s Hair. Other credits included the 2008 comedy You Don’t Mess with the Zohan and the 2012 thriller Love Sick Love. 
In 2005, at age 79, she appeared in a new comedy, Leading Ladies, at Ford’s Theater in Washington. 
In 2013, Rae went public with an account of why her marriage to Strauss had ended in the mid-1970s after a quarter-century. She said he disclosed to her he was bisexual and wanted an open marriage. Strauss died in 2011. 
In addition to son Larry, she is survived by sister Miriam Guten and three grandchildren. 
Services were pending, Boll said.

Netflix’s Insatiable slammed for fat-shaming ","Netflix’s new series Insatiable, hitting screens on Friday, was touted by the streaming service as a dark comedy meant to spark debate on society’s ills. 
Instead, critics have slammed it as fat-shaming, homophobic and denigrating to transgender people.
The offbeat show follows the story of overweight teen Patty, who is mocked and bullied incessantly until she has an accident that requires her jaw be wired shut — which causes her to shed significant weight.
Diet culture
With her new svelte figure, she vows to seek revenge on all those who attacked her, notably by participating in beauty contests.
The trailer prompted fierce backlash from critics accusing the show of body-shaming.
It perpetuates “not only the toxicity of diet culture, but the objectification of women’s bodies,” read a petition launched last month.
With the show’s release on Friday, the petition – which calls for the series’ cancellation — had more than 2,29,400 signatures.
Some people also skewered the show for the way it portrayed homosexuality, including apparently making light of Patty’s best friend Nonnie for her repressed desire.
‘Feel proud’
In another scene, a young girl who accidentally releases a nude photo of herself says she initially “figured everyone would think I’m a slut.”
“Now they think I’m a lesbian and that’s way worse,” she says.
“Feel proud”And in another scene, Patty and a transgender woman compare being fat to being transgender, saying they both aspire to change their bodies.
“People bring with them their own emotional history and that’s what makes art amazing and TV entertaining. I’m completely aware that it’s not a show for everybody but we’re really proud of what we did.”
Netflix’s vice president of original series, Cindy Holland, said the series explores issues “satirically, in a very over-the-top way.”
Lauren Gussis, who created the show, called it “a cautionary tale about how damaging it can be to believe the outsides are more important — to judge without going deeper.” “Please give the show a chance,” she said.

All the President’s men "," When it’s winter in Lutyens’ Delhi, you’ll hear the sound of hooves on Willingdon Crescent. The mist lifts a little to reveal men on horseback in jodhpurs and maroon turrahs slip quietly into the vastness of the Presidential Estate. On Republic Day, these men, in rich ceremonial uniforms and gold braid, lead the parade escorting the Presidential cavalcade, their lanced pennants fluttering in the breeze. Who are these men that make up this elite force protecting the President of India and guarding a 245-year-old legacy that dates back to the early years of the Indian Army?
National Geographic’s The President’s Bodyguard throws the spotlight on the history and workings of the household cavalry regiment, the senior-most in the order of precedence among the units in the Indian Army. Raised in 1773 by Governor-General Warren Hastings, the President’s Bodyguard was, in its early years, composed of Mughal troopers. By the time it took on its present nomenclature in 1950, it had distinguished itself in various battles such as the Burmese wars, Sikh wars and the Java campaign — the last, a battle honour it carries to this day. Today, the unit ethnically composed of men from Haryana, Punjab and Rajasthan has been part of UN peacekeeping missions and risen to the defence of Chushul in the 1962 Sino-Indian War.
Commenting on the documentary, President of India Ram Nath Kovind says, “Ceremonial occasions like the Republic Day parade, oath-taking ceremony of a new President, or receiving a visiting head of state, are watched keenly in India and abroad. The President’s Bodyguard displays the best traditions of discipline and skills of our Armed Forces. These are untiring, dedicated and brave soldiers — as good as the best in the world. I am very proud of them.”
The documentary explores the lives of these men as part of a mounted, ceremonial unit as well as in combat roles — all personnel are trained as paratroopers. It delves into their regimental history, mirrored in their dress uniforms — among the few remaining in the world to wear napoleon boots. Since they escort and protect the President, the unit is based in Rashtrapati Bhavan, its high-vaulted stables home to horses and the vast acres practice grounds for tent-pegging. A farrier is part of the unit and the bay mounts of the PBG are allowed to wear full manes; only the regimental trumpeter has a grey charger. 
All these fascinating facts will be heard in Amitabh Bachchan’s rich baritone, who says, “The film will take viewers a step closer to the history and heritage of one of the oldest cavalry units of our homeland.”
The film premieres on NGC at 9 pm on August 15. The documentary will also be available on Hotstar.
To the last bugle call
When Partition was announced, the most remarkable division of household goods took place in the stables of the Viceroy’s House, now Rashtrapathi Bhavan. The 12-horse-drawn carriages had ornate emblems, glittering harnesses and scarlet cushions that had been put to use every time a Viceroy paraded through the capital. When it was time to divide them, Lord Mountbatten’s ADC, Lieutenant Commander Peter Howes, decided that India and Pakistan would toss for who would get the six formal state carriages in gold and the six semi-formal state carriages in silver. When the coin clattered onto the stable yard, India got to keep the gold carriages. Howes divided the harnesses, whips, boots and uniforms of the Viceroy’s Bodyguards that went with each set of carriages. In the end only one item — the ceremonial horn used by the coachmen — remained. Knowing it was of no use if broken in two, Howes decided to keep it. Howes went on to become a Rear Admiral and the horn found pride of place in his living room.

It’s more than just a feminine touch ","Since quite a long time, in most of the working areas considered for a long time as male domain, women have stepped in and made their presence felt in Bangalore. Take the case of M.R. Laksmamma who is among those rare models who balanced her domestic and social roles efficiently. In spite of being married by the time she was a ten year old, and becoming a mother of seven children, she pursued her studies, graduated and won gold medal in MA examination. Thanks to the support of her family. 
She was very much concerned with the issues of women welfare. In 1945 she was elected unopposed to the Mysore State Legislature. On September 4, 1947 along with. H.C Dasappa and T. Sunandamma, she took an active part in the agitation for the demand of responsible Government in Mysore State. When she was jailed, she had four children and had to leave them with family members. At the prison, she closely studied the pitiable condition of women inmates. She taught them reading, writing and simple calculations. Once she was released, After the release she became an even more stronger activist of the Congress party. She was responsible for the formation of several women organizations including Mahila Mandali Educational Institution which is going strong even today in N.R. Colony, South Bangalore. 
In 1954 AICC meet was held in Sadashivanagar. M.R. Laksmamma was the convener of the women wing. This brought her close to Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi and some other top leaders of Congress. This helped her to widen her sector of service to women. 
All these abilities enabled her to get selected to go to America to study their administrative mechanism. In addition to the given task she even met the vice-president Nixon and Patricia Nixon and discussed in length about the measures taken by them to empower the women. Throughout her tour of America and other countries she used to send her observations regularly to ‘Sodari’ a weekly magazine run by her for women. These well recorded and preserved documents are guidelines and eye openers for the present day elected representatives going abroad for study tours at the cost of public money.
In addition to ably managing various responsible posts, she worked as Girl Guides Commissioner for over two decades and was honoured with Silver Elephant national Award. It is through her initiative Consumer Protection Forum came into existence in 1970. 
In short, M.R. Lakshmamma stands out as a role model to the present day women administrators, politicians and 98 women corparators of BBMP
P.R. Jayalakshmamma is another example of a young girl married at the age of 12, but through her innate talent she grows to gain a prominent place in the who’s who of the city during 1960s. Her husband P.R. Ramaiah was a staunch follower of Mahatma Gandhi, and ran a very popular news paper namely Tayinadu. Influenced by his ideals and principles Jayalakshmamma also actively involved herself in social reformation movements. She was the vice chairman of the Social Welfare Board for quite some time. She was closely associated with several welfare organisations like the Abalashrama, Ashakta Poshaka Sabha etc. she ran a school and orphanage started by the Gokulam Educational Society. She was also a member of the Congress and later the Janata party. She represented Wilson Garden ward as a corporator during the late 50s and early 60s. These words of Justice Hombe Gowda epitomize the magnitude of her contribution to the growth of the city. ‘ … This Wilson Garden Area was a jungle site. Smt. P.R. Jayalaksmamma by her great and continued efforts has converted it into a beautiful extension.. Her work is appreciated by one and all. We, the residents of Wilson Garden are very grateful to her…’ She was also the first Deputy Mayor of Bangalore during 1963-1964. In this capacity also strived hard to improve the conditions of schools, hospitals, libraries run by the corporation .
Mahila Seva Samaja in Basavanagudi, ,more than a century old educational institution stands testimony to the service rendered by the ladies in the field of Education. In 1913, Parvati Chandrashekhara Aiyer founded this with a sole intention of to assist women to be independent. 
After about one hundred years even to the prestigious institution is completely managed by the women. Though Parvati was married at the age of nine, later with the help of oratory, which was a God given gift to her, she led the movement against the child marriage. She was also actively involved with her husband in Theosophy movement in Bangalore. 
When she was honored with Kaiser-i-Hind medal by the British, in January 1927, Right Honorable Srinivasa Shastry wrote that it was an honour to all the woman of India. In 1928, along with her husband Justice Chandrashekara Ayer she had gone to Delhi to meet the viceroy to make him realize the urgent need to focus on women’s empowerment in the country. She died there in a freak accident. Dignitaries like Sir M Visvesvaraya, Anni Baeasant, G.S. Arundale condoled her demise. 
The boulevard from Basavanagudi National High School to Prof Shivashankar Circle on KR Road was named after Parvati. Chandrashekar Aiyer. But it has paved the way for Namma Metro Station. A cement plaque with Parvati Chandra Shekar Aiyer Boulevard written is also missing. An elegant stone building In Vani Vilaasa Hospital premises with Parvati Chandrashekar Women’s Dispensary written on it is also gone. Yet, prestigious institutions such as Mahila Seva Samaja, and Theosophical society remind us of her invaluable contributions to the city. 
St. Marthas Hospital on Nrupatunga Road was started by Good Shepherd Sisters in 1886. Impressed by their selfless dedicated service to the people here, the Maharaja of Mysore gave them land of about 20 acres to continue their service to the city. What started as a fifty bed hospital has grown to become a globally known multi-specialty hospital. Hrudaya Pushpa was sent to Bangalore from Bombay about six decades ago with rupees 50 to start the Brahma Kumari Eswariya Kendra in Bangalore. 
But today, the organisation is a real feminine force, clad in white attire working for spiritual enlightenment of common people.
Sophia High School, Mount Carmel College on Palace Road, Mitralaya school on Mission Road, Karunalaya on Bull Temple Road, Sharada Stree Samaja, Women’s Peace League in Basavanagudi, Mahila Hindi Shikshana Samiti in Chamarajapete, Malleswaram Entrepreneurial Women’s Society, Malleshwaram Ladies Association, Sri Ramakrishna Vivekananda Balakiyara Vidyalaya in Cantonment Sumangali Sevashrama near Hebbal are only a few of the very big list of great ventures under taken by the feminine force.
These are random examples to show the magnitude of the contribution of women in various other fields like, journalism, literature, theatre, fine arts, research, science and technology, IT-BT etc.

'Succession': The family that plots together
","The TV family drama, once a soap opera template that spawned a thousand episodes, has come of age in the post-digital world. Troubled childhood impacting adult lives (Ray Donovan), the black sheep putting lives of his near-and-dear ones in peril (Bloodline), the household that controls the fate of a nation (Tyrant) - family sagas now walk a tightrope between fraying relationships and darker themes.
The newest entrant to this dysfunctional-relatives-out-to-get-one-another genre is HBO’s Succession, about one of America’s richest business families, the Roys, choking under the stronghold of a ruthless patriarch. Brian Cox plays a Rupert Murdoch-styled media mogul, Logan Roy, who refuses to entrust his children with the family business after earning octogenarian status. The show begins with Logan turning 80, and changing his mind about ceding the CEO position to Kendall, the only offspring who seems worthy of succession.
Adam McKay (The Big Short) directs one of the year’s best pilots, setting the tone with an episode that’s tightly-knit, tense and firing-on-all-cylinders from the get-go. Kendall is in the middle of an acquisition that could accelerate his ascent to the throne even as he’s forced to look over his shoulders, lest his own father snatch away his shot at glory. His siblings Roman and Shiv, and step-brother Connor, have their own idiosyncrasies, each of them hungry for their father’s ever-wavering attention. 
Two other members of the extended family, Shiv’s fiancee Tom, and cousin Greg, compete for oddball status. 
Creator Jesse Armstrong gives you characters that are, at once, fascinating as they are spite-inducing, each of them using their clout to clamp down on less fortunate entities. A particularly uncomfortable moment in the first episode has Roman enticing the gardener’s kid with the possibility of winning a million dollars if he hits a home run in a game of baseball. Roman nonchalantly snatches the bat from the young boy at the end of the challenge, tearing the cheque into pieces and walking away. 
Privilege doesn’t necessarily make you empathetic, and the Roys are a particularly merciless bunch. There is really no character worth rooting for here; only those you hate less. Kendall is the one who comes nearest to ‘protagonist’ tag, and actor Jeremy Strong brings a mix of naked ambition and desperate vulnerability to a character you can never decide is worthy of being rooted for or not. 
After starting on a strong note (the brilliant second episode is set entirely in the confines of a hospital over a single night), Succession meanders for a bit, with greater emphasis on business dealings and Machiavellian one-upmanship. The show, however, settles into a comfortable rhythm around the midway mark, when relationships begin to unravel. Each episode in the latter half of the 10-part season is underlined with a sense of breathless urgency, and intrigue. 
A special mention about the Nicholas Brittel-created theme song, which you can use as an imaginary background score while inventing schemes to outmanoeuvre rivals in the real world.
The first season of Succession is now available for streaming on Hotstar

'Alex, Inc.': Beginning of the end ","Scroll through Zach Braff’s Twitter feed, and you will find him joining the ranks of other celebrities like Jim Carrey and Chrissy Teigen, deriding Donald Trump’s hyperbolic tweets. Scroll all the way back to March, and you will find him enthusiastically promoting Alex, Inc., the ABC sitcom that he starred in, directed, and served as executive producer for. Co-starring Indian-American actress Tiya Sircar (The Good Place, The Intern), the show is based on the real-life story of Alex Blumberg, the father of two who left his job in radio to launch his own start-up — a podcast.
Unfortunately for Braff, the show — which premières in India on August 28 — was not renewed for a second season despite the actor’s optimism about its premise. “I thought the original podcast made the basis for a great TV show,” he says. “I never heard anything like it. It was raw — they were so willing to record the embarrassing moments.”
Silicon Valley aura
In the single-camera sitcom, Braff — who returns to network television after eight years (his last role was as Dr John Dorian on the hit show, Scrubs) — chronicles his journey to find venture capital funding for his start-up. At the co-working space that he has recently joined, 20-something tech enthusiasts work on prototypes for their projects (example: a baby rocker that puts your child to sleep). Alex is older, has little experience in the world of start-ups, and faces the pressure of a mortgage and a fast-dwindling budget. “I love that our story is about a guy in his late 30s,” says Sircar. “The idea is that it is never too late to go for it.”




India calling
In real life, Blumberg’s wife Nazanin is of Persian origin, but after Sircar was confirmed as the female lead, her character, Arunima ‘Rooni’ Schuman, was adapted. “The producers really wanted to tailor-make this character for me, which has never happened to me in Hollywood before,” she shares. “Rooni became Indian, more specifically, Bengali-American. I am pretty excited to be portraying a character who’s so close to who I am really in life,” says Sircar, whose own parents were interviewed by the show’s producers to ensure that Rooni’s Indian heritage was accurately portrayed.
For Braff, who has dabbled with more directorial work after Scrubs (projects include the Morgan Freeman-starrer Going in Style and Wish I Was Here), the appeal of Alex, Inc. was its relatability. “It is a very prevalent thing in our country where individuals and families think of being their own boss,” says the actor, who has not announced any new projects since the show’s release.
Alex Inc. will première on August 28 on Comedy Central India

 The priest, who conducted the puja at Priyanka’s residence, said it was for peace and their well-being.
“The puja started a little over 10.30 a.m. and it lasted for about four hours. We performed Grah Shanti, Ganesh Puja, Aarti and havan. It was done for their peace and well-being. They both looked very nice together. We just wish them a long and happy life,” priest 
“Nick is a very humble person. He just followed the rituals. Priyanka used to explain things to him,” Kamal Kumar Mishra, told PTI.
 In the first photos from the ceremony, Priyanka and Nick were seen in traditional Indian attires.
 A photo from the ceremony showed the couple standing in front of background bearing their first initials.
 Priyanka opted for a yellow Abu Jani Sandeep Khosla salwar suit, Nick donned a ivory kurta churidar for the occasion.
 The designer duo also posted a picture from the ceremony.
“LOVE AGLOW! Priyanka Chopra is heavenly in Abu Jani Sandeep Khosla Couture at her Roka Ceremony. Here’s wishing the beautiful couple every Joy,” they captioned the photo on their official Instagram page.
 Nick’s parents, Denise Miller-Jonas and Paul Kevin Jonas, who arrived on Thursday, also opted for Indian wear.
 Priyanka’s cousin Parineeti Chopra, Salman Khan’s sister Arpita Khan Sharma and screenwriter Mushtaq Sheikh were present at the function.
 Preparations for the ceremony were going on in full swing since morning at Priyanka’s Juhu residence.
 Nick arrived here with his parents on Thursday and they were received by Priyanka at the Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport.
 Last night, the couple went for a dinner along with their families at JW Marriott Hotel in Juhu.
 The couple will reportedly be throwing a party for their friends and family at her residence tonight to celebrate their engagement. The bash is expected to be attended by a host of celebrities.
 The singer reportedly proposed to Priyanka on her birthday in July this year. 
Priyanka, who is currently in Mumbai to shoot for Shonali Bose’s film “The Sky is Pink”, was spotted wearing the ring at designer Manish Malhotra’s party recently.
 The duo sparked dating speculations when they were photographed enjoying multiple dates over Memorial Day weekend.
 Nick had met Priyanka’s family in June and even spent quality time with them in Goa. The couple had also posed for the shutterbugs during the the engagement party of Mukesh Ambani’s son Akash.
 But it is for the first time that parents from both the sides are meeting.
 Nick had already introduced the actor to his family members when she had attended the wedding of his cousin in the U.S.

Podcast review: In The Dark
"," It’s like a scene out of the Netflix sci-fi thriller series Stranger Things. It’s a warm October night in an idyllic country town; three young boys are cycling home from a video rental store, when they are waylaid by a stranger with a gun. He forces two of them into a ditch, grabs the third and drives away. The two boys run home to raise an alarm. Search parties scour the area in a widening circle all night, and several days after, but there is no sign of the missing boy nor any clues of where — and how — he may have been taken. 
The disappearance of Jacob Wetterling from St. Joseph’s, Minnesota, in 1989 was a turning point in public attitudes and legal provisions relating to sex offenders in the U.S., leading to the establishment of a national registry of sex offenders and crimes against children. It was also a case that remained unsolved for close to three decades, despite unprecedented police attention and resources.
In asking what went wrong, investigative journalist Madeleine Baran of the U.S.-based APM Reports unravels a history of poor crime-solving, a lack of accountability, and the damage this inflicted on so many. It is a story painstakingly documented and told in riveting detail.
In the Dark is a true crime podcast with a difference. It begins with the crime but then goes on to interrogate the larger system of law enforcement. The first season, focused on the Wetterling case, researched the law enforcement machinery in Stearns County, Minnesota, trying to understand how the case had been dealt with and the ways in which it changed the fabric of life in the county. 
Through nine episodes, we journey with Baran through the various layers of the story: the event, the search, the media circus, the movement to establish the registry (a primary advocate of which was Jacob’s mother Patty Wetterling), overlooked clues, missed opportunities, collateral damage and finally, the truth of what happened.




Unlike many true crime stories, the focus is not on the morbid details of the crime, but on the social, legal, and scientific mechanisms that can help or hinder its resolution. The solid investigative reporting draws on data (at one point, Baran invokes the Freedom of Information Act to try to get county-level statistics on crime solving), in-depth interviews, and careful scrutiny of information. The series won a Peabody Award in 2017, for being “deftly incisive in telling the human tale” and “full and unrelenting in its attention to broader policy implications.”
Racial tensions
In season two, Baran and her team turn their attention to the trial of Curtis Flowers, an African-American man who, over the past 21 years, has been tried six times for the same crime, and been sentenced to death each time. He has maintained his innocence over the years, just as the prosecutor has maintained guilt. Baran spent a year in Montgomery County, Mississippi, getting to know Flowers’ family, the community, and the racial tensions that inevitably lie beneath the surface of the American South. 
As in season one, each episode goes into a specific aspect of the investigation and the trials, featuring interviews with witnesses and expert commentary on the forensic evidence (I learned, for instance, that the history of lineup-based identification suggests that it is one of the leading causes of wrongful conviction). One episode has Baran and her team sifting through some 8,000 court records in an abandoned warehouse to understand the county’s pattern of policing (a video of this exercise is on the In the Dark website), while APM reporter Will Craft put together a database from countrywide court records to determine the role of race in jury selection (now publicly available on GitHub). 
Unlike season one, however, Flowers’ story has not ended. He is awaiting another trial (and Baran’s reporting has yielded evidence that the defence hopes will exonerate him), even as the prosecutor continues to press for guilt and the death penalty.
True crime is one of the fastest growing and most popular genres in the podcast universe — which is not a surprise, given the TV success of this genre, a reflection of our fascination with the seamier side of life. But In the Dark moves us beyond this fascination, with an intelligent and searching look at the deep-rooted social and often systemic failures that keep justice from being served. It’s also a call-out to the value of the earnest pursuit of local stories, seemingly small, obscure events that affect people not often in the limelight, stories that give us unexpected insights into ourselves and our times.

The miracle did not happen ","From standing with folded hands with a flower adorning his ears and singing ‘Ammavum Neeye’ as a mere four year old to penning and crooning an ode to his screen mother in ‘Vishwaroopam 2’ Kamal Haasan has come a long way and it’s not just the way his name is spelt or pronounced. First donning grease paint as a four-year-old he’s moved on to wearing various cinematic hats and has excelled in each ‘avtaar’ spanning a career spread over 59 years save a few as a gawky teenager. I realise it’s nearly four decades since I first barged into his Alwarpet office and interviewed him on the eve of the release of ‘Varumayin Niram Sivappu’. He had already appeared in more than 100 films and was the only actor with super-hits in all the four South Indian languages. He still is and you can add Hindi to that. I carried a tape recorder the size of a briefcase and Kamal was worried if the batteries would last. Well the last time I interviewed him I recorded with my mobile phone. Kamal has always embraced technology instead of feeling intimidated or threatened. For a school dropout his English was impeccable. 
He’s the reason I started watching Tamil films: a Telugu speaking neighbour insisted I watch ‘16 Vayadhinile’ and I was hooked enough to revisit his earlier films that were getting re-released. His versatility, even then was striking be it playing a Malayalee ventriloquist in ‘Avargal’, the buck toothed imbecile in ‘Kalyanaraman’ or the married guy with the glad eye in ‘Manmatha Leelai’. He refined Sivaji Ganesan’s style of acting and his exposure to world cinema helped him hone his skills. He admonished me for terming Sivaji’s style as overacting and asked me to watch his earlier films. The cinematic climate was conducive too with talents like Bharathi Rajaa and Balu Mahendra emerging. There was Ilayaiyaraja whose music could elevate mundane emotions and cinematographers like Ashok Kumar. Every director worth his megaphone wanted to work with Kamal and unlike now he was open to talents like Rudhriah who made ‘Aval Appadithan’. He effortlessly shrugged off getting typecast. Even the humungous success of ‘Sakala Kala Vallavan’ could not lure him into commercial complacence. The decade after 1980 saw his acting skills coming to the fore with films ranging from ‘Raja Parvai’ to ‘Pushpaka Vimanam’, ‘Sagar Sangamam’ and ‘Nayakan’ to ‘Apoorva Sahodarargal’. Shahrukh Khan told me Kamal was better than De Niro and Pacino put together. I would add Chaplin and Brando. If he did imitate occasionally it was imperceptible and his way of paying homage and his comic timing is magical. It was also the decade where he wasted his talent in mindless Hindi films. The best thing that happened to his career was the failure of his Hindi films.
Kamal’s most repeated line during interviews is that he was a reluctant actor. Differences with Shantanu Shorey during the Hindi version of ‘Avvai Shanmukhi’ forced Kamal to make his directorial debut though he was accused of being a closet director in most of his projects. “Well it’s my neck on the line and I do it only when I realise the director is inept,” he told me which is true and Mani Ratnam will vouch for that. His decision to give up films for politics has shocked fans especially since he’s always insisted politics was not a natural progression as it is for most Tamil stars. The trauma he underwent to release ‘Vishwaroopam’ was the trigger, I assume. The question probably was who can protect you when the so-called protectors harassed you? Not many are giving him a chance in his new role. In fact diehard fans are wishing he loses and gets back to doing what he does best. 
The reactions to ‘Vishwaroopam 2’’ like most of his works is extreme. His recent films have left a lot to be desired be it the unnecessary ‘Thoongavanam’ or ‘Utthama Villain’ which for a Kamal starrer left you emotionally unmoved. It’s disheartening to see the indifference when the release of a Rajni or Kamal starrer approaches if devoid of controversy or hoopla. Is it generational? Are they committing the same mistakes our generation accused MGR and Sivaji of, playing characters too young for their age? 
Meanwhile a brief review of ‘V2’ would be that it’s way better than a Vijay or Ajith pot-boiler but falls woefully short of the movie miracle that we’ve come to expect each time Kamal appears on-screen.

Funny one-liners, flimsy plot
","A signboard says, “King’s council in session. Eavesdroppers will be dropped from eaves,” and a one-liner from Bean goes like this, “I drank so much, I can’t remember if I drank anything.”
The creator of the nearly three-decade-long-running animated sitcom The Simpsons, Matt Groening, comes to the house of Netflix with Disenchantment, an animated fantasy series that’s set in the medieval period.
Indians might look at the landscape of Dreamland, a fictional town ruled by King Zog, in Disenchantment, and immediately compare it to the grandeur of Baahubali’s Mahishmati. There’s a river that runs through the towns, lots of houses and tiny shops, and a host of bumbling characters in both of them that it makes me wonder if these writers are drawing their materials from a common pool of imagination.
While Mahishmati doesn’t include elfs, demons, griffins, and 12-feet-giants, Groening’s Netflix offering is generously peppered with these forms of living creatures, and it pokes fun at them at every given opportunity. The dark humour, that the creator and his writers dunk their characters in, is reminiscent of another brilliant animated show, BoJack Horseman, where animals, humans, and birds live in a world that doesn’t discriminate the beings based on their appearances.
For a standard set-up such as this, Disenchantment has humour and suspense in unequal measures. The series opens with a gambling princess (Tiabeanie, also called Bean; and voiced by Abbi Jacobson), and we follow her story for quite some time till she is joined by a demon named Luci (voiced by Eric Andre), who’s kind of modelled on the darker side that we all have inside of us – hence the total blackness of the character – and, an elf named Elfo (voiced by Nat Faxon), who has abandoned the jolly land of Elfwood to understand the miseries of the world because he’s always made to sing happy songs.
Groening’s strength seems to be in developing quirky visual gags. A signboard says, “King’s council in session. Eavesdroppers will be dropped from eaves,” and a one-liner from Bean goes like this, “I drank so much, I can’t remember if I drank anything.” These ingenious images and dialogues drive the show forward, but it’s hard to figure out the larger curve it’s going for. The traces it leaves behind, as, when one looks back, is nothing but a series of hilarious memes. If you’re digging for coherence and light knuckle-punches at pop culture in this scripted show, this may bypass your expectations and give you something you hadn’t signed up for.
The various supporting characters are also present to add an extra edge to the sight-and-sound jokes – a three-eyed minister hides his third-eye below the cap he wears, a groom-to-be turns into a pig, and a scientist tortures Elfo to extract his blood to make the elixir of life. And, even here, all the dialogues don’t sparkle with fire and ecstasy since Luci and Elfo pull strings from different corners and it becomes a game of bad-versus-good soon enough.
But the connection between Disenchantment and life in India isn’t just built over the Baahubali Bridge. Princess Bean is strictly not in the mood to get married, and, yet, she wants to be loved by a person who doesn’t see her as a princess. Likewise, there’s a whole truckload of mother sentiment – Bean is raised by a nanny, and the absence of her real mother is a cause of worry – that’s closer to what the Indian writers produce on a regular basis compared to their counterparts in the West. If not for anything remarkable, at least, for these homegrown elements, the series rings a loud bell. 
Groening may not have reached for the stars altogether, nevertheless, he has, certainly, made spacecrafts for future creators to hop on and explore the area of fantasy universes. In that sense, Groening is to American television, and Netflix, what Hayao Miyazaki is to Japanese anime.

Bring on the laughs "," A dash of stand up comedy, lots of improvisation, and a ton of audience interaction. These are what the performers have promised to give Bengaluru tonight at a marquee show, organised as part of Black Dog Easy Evenings. The event brings together the talents of Papa CJ, Cyrus Sahukar, Danish Sait and The Improv, hosted by Saad Khan. 




After shows in Delhi and Hyderabad, the performers are in our city tonight and the act promises much variety, with a stand up set by Papa CJ followed by improv comedy by The Improv, where Sahukar joins Sait, Anil Abraham, Darius Sunawala and Khan for on-the-spot shenanigans with some assistance from the audience. “Beware the front row,” CJ warns light-heartedly. 
For Khan, who is a veteran at Improv, having started The Improv group six years ago and having Sahukar and CJ on board has been good fun. “Cyrus comes from a crazy history of comedy, and he has been at it for the longest time. CJ also joins us for a couple of scenes, and both these guys are naturals. Cyrus, like Danish, is great at characters, and when you have characters the scene is automatically elevated from just punchlines to the journey of a story.”




The mutual camaraderie is something all the performers enjoy. “Stand up can be lonely because you tend to write and perform alone, so it was a refreshing change to work with the others,” says CJ, a sentiment Sahukar echoes, “Improv is not about the individual. If you enjoy making it about yourself then you should not do it. I think as human beings, if you are part of a collective, you just feel better about performing.” 
The unpredictability of Improv is part of what makes if fun, feels Sait. “To be honest, neither us nor the audience know what we are running into. There are many unknowns, but then a magic happens, it all comes together and in the end we have a known. Improv gets better with time, because the craft gets better but the stage remains the same. It is great to be performing with others who are happy in their own space and no one is trying to outdo each other.”




Sahukar mentions that the format of the show lets the performers unwind and be themselves. “I enjoy the feeling of uncertainty and assured failure. You are going to mess up somewhere for sure and that is part of the fun. You never have the same show twice and you and the audience all become apart of one big act.” He confirms that his strength at playing characters has helped in improv. “Not being myself has worked out pretty well,” he laughs.
Performing in Bengaluru, which is essentially home turf for half the team, has the whole act geared up. “Bengaluru is a city I come to a lot,” says Sahukar, “And we have never had an empty show. People here just have an interest in variety and turn up no matter what.”
The Black Dog Easy Evenings marquee show will be held on August 24 at UB City at 8 pm, before heading to Mumbai tomorrow and Kolkata on September 21.

“We, along with the cast, writers and crew, are extremely appreciative of the show's success and aim to deliver a final season, and series finale, that will bring 'The Big Bang Theory' to an epic creative close,” the statement added.
“There are many ways to look at the dozen years of 'Big Bang Theory' as we draw to a close, but for me it will be the family that gathered each week to create a true labor of love,” tweeted co-creator Bill Prady. “I will treasure my Big Bang family to the end of my days.”
There’s also a UCLA scholarship created by and named for the series to support undergrad study in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM).
Season 12 of “Big Bang” premieres on September 24.

Forbes list: Akshay Kumar world’s 7th highest-paid actor, Salman Khan in 9th place "," Akshay Kumar has emerged as the seventh highest-paid actor in the world by earning USD 40.5 million in 2018, according to Forbes magazine.
The “Gold” actor is closely followed by his contemporary Salman Khan in the ninth place, raking in USD 38.5 million.
Kumar and Khan are the only two Bollywood actors to make it to the top 10 highest-paid actors list, compiled by the publication.
 Kumar, who came in 10th last year, upped his game by USD 3 million. Khan stayed at his ninth rank, but with an increase of USD 1.5 million this year. Shah Rukh Khan, who was at the eighth spot on the 2017 list, did not find a place in 2018. 
The list has been topped by Hollywood star George Clooney, who scored a career-high pre-tax paycheque of USD 239 million between June 1, 2017 and June 1, 2018. Clooney was followed by Dwayne Johnson, who banked USD 124 million pretax to rank. 
“Avengers: Infinity War” star Robert Downey Jr, earned USD 81 million to book the third place. His co-star, Chris Hemsworth came in at number four with USD 64.5 million earnings.
 The combined earnings of world’s 10 highest-paid actors come at a total USD 748.5 million between June 1, 2017, and June 1, 2018, before fees and taxes.

Cirque on steroids: the circus comes to India
"," Over a period of three decades, Cirque du Soleil has developed more than 42 productions that have toured to approximately 450 cities. They have all premièred in the company’s hometown of Montreal before hitting new territories. In November, the norm changes. For the first time ever, Cirque du Soleil premieres its new show, Bazzar, outside Canada — first in Mumbai and then Delhi — before taking it to other countries. 
Written and directed by Susan Gaudreau, Bazzar pays homage to the founders of Cirque du Soleil, Guy Laliberté and Gilles Ste-Croix, buskers who established the company in 1984. Today, it is worth hundreds of millions of dollars. 
“I wanted to tap into the essence of what makes Cirque du Soleil so unique,” explains Gaudreau, who is hugely inspired by Indian cinema. Naturally, the first show to debut in the country would have to reflect her passion and “the song and dance of Bollywood with its rich colours and drama”. 
“I really wanted to do something that Indians could relate to,” she adds. While the director readily admits the influences of Bazzar, she is quick to clarify that it is not a show specifically for India. 






Full house
With 30 performers on stage, including 22 acrobats, two live musicians and a singer, Bazzar’s plot reflects the workings of a circus company. It is the story of a maestro putting together an ambitious performance, not unlike a Cirque du Soleil production. His troupe of eclectic artists includes the floating woman — a trickster hell bent on sparring with the maestro, and who ends up intentionally botching his plans. “So there’s this dynamic between the two main characters about who’s going to come on top,” explains Gaudreau, adding that Simon Carpentier, Bazzar’s composer, developed a new genre of music — folk electronica with lyrics in English, Spanish and French — for the show. “It’s a type of live music that has [instruments like] the saxophone and banjo and is very roots-based, but its bass is electronica.” 
To reflect the aesthetic of the show, costume designer James Lavoie zeroed in on the works of contemporary 20th century artists, conceptual architectural clothing, and street style. “Our number one priority is to make sure that the artists are comfortable and that they can fully concentrate on their performance,” says the designer. “We also use textiles and materials which are resistant. For example, moleskin is used very often for its comfort, breathability and its resistance.” In spite of its high-level renegade theme, the show also promises classic circus entertainment with dual trapeze acts, acrobatic bikes, contortionists, cord lisse (aerial ropes) and teeter boards. Highlights include the hairceau act, where a woman suspends herself from an aerial hoop knotted using her hair. “Every show that I create, I like to have a twist,” explains Gaudreau. “It’s either something that I never worked with before or Cirque has never worked with before,” she says, adding that the inclusion of mallakhamb — India’s answer to aerial gymastics — was a natural evolution. “It’s very exotic for us.” A first for Cirque du Soleil, two Indian mallakhamb artists, one of whom is Rajesh Mudki, will join the cast and crew from 50 nationalities.




Intimate and immersive
 As with the company’s touring norm, Bazzar comes to India in the Big Top Tent — 62 feet high and 135 feet in diameter, accommodating 1,500 people. With a mere three-day set up time, the portable venue is efficient enough to travel to both luxurious and intimate settings. “We’re packing up everything in road cases in Montreal as we speak,” says Daniel Lamarre, president and CEO of Cirque Du Soleil. 700 tonnes of equipment will then make its way to Mumbai in sea containers. “The Big Top Tent is more intimate and more immersive. It’s almost like Cirque on steroids, meaning that you’re going to be seated so close to the artists that you’ll see the sweat fall off their faces,” he laughs.
***
At home in Mumbai
Bazzar is the first event in Maharashtra to receive a single window clearance from state authorities. V K Gautam, principal secretary, Tourism and Cultural Affairs Department, Government of Maharashtra, has confirmed that the development of an online portal is underway to ensure speedy clearances for future events. With this collaboration, Lamarre expects to create revenue of more than $15 million for the state thanks to the influx of tourists. The partnership with India, he hopes, will be long-lived. He is particularly keen to bring the Cirque du Soleil’s social initiatives to the country (existing programs in other cities include working with at-risk youth ). He has not dismissed the idea of creating a permanent venue (à la Las Vegas) in Mumbai either.
Bazzar premieres on November 15 at MMRDA Grounds, BKC. Tickets, priced at ₹1,250 onwards, are available on bookmyshow.com

Chip and beast
"," “I’m just the messenger. The message is from Nature.” This is the disclaimer that follows every segment of Thank You for Sharing, a new short-format sketch comedy podcast from Saavn’s in-house creative team. 
Hosted by Chip (Chirag Lakhani), who gives quirky facts about animals — like octopus, hippos, anacondas, bats, kangaroos, etc — each of the 12 episodes is sponsored by a fictitious service or product, voiced by Abhimanyu Mullick, Ishani Dasgupta and Shrey Sahjwani. Sketch comedy has been relatively unexplored in the audio world, especially in India. Lakhani says, “When we came up with the idea of having a guy on a beach, giving you animal facts, we thought it was funny, but we weren’t sure that anyone would want to sponsor a show like this. So, we created our own sponsors.”




Each episode opens with an advertisement from a fake, and hilarious, sponsor, followed by a real animal fact. To close the show, there is a sketch about what the product advertised earlier would be like if it were real. For instance, there is the Hmm App — which steps in during long, one-sided phone conversations that require little else from you except the occasional grunt to indicate that you are still on the line. The sketch demonstrates how the makers use it in their helpline, with chuckle-worthy results. Another innovative “service” is the Designated Drinker. If you like to socialise but do not want to take a cab back home, get someone to drink for you instead. The punchlines and sound gags make the three-to-four-minute-long episodes quite enjoyable, and draws a number of laughs. 
Mullick says that comedy is not an easy genre, no matter the medium. “Sketches generally translate better when there’s video that drives the jokes home. In the world of audio, that luxury cannot be afforded. While it had its challenges, the show was a tonne of fun to produce, and we’re looking forward to a second season soon, with more video packages.” 
Thank You for Sharing is available now on Saavn.

Raj Kapoor’s iconic RK Studio up for sale
"," Actor-filmmaker Raj Kapoor’s RK studio is up for sale — 70 years after it was established — as it is not “economically viable” to rebuild it after it was gutted in a fire last year, says the late actor’s elder son, Randhir Kapoor .
 Founded by Raj Kapoor in 1948 in suburban Chembur, the studio witnessed several films made by the Kapoor family over the decades. 
On September 16 last year, a major fire broke out on the sets of dance reality show ‘Super Dancer’ at the studio in which its ground floor was gutted. No casualty was reported in the mishap.
While actor Rishi Kapoor had earlier expressed a desire to rebuild the studio with “state-of-the-art technology,” his brother Randhir said it was not practical.
“Yes, we have taken the decision to sell RK Studio. It is already up for sale. After the fire, it is not viable to build the studio again,” Randhir said.
 The films made under the RK banner include Aag, Barsaat, Awaara, Shri 420, Jis Desh Mein Ganga Behti Hai, Mera Naam Joker, Bobby, Satyam Shivam Sundaram, Ram Teri Ganga Maili, among others. 
The last film made under the banner was the Rishi Kapoor-directed Aa Ab Laut Chalen.
When Raj Kapoor passed away in 1988, Randhir took over the studio. Later, his younger brother Rajiv Kapoor directed Prem Granth.

Stories of man and nation "," The turbulent life and trial of South African athlete Oscar Pistorius, also referred to as the ‘Blade Runner’ for his athletic feats on prosthetic blades, will be the central narrative of Pistorius, a four-part documentary set to stream on Amazon Prime Video. Directed by Vaughan Sivell, also known for his documentary on champion boxer Joe Calzaghe, Pistorius dives into the circumstances surrounding Pistorius’ murder of his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp in 2013, and his drawn-out trial, set against the backdrop of South Africa’s journey as a nation. 
Sivell says that this parallel between Pistorius’ life and South Africa's growth is one of the reasons that drew him to the project. “When I looked into Oscar’s story, something that struck me as poignant was that Oscar and new South Africa were more or less the same age, and that both, because of circumstances, would have had very low expectations. Yet, Oscar managed to achieve so much as an athlete and South Africa became the rainbow nation under Mandela. Then you jump forward to a point in history where Oscar is on trial and somewhere his defence team blames the state of South Africa where crime is so high that a rich, white man hears a bang in the night, grabs his gun and shoots. The history of the country and the history of the man sort of collided at that point.”
Sivell explains that the team behind the documentary went to painstaking lengths to ensure accuracy, including getting the go-ahead from Pistorius to interview his family. 




The second half of the series, Sivell says, focuses on the trial in an attempt to dissect all available evidence. “Even though I am credited as sole director, we really were a team that worked at piecing together thousands of hours of footage and paperwork that the State and the defence dealt with. It took us three years and from day one till the end we were still discussing vital pieces of evidence, going back and forth.” 
Sivell says that the challenge was not to remain impartial, however, “It was more of a task to make sure that we did not miss out on any crucial evidence.”
Sivell goes on to draw more parallels between Pistorius and South Africa. “South Africa is a country of extremes. It is extremely beautiful, with wonderful people, but also deals with extreme poverty and a high rate of violence. In a way, what we learnt during the trial is that Oscar is also a man of extremes. 
“When he had his legs on he was the Oscar we knew, the shining superman, but when he did not have his legs he was a feeble, frightened paranoid individual. To put it another way, if you believe his story, had Oscar gone to sleep that night in Switzerland, London or Paris, Reeva might be alive today, as he would not have had a gun on him. So that parallel comes back.”
He also admits that he finds the stories of sportspersons interesting, provided he can find a good narrative to focus on. “There is no drama in the world, it seems, like the sporting life. I had done this film on the boxer Joe Calzaghe, (Mr. Calzaghe) and I thought I knew him before I did it, but what I did not know were the extremes he had to go through. As a producer, even as I was looking for another sportsperson, I realised that despite their careers, many tend to have boring lives. Oscar’s life was different in the drama that it became. You would not write a fiction as remarkable as Oscar's story, and a story like that will always attract filmmakers like me.”
The four-part series ‘Pistorius’ begins streaming on Amazon Prime worldwide from September 6.

Sadaa back in the spotlight
"," Every time actress Sadaa has a film up for release, the one thing everyone seems to ask her is: “Where did you go all these days?” By now, the Mumbai-based actor is used to these queries. At one level, she says she understands them. After all, one would have expected the star of hits such as Jayam, Anniyan and Unnale Unnale to keep churning out movies on the trot. But, that never happened. “I did some films without much thought, and would wonder why on earth I signed up for them,” she admits. And so, she took a conscious decision to move away from what was being offered. Her last release was Eli, with Vadivelu.
And then, when she was in Chennai as part of Vijay TV’s Jodi No 1, director Abdul Majith (of Tamizhan fame; the film that saw Priyanka Chopra make her début in films) met her and narrated a story about sex workers. That film is Torchlight, co-starring Riythvika. It releases this Friday after a protracted battle with the Censor Board; the director has effected 87 cuts in the film. Set in the 80s and 90s, it speaks about the plight of women who solicit customers on highways due to family circumstances, and who lead miserable lives.
“I wanted to move away from regular commercial stuff and do something more mature as an actor. I wanted to be part of a film that would have me as a performer, and one in which I enjoyed the process of making it, no matter what the outcome,” she says.
Even before this, she did get offers from many first-time directors and producers, but was wary of signing up for films that might never see the light of day. “I was surprised when he told me that this script had been rejected by many others. There was no way anyone wanting to do a good film could have rejected this! It is bold, has hard-hitting dialogues that might shock people, but is rooted in reality. And, no, contrary to what many think, it has been shot aesthetically. That was among my conditions before getting on board the film. Luckily for me, Majith sir had done his homework and research. I merely had to follow instructions.”
Sadaa says that she is happy people still miss her. And, even after all these years, there is a sense of disappointment at the offers that came her way after she proved she was heroine material. “I think that was probably because some of those films were way ahead of their time. For instance, Unnale Unnale is the kind of film that is still contemporary now.”
One reason, Sadaa says, is that she can’t bring herself to socialise and scout for offers. “Once I complete my work, I move on. I’ve been lucky that filmmakers approached me, and not the other way around,” says the actress, who has two more films coming up. And, in between all of that, she’s busy with her latest passion — veganism, and her long-time work with rescuing animals and encouraging people to adopt and not shop for pets.

Lord of the ring "," The Ashok is teeming with sport stars. Young and sprightly, they are all busy. Some are checking in for the official felicitation function. Some are stepping out to catch up on shopping related to the function. Everyone is super busy. But one young man has no moment to himself. He is actually the superstar among the sport stars. Humble and extremely introvert, he hardly comes across the 49kg gold medallist, a champion in the ring at the recent Asian Games held in Jakarta. Hardly. But Amit Panghal, the diminutive dynamite from Maina village in Haryana’s Rohtak district, rides tall amongst the sporting fraternity of the country.
I have a lunch rendezvous with Amit at Frontier, which is known to serve authentic North-West Frontier cuisine. The Ashok, it is said, is well liked for its superb dining facilities. The ambiance is refined and beautiful. At Frontier, you are treated to a visual performance of Chef Anish Kanswal’s tandoori specialities. The most popular dishes such as Pathar Kabab, and Kabab-e-Bannu offer succulent pieces of tender chicken enclosed in an egg wrapping. Dal Dera Ismail Khan, to be had with keema naan and pudina naan, figures among the most delicious dishes.
The staff at the Frontier lines up in silent admiration as Amit, proudly dangling the gold medal, walks in, takes his seat, and then tries soaking in the place. The gold medal bout is fresh. So are his memories of the journey to the podium, beginning from early days spent with brother Ajay, who was a boxer to be feared in the neighbourhood. “I have lived my brother’s dream. He is the reason why I became a boxer. I never thought of becoming a boxer. My coach (Anil Dhankar) pushed me. He had more confidence in me. His support has been invaluable for me. And, of course, Vijender Singh (Olympic boxing medallist). Vijender was the inspiration,” Amit smiles into the camera of my colleague. 
An armyman to the core, Amit saluted the National Flag at Jakarta in a fitting manner after winning the gold. At the presentation ceremony, he could not hold back his tears. “I don’t know what happened. I have heard the National Anthem so many times but I just could not hold myself back. I used to get goosebumps when hearing the National Anthem. The tears were natural. I still get emotional.” 




The gold medal at the 2018 Asian Games is big. “Very big,” Amit corrects me with his infectious smile. “The boxing family was looking for glory. Vikas (Krishan) was sure to get a medal but for the cut he suffered on the eye. This medal means so much for me because 49 kg is to be removed from the schedule and I have to compete in the 52 kg category. It is going to be hard work.”
You have to strain to hear him. Amit is a calm and composed young man, sitting across the table, just the opposite of what he is in the ring – agile and swift, so nimble footed. Is he not docile for a boxer. “Most people have a wrong impression that wrestlers and boxers should be aggressive. I remain calm mostly but sometimes I do get angry, irritated. My game is more defensive and I believe in counter attack. In small weights, speed, and not strength is what matters. Agility is an essential part of boxing. I have worked on it. But I don’t have to be needlessly aggressive and anxious.”
How about lunch? The menu offers a mouth watering variety but his choice narrows down to fruit plate. “Only fruits,” asks Nishtha Chandel, who is facilitating our visit to Frontier. The kababs appear attractive. But Amit wants to avoid heavy food.
“I am not at all fussy about food. I can eat anything. I can survive without vegetarian food. I love chicken and can eat lots of it. I need to develop my strength too. I love daal and rotis as much but nothing to beat the choorma and kheer that comes from my mother’s exceptional cuisine. I can eat anything cooked by her 365 days. She is so good,” Amit pours out his respect and affection for his mother.
When Vijender was winning the Olympic medal, Amit was starting his boxing. “His Olympic medal was a boost to boxing in India. First one in Olympics. Boxers have emerged from all corners of the country thanks to him.” Talking of inspiration, Amit has grown idolising the legendary Muhammad Ali. “He was the ultimate boxer. His punching speed was frightening. For his size, he was lightening quick on his feet. No wonder he is the greatest boxing icon.” 
Amit hails from a small village where wrestling is big. He reflects, “We have lots of wrestlers emerging from Haryana. But boxing is picking up. The state government is also encouraging. Girls are doing pride to the State. Phogat sisters have changed the scenario. Then Mary Kom has inspired women boxers. Now Vinesh Phogat has done the same in wrestling. She is a big wrestler. My grandfather was a wrestler. I was never attracted to it and then my brother took me to boxing.”
The fruit plate arrives. He concentrates on the kiwi fruit and slices of watermelon. He quickly gulps the orange juice. I know there are many waiting to interview Amit, whose life has changed from the time he became an Asian Games gold medallist. “I can see the change (within) yes. The world has changed. I am overwhelmed by the affection that has been bestowed upon me.”
At Jakarta, Manoj Kumar was his room-mate. “He motivated me before every bout. I have learnt a lot from the seniors. I would like aspirants to learn from the coaches and the seniors. Make the most of their experience. I would also like to tell you that sportsmen hardly lose temper. I hardly get angry. Never outside the ring. Never. But I do feel sad when I see the filth around. We should try and stay clean. And rape is a blot on our society. It has to be dealt with firmly.”
Dessert? “Not now. I am full,” Ami raises his arms. “I love sweets. Kheer and choorma is my favourite. My mother makes it the best. To lose 2 ½ kg before the final, I had to eat lots of fruits, juices (watermelon, orange, pineapple). Now there is no weight control. I eat whatever I get. I am physically tough. And I am mentally tough too.”
Amit, a Naib Subedar in Army, will soon travel to Pune, which is close to Mumbai. Meeting film legend Dharmendra is a secret desire for Amit. “I am a huge fan. My father (Vijender Singh) and Dhankar Sir are huge fans of Dharmendra. My father’s DP on Whatsapp has a Dharmendra photo. I love him. I have heard he used to be known as the He Man. I love his son (Sunny Deol). I can see his punches. They must have tremendous power. I have seen many of his movies many times. Wish I could meet Dharmendra ji.”
It is time for Amit, 22, to join a crew filming his appeal for Swachh Bharat. The hotel staff swarms him for selfies. He obliges them all. I have not seen champions so humble. He is indeed a rare commodity!

Academy shelves plans for ‘most popular’ Oscar
","The idea to hand out a popular film Oscar has been shelved for now following widespread backlash, but film academy president John Bailey said that the new category was well-intentioned in its efforts to reflect a changing industry and misunderstood by its critics.
The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences said on Thursday that it will further study plans for the category, citing the fact that implementing a new award three quarters of the way into the year would create challenges for films that have already been released.
The academy announced the new category for “outstanding achievement in popular film” last month without parameters, spawning immediate questions about the criteria and how it would impact critically and commercially films such as Black Panther, which has been cited as a possible best picture contender.
Mr. Bailey told The Associated Press he was surprised by the negative reaction to the new category and feels that that people did not understand its goal to give recognition to the kinds of films that are being made today.
“The idea of this award was not about trying to make sure that certain kinds of big mass market pictures get recognized. To my mind, it’s more about the kind of pictures that are so difficult to get made,” Mr. Bailey said, citing films that he worked on like The Big Chill and Ordinary People as the kind of “middle pictures” that major studios don’t make as many of and, when they do, aren’t often recognized with the film industry’s most prestigious award.
While the criteria for the new category are still not defined, Mr. Bailey said both release size and box office are part of the equation and that a film like Black Panther could be submitted and potentially win for both best picture and popular film. The same is true for an animated film.
Oscar viewership is often tied to the box-office muscle of the big nominees. Ratings for the 90th Academy Awards fell to an all-time low of 26.5 million viewers, down 19 per cent from the previous year and the first time the glitzy awards ceremony had fewer than 30 million viewers since 2008. The biggest show audience on record came in 1998, when the blockbuster Titanic was named best picture.
The last three years the best picture Oscar has gone to “smaller” films The Shape of Water, “Moonlight” and Spotlight none of which made more than $100 million at the North American box office or played in more than 3,000 theaters.
The 91st annual Oscars, to be held February 24 in Los Angeles, will undergo some changes this year, with the academy planning to shorten the ceremony to three hours. In order to do so, it plans to hand out Oscars in six to eight categories during commercial breaks. The academy also still plans to shorten the awards season by moving up the 2020 Oscars a few weeks to February 9, 2020.

Burt Reynolds, star of film, TV and tabloids, dead at 82 ","Burt Reynolds, whose good looks and charm made him one of Hollywood's most popular actors as he starred in films such as “Deliverance,” “The Longest Yard” and “Smokey and the Bandit” in the 1970s and '80s, has died at age 82.
Reynolds died on Thursday morning at the Jupiter Medical Center in Florida, his manager, Erik Kritzer, said in an email.
“It is with a broken heart that I said goodbye to my uncle today,” Reynolds' niece Nancy Lee Hess said in a statement sent to Reuters by Kritzer.
“My uncle was not just a movie icon; he was a generous, passionate and sensitive man, who was dedicated to his family, friends, fans and acting students,” she added.
Burton Leon Reynolds Jr. was born on February 11, 1936, and grew up in Florida. He was a fine athlete and played football at Florida State University in the 1950s before his professional football hopes were dashed by injuries suffered in a car crash.
He began acting after enrolling in a junior college. He moved to New York and landed minor stage and TV roles before making his film debut in 1961. Reynolds often was cast in Westerns, including the popular “Gunsmoke” television series in the 1960s.
In 1972, the same year “Deliverance” was released, he showed versatility by also starring in Woody Allen's comedy “Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex * But Were Afraid to Ask.”
Reynolds starred in romantic comedies as well, including ”Starting Over” (1979) with Jill Clayburgh and Candice Bergen, and in the musical comedy “The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas” (1982) with Dolly Parton.
His film career stalled in the mid-1980s with several misfires and he was never again a leading movie star.
Reynolds turned to television and had a successful run on the situation comedy “Evening Shade,” co-starring Marilu Henner and Charles Durning. He continued to appear in films in lesser but sometimes noteworthy roles.
He earned his only career Oscar nomination playing a porn director — a role he despised — in director Paul Thomas Anderson's “Boogie Nights” (1997), starring Mark Wahlberg.
Reynolds experienced some health issues later in his life. He underwent quintuple heart bypass surgery in 2010 and was hospitalized in intensive care in 2013 with the flu.
At the peak of his career, Reynolds was one of the most bankable actors in the film industry, reeling off a series of box office smashes until a career downturn in the mid-1980s. He rebounded in 1997 with a nomination for a best supporting actor Academy Award for “Boogie Nights,” and won an Emmy for his role in the 1990-1994 TV series “Evening Shade.”
With his trademark mustache, rugged looks and macho aura, Reynolds was a leading sex symbol of the 1970s. He once appeared naked in a centerfold in the women's magazine Cosmopolitan in 1972.
Reynolds' personal life sometimes overshadowed his movies, including marriages that ended in divorce to actresses Loni Anderson and Judy Carne and romances with Sally Field and Dinah Shore, among others. His financial woes and his struggles with prescription pain medication also generated attention.
Reynolds cited director John Boorman's Oscar-nominated 1972 ”Deliverance” as his best film and said he regretted that the hoopla from his Cosmopolitan appearance detracted from the movie that made him a star. He played tough-guy Lewis Medlock — opposite Jon Voight, Ned Beatty and Ronny Cox — in the chilling tale of a canoe trip gone bad in rural Georgia.
He starred in dozens of films, also including “White Lightning” (1973), “W.W. and the Dixie Dancekings” (1975), ”Hustle” (1975), “Nickelodeon” (1976) and “Semi-Tough” (1977). He was the top money-making star at the box office in an annual poll of movie exhibitors 1978 through 1982.
Many of Reynolds' films were set in the South. He often played a lovable rascal who outwits local authorities, as in director Hal Needham's 1977 crowd-pleasing action comedy “Smokey and the Bandit,” co-starring his girlfriend Field and Jackie Gleason, and its two sequels.
Another of his better roles was that of a former pro quarterback who lands in prison and assembles a team of convicts to play the warden's squad of brutal prison guards in 1974's rollicking “The Longest Yard,” directed by Robert Aldrich. He appeared in a supporting role in 2005's remake with Adam Sandler.
Reynolds also directed several movies in which he starred, including “Gator” (1976), “The End” (1978), “Sharky's Machine” (1981) and “Stick” (1985).
While some of his performances were critically praised, others were ridiculed, particularly in the bloated action comedy ”Cannonball Run II,” a sequel to his financial success “The Cannonball Run” (1981). He also starred in the notorious 1975 musical flop “At Long Last Love,” a film so atrocious that director Peter Bogdanovich publicly apologized for making it.
Reynolds turned down notable roles including Han Solo in ”Star Wars,” which went to Harrison Ford; the title role in a James Bond film; and the astronaut in “Terms of Endearment” that Jack Nicholson turned into an Oscar-winning performance.
His niece said that although he had had health issues in the past, his death was unexpected.
“My uncle was looking forward to working with Quentin Tarantino, and the amazing cast that was assembled,” she said.
He was expected to be in Tarantino's 2019 movie “Once Upon a Time in Hollywood”, according to movie and television information website IMDb.
Reynolds said in 2012 that he regretted some of his film choices. “I took the part that was the most fun — 'Oh, this will be fun.' I didn't take the part that would be the most challenging,” he told television interviewer Piers Morgan.
Asked to come up with his own epitaph, Reynolds said, “He lived a hell of a life, and did his best — his very best — not to hurt anybody.”

John Krasinski on the rise
"," Jack Ryan, a former marine who now works as an analyst for the CIA, is a true patriot; an upright man with a strong sense of morality. 
The lead character of many a Tom Clancy novel is a readymade fit for the vacuum created by the slew of morally-ambiguous protagonists on our TV screens over the past decade. In John Krasinski, who has remodelled his career drastically since his days as a cast member on the sitcom The Office, the show gets a lead actor who’s got the right mix of charming good looks and intellect (he wrote and directed this year’s sleeper hit, A Quiet Place, after all). 
On paper, it’s a terrific set-up. Even though based on Clancy’s novels, co-creators Carlton Cuse and Graham Roland come up with an altogether original plot for the first season of the Amazon series, in order to reflect real-world conflicts and palatable antagonists. Ryan’s adventures, whether borrowed from existing material, or entirely invented, create the scope for a long-lasting multi-season show, and the streaming service gives Cuse and Roland the showcasing they envisioned for their big-budget TV series. With a plot that spans across six countries, and a bunch of massive action set-pieces, Jack Ryan is meant to be the kind of fast-paced spectacle audiences are more accustomed to watching on the big screen. 
With Cuse (creator of Lost) at the helm, you can be assured character development will be given importance too. The antagonist Suleiman, for example, is a terrorist driven by the atrocities he suffered as a young boy in Yemen, and actor Ali Suliman turns in the best performance of the show. This is firmly Homeland territory, with fanatical villains, world-destroying terror plots, and a righteous protagonist, but without the grimness that TV audiences are accustomed to with similarly-themed shows. 
And while that’s a tightrope walk we could’ve all welcomed, Jack Ryan falls prey to the worst clichés of the action movie genre it so desperately tries to recreate. The hero, for example, is always conveniently present in the wrong place at the right time; complicated plot points (cracking the password of an encrypted hard drive, for example) are resolved with lazily sketched-out ‘eureka’ moments; and dense conflicts are resolved quickly. A lot of it is great fun to watch, frankly, but keep your expectations in check.
Season One of Tom Clancy’s Jack Ryan is now streaming on Amazon Prime Video. Both seasons of Ozark are now streaming on Netflix.

Podcast review: Gonads attempts to go back to the birds and bees talk
"," Somewhere over the rainbow is a place where love is love, where simply being is enough to be recognised and counted, where understanding is based on reason, imagination and empathy, and where conversation trumps judgement. 
Even as we celebrate the overturn of Section 377, we know that it’s a long way before social and cultural norms accommodate alternative sexualities, and legal provisions make possible a life of true choice for anyone who doesn’t check the heteronormative box. But as we move into a fuller understanding of what it means to be human, and why binary categorisations just don’t cut it, it could help if we had open, informed, and genuinely curious conversations — about sex, sexuality, gender, and genetics. 
Several initiatives in our own backyard (Agents of Ishq, Tarshi, for instance) are making attempts to get us talking and dealing with our deep discomfort with all things sexual, but it’s a slow process that more often than not evokes embarrassed laughter or shocked silence.
New York-based Radiolab’s six-part mini-series, Gonads, is an attempt to go back to the beginning with that conversation. With what has come to be the group’s characteristic mix of deep reporting, contextualisation and personal history, Gonads explores “the epic journey of reproduction” from its primordial roots to the processes that makes us who we are and how we make more of us.
The series was conceived in 2015, when producer Molly Webster followed the story of a gay Israeli couple and a surrogacy service in Nepal, in the process uncovering the complicated ethical, cultural and emotional dynamics of outsourced baby-making. The resultant episode, ‘Birthstory’, which Radiolab co-host Jab Abumrad describes as “a story about the business of family making, the outsourcing of babies, about exploitation,” but also about “the way cultures cross-fertilize in really unexpected ways, creating a symbiotic benefit even while it’s troubling and maybe unfair.”
The episode, though three years old, is still an engrossing listen, and a great example of collaborative reporting from journalists in Israel, India and Nepal. Armed with a grant from Science Sandbox, Webster then went on to explore the scientific basis of reproduction, and put together her research in this six-part series.




In Episode 1, titled ‘The Primordial Journey’, Webster sets the tone, quirky and inquisitive, with the question: “What do you think of the word ‘gonads’?” and gets a range of responses, from “it’s a crazy question” to “isn’t that ‘nuts’?” More than 90% of her respondents thought that it was a decidedly male word, unaware that both women and men have gonads. She decided it was time to “reclaim that word... as a woman, as a science lover.” All this set to a foot-tapping theme song with a catchy refrain: “go-go-gonads.”
Outside the binary
While the first episode focuses almost entirely on matters of science, each of the subsequent episodes is built around a story that takes us into the wonders of futuristic fertility science, the fluid and fickle matters of biological sex determination (the surprising discovery that X and Y do not always equal female and male), and complications of falling outside the gender binary.
Episodes 4 and 5, originally aired back to back, serve as the real centrepiece of the series, working together to re-examine socially constructed notions of gender alongside the slippery biological processes that can confound any attempt to define difference. 
In ‘Dana’, we encounter Dana Zzyym, whose experience “broke the binary” and forced the inclusion of the term “Intersex” on United States passport applications. And in ‘Dutee’, Webster and reporter Sarah Qari revisit the heartbreak and struggle faced by the young Indian track and field star, Dutee Chand, who was stripped of her medals when she was found to have unacceptably high levels of natural testosterone. 
Webster rounds off the series with the edited version of a live show at New York University that turns the usual sex-ed class on its head, considering, “how do we teach this stuff in the current polarised environment?”
Like all Radiolab productions, Gonads demands careful listening, and while the questions it addresses are scientific, their implications — as we only too well know — are deeply cultural and emotional.

The Beatles in India
"," It was in the year 1968 when the Beatles were spending time away from the limelight, to learn and practice transcendental meditation by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. It was by pure chance that budding photographer and filmmaker Paul Saltzman stumbled upon the Beatles living in an ashram in Rishikesh, when he’d actually arrived there to mend his broken heart through the medium of meditation. 
Speaking to The Hindu, Saltzman recalls, “I stopped thinking of them as The Beatles within 30 seconds of meeting and talking to them. Kind of magically, the Beatles went away and they were just these people I was sitting with. I never even thought of asking for a picture or autographs! For a week, we were buddies. I could’ve taken lots of fun photos, but I asked each of them privately, if they’d mind me taking pictures and they said, “Go right ahead!””
After spending 11 days at the ashram, Saltzman went back to Toronto, published a few photographs of the renowned musicians, wrote an article about meditation and put away the pictures in a cardboard box. Thirty years later, it was his daughter, Devyani, a Beatles’ fan, who made him dig up those old prints, which eventually featured in Saltzman’s book, The Beatles In India. 
Avid Learning Institute, Consulate General of Canada in Mumbai and ICIA Gallery will be hosting an exhibition of the photographs and a conversation on ‘Beatlemania: Capturing Subcultures through the Lens’ between the filmmaker and photographer and art critic and curator Girish Shahane. 
About the talk Shahane said, “It will be about how he came to Rishikesh, his interactions with the Beatles, the life of the photographs after he’d taken them and how India became important in a particular way to the world. The cultural aspect of Indian history became important to the hippie movement and the legacy of that movement in the present time. The major impact of the Beatles on India was through their interest in India, which then became an interest that many of their fans shared. The important thing is what the Beatles did for India in terms of its connection with the rest of the world.”
Saltzman also said, “We will talk very broadly about the concept of photography documenting subcultures. I didn’t set out to document anything [in 1968]. I was not a photographer. I was starting to be a filmmaker but I was at the very beginning of my career. For me, photography and filmmaking has always been about experiencing what I’m in the middle of. My love of taking pictures and making movies is really about human being as opposed to subcultures. ‘Documenting subcultures’ is what somebody can label it, in retrospect. 
Some people do that brilliantly, filmmakers and photographers, who specifically want to do document for a purpose but that’s not my way. My passion is to become more conscious as a photographer and filmmaker, to become more compassionate, to have greater empathy and not just for others, but for myself.”
The Beatles in India will be on exhibition from this evening until September 22 at ICIA Gallery, Kala Ghoda; this evening attend a talk between Paul Saltzman and Girish Shahane at 6 p.m. at the same venue.

Glenn Weiss proposes girlfriend in Emmys acceptance speech "," At the 70th Primetime Emmy Awards Glenn Weiss, a director and producer, won the Outstanding Directing for a Variety Special trophy and used acceptance speech to propose his girlfriend, Jan Svendsen.
 He bagged the trophy for helming the 90th Academy Awards earlier this year.
Weiss asked Svendsen to come up to the stage and he began talking about his mother, who he said tragically passed only two weeks ago. 
Svendsen joined him onstage, and he presented her with a ring. 
“Jan, you’re the love of my life, and my mom was right, never let go of your sunshine. You wonder why I don’t like to call you my girlfriend? Because I want to call you my wife. I want to put this ring on your finger in front of all of these people and in front of my mom and your parents watching from above. Will you marry me?” he said.
 She replied with a “yes”.
Later in the ceremony, when “The Americans” star Matthew Rhys claimed the trophy for Lead Actor in a Drama, he quipped that his girlfriend and fellow nominee Keri Russell said, “’If you propose to me, I will punch you clean in the mouth.’”

'Game of Thrones,' 'Mrs. Maisel' triumph at Emmys ","Amazon’s The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel became the first streaming series to win top Emmy comedy honors and HBO’s Game of Thrones recaptured the best drama series award on Monday at a ceremony that largely slighted its most ethnically diverse field of nominees ever.
The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel,  a sitcom about an unhappy 1950s homemaker liberated by stand-up comedy, earned best actress honors for star Rachel Brosnahan.
Claire Foy of The Crown and Matthew Rhys of The Americans won top drama acting Emmys, their first trophies for the roles and last chance to claim them, with Foy’s role as Queen Elizabeth II going to another actress and Rhys’ show wrapped.
The field bested by Foy included last year’s winner Elisabeth Moss for The Handmaid’s Tale and Sandra Oh of Killing Eve, who would have been the first actor of Asian descent to get a top drama award.
“This wasn’t supposed to happen,” said a startled Foy.
Game of Thrones, which sat out last year’s Emmys because of scheduling, won despite competition from defending champ The Handmaid’s Tale.

Love, lust and longing "," 
 There is a buzz in the little lane winding around a village in Vypeen island. Lokadharmi, a centre for theatre training, research and performance, tucked in Njarakkal in Ernakulam, is teeming with theatre lovers and thespians. A video camera has been propped up to record the in-house premiere of Shakuntalam, a play scripted and directed by the founder of the institute, Chandradasan. The director emerges out of his earthy-hued play house, speaking to his actors and tech team. A glint in his eyes tells us that he is excited about showcasing the Malayalam musical adaptation of Kalidasa’s Sanskrit text Abhijnana Shakuntalam. 
A modern playwright’s challenge is to recreate a classic text in a way that the contemporary audience can relate to. More than anyone else, Chandradasan, who has a penchant for choosing Greek texts like Medea, Shakespeare’s works like The Tempest and Indian classical dramas like Karnabharam, knows this. “If it does not speak to the times, it becomes a museum piece,” says the director. 
Originally devised for students of the National School of Drama for their academic exercise, the play, in its Hindi version, directed by Chandradasan ran for six houseful shows. 
In the Malayalam version, he scouted for young actors as he was looking for a bubbling energy on stage. “Actor comes first for me and not any other technical aspect. They are my medium.” Just then, an actor in her red flowing costume makes a dash for the director from inside the playhouse. With her straight hair flowing down till her waist and a meditative air, she looks every bit a wise sage. But, the child in the woman is evident when she clarifies with Chandradasan about some details about her hairdo; the conversation ends in a warm hug, with the director promising to visit the green room a few minutes before the performance. “I want them to feel the nuances of their characters and make the process touch the inner core of their being,” says the practitioner who follows the school of Konstantin Stanislavski, tenets of Natyashastra and Greek chorus motif.
Reworking on the text was enlightening in many ways. As he read through the original text, puritan concepts of the romance between Dushyantha-Shakuntala scattered away, he remembers. “When I read between the lines, I realised Shakuntala was just any other girl for Dushyantha, who is known to have numerous affairs. An embodiment of Kamadeva, he is seen with sugarcane bow and arrows made of flowers. For me, Shakuntala’s love for him is an attraction of an adolescent towards a man.”




The final episode of Dushyantha’s memory loss, Shakuntala’s journey to his kingdom and facing rejection from him and Dushyantha remembering her through the ring she left for him, are designed to move the audience to a cathartic climax. But, not without a serious introspection of the original text by Kalidasa through a critical eye and meta narrative. “In my play, Shakuntala does not believe in the ring any more and chooses to leave. Scholars such as Romila Thapar have pointed out that there is no mention of the ring or the curse of a memory loss in the epic. Dushyantha just abandons Shakuntala in the forest and leaves. Since Kalidasa is a royal poet, perhaps, he felt he had to keep alive the good name of the king. Two of my characters voice this thought.” 
Art inspires the playwright who thinks quite visually. Paintings and imageries define the space for his narratives. As we talk, Chandradasan multi-tasks between supervising the stage décor and offering suggestions to the cinematographer on the lighting spots on the stage, strewn with flowers. The entire milieu makes you feel you are in a forest. “The audience has to see something permanently to feel the nuances of the inner feel of the play. It could be static or moving. This is where paintings come to my help.”
Music is designed in a way to rekindle the memory of the 60s’ and 70s’ Malayalam cinema in the audience. Slokas have been condensed into six songs, written by the playwright. A padam composed by Irayimman Thampi has been set to a new tune by Bijibal to convey the sense of lament. “Rendering a sloka becomes ritualistic, distancing the audience from contemporary reality. Songs make them connect instantly. Actors will be singing some live, some are recorded; they will be played on stage with actors’ live renditions overlapping the recorded ones.”




 The fourth act, especially, has evocative moments where Shakuntala is bidding her famous goodbye to the birds, trees and animals in the forest. 
 So, while representing Kanvashram, the breeze, the trees and the birds, he does not use the conventional realistic set but the visual metaphors of paintings and art and set work, designed by Samkutty Pattomkary. There are Raja Ravi Varma-like paintings of women in the backdrop juxtaposed with installations of trees decorated with pink flowers and drooping leaves. The idea is to represent the conflict between the classical strokes of the former with the organic, tribal motifs of the latter. And, this in a way reflects the bigger philosophical conflict of the city vs the forest, which the play reflects on. 
 Dushyantha’s encroachment into the forest can be seen as the invasion of the city on the rural ecosystem, says Chandradasan. “Nature plays an important role in Kalidasa’s work. Shakuntala could be Nature, with Dushyantha embodying the male chauvinistic ideology. This is the central conflict of my retelling of Shakuntalam.” In a way, the location of Lokadharmi reflects its founder’s love for Nature and a raw way of living. “When we talk about Indian theatre, why do we limit ourselves to the metros? Lot of meaningful theatre is happening in the villages of India.”
(The play will be staged in October. Follow Lokadharmi on their Facebook page)

In tune with the dance of the serpent "," 
 As Sarpatatwam, a 28-minute documentary, premieres today (September 21) in Los Angeles, the short film’s creator, Methil Devika, says it is the realisation of a year of hard work. Focussing on a composition of a 11th century mystic, Devika burrowed into the significance of serpents in ancient civilisations and its symbolical implications. 
A trailer of the film that has gone viral gives tantalising glimpses of the documentary and visuals that are aesthetic and sensuous at the same time. “This is a composition that has been performed by many dancers. But I chose verses from the composition that demanded more exploration into the layers of philosophical thought, the details of which I can’t reveal now,” she says.
That is when serendipity came calling, giving her the opportunity she was seeking. Office-bearers of Nagayakshi temple in Palakkad wanted her to perform at the temple. “I said yes and decided to work on this particular composition. However, I found that a lot of research would be needed to undertake such a work and so, with great regret, I turned it down. However, a few days later, I got a call from Mannarashala temple (dedicated to Nagas) for a recital there. I felt it was too much of a coincidence and decided to take it up,” recalls Devika.




While going through the lyrics of the composition, she found that the second part of the composition was not notated although the first part was. “Although I am not a trained musician, I took up the responsibility of setting it to music. That is when I discovered none of my regular musicians were free at that point of time. By then, I was determined to set the music myself, choreograph the dance and perform it too,” says Devika. 
It was again luck that played a part in choosing the main vocalist. Udupi- based Aparna Sharma rendered the song beautifully and Devika performed it at Mannarashala in October 2017.
That was also around the time the accomplished Mohiniyattam danseuse and academic was planning to get some of her work archived, as she had never taken the trouble to document her choreography or recitals. “Some directors were approaching me with offers for acting in films. One of them was Rajesh Kadamba. I was not all that keen on acting in a film but I invited him to watch my recital at Mannarashala. In course of time, I decided to have him film my work, which would have a narrative that had to be in line with my research and interpretations,” explains Devika.
She got down to work on the script and storyboard before having long discussions with Rajesh. The shooting took only 10 days but it was the preparatory work that ensured that the actual filming got over smoothly.
With Devika as narrator, performer, scenarist and co-director and co-producer, Sarpatatwam showcases her multifaceted creativity. Beginning with a narration and beautiful visuals that explain the significance of Sarpatatwam, the docu moves to the Mohiniyattam performance.
Generous with her praise for the director and film crew, she says she doubts if it would have worked so well with anyone else. “I was insistent that the focus should be on the dance and it should be aesthetic and factual. Rajesh was able to do justice to the theme and cinematographer Vipin Chandran’s frames beautifully enhance every scene,” she gushes.




Watching Devika’s deep involvement in the work, her husband, Mukesh, also decided to join the venture. “I began with a small budget as it was my own production and I, initially, discouraged Mukesh ettan from working with us. He was not happy with my decision. Anyway, later, I changed my mind and we launched our production house ‘Chitrakutam films’. I am lucky Mukesh ettan is the co-producer because as there were international inquiries, the production had to adhere to those standards and needed a bigger budget.
 “I am glad he is also with me in the production. Sarpatatwam is the first in a series of docus I plan to produce on dance and related subjects. Once the screening starts, I will understand the kind of reception the film will get. As it is, a lot of universities and museums have got in touch with me to archive the film,” she adds.




She sees the completion of the film and her involvement in it as a “blessing” and a sign of some “divine intervention”. But she asserts: “This is a first step. Depending on how it goes, more such films are in the making.”
DIRECTOR’S VISION
 “I had always wanted to work with Methil Devika and I first approached her with the script of a film that centred on a dancer. But she was adamant about not working in a feature film then. But I requested her to get in touch with me if she ever changed her mind or even if we could work together on a documentary. That is when she called me to watch her recital at Mannarashala and she followed it up with a suggestion for archiving it,” recalls Rajesh.




A veteran of several award-winning television programmes on Rosebowl and Kappa TV, Rajesh felt that instead of merely documenting the performance, it would have be better if she would enhance it with an explanation of the performance and its significance. “Since Madam was particular about not deviating from the essence of the recital, a narration was introduced as a preface to the dance,” elaborates Rajesh. 
While the main venue was the verdant greenery at Kowdiar Palace in Thiruvananthapuram, it was also shot at Iringole Kavu in Thrissur, the biggest sacred groove, and Mannarashala. “To make it as authentic as possible, we used the real organic powder while drawing the kalam instead of treating it as just a film. We treated it with great reverence,” he says. 
He is effusive in his praise of cinematographer Vipin Chandran, who, he says, remained true to the essence of the film. The trailer has been receiving rave reviews from all over and Rajesh hopes the film will pave the way to more such projects. 
SOARING ON CREATIVITY
 Filmmaker and sculptor Rajiv Anchal’s magnum opus is the Jadayupara project at Chadayamangalam and the sculpture of the bird, which has been eulogised in the Ramayana as the brave eagle that tried to save Sita from the clutches of Ravana. For the inauguration of the project, Rajiv filmed Methil Devika’s original choreography of a poem composed by ONV Kurup and set to music by M. Jayachandran. It has been rendered by Aparna Rajeev and Vidhu Pratap. 
ADOOR’S APPRECIATION
An excerpt from auteur Adoor Gopalakrishnan’s response to the film.
...The documentary based on the.... centuries-old evocative song on the mythical Serpent God is at once a testament to Ms. Devika’s total dedication to the art and her unparalleled achievement. It is natural that she has conceived the treatment of the film and has chosen herself as its sole interpreter and performer...

Clever puns and sight gags "," The latest addition to Netflix’s ever-bulging originals is Paradise PD. It’s an animated series, with a barrage of hilarious insults that are meant for adults who don’t feel attacked at the drop of a hat. The show couldn’t have been made for television. The script would have either gone through several changes, or the final cut would have looked different to appeal to the sensibilities of the TV audience.
The adult comedy, created by Waco O'Guin and Roger Black, alternates between the dark web of realities and the imaginations of a dynamic duo that’s not afraid to make fun of Joe Biden, Johnny Depp, or Elon Musk. While Depp (of course, the animated version) is thrashed for starring as Willy Wonka, Musk appears in a risqué scene where he’s mocked for the Tesla cars. These bits aren’t, in any way, connected to the main story, and, yet, they are brought into the frames to deliver humor.
The constant urge to stray away from the plot to make absurdity its main focus seems to have helped the creators in coming up with a universe that allows them to make space for talking animals and thinking machines. Some viewers might feel that the jokes are too on the nose, but, let’s face it, there’s nothing else that Paradise PD is running after. It’s not chasing eternal glory; its only intention is to catch the scrolling eyes of the naïve Netflix binger.
The story of a bunch of small town cops who are dumber than the characters in a Harpic commercial couldn’t have relied on the strength of a coherent story anyway. The cops – Kevin, (voiced by David Herman), Gina (Sarah Chalke), Chief (Tom Kenny), Dusty and Hopson (both the characters are voiced by Dana Snyder), and Fitzgerald (Cedric Yarbrough) – are not funny on their own. They don’t run around throwing one-liners. They only react to the things that happen around them. But the police dog, Bullet (Kyle Kinane), is like none of them. He’s intelligent and cunning, and, when the clock strikes the right time, he invites his dog-friends to the station to do drugs (he has a key to the room where all the confiscated drugs are stored).
The quirky characters find different methods to unleash their morbid passivity around banal and inappropriate occasions all the time. Here, let me give you an example of a supporting character that tends to break into puns, for which Fitzgerald is a huge fan, to explain the bizarre nature of the series. Just before dying, the pun master utters, “Talk about heart-stopping action, huh,” and goes on to pull his heart out of his gaping chest. Now, tell me, how can anybody resist a chuckle when such things keep happening? 
And, without sanity interrupting the proceedings, Paradise PD flows over the edges of sight gags (a drug lord’s hideout is named “Terry Two Toes Secret Hideout”) rather nicely. Another recently released Netflix series, Disenchantment, too, uses the flavour of sight gags quite innovatively. But Disenchantment is made for a much younger audience, whereas, in the case of Paradise PD, the average viewer would be a young adult. I can imagine the youth screenshotting vulgar lines and images, containing graphic nudity, to pass them around in the college WhatsApp groups they’re a part of, with cool emojis and hashtags.
Unfortunately, Paradise PD hasn’t been discovered by the thirsty millennials yet as they’re currently busy with another adult animated series, BoJack Horseman. That’s understandable because it’s one of the best shows for people who are looking to find solace in the arms of a non-judgmental sitcom that pokes at the flaws of the human psyche. In that sense, Paradise PD is a low-hanging fruit even though it hits the bull’s-eye with its wordplays.

Below the ice "," Polar cubs, fantastical auroras, male emperor penguins protecting their eggs from a fierce polar storm, colourful under-ice corals and deadly ice stalactites that freeze creatures to death — this is a taste of what to expect from the Winter episode of the upcoming Frozen Planet series, that focuses on the polar regions. All set to première this month, the fascinating scenes captured in the series are a product of many weeks of behind-the-scenes work in subzero temperatures. 
“Winter is the coldest, darkest time in the region. For the wildlife too, it’s a time of fighting for survival,” recounts Kathryn Jeffs. “We landed in remote McMurdo Sound, Antarctica, on a C-17 plane with 65 heavy bags of kits, including specially adapted tripods. We drilled holes into the 3-feet thick ice, over which we placed dive-huts to capture the under-ice life there,” she says. Divers Doug Anderson and Hugh Miller would go down for 45 minutes at a time, with Hugh carrying the special underwater lights and holding them still while he hovered in water and Doug filmed. “The water was below -2 degrees, so we would pour near boiling water into their gloves just before the dive. The biggest challenge there was to keep warm,” explains Jeff, who has also produced the popular miniseries Planet Earth and Oceans: Our Blue Planet, among others.
During their time in Mc Murdo Sound, the crew filmed a rare phenomenon. “We were lucky to have captured a 8-hour time lapse video of a brinicle forming — this has never, ever been filmed before,” says Jeffs. The brinicle — an icicle formed by the downward flow of saline water that freezes any sea creatures it traps — was filmed using underwater tripods, lighting stands and cables held down with lead weights. “In the first attempt, an inquisitive Weddell seal had tipped over the camera. It was face-down when we came back for it the next morning. But the second time was a success — it was a very emotional moment for us,” she adds. 
Jeffs’ fascination of the natural world started early on. “Since the age of three, I’ve loved animals and nature. As I got older, I began to worry about our impact on the planet, so I wanted to share my love for nature with other people in the hope that they enjoy and do more to protect our precious planet,” adds Jeffs, who has a degree in Biological Imaging and a career spanning over 17 years. Working with Sir David Attenborough on Frozen Planet has been a high point for Jeffs. “He has been my hero my entire life. His fascination for nature is infectious, and his impact on an entire generation’s understanding and love for wildlife is immeasurable,” she says.
Now, Jeffs is off on her next adventure, working on a three-part series for BBC and PBS called Island: Earth’s Paradise Isles. “I’m off to Borneo to film giant bat caves,” she reveals, “the series will also feature Madagascar and Hawaii.”
Frozen Planet premières on Sony BBC Earth on September 24 at 9 pm.

Netflix to develop adaptations of 'The Chronicles of Narnia'
","The lion, the witch and the famous wardrobe of C.S. Lewis' 'Chronicles of Narnia' are all getting a reboot soon. Online streaming platform Netflix, has entered into a multi-year deal with the C.S. Lewis Company to develop stories from across the Narnia universe into series and films, a Netflix press release said. All series and films produced through the deal will be Netflix productions. The deal marks the first time that rights to the entire seven books of the Narnia universe have been held by the same company.
The C.S. Lewis books already have a presence in Hollywood with three movies being made on the series. “Families have fallen in love with characters like Aslan and the entire world of Narnia, and we’re thrilled to be their home for years to come,” said Ted Sarandos, Chief Content Officer, Netflix. 
The Chronicles of Narnia is a series of seven fantasy novels, considered one of the greatest works of author C. S. Lewis. Set in a magical land called Narnia, the books feature various adventures of the protagonists who are children, while also unveiling the history of Narnia. The majestic lion -- Aslan -- aids the children who get magically transported to Narnia with the help of a cupboard. In total the Narnia books have sold more than 100 million copies and been translated into more than 47 languages worldwide. 
Netflix has ventured into giving a reboot to children's fantasy fiction novels for quite some time now. Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events starring Neil Patrick Harris, Anne with an E which is based on the 1908 novel Anne of Green Gables, are some of the other books-to-web shows that Netflix has come out with.

Not what it promises to be
","Forever, the new Amazon Prime series that deals with the concept of togetherness through sickness and health, and, even afterlife, tries to overturn the notions of YOLO (You Only Live Once) with the potent lyricism of YODO (You Only Die Once). But in the hope of laying the foundation for a universe populated with the themes of fantasy and rom-com, the creators, Alan Yang and Matt Hubbard (known for their work in Parks and Recreation), have, unfortunately, walked into the territory of morbid mundanity.
It’s an ironic statement to describe the nature of Forever since the writers wanted the series to stray away from the herd and stand tall as a show that people would speak about in philosophy classes. However, I’m not sure if that’s going to happen as it neither throws in all the answers regarding the specialty of life after death, nor does it excite us with its feel-funny moments.
The series opens with a cute montage of June (Maya Rudolph) and Oscar (Fred Armisen) getting to know each other through dates (with no audible dialogues) and ends with June turning sour as a pall of routineness falls into the crevices of their relationship. While Oscar isn’t particularly bothered by the lack of adventure in their marriage, June looks worried. Her face, like a forgotten doll in the shelf, looks unhappy and uninterested in taking the same walks, waving at the same people, and playing the same games day after day. 
Rudolph and Armisen are fine comedic performers, but with the material that’s handed to them in Forever, they appear a little out of place. Rudolph’s reaction when she realizes that she’s going to “live” with her husband, who has been dead for a year, in her afterlife, is not the laugh-out-loud kind of scene that you’d expect in a comedy such as this. It’s more on the lines of an ordinary occurrence. How would the audience receive this piece of vital information at the end of episode two if June herself doesn’t feel alarmed by her situation?
In fact, the supporting characters, Kase (Catherine Keener), the next-door neighbor who inspires June to leave her past behind, and Mark (Noah Robbins), Oscar’s friend in the quiet neighborhood that people move into once they die, are livelier, and, as a result, get sassier lines to deliver; whereas, the married couple has conversations about the best way to sit and the best food to eat on the beach. The quotidian lines aren’t totally devoid of emotion, or charm, but I somehow couldn’t find a hint of pleasure in their banter.
For a show that could have, perhaps, used some of the eccentricities from The last Man on Earth, the dialed-down-normalcy of June and Oscar’s behavior, as they discover the absurdities and rules of the other world one at a time, is a mega dampener. And that’s exactly why the series looks better when it focuses on the sub-stories that are not directly related to the leads.
The most surreal half-hour of this eight-episode hotchpotch is the one about an African American and an Asian American couple (Jason Mitchell and Hong Chau as Andre and Sarah, respectively), who do not take the final step to be together because they’re married to other people. 
The whole episode revolves around their affair in an abandoned house, and it gives June the courage to break away from the monotony she’s become tired of.
Though, Yang and Hubbard bring in awe-inspiring elements (the dead walk on the ocean bed) and various characters to shake things up, Forever fails to rise above the average. 
It’s just a series about a man and a woman in a long-term relationship who are looking out of the windows of commitment from different corners.

Hansal Mehta, Apurva Asrani call out ‘Queen’ director Vikas Bahl over harassment allegations
"," Filmmaker Hansal Mehta and screen writer Apurva Asrani are among the first voices from the Hindi film industry to condemned “Queen” director Vikas Bahl over the sexual harassment allegations against him. Last year, a woman employee at Phantom Films, which had Bahl as one of the partners along side Anurag Kashyap, Vikramaditya Motwane and Madhu Mantena, had levelled allegations of molestation against Bahl, who she said behaved inappropriately during a trip to Goa.
In a recent article in Huffpost India, the woman has reiterated the allegations, sharing further details about the incident.
According to the report, in October 2015, the woman reached out to Kashyap and detailed her experience, but no action was taken while Bahl continued to harass her until she finally quit the company. 
Sharing the article on Twitter, Mehta wrote, “Will anybody do anything about this bloody creep or will the industry protect him like it always does?” 
Asrani said such incidents made him feel “sick”. 
“Why was no action taken against Vikas Bahl in over 3 years? To think that the victim had to continue to work in the same office and even be assigned to report to him is awful,” he tweeted. 
Critically-acclaimed filmmaker Onir said it was sad that some of the biggest stars in the Hindi film industry were still working with Bahl. “It’s sad that inspite of knowing the truth... studios and stars continue to turn a blind eye to the perpetrators.” 
Bahl is currently directing his next venture “Super 30”, featuring Hrithik Roshan in the lead.
Quoting the story, “Sacred Games” actor Kubbra Sait tweeted, “The details in here are gory. But necessary to read. May the girl continue to fight knowing that her story isn’t wasted. Thank You for the courage. #MeToo #TimesUp”. 
“Shubh Mangal Saavdhan” director R.S. Prasanna said the revelations were “shocking”. “This is so very shocking. #MeToo seems to have become the forest fire that it deserves to be,” he said. 
Producer-director Nikkhil Advani said serious action must be taken against the culprit.
“Serious action, serious introspection and serious correction is required from an industry that has forever been plagued with ill repute. This is not the story of one girl or one incident but symptomatic of a work ethic at large,” he wrote. 
In the article, which has since become viral on social media, Kashyap has admitted he had failed the woman, three years after he first learnt of the allegations.
“Whatever happened was wrong. We didn’t handle it well, we failed. I cannot blame anyone but myself. But now we are determined to do better. We believe her completely. She has our undying support. What Bahl has done is horrifying. We are already on our path of course correction and will do everything in our capacity to fix it,” Kashyap said.
According to the publication they had also sent detailed questionnaires to Phantom Films’s remaining three partners — Bahl, Motwane and Mantena.
Before the article was published, the four partners Saturday announced that have decided to dissolve their joint banner Phantom Films, without citing the reason for this decision.

TV shows that talk about mental health of doctors
","If you think about it, a hospital is the best place for any soap opera: it is where strangers meet everyday, each new patient bringing a new storyline, that is woven into the permanent cast’s (read: the doctors and nurses) lives. Which explains why medical dramas such as ER and Grey’s Anatomy have been some of the longest-running shows in TV history. Even Indian TV took a hint and created the short-lived but popular Sanjivani (cue theme whistle) and its spin off Dil Mil Gaye.
But how many of them go beyond portraying doctors in clacking heels with smoldering good looks, to real characters that experience the stress that comes along with being a doctor?
 The original big daddy of medical soap operas, M*A*S*H’s final episode, ‘Goodbye, Farewell and Amen’ was one of the most watched shows and is still remembered for its handling of main character Hawkeye Pierce’s mental breakdown. Hawkeye, a surgeon at the U.S. Army Medical Corps, was himself being treated at a mental hospital and is forced to bring to the surface repressed memories of having to watch a mother choke her infant during the Korean War. The episode effectively deals with PTSD, and the long lasting effect of war on army doctors.
Another show that talks about PTSD among war veterans, One Day At A Time, sees lead Penelope, a civilian nurse and United States Army Nurse Corps veteran, battle with anxiety and depression, pointing out how the condition raises its head even when everything in your life may seem perfectly fine. Living with her mother who in an old-fashioned Latina way, believes depression is something “you just have to get over”, Penelope stops taking her medicines and going to therapy, believing she has finally outrun it -- only for it to catch up with her when she least expects it.




Ah, yes. The famous Dr House: brilliant, cheeky, brutally sarcastic, irreverent to rules -- the ultimate bad boy of the medical world. But when it comes to handling his own issues, he is less than equipped to do so. Blaming chronic pain in his knees, he regularly relies on painkillers, overdosing to a point that he starts to hallucinate. Though he is shown as trying to overcome his addiction by checking himself into a rehab, he reverts to his habits soon after.
Though the show occasionally touches upon how its doctors, from Christina Yang, to Owen Hunt and Meredith Grey, deal with the stress and depression, most of the show’s drama comes from ridiculous plot points (a bomb lodged in a patient’s chest, can you believe?), invented only to pull the narrative forward. The show has problems with continuity (understandable what with doctors dropping dead like flies, and so many permutations and combinations of couples), one of which is surgeon Bailey’s on-now, off-tomorrow OCD.
Even though the show is supposed to be a parody, or probably because of it, Scrubs has a loyal fan following among actual doctors for getting the stresses that come with the job right. The show which specialises in escapist humour, often surprises us with its sensitivity. We watch as protagonist doctor JD comes to term with the reality of losing patients once in a while, and senior doctor Cox gives a chillingly practical advice to focus only on those who can be helped. The show also talks about how the residents’ busy schedules hardly leaves them with a personal life to date and socialise.

Sayantani Ghosh in a mythical avatar ","A popular face in television serials, Sayantani Ghosh is back with a mythological drama. She will be seen as Kunti in Karn Sangini on Star Plus.“We have shown that Kunti realises her mistake of abandoning her son Karna. Because of social norms, she could not bring up Karna as a single mother. She didn’t have the courage then but after so many years she realises her mistake. She keeps on repeating this line, ‘Every time there is a war, one emerges as a winner, but a mother is always a loser.’” This, she says, gives a contemporary ring to it. “Even today, whenever there is a war or a skirmish at the border, it is the mother who is left grief-stricken.” 
An erudite actor, Sayantani says, she could relate to her plight. “I don’t think anyone in today’s time can say that he or she never committed a mistake. We want to rectify our mistakes. Similarly, Kunti too committed a mistake, which she wanted to correct.” 
On the increasing jingoism in society, the Kolkata-born actor remarks, “If I am not breaking traffic rules, not littering on the roads, paying taxes on time, it makes me a better patriot than someone who is just shouting slogans.” 
Reflecting on the look of her character, Sayantani says it is unlike most other mythological serials where characters look like dressed for a wedding. 
“We have used minimalistic jewellery and outfits are soft and light in colour. Usually, Kunti is shown only in whites; here we have added rust and mustard as well.” 
In order to reach out to young generation, the dialogues, she adds, are not Sanskritised. They are neither colloquial nor laced with bombastic words. Prayas would be replaced by koshish, bal ki jagah hum taqat bol sakte hai. This will make it easier for the average TV viewer to understand.” 
Sayantani was last seen in Naagin, a series which is trolled a lot on the social media. “Well, it was a huge success in terms of the TRPs. It only reflects what society is ready to watch. As actors, we want to do diverse roles. However, my personal choice is to do contemporary stories.”

Azeem Banatwalla: ‘It’s the golden age of web series’
"," Tell Azeem Banatwalla about your problems and he may have a different take on the whole thing. How? Enter his ‘Problems’ Tour, his 20-stop tour across India which also features five international destinations: Singapore, Dubai, Bangkok, London and Kuala Lumpur. Hyderabad is the second stop and Azeem is fuelled for fun in one of his favourite cities, explaining, “I love Hyderabad; the city honestly has the craziest crowd. Over the course of one show, I received seven standing ovations and that was really something.” 
Sporting a short bio ‘I tell jokes for money. Your offence is free,’ the East India Comedy veteran will have your interest piqued. In April, he completed his part in the Melbourne Comedy Festival which exposed him to different styles of comedy of which he wasn’t aware. Do check out his Facebook page for a hint of what’s to come for Problems. Living in an age of political correctness and outrage culture, Azeem doesn’t shy away from artistic license nor does he deliver punchlines for shock value. This probably stems from the fact that he has a background in journalism. “Despite my background, comedy has opened up new avenues to explore topics I hadn’t prior to all of this, such as aspects of the beef ban discourse.”
“I’ll be addressing issues within our government as well as social dilemmas like overpopulation. It may leave some people thinking ‘okay that’s a very different way to look at it.’ I’ve been doing trial shows for the tour for about three months and I feel pretty geared up,” he explains, “and there was quite a bit of adjustment here and there. See, style in comedy is something that progresses slowly but surely. So I’m actually planning on implementing a Powerpoint presentation to add a bit of a kick to the show.” He chuckles a little right then. 
So how much of his set is ‘planned?’ He responds, “maybe 20% of my writing actually ends up on stage. There is an element of improv I see in other comedians’ sets but I do what feels natural. I find I tend to make use of the ‘on-stage down-time’ to formulate something fresh which does end up working on varying crowds. Plus my work on EIC versus The World on Amazon Prime was a great deviation off the scripted nature stand-up shows tend to have. I really enjoy that on the show; we sit and discuss issues candidly and that in itself fuels different comedies and perspectives. Engaging with different platforms is really important and, right now, it is the golden age of web series.”
So trust a guy who’s done over 500 shows all over India and Asia, and is pretty much a one-man-show. “I tend to do most of the planning and scheduling on my own,” he reflects, “and, in a way, that keeps my grounded, on my toes and away from complacency.” So bear witness to Azeem’s lack of complacency this weekend, for sure. 
Azeem Banatwalla’s ‘Problems’ will be taking place at Bhaskara Auditorium on October 6 at 8:30pm. Tickets are available via bookmyshow.in at ₹499 onwards.

#MeToo in Bollywood: Netflix may not renew ‘Sacred Games’ "," The second season of Sacred Games could be in jeopardy with the #MeToo #TimesUp movement gaining ground in Bollywood. Netflix may not renew the series in the light of the sexual harassment allegations against lead writer Varun Grover that Grover has very strongly and categorically denied. 
The project had been greenlit with great fanfare with director Vikramaditya Motwane continuing as the showrunner and Neeraj Ghaywan joining in, directing the Sartaj track to Kashyap’s Gaitonde strand. Both Motwane and Kashyap have also been facing flak for not handling the sexual harassment charges against Phantom ex-partner and director Vikas Bahl with seriousness. 
When The Hindu reached out to Netflix, the streaming platform came up with the following statement: “At this time we are evaluating options on the path forward.”

Teenybopper whopper: A review of American Vandal Season 2
","In a study conducted in 2017, it was revealed that American teens spent 27% of their time watching Netflix among all entertainment consumed; second only to YouTube.
Netflix has always been big on data. Back in 2011, they won a bidding war to produce their first original, House Of Cards, and green-lit the first two seasons of the show before even a single scene was shot. Why? It had data that showed audiences were a fan of the original House of Cards (UK), and that all Kevin Spacey films and David Fincher movies drew eyeballs on the streaming service. It was all the push they needed to make a 100 million dollar gamble and it paid off.
It’s not entirely surprising, then that Netflix is big on teen dramas at the moment, especially after the runaway success of 13 Reasons Why a couple years ago. Among them is Elite. Set in a prestigious educational institution, Las Encinas, which is nestled among the scenic mountains of Spain, the drama revolves around three under-privileged students who get a full scholarship after the building of their local school collapses. 
The show intercuts between a murder investigation being conducted in the present and the three students getting bullied by more influential students in the past. Following a 13 Reasons Why-meets-Riverdale-meets-How To Get Away With Murder-meets-Gossip Girl template, the show is overcrowded with ideas, and exhaustingly mundane. Another familiar element is the presence of actors from La Casa De Papel, another Spanish hit on Netflix, but their presence doesn’t lift the storytelling in any way. Avoidable.
The high school show to beat all others, though, is American Vandal, the sophomore season of which premièred recently. 
A satire that doffs its hat to some of the most stellar documentaries on Netflix — the plot of Making A Murderer and the narrative style of The Keepers — American Vandal is unlike other mockumentaries in that it’s not a story within a story, but strictly follows the rules of the most hard-hitting documentaries even while dealing with outrageous incidents. 
The first season began with drone shots of Hanover High School in Oceanside, California, as a solemn voice-over implied that the peace of the city would be destroyed by a dastardly crime — the vandalism of the vehicles belonging to the school’s teaching faculty, in the form of penis-shaped graffiti. It’s impossible to keep a straight face while watching an intense dissection about the implications of penis-shaped graffiti, and the first season kept the humour intact throughout its run.
But it’s the latest season where American Vandal really finds its tone. It begins with another ill-fated incident: students of St Bernadine school suddenly feel the urge to defecate after consuming lemonade during the lunch break, resulting in chaos as hundreds go pooping all across the school premises. It’s an incident that requires the thorough investigative abilities of Peter Maldonado and Sam Ecklund, the filmmakers whose Hanover High documentary travelled far and wide. 
While retaining its tongue-in-cheek wit, the new season isn’t only focussed on getting the laughs, but also in designing a thicker plot that gets you deeper in. It’s all quite silly when you think about it, but the skill involved in balancing rip-roaring fiction with somber documentary storytelling is what makes American Vandal unlike any other teen drama at the moment, on Netflix and otherwise. 
The first two seasons of American Vandal are streaming on Netflix.

#MeToo: Mukesh Chhabra, Vicky Sidana, Bhushan Kumar and Ashish Patil accused
","Casting directors Mukesh Chhabra and Vicky Sidana, T-series chairman Bhushan Kumar and Yash Raj Films Talent and Business head Ashish Patil have been accused of sexual harassment and asking for sexual favours in a professional setup.
Mr. Kumar denied the allegations in a statement to PTI saying, “I am appalled and anguished to know that my name has been dragged in this #MeToo by some anonymous person(s). The allegations against me are bad on the face of it. I have enjoyed an impeccable reputation and have always maintained professionalism. The tweet has been used as a tool to defame me and malign my reputation."" 
Mr. Kumar has submitted an application at Amboli police station seeking a complaint of defamation and criminal intimidation against an unknown person for posting offending remarks and statements against him on social media and levelling sexual harassment allegations, confirmed senior police inspector Bharat Gaikwad. 
Under #MeTooIndia on Twitter, an anonymous account had accused Mr. Kumar saying, “I was new and very scared. The next day I got to know that I was dropped from the film because I refused to sleep with the ‘boss’.”
Refuting allegations of sexual harassment of aspiring actors during auditions, Mr. Chhabra released a statement saying, “It is very unfortunate that years of hard work and building is been muzzled with a series of unsubstantiated wild anonymous allegations.”
Filmmaker Anurag Kashyap tweeted, “I neither have any #MeToo stories nor evidence about Mukesh Chhabra. I cut off ties with him for lots of reasons related to casting and reasons that I don’t feel the need to put out in public domain.” Mr. Chhabra had worked on the casting of Netflix’s Sacred Games, which was co-directed by Mr. Kashyap.
Mr. Chhabra opted out of a panel discussion at the ongoing India Film Project (October 13-14), an annual content creation festival held in Mumbai. Singer Raghu Dixit, journalist Meghnad Bose, comedian Aditi Mittal and Mr. Patil have also stepped down from participating in the festival after allegations of sexual harassment and assault under #MeTooIndia.
Denying allegations made anonymously on Twitter, Mr. Patil said in a statement, “They are untrue, fabricated, extremely defamatory and agenda driven. Yash Raj Films also tweeted promising to take strictest action if the allegations of sexual harassment are found to be true.

#MeToo: Alok Nath’s wife files complaint in court against Vinta Nanda
","Actor Alok Nath’s wife, Ashu, has registered a complaint in Andheri court against writer-filmmaker Vinta Nanda, asking Amboli police to investigate the allegations of molestation and rape made by Ms. Nanda.
 
“I have heard from the media only that Mr. Alok Nath has filed a defamation suit against me. We, on the other hand, have not received any intimation regarding it as yet. We will respond to the notice once we get it and I assure all of you that we will fight this battle right till the end,” said Ms. Nanda.
 
Ms. Ashu’s lawyer, advocate Ashok Sarogi, clarified that no defamation suit has been filed yet. In the complaint, addressed to Chief Metropolitan Magistrate in Andheri Court, a copy of which is with The Hindu, Ms. Ashu said, “Because of the said defamatory statement published on behalf of [Ms. Nanda] by way of interviews given to various such social medias, our position is such that we are terrorized as even if we move out, the people are looking at us with a different attitude (sic).”
 
In the complaint, Mr. Nath’s wife also accused Ms. Nanda of having grievances against her husband because “it seems that Ms. Nanda has been carrying on an impression that because of my husband, the artists and story line [of the television serial Tara] were required to be changed and the said serial has gone off the air.”

Hyderabad Comic Con 2018: A multi-verse of entertainment
","Step into any Comic Con and you’re instantly transported into a whole new world of fun, family and fantastical getaway. This weekend promises no less with Hyderabad Comic Con kicking off. So what can one expect? 
Funnyman Sahil Shah from East India Comedy will be hopping on board, not at all a stranger to the comedic tides of Hyderabad. In fact, Sahil was in the city for last year’s Comic Con too, honing his superpower of entertainment to keep attendees in totally upbeat spirits.
Coming to Hyderabad Comic Con for the first time, animator and comic book artist Rahil Mohsin is ushered in from Bengaluru. Growing up on the stories around TinTin and then falling in love with stories like Johnny the Homicidal Maniac by Jhonen Vasquez, the artist dubbed “chameleon” is now illustrating for Sufi Comics, an indie comic book creator. Sufi Comics went on to be the first Indian publisher to go to San Diego Comic Con.
Now… what to do at Comic Con that hasn’t been around before? Fear not, they have your back. If you’re anticipating the release of Aquaman this December, the Aquaman experience should get you geared up even more. Immerse yourself in a fun underwater-but-not-really-underwater zone and keep your camera at the ready for selfies with The King Of The Seven Seas. 
And, of course, treat yourself to an exclusive peek into the sequel of Fantastic Beasts if the waiting is too much for you. And if you’re having a little Marvel withdrawal, there’s always a place for that to get your quick fix.
Speaking of films and comics colliding, don’t miss out on Matthew Rosenberg’s appearance. Having an integral role in the culmination of Dark Phoenix and The New Mutants comics, it’s fair to assume he knows what we can expect from the respective films to be released soon. Matthew and his partner Patrick Kindlon came together to form Ashcan Press and their success has been huge in the comic book realm. While we won’t be seeing the partners together, be sure to catch Matthew to regale him for spoilers. 
Founder of Comic Con India Jatin Varma observes a huge gaming community in the city which many will see in the form of AMD Gaming and ESL Gaming. In attendance as well will be artist Saumin Suresh Patel, Akshay Dhar of Meta Desi Comics, Vivek Goel of Holy Cow Entertainment and Rajeev Tamhankar of TBS Planet Comics — just to further name drop here.
But now, time to get serious; in light of India’s #MeToo movement, Comic Con India’s Cosplay Is Not Consent campaigns and protection schemes stands at alert.
Jatin gets real, “You do have situations where we need volunteers to keep cosplayers and their costumes safe. You’ll see costumes which are very elaborate and expensive. So, yes, there are one-off incidents — which are rare — where boundaries are crossed and we take action immediately and we have intervention from the police, too. But most of these outfits actually invite a lot of positive engagement and curiosity, which is what we love to see.” 
Do join on this campaign on a citizen level; just because you’re only attending, doesn’t mean you’re simply a by-stander!
Hyderabad Comic Con will be at Hitex Exhibition Centre on October 13 and 14. See hyderabadcomiccon.com for tickets.

Exalted meanings
","For no reason, this Kannada film Anupama (1981), occupied the mind. And how? Totally. The actors, the story, songs – everything. It was a fun film, something similar to the lines of many films of those times. Like Padosan – you fall in love with the girl who is your neighbour. You have friends to aid your love, who are foolish, but loveable. Something like Guru Shishyaru, a bumbling brat pack that has sudden visions of truth. And many other films – tragedy strikes, and till then a fun story, heaves with sadness. Anupama, therefore, brought with it loads of memories – of a time that can never come back. Of the simplicity, of the genuine goodness of things, of tragedy and its inevitability, most of all, the music.




The film has three memorable songs: Anupama Cheluvu, Bartaale-Bartaale and Olume Poojegende. Anupama Cheluvu is a lovely, breezy and vibrant love song. You can see in it shades of Ilaiyaraja (who had made his debut in 1976 with Annaikili), especially on the percussion track. It is composed differently for the main melody and background score, with an illusion of syncopation for the main melody. Bartaale Bartaale is an entertainer – it is full of clownish antics with not much of a melody. But one remembers it for the number of sound textures it creates and how it intelligently blends it into the melodic structure. The highlight is Olume Poojegende, masterpiece of a song. A song that can easily be called among Kannada’s best.
The music for this film is by Ashwath-Vaidi, a pair that came into existence after they met during the recording of the film, Kakana Kote (1976). For the next three decades, the C. Ashwath and L. Vaidyanathan duo composed some of the greatest songs of Kannada film industry. The story about their collaboration is that Ashwath provided the tunes, and Vaidyanathan made the background score, however, it is hard to believe that their extraordinary efforts emerged from such watertight compartments.




C. Ashwath was among the iconic bhavageethe composers of Kannada. His vision, style, repertoire was distinct. L. Vaidyanathan came from a family of great musicians. His father V. Lakshminarayana was a teacher to him and his highly accomplished brothers, L. Shankar and L. Subramaniam. An ace violinist, he worked as G.K. Venkatesh’s assistant and the film industry remembers him as one of the finest arrangers who mixed rare instruments to create a unique and sensitive soundscape. He had a great sense for earthy sounds and timbres, and was also known for his keen understanding of technology. Vaidi, as he is popularly known, composed music for over 170 films, but the most enduring memory for listeners is his unforgettable signature tune for Shankar Nag’s Malgudi Days: Thanana thananana re…..




Olume Poojegende is a masterpiece (sung by S. Janaki and S.P. Balasubramaniam) for the way in which the composition has been conceived. In its imagination, it has the complex manoeuvrings of a piece of classical music, but in its rendering it brings the eternal charm of an intense film song. What merits such an observation? Listen to the song, and you will recognise the rich textures of the Hindustani raga, Yaman Kalyan. Listen to it again, and again, and you will begin to get into a mystery that is embedded in the song. What is it? In an optical illusion what you see depends much on what you focus on: what forms the background and foreground. Similarly, in an auditory illusion, what we hear also depends on what we focus on. In this song, much of what we see and hear depends on what we begin to see as the aadhara shruti (the note from which the entire song progresses). The opening phrase of the song on santoor, which largely uses just three notes, operates from the shadja, but by the end of the opening background score, the entire song moves to madhyama shruti. This creates the effect of tonic shift or graha bedham while actually the entire melody has shifted to another note, a higher note which is the madhyama. While in the normal pa to pa scale, the opening phrase for Yaman Kalyan would have been da ni sa, it becomes ga ma pa in this case. This has been done so intelligently that unless you stay with the song, it is a mystery you cannot decipher. In a masterpiece of a move, Ashwath-Vaidi introduce raga Bhinna Shadaj in a phrase that occurs just once, elevating the dramatic quality of the entire song.
The use of instruments is brilliant, as well as the use of rhythm and intervals between notes. It creates multiple patterns, multiple melodic effects while the emotion of the song remains a constant: slow, and protracted. The whole experience of the song gains in meaning when, at the end, you realise it is a dream that you want to hold on to. To extend it to poetry, Basavanna writes: “Things standing shall fall, but the moving ever shall stay”. Therefore, as long as Yaman Kalyan appears in new forms in every dream, it will remain eternal.

Actor Dileep is no longer a member of A.M.M.A, says Mohanlal
"," Actor Dileep, accused in the abduction and sexual assault of a woman actor, is no longer a member of A.M.M.A (Association of Malayalam Movie Actors), according to Mohanlal, president of the association. 
“Dileep tendered his resignation after we sought it,” Mr. Mohanlal told the media after a meeting of available executive committee members of the actors’ guild here on Friday. Bickering within the association was apparent over the week after the Women in Cinema Collective (WCC), a gathering of women actors in Malayalam cinema, voiced its protest against A.M.M.A for the body’s perceived apathy towards the assaulted woman actor, which according to them was in stark contrast to the protection it granted to the accused actor. 
Mohanlal, who was flayed by the WCC for addressing seasoned women actors part of them with the generic word ‘actresses,’ chose to address them as such even on Friday. Rebutting the accusations, he said it was wrong on the part of some A.M.M.A members [who are also part of the WCC] to level allegations against the association while remaining within it. 
There was a system within the body to address complaints of sexual harassment and the committee comprised K.P.A.C. Lalitha, Kukku Parameswaran and Kaviyoor Ponnamma. He also downplayed the sticking points in the responses to the WCC given separately by actors Siddique and Jagadeesh, saying both were in line with the official position on the issue. 
“The A.M.M.A available executive has resolved that the reinstatement of women actors who have left the body will be considered as and when they approach it with the request. It’s not on top of our priority right now,” he said. “There’s no need to call a general body to discuss this. As for the Dileep issue, we had asked the women actors for sometime to act on the demand for his resignation, but that was not heeded,” he said.

Mr Blah was seen climbing on the barricades of the bridge when the police caught hold of him and made him get down.
""He was crying. He seemed very frustrated and depressed. We took him to the police chowky, offered him water and asked his problem to which he said that he was frustrated with the #Metoo allegations on him. He was depressed due to the defamation he and his family faced. He along with nine other partners had founded KWAN and after four girls alleged him of harrasment in #Metoo campaign, he was asked to resign,"" Mr Gaikwad said.
His wife was informed by traffic police and he was handed over to the Vashi Police thereafter.
""The traffic police handed him to us but we haven't charged him as he has not done any (suicidal) act. He told us that he had come for a walk at the bridge. After his family reached, we handed him over to them,"" senior police inspector Anil Deshmukh from Vashi police station said.

#MeToo: Anu Malik takes break from ‘Indian Idol’ amid sexual harassment allegations "," Music composer Anu Malik on Sunday said he was taking a break from singing reality show Indian Idol following various sexual harassment allegations against him. In a statement, the music director, who has been attached with the show as a judge since 2004, said he had decided to step away from it as he was not able to “focus on my work”. 
“I, Anu Malik, have decided to take a break from Indian Idol as I am currently unable to focus on my work on the show. The channel has been kind to agree for the same. Thank you,” Malik said.
 The music composer’s response comes after sources claimed that Sony TV, on which the show airs, has asked him to step down as a judge for Indian Idol 10.
Sony Entertainment Television also issued a statement saying the composer would not be part of the show anymore, which includes Vishal Dadlani and Neha Kakkar as the other two judges.
“Anu Malik is no longer a part of the Indian Idol jury panel. The show will continue its planned schedule and we will invite some of the biggest names in Indian music as guests to join Vishal and Neha to judge the extraordinary talent of Indian Idol season 10,” the statement read.
 The decision comes after singers Sona Mohapatra and Shweta Pandit accused Malik of sexual harassment. Two budding singers also levelled similar allegations against him.
 Malik’s lawyer Thursday denied the allegations, saying India’s #MeToo movement is being used for his client’s “character assassination”. 
Malik has repeatedly denied the allegations.

It’s a game-off with guns and swords
","Veteran developers Treyarch have really turned the tides of war for this multi-player-only foray with Call of Duty: Black Ops 4, especially after WWII. Embracing the old saying that goes, if you can’t beat ’em, create your own versions of them, as they make the jump into an already-crowded arena dominated by Fortnite and Overwatch.




What’s it about? 
Gone is the single-player story in favour of multi-player, but there is a semblance of a story revolving around The Specialists from Black Ops 3, in the way their back stories unfold in the Specialist HQ. Black Ops 4 is dripping with personality, with a wicked sense of humour that permeates across all its modes. A combination of dead-serious military mumbo jumbo mixed with a dark wit, infusing the game with a raw charm.


How does it play? 
Think of Black Ops 4 as a collection of three multi-player games. One is the Overwatch-like component, with the specialists, who are hero characters with their own abilities and classes. Instead of a limited weapon set per character, you’re free to use any weapon in the game as your primary or secondary; like Destiny 2, each character has a signature power weapon and an ability. Pick a specialist and fight across several modes, like capture the base or heist across several maps. Also, there’s no healer class; instead, every character can heal using a rechargeable stimpack.
The real meat of the game is the massive 100-player Battle Royale, which is the best implementation of the game mode today. Black Ops 4 adds a quicker pace and a more realistic weapon sim element to the experience. Maps are not too big but have a higher density of hidden stuff to discover. There’s satisfaction in the shorter matches, that force 100 players to clash together faster, as the boundaries close in rapidly. The FPS experience makes the action more visceral, and traversal is fun as you run, gun and slide across the map, deploying various weapons and unique gear like shields to defend yourself.
Lastly, the beloved zombie mode that is the hallmark of Black Ops games makes it back with pulp humour. Letting you play through scenarios co-operatively with friends killing Zombies, as they disintegrate in fountains of gore, as you rack up points to open doors or loot chests to get better weapons.
Should you get it? 
A raw and refined experience, Black Ops 4 is the de
finitive multi-player experience that puts together all the best of what’s out there in the world into one package. Also finally, the world gets a refined military Battle Royale done right.
Gather round ye intrepid readers, as we take you back in time to a stage of history — the bloody story of scantily-clad fighters duelling to the death for deadly soul swords. A tale that no history book you’ve ever read has covered, unless of course you’ve taken history lessons in the local game arcades, in which case you’re familiar with the SoulCalibur series. Which emerges from the dark once more in SoulCalibur VI, with one grizzled and grey Witcher in tow.




What’s it about? 
SoulCalibur VI is essentially a reboot of the series, set in the 16th century, telling the story once more about the Soul Edge. A sword so evil that it twists the wearer who wields it into something horrifying, and only the polar opposite, SoulCalibur, can counter it. Packing not one but two story modes, one of which lets you experience the main story, interspersed with one-on-one combat. The second is Libra of Souls, which has you create your own character and fight through a full campaign that has you travel to points on a map. Which, incidentally, is set in India as well as China.


How does it play? 
If you’ve played Tekken, then SoulCalibur VI follows that same 3D arena battle system, as large characters duke it out across some well-animated levels. The game features 22 characters, each wields a different weapon and has a distinct fighting style. Even without going through the moves list, the game is easy enough to just jump in and hold your own. Though, if you get tired of button mashing, there is a surprisingly deep system that will make your head spin. Like the Reversal Edge, which has a complex rock, paper, scissors-like mechanism of countering and dealing with clashes.
It’s fun seeing all the characters appear in smooth HD graphics with detailed costumes. There are also little touches, like visible damage as they fight. The entire roster looks great, from the valkyrie-like Sophitia to the walking spike Voldo, to the overtly sexual Ivy with her sword whip. All of them look and fight great, with excellent battle animations. Fans of The Witcher series will be ecstatic at the inclusion of Geralt of Rivia as a playable character, whose moves are true to the game. That said, even the music kind of reminds you of Wild Hunt.
Where SoulCalibur VI does falter a bit is in its presentation, with slightly dated menus that you have to wade through, with a few rough edges. While characters had colour swaps, it would have been great if they had alternate costumes, just like Street Fighter V, Injustice 2 or even Overwatch. These are small nitpicks in an excellent one-on-one fighter with solid mechanics.
Should you get it? 
If you love one-on-one fighting games, then SoulCalibur VI is right up your alley. With an excellent single-player component and Geralt of Rivia.
The writer is a tech and gaming enthusiast who hopes to one day finish his sci-fi novel

Second season of ‘Sacred Games’ will continue with original team: Netflix
"," The second season of Sacred Games will continue on Netflix with the original team at the helm. A statement from Netflix on Tuesday said: “After an independent investigation, the results helped inform Netflix’s decision to continue with Vikramaditya Motwane and Anurag Kashyap on season 2 of Sacred Games. We continue to collaborate with our production partners to ensure and maintain a safe and respectful working environment.” 
The project had been greenlit with Vikramaditya Motwane continuing as the showrunner and Neeraj Ghaywan joining in, directing the Sartaj track to Mr. Kashyap’s Gaitonde strand. The streaming platform had temporarily put the season 2 on hold pending investigation in the light of the sexual harassment allegations against lead writer Varun Grover that Mr. Grover had very strongly and categorically denied. 
Both Mr. Motwane and Mr. Kashyap had also been facing flak for not handling the sexual harassment charges against Phantom partner Vikas Bahl with seriousness and alacrity.

‘I didn’t expect Soorya to become a movement in itself’: Soorya Krishnamoorthy
"," 
When Nataraja Krishnamoorthy, whom the world knows as Soorya Krishnamoorthy, decided to convert 15 cents of his family property into a performance space for artistes, free of cost, inclusive of facilities such as light and sound equipment, many of his well-wishers objected. But he wasn’t dissuaded. Krishnamoorthy said, he “was giving back to the society that had given him so much”. He was confident that it would succeed. And it did, like many other artistic and cultural initiatives that this cultural activist has introduced in Kerala over the last 42 years under Soorya, said to be the largest cultural society in the world, and in his capacity as the head of many cultural organisations in the State.
Today, ‘Ganesham’, near Thycaud in the capital city, is a unique cultural centre. The venue, more like an extension of his tastefully-done home, Sooryachaithanya, has a 400-seater black box theatre. The space also has two open-air auditoriums, a green room, a dormitory for artistes and a gallery for artists to display their work, all without any fees.
“The kalvilakku at the entrance of Ganesham is lit on days we have programmes. And it has been lit on not less than 90 of the 180-plus days since it was officially opened six months ago. Some events ran to full houses, there were plays that had repeat shows and so on,” says 67-year-old Krishnamoorthy, a former engineer with the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO).
What triggered the concept was his own journey as an artiste and art connoisseur. “I know the challenges and hurdles faced by artistes and those involved in staging shows. This space is for all those talents who need a stage. The shows are ticketed and the artiste(s) can take home the collection. Many drama troupes have recovered their initial expenditure after two presentations. That’s exactly what I wanted. All performances go through a screening process before they are staged because this is a centre for serious artistes and genuine art lovers,” he says.
This was a path he had never envisaged when he formed Soorya as a film society with a handful of like-minded individuals. He was then working in the ISRO along with people such as former president APJ Abdul Kalam and scientists like PN Subramaniam and CR Sathya. “They were art lovers and among the founders of Soorya. After 27 years, I took voluntary retirement from ISRO with the mission of taking art and culture to the common man. Chitralekha Film Society, the first film society in Kerala launched by Adoor Gopalakrishnan, had introduced me to good cinema by then. When it became defunct after Adoor’s resignation, our aim was to take good cinema to the people and ensure participation of women, especially homemakers, through Soorya. But I didn’t expect it to become a movement in itself. We could bring in the best artistes and also give a platform for many budding talents who went on to become established names in their field,” he says.




Cinema, classical dance forms, theatre, Carnatic music, ghazals, painting exhibitions, photography workshops, literature, children’s theatre, folk art, talk festival... Soorya has it all in its 111-day festival held at various venues in Thiruvananthapuram till Ganesham came into the picture. “With chapters in 38 countries, we have at least one programme every day in some part of the world, thus making it a 365-day festival,” he says.
Ask him how he keeps the show going, and Krishnamoorthy says, “It’s by god’s grace and because of my amazing team. Except for three individuals who passed away, those who have been associated with Soorya since its inception are still attached to it. We don’t have an office or paid staff. Instead, there is a 10-member core team who toil hard. I take care of everything, including arranging the artistes, till two days prior to the beginning of the festival. After that, I distribute the work among the team members and give them the authority to take the final decision in case of any crisis. I trust my team and the members have never let me down,” he says.
In between, he is busy scripting and directing plays and conceptualising mega shows. “Because art has always been an outlet for my sorrows. If it was poet Sugathakumari, my foster mother, who instilled in me the love for Malayalam language, I took to art to give vent to my pain. This is why you won’t find entertainment in my productions,” he smiles.
He is now working on his 100th production, ‘Thrayambakam’, a mega stage show to be staged on December 2. Krishnamoorthy says that he has no apprehensions about Soorya’s future. “There are trained youngsters to take it forward. This has to go on. My only prayer is that I don’t end up compromising on my art. I don’t want to sell something that god has gifted me, ” he signs off.
Conditions apply
* All programmes of Soorya start at 6.45 pm. “Our office hours at ISRO, located in Thumba, was till 5.30 pm and by the time we reached the city it was 6.15 pm. So 6.45 pm was fixed as a convenient time to begin the programmes and we didn’t change that.” But Krishnamoorthy doesn’t wear a watch, a habit he picked up from his father, T Nataraja Pillai.
* Soorya’s programmes are not ticketed and follow a membership system. The gate closes by 6.45 pm and will be reopened only at 8 pm or at the end of the programme, depending on the duration of the performance. If you are a non-member, you can enter by 6.40 pm, after the members have been seated.
Memories unplugged
* It was at MS Subbulakshmi’s residence in Chennai that the idea of the Soorya festival was born. In addition to the legend and Krishnamoorthy, the meeting was attended by KJ Yesudas, Padma Subramanyam and mridangam maestro Mavelikkara Krishnankutty Nair. “They all promised to perform every year. Yesudas has not missed a year till now; Padma Subrahmanyam performed for 35 years; Krishnankutty Nair was a regular at Yesudas’ concerts for many years. MS performed only once,” he remembers.
* October 1 is reserved for Yesudas. That had to be changed just once because he had to perform in Australia on that day. “I was moved that he took my permission before he agreed to it.”
Milestones
* A pioneer of light and sound shows, Krishnamoorthy’s first such production was ‘Thamasoma Jyothirgamaya’, based on temples, rituals and temple art forms. He has directed over 40 shows. As a playwright and theatre director, his most notable work is Melvilasam, which has completed 400 stages. His ‘Chayakkadakathakal’ is a series of plays with the same characters
* His house is home to Ganesha, as you find here idols, paintings, curios and sculptures of the deity. Every Vinayaka Chaturthi, the door is open for the public to see the collection.
Personal touch
* Krishnamoorthy always spots a cap, a habit he picked up eight years ago. “As I began losing my hair, I was advised to wear a cap to protect the scalp from the glare of the arclights. I started wearing it during rehearsals and that habit stayed on. Also I wear only black trousers and white shoes.”
* He was first addressed as ‘Soorya Krishnamoorthy’ by his daughter, Seetha. “She was in her primary class then. One day she got so upset with me that she angrily called me, ‘Soorya Krishnamoorthy’. That became official when friends and media started using it.”

Actor Suraj Sharma on life after Pi
","If searching for God on Facebook sounds like a satire of the times we live in, then God Friended Me is a slightly silly and contrived yet heart-warming take on the concept. 
The comedy-drama, which is currently airing on Colors Infinity, explores human connections and our ability to help one another, says actor Suraj Sharma, who plays one of the leads. “Do we need a so-called God or faith in a higher being in order to help each other? Or is faith in one another enough to be kind and compassionate? That is the basic premise of the show,” says the Life of Pi actor.
‘God’ sends a friend request to atheist Miles Finer (played earnestly by Brandon Micheal Hall) on Facebook, providing suggestions of ‘friends’ to him — people whose lives Finer invariably ends up making a difference in, without always intending to. Sharma’s character Rakesh Sehgal — a part-time hacker who ends up “finding meaning and an objective to his life” — is also swept up by the changes in Finer’s life.
Just three episodes in, the show has provided viewers with context about Finer’s family (his father is a reverend who is deeply disappointed with his son’s atheism) and has woven in the issues of the third protagonist, Cara Bloom (Violett Beane). “The point of the TV show is to kind of harness the multiple perspectives on religion, you know? It’s to try and get to a more holistic idea,” shares Sharma, who was most recently seen in the 2017 Bollywood film, Phillauri, where his character is haunted by Anushka Sharma’s ghost. “There’s a whole bunch of different ideas in the show.” 
It is, however, yet to delve deeply into Sehgal’s character. When it does, Hinduism will definitely come up, promises Sharma. “He is definitely agnostic,” says the actor, on a phone call from New York. “He’s all about computers and hacking and science. I think his mom and dad might be religious but he’s definitely not.”
I ask him about his own spiritual beliefs. “Me? According to the bigger picture, I am also agnostic, but I like to think of myself as into the idea of spirituality,” says Sharma. “So no, I don’t believe in God.” 
But he does seem to believe in serendipity. “I had to leave New York to get a job in New York,” says the Delhi-born actor, with a chuckle. “I’d been living in New York for about five or six years and I moved to Los Angeles. But in the first week there, I get a callback to this audition. So I go to CBS and meet the people there and basically, everything went really well. And I ended up coming back here.”




Serendipity might also have had something to do with Sharma bagging the role of Pi in Ang Lee’s critically acclaimed 2012 film, Life of Pi. It was Sharma’s brother who had originally gone to audition for the film. Still in school in Delhi when he was cast, the actor reveals that his life turned “completely upside down” after the film. “It was epic and amazing and I got to learn so much and meet so many different types of people,” he says.
After Life of Pi, he has gone on to do several critically-acclaimed roles, both on television and the big screen. There is his portrayal of Rinku Singh, the first Indian to play professional baseball, in Million Dollar Arm alongside Jon Hamm and Slumdog Millionaire actor Madhur Mittal. He was also seen in the fourth season of Homeland, where he essayed the role of Aayan Ibrahim, a Pakistani medical student.
Talking about his acting career thus far, Sharma sounds just as excited as the 16-year-old version of himself. “Pi gave my life an objective,” he reveals. “Obviously, you know, this is also such a privileged lifestyle — I got to go to film school in New York. I really appreciate how it gave me a way to move forward,” he adds.
But he is in no big hurry. Beyond God Friended Me, Sharma shares that he has not signed on any new project. “For now, I’d just like to concentrate on this,” he says. 
God Friended Me airs every Monday at 10 pm on Colors Infinity.

Riding the wave: Neil Bhoopalam and Kalki Koechlin on their latest show 'Smoke' ","When we sit down to chat, actor Neil Bhoopalam jokingly sings a few high notes into the recorder placed in front of him, and later even breaks out into an impromptu impression of Jackie Chan. Whether these are the effects of too many cups of coffee or not is unclear, but in between these moments he seems rather pensive and measured with his words. The actor, along with Smoke co-star Kalki Koechlin, talks to Weekend about the web series that premièred yesterday, the potential of online content, and other works in the pipeline.
What drew Bhoopalam to the crime drama exploring the gritty underbelly of Goa was his character, Savio. “He is a chef, and he is deaf and mute,” he says, adding, “I’ve never worked in the underworld space before. If I like the world that is on paper and my character, [I look at] how I can add value to it. It will only be me who can pull that off as a performer,” says the 35-year-old actor, who was approached by Faisal Malik from Hamari Film Company for Smoke. On the other hand, Koechlin plays a Portuguese DJ, Tara. “Her passion is compromised because she has to do it in this environment — of a mafia world,” he says.
Directed by Neel Guha (That Girl in Yellow Boots), the 11-episode series also stars Jim Sarbh, Mandira Bedi and Gulshan Devaiah. “While the role I’m choosing should be challenging, I also like to see how much fun I can have on set,” Bhoopalam says with a laugh. “At the end of it you are going to spend many hours with these people. They are going to become like your family,” shares the actor, who has worked with Sarbh in Koechlin’s directorial theatrical début, The Living Room.
As Bhoopalam and Koechlin balance working in numerous mediums — theatre, film, and series — they are equally excited with the potential that Indian’s online content holds. The country’s digital game is relatively young, but we have seen a few wins. The most recent being Smoke’s première at MIPCOM (an annual global entertainment market at Cannes) on October 15, and Amazon’s Inside Edge nomination for the International Emmy Awards.
Koechlin believes that the absence of censorship allows for the exploration of complicated adult content. “And with this complexity comes a realism which is important to our cinema [because] we don’t have that culture very much in our commercial [films]” she says on a follow-up phone call, adding, “As an actor, even if you aren’t playing the main lead, you have a much meatier role because of the length [afforded by the medium]. The fact that there might be [more] seasons gives us a sort of permanence. Otherwise it has always been like ‘Okay, abhi kya (now what)?’ after every movie.” Koechlin will soon be seen in the Amazon series Made in Heaven and a film with Rana Daggubati, Haathi Mere Saathi.
Bhoopalam, who was also seen in 24, the Indian television remake of the American political thriller, reveals it was Anurag Kashyap’s 2009 film Dev.D (which featured Koechlin in her first prominent role on screen) that made him want to join films. “It was proof that you don’t have to come from a family of actors,” says the former VJ, who will next be seen in the series Ikigai on MX Player and 4 More Shots Please.
Koechlin is looking forward to her role in Shakespeare’s The Rape of Lucrece that will be staged at NCPA, Mumbai, later next month. “It is especially relevant today given the #MeToo movement. I have supported the movement but refrained from actually commenting on individual cases which I don’t know the details of. But it’s going to make us much more aware of sexual harassment and hopefully result in a cleaner, more equal environment especially at work,” she concludes.
All episodes of Smoke are now streaming on Eros Now

Will the spectacular new season of 'Daredevil' salvage the fate of Netflix’s Marvel shows? ","Netflix released Season 3 of Daredevil last week, close on the heels of the streaming service axing Iron Fist and Luke Cage in quick succession. It was a brutal decision, which culled The Defenders catalogue by half (not counting spin-off The Punisher). This double pull-out casts a gloomy shadow over Netflix’s Marvel universe, which got off to a pretty rosy start three years ago.
Both Daredevil and Jessica Jones arrived in 2015 to stellar reviews, and with solid opening seasons. Each show had a tone that was refreshingly distinct from Marvel’s big screen extravaganzas, and both went beyond familiar superhero tropes to weave in themes like religion and consent. 
Even though Luke Cage couldn’t live up to the hype created by its predecessors, it at least had some interesting characters, and captured the vibe of New York’s Harlem neighbourhood nicely. Iron Fist, though, was a complete disaster, and intolerable over its 13-episode arc. The count of episodes, in fact, has been a major drawback. Not all dramas can sustain interest over a 13-episode arc, least of all those that either have completely listless characters (as in Iron Fist), or mundane plots (as in Luke Cage).
Daredevil and Jessica Jones have managed to stay afloat because writers of both shows laid a strong foundation for the characters in their first seasons itself, due to which their less-intriguing sophomore seasons delivered. 
Marvel’s TV division has a lot to learn from its film counterpart — each set of movies dedicated to a different character (or characters) in the Marvel Cinematic Universe has been helmed by an eclectic filmmaker, distinguishing one from the other in tone and treatment. Iron Fist and Luke Cage, as characters, seemed unsure of their place in The Defenders universe, their creators either borrowing tropes from Daredevil and Jessica Jones that didn’t fit into their world, or making slight deviations that seemed unconvincing. 
Their premature demise, hence, isn’t shocking, and paves the way for the two characters to appear in either Daredevil or Jessica Jones-led storylines in possibly better-written parts.
The new season of Daredevil, meanwhile, is splendid. The writers go back to the show’s crime-thriller roots — which it deviated from in the second season — and come up with something intense, multi-layered and character-driven. Part of it has to do with the return of Daredevil’s arch-nemesis Wilson Fisk. Vincent D’Onofrio, as the big, bad villain, remains enchanting as ever, even when he resorts to theatrics. 
But what truly makes the show tick is the painstaking attention given to each character. Karen Page (Deborah Ann Woll, excellent) and Foggy Nelson (Elden Henson), probably Netflix-Marvel’s most impactful characters other than the heroes and the villains, get meaty tracks that merge nicely with the central plot. Two new additions — FBI officers Ray Nadeem (Jay Ali) and Benjamin Pointdexter (Wilson Bethel) — are fascinating grey parts that add to the show’s appeal. Charlie Cox’s portrayal of the Devil of Hell’s Kitchen is probably TV’s most underrated performance at the moment (he even loses the spandex this time, as if yearning for more respectability).
Season 3 of the show retains traits that made it so watchable to begin with — an unflinching character study of its central protagonist, and beautifully-orchestrated action sequences. The new season sets a pretty high bar, leaving Netflix and Marvel with an altogether new quandary: how do you improve on something this spectacular?

Sensation Rise 2018: Rise for the city and for rhythm
","They say you never forget your first. Tri-city music festival Sensation can apply this concept too. Set to light up Gachibowli and to send the ground throbbing with unbelievable bass courtesy the 30,000 attendees and the line-up of artistes such as Mr White, Robin Schulz, Nicky Romero and more, October 27 is a date for EDM-lovers’ calenders. 
“Sensation is a festival that is deep-rooted in feelings and spirits, which are the very factors that differentiate the spectacle from the others around,” explains AB InBev marketing director Kartikeya Sharma, “[the festival] is celebrated for uniting fans in a surreal manner, creating waves of togetherness and euphoria. At Budweiser, we believe in authenticity and freedom, the two pillars of all our synergies and associations which works to create a memorable experience beyond just the ordinary, for everyone.”
Past themes of Sensation in Hyderabad have included ‘Welcome to the Pleasuredome’, ‘Source of Light’, ‘Innerspace’ and ‘Wicked Wonderland.’ While these all sound and have proven to be incredibly immersive and eye-catching, this year’s theme, ‘Rise’ has more socio-political grounding, but not overly so. Conflict, dissent and other energies of negativity are the antithesis of what Sensation Rise aims to pursue and that’s where Rise comes in. 




“The very foundation of the festival is a celebration of freedom and rebirth, liberating fans to unleash the best of themselves, in a unanimous and harmonious manner. The aura and atmosphere brew a vibe of togetherness, ensuring that the diverse fans feel part of the larger experience, irrespective of their backgrounds and origins... We live in a day and age where every minute, consumers are bombarded with multiple messages through multiple platforms. By the end of it, only the distinct and discerning mediums manage to make a mark in memory, which is especially true for millennials today. Experiences are growing to be an extremely important part of the marketing mix for brands, considering it is the only platform that allows for close and sustained interaction with the consumer.”




Budweiser is on board for their second year (their first being in 2016) with Sensation and the team is all geared up to bring their A-game. “ (Budweiser) always aims to go above and beyond and provide the most differentiated experiences; this year with Sensation Rise it will be no different. We will be offering the best of hospitality to our guests by bringing to the city the signature ‘Bud Hotel’ concept... We are curating a special zone: ‘The Budweiser Maze’ which is an immersive engagement zone wherein festival-goers can also get their hands on customized merchandise. The Sensation experience will then continue at the Bud Hotel, where we are hosting an exclusive after party for the artists and fans.” So clearly, the party never stops — nor should it. 
And of course, one has to keep in mind that safety is a priority. Sensation Rise 2018 is going to take place at Gachibowli stadium, keeping in mind the mammoth size of the event. Predictably, an event of this scale also entails a lot of planning, hard work and security which the collaborative teams are extensively working on, to provide for a great festival experience.

Don’t feel defined by ‘The Crown’ role, says Claire Foy "," ACtor Claire Foy says she does not feel that she is defined by the role of Queen Elizabeth II in The Crown.
The 34-year-old actor shot to global fame after playing the monarch in the Netflix royal drama for two seasons.
 She says though the role was an “honour” for her, she was not trying to actively break the mould.
“I don’t feel like I’m defined by playing Queen Elizabeth. It’s a huge honour that people liked that character and therefore see me as that character. So, I’m not trying to actively go against that,” Foy, who will be replaced by Olivia Colman as the Queen in the next two seasons, told People magazine.
 The actor, whose latest release was The Girl in the Spider’s Web, says she is selfish in her career choices.
“My career is only for me, really. I can’t do it for anybody else and so the choices and decisions I make are purely based on what I want to do. That’s it really. It’s a really selfish thing,” she says.

Anupam Kher resigns as chairperson of FTII ","Actor Anupam Kher resigned as chairperson of the Film and Television Institute of India on Wednesday, saying that it would not be possible for him to discharge his responsibilities due to his professional commitments in the U.S.
He is playing former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in a film based on a memoir written by Sanjaya Baru, a former media advisor to Dr. Singh. The film is expected to be released before the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.
In his resignation letter to Information and Broadcasting Minister Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore, Mr. Kher said he will be stationed in the U.S. for “nearly nine months between 2018 and 2019 and then for a similar period for a minimum of three years more” due to his commitment to the NBC series New Amsterdam.
“Given this assignment (the show), it would not be fair to me, the students and management team, for me to hold a position of such responsibility and accountability, without being actively involved in the operations,” he said in his letter.
Mr. Kher, 63, urged Mr. Rathore to accept his resignation and in the notice period scout for someone suitable to take over from him. “I will always be available, if needed, for any guidance or responsibility given to me as an individual,” he wrote.
His resignation letter, dated October 30, has been accepted by Mr. Rathore, who thanked Mr. Kher for his services to the premier institute, the I&B Ministry said in a statement here.
Mr. Kher had replaced Gajendra Chauhan, who had a controversial tenure as the head of the prestigious institute, in October last year.

This 'Sarkar', hardly rules
","Films provide instant, though brief gratification. We pay to watch a protagonist wipe out evildoers and correct social wrongs in a jiffy, fully aware of the reality that awaits us when we emerge from the cool confines of a multiplex. Of late there have been a slew of films about an ‘educated abroad’ youth ascending the political throne and cleaning out corruption in a couple of hours. If it’s not the reluctant son, then it’s someone who’s been wronged. Some like ‘Bharath Ane Nenu’ struck a chord while ‘Nota’ failed. Film stars with political ambitions using cinema as a platform is not uncommon in the South. MGR did it tacitly and achieved his goal with tact though it seemed effortless. People loved him for the empathy he exuded, while for Jayalalitha it was the sympathy that worked since she was looked upon as the protégé who was wronged. NT Rama Rao succeeded, but Chiranjeevi faded away. On-screen heroism is just not enough and fans alone cannot push a star to political power. Women voters are also the trump card. Then there was Dr. Raj Kumar who could have swept any poll effortlessly but decided that affection and love should not be used to attain power only to be misused by kin and clan.
 There is a general feeling in Tamil Nadu, not unfounded that politicians and film stars who seemed to suffer from verbal constipation when Jayalalitha was in power have suddenly become vocal. AR Murugadoss or Vijay would not have even dared to conceive leave alone make ‘Sarkar’ if the iron lady had been around. Even if they had managed to it would have rotted in the cans. Jayalalitha had an uneasy equation with Rajni, Kamal and Vijay who was snubbed when he tried to visit her at her summer retreat and request her to clear the hurdles surrounding the release of ‘Thalaivaa’. I’m sure she was not impressed with the title. Her demise has encouraged the three stars to try and fill the huge political vacuum. Vijay of course is still testing the waters, while Rajni is still dithering and Kamal is in the thick of things.
Enemy’s enemy is your friend and so the extremely choosy Vijay green lights a project produced by Sun Pictures and helmed by Murugadoss who’s still being cursed by Mahesh Babu’s fans for spinning a disastrous web called ‘Spyder’. The premise about the importance of a single vote is promising but is used for the hero’s personal propaganda. 
People are accused of accepting a pittance to vote while stars earn in crores just to further personal ambitions. The film brazenly attacks the present ruling government which would have been impossible before the end of 2016! Imagine naming the antagonist Komalavalli which was Jayalalitha’s real name! The film is replete with corporate and political innuendo. The ‘hero introduction’ is strange. He’s called Ghengis Khan, a Casanova and a corporate monster who gobbles up companies and renders thousands jobless and homeless.
 Hero’s name is Sundar supposedly inspired by Sundar Pichai and his company is called GL. When someone says hero is omnipresent on the net another chirps in that it’s because he owns the search engine. That’s not true about Sundar Pichai, but the similarity ends there. This guy looks like a spoilt brat who has inherited rather than built, smokes incessantly, emerges from a limousine and dances with scantily clad girls in a casino in Las Vegas.
 He boards a private jet and lands in India just to cast a vote only to be informed an impersonator has already done it. With the help of his lawyer (by the way he’s called Jethmalani) we’re enlightened about section 49P. He saunters into a private party at a friend’s place and lights up exposing his lack of basic etiquette. Well, a politician’s underling dares him and brat decides to stay back and fight. What follows is a long winding star vehicle of political sermons generously sprinkled with forgettable songs and bones being broken when brains are not being battered. There’s no time for romance so heroine Keerthi Suresh is treated like a junior artiste. I realised subtitles are a good way to overcome verbal censorship. Vajpayee is muted but mentioned in the subtitles! 
Politicians wear huge rings with a picture of their leader and also have a photograph peeping through the pockets of their white shirts. There are references to ‘Jalli Kattu’, farmer suicides, a family immolating themselves due to exorbitant interest rates charged by private lenders and even how tomato growers are taken advantage of. The film is mounted on a massive scale. Big budgets mean populating frames even when not necessary.
Vijay is the focal point so none of the other characters are properly fleshed out. The hero is introduced as extremely intelligent but uses muscle more often than grey matter. A politician who’s been in power for fifty years listens like a puppet to political advice from his young daughter living abroad. The humour feels forced and less said about Rahman’s music the better. If I’d written this script like I would have remained anonymous.
This ‘Sarkar’ is simply not fit to rule.

When Agumbe turned Malgudi
","A Kannada organization recently demanded that Malgudi Days directed by Shankar Nag be dubbed in Kannada, 32 years after one of India’s finest television serials was made. For those who reported the serial, striking for its native ambience, it was a moment for memories. Shankar Nag, a dreamer of the real sense passed away 28 years ago, leaving a bright and indelible impression on the celluloid world. Though Shankar Nag was known only in Kannada, the making of Malgudi Days catapulted him to the national scene. Had Shankar Nag lived, he would have turned 64 today.
It is difficult to find an answer as to why Shankar Nag made Malgudi Days, (based on R K Narayan's works, which in 1986 became a phenomenon) in Hindi and English rather than in Kannada. He could have offered a convincing reason. According to those, who worked with Shankar in late 80s, Shankar wanted to reach a wider audience and also to showcase Kannada talent across the country. Following the success of first 13 episodes, an elated Shankar had said: “Malgudi Days changed everything. Ordinary people come and chat with me about Malgudi Days even in places such as Delhi and Bombay. This has also helped me to jump airline queues, as they tend to treat me as a VIP,” he had smiled impishly.




Noted actor Ramesh Bhat, associate director of the acclaimed Malgudi Days who also essayed several roles, opposes the move of dubbing the serial in Kannada. 
“As a principle, the all-time classic serial should not be dubbed into Kannada. If needed, it is better to produce the serial with Kannada actors and crew with a fresh approach"". 
Malgudi Days was described as ""a piece of genuine India"" and viewers, especially in old Mysore region found themselves relating to each episode. This, in fact, is the outcome of any sincere cinematic exercise, which treats simple human folk in simple terms. Malgudi Days reached the hearts because of its plain looking characters and incidents, which helped them find latent mysteries of ordinary human existence. With the signature tune and music by L. Vaidyanathan (which is now a popular, ring tone), the heartwarming stories, sketches by R.K. Laxman, and performed by talented actors made Malgudi Days exemplary.




It is important that even Malgudi Days faced problem in the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) for no genuine reason. Some sentences in Mithaiwala episodes were muted by CBFC. Shankar Nag, who was shooting in Agumbe at that time, shot off a protest telegram to Doordarshan objecting to cursory unnotified censorship of certain harmless passages.




It is also sure that, certain things never tire audience. Set in British India, Malgudi, a fictional town, is a dream which viewers would like to see again and again. This idyllic world can never stale. R.K. Narayan, was often asked: ""Where is Malgudi""? To which, he in his introduction to the short story collection Malgudi Days (1942) says: “All I can say is that it is imaginary and not be found on any map (although the University of Chicago Press published a literary atlas with a map of India indicating the location of Malgudi.) If I explain that Malgudi is a small town in South India, I shall only be expressing half-truth, for the characteristics of Malgudi seem to be universal.”
It was a challenge for Shankar Nag and producer T.S. Narasimhan to zero in on Malgudi. Mysore is actually the Malgudi of Narayan, where the writer lived and wrote. As Mysore turning out to be metropolis and lost its old charm because of its urbanisation, producer and director considered Nanjangud town for a while. But, they rejected it, because of its proximity to Mysore. Finally, the one-street Agumbe, in the heart of Malnad found to be the fittest choice, because of its old charm, the sleepiness, the rustic ambience. With a river running quietly, century-old tiled houses and a sedate way of life and where television was just making an appearance with the help of tall boosters, Shankar found his imaginary Malgudi in Agumbe and surrounding areas. Arasalu village with its tiny railway station where just two train passes daily provided the ideal location for the serial.




The credit of transforming Agumbe into Malgudi has to go to the sculptor, art director and town planner John Devaraj. He conceptualised everything that needs to make Agumbe look like the imaginary Malgudi. He created carts, statues, avenues, shops, bus stand, schools, shops everything. According to Jagadish Malnad, who was in control of production, Shankar Nag invested loads of energy and enterprise into imaging the minute details of life in Malgudi. Shankar Nag’s precision for details and authenticity turning Agumbe into Malgudi had become a daunting task. Donkeys were transported from Shimoga to Agumbe and elephants from Bangalore. Austin and Hindustan cars were borrowed from friends. A road-roller had to be transported from Bangalore. Shankar Nag virtually erected a gaiety land replete with dancers, wrestlers, fire eaters, bangle sellers for Talkative Man episode. Crowds were lured from nearby villages by wooing them with lunch and bus fare. Hundred plus actors and crew were lodged in the houses of the village. Almost every house hosted one member of the team recalls Ramesh Bhat. 
After three decades, there are no traces of Malgudi in Agumbe. Time has erased even memories. Some of the properties of Malgudi Days, which Shankar left for the people of Agumbe, is in the premises of a school. But, people of Agumbe still remember Shankar Nag, who gave it more meaning than being known to receive highest rainfall in the Western Ghats.

Thrilling and moving ","Julia Roberts has been entertaining the movie audiences for three decades now. For the first time in her career, she has stepped into the world of television as part of the main cast for Amazon Prime’s Homecoming. She has previously guest-starred in several shows, but, her role in the new thriller series marks a diametric shift, as leading Hollywood stars are looking to open their doors to let the breeze of the small screen envelope them.
Earlier this year, we saw Amy Adams slip into the shoes of Camille Preaker in HBO’s Sharp Objects; and, in Homecoming, similarly, Roberts stands in the center, with every character designed to move around her. She plays a counselor, named Heidi Bergman, who helps soldiers get back on the plane of civilian life. Her charming smile is used to its fullest extent as she wears it readily during her conversations with her patient-turned-friend Walter Cruz (Stephan James). Cruz also has a smile, which transitions from handsome to playful, and, it’s a delight to watch these two actors talk about road trips that they might take in the future.
Homecoming is divided between two periods – one, in 2018, where Bergman is settling into her job as a counselor at the homecoming facility, and, the second one in 2022, where she’s working as a waitress at a diner. While the 2018 portions are shot in the widescreen aspect ratio, the latter is boxed in a square as a visual metaphor since Bergman can’t remember much about her days as a counsellor. Her incapacitated view of what’s happening around her is presented on-screen in this amusing manner.
In the initial episodes, when Shrier (Jeremy Allen White), a soldier and Cruz’s roommate, argues that the programme is a scam, we don’t believe him. What could a bunch of soft-spoken people do to soldiers, after all? And, in the same way, when a bureaucrat (Shea Whigham as Thomas Carrasco) from the Department of Defense asks Bergman if she knows Cruz, outside the diner, she answers in the negative. At this point, we don’t know, like Shrier and Carrasco, what’s true and what’s not.
These nifty elements add to the intriguing nature of the series. Homecoming is based on the fiction podcast of the same name by Eli Horowitz and Micah Bloomberg, and all the half-hour episodes of the first season are directed by Sam Esmail (the creator of Mr. Robot). The season ends on a hopeful note, albeit with a bleak twist, and I’m waiting to see what the mega heads behind this carefully crafted show are going to bring us in season two.
Carrasco, in particular, as an employee at an organisation that doesn’t recognize his skills, took my heart. He stops by at the diner to follow up on an anonymous complaint that’s lodged against the homecoming facility. From there on, you can see how patient and invisible he acts. Whigham plays him, with a sense of confidence, and not with a sorry face, even though he’s constantly made to feel small by his boss as she brings up his position in the office. In one of the last few episodes, he gets a chance to lose his temper and yell at Colin Belfast (Bobby Cannavale), Bergman’s former boss, as he gets ridicules by him for simply doing his job. But, Carrasco’s hard face doesn’t show any emotion and he stands there as if he’s turning a deaf ear.
Homecoming reminded me of Adrian Lyne’s Jacob's Ladder and Michel Gondry’s Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind for different reasons – Jacob’s Ladder deals with soldiers and their traumas; whereasEternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind digs deeper into what some people want to hold on to, and what they want to let go of. These two brilliantly written films may have inspired the creators of Homecoming, but Horowitz and Bloomberg have their own take on how certain factors of science fiction can scare the living daylights out of us.

‘Not just about the bigger cities anymore,’ says Atul Khatri
"," When one of the country’s top 20 comedians (so says CNN-IBN) says, “Stand up comedy is here to stay,” you have to believe it. Atul Khatri, who said that, looks forward to performs at the Headliners show in Hyderabad later this week, ostensibly ‘because this is his first show after Diwali’ as per his social media post. 
His optimism stems from the fact that stand up comedy which is more than a few decades old in the west is proof that this it is here to stay, though it might be in a nascent stage in India. “Like theatre and movies, this form of entertainment will not lose its sheen. With newer and brighter artistes coming up, the audience is getting bigger and bigger. The scene is improving.”
For more proof, Atul cites the success of his recent show in Tinsukia town of Assam. He had no idea of a place called Tinsukia until he signed the show. He shares, “The strong crowd presence there overwhelmed me. Bigger cities and towns are no more the only hotspots to perform.”
Atul says frankly, “This kind of reach is possible only because we are all connected through the internet. There is hardly anyone who doesn’t have a smart phone and net connectivity. Given the forward rate in Whatsapp and the speed at which the share button is used on social media, our reach gets better. Then there is YouTube as well. Audiences come to shows only after they have seen us on YouTube, so it is the first platform that any artiste gets.”
The comedian who makes audience roll in laughter with lines delivered with a straight face, says the content he uploads on video hosting platforms, including YouTube, is different from what he performs on stage. “The upcoming Headliners show in Hyderabad has all new content. It is a fresh concept and each of us will have 25 minutes on stage,” he adds. On video hosting platforms, Atul says, “They are opening new windows to reach out to more audiences. While YouTube needs a lot of filtering, viewing platforms like Netflix, Amazon Prime Video are all about premium content that allows viewers to select.”
Will he be able to make up for his Diwali expenditure with this show’s sales? “Sales look good. I will be performing with three other brilliant artistes Varun Thakur, Aishwarya Mohanraj and Prashasti Singh, so audiences can enjoy themselves.” 
Atul Khatri performs for ‘Headliners’ at Sri Satya Sai Nigamagamam on November 17 at 6:30pm. Tickets: ₹799 on insider.in.

Marvel Comics legend Stan Lee dead at 95
","Stan Lee, who dreamed up Spider-Man, Iron Man, the Hulk and a cavalcade of other Marvel Comics superheroes that became mythic figures in pop culture with soaring success at the movie box office, died at the age of 95, his daughter said on Monday.
As a writer and editor, Lee was key to the ascension of Marvel into a comic book titan in the 1960s when, in collaboration with artists such as Jack Kirby and Steve Ditko, he created superheroes who would enthrall generations of young readers.
“He felt an obligation to his fans to keep creating,” his daughter J.C. Lee said in a statement to Reuters. “He loved his life and he loved what he did for a living. His family loved him and his fans loved him. He was irreplaceable.”
She did not mention Lee's cause of death but the TMZ celebrity news website said an ambulance was called to Lee's Hollywood Hills home early Monday and that he died at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center.
Americans were familiar with superheroes before Lee, in part thanks to the 1938 launch of Superman by Detective Comics, the company that would become DC Comics, Marvel's archrival.
Lee was widely credited with adding a new layer of complexity and humanity to superheroes. His characters were not made of stone — even if they appeared to have been chiseled from granite. They had love and money worries and endured tragic flaws or feelings of insecurity.
“I felt it would be fun to learn a little about their private lives, about their personalities and show that they are human as well as super,” Lee told NPR News in 2010.
He had help in designing the superheroes but he took full ownership of promoting them.
His creations included web-slinging teenager Spider-Man, the muscle-bound Hulk, mutant outsiders The X-Men, the close-knit Fantastic Four and the playboy-inventor Tony Stark, better known as Iron Man.
Dozens of Marvel Comics movies, with nearly all the major characters Lee created, were produced in the first decades of the 21st century, grossing over $20 billion at theaters worldwide, according to box office analysts.
Spider-Man is one of the most successfully licensed characters ever and he has soared through the New York skyline as a giant inflatable in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade.
Lee, as a hired hand at Marvel, received limited payback on the windfall from his characters.
In a 1998 contract, he wrestled a clause for 10 percent of profits from movies and TV shows with Marvel characters. In 2002, he sued to claim his share, months after “Spider-Man” conquered movie theaters. In a legal settlement three years later, he received a $10 million one-time payment.
Hollywood studios made superheroes the cornerstone of their strategy of producing fewer films and relying on big profits from blockbusters. Some people assumed that, as a result, Lee's wealth had soared. He disputed that.
“I don't have $200 million. I don't have $150 million. I don't have $100 million or anywhere near that,” Lee told Playboy magazine in 2014. Having grown up in the Great Depression, Lee added that he was “happy enough to get a nice paycheck and be treated well.”
In 2008, Lee was awarded the National Medal of Arts, the highest government award for creative artists.
Lee was born as Stanley Martin Lieber in New York on December 28, 1922, the son of Jewish immigrants from Romania. At age 17, he became an errand boy at Timely Comics, the company that would evolve into Marvel. He got the job with help from an inside connection, his uncle, according to Lee's autobiography ”Excelsior!”
Lee soon earned writing duties and promotions. He penned Western stories and romances, as well as superhero tales, and often wrote standing on the porch of the Long Island, New York, home he shared with his wife, actress Joan Lee, whom he married in 1947 and who died in 2017.
The couple had two children, Joan Celia born in 1950 and Jan Lee who died within three days of her birth in 1953.
In 1961 Lee's boss saw a rival publisher's success with caped crusaders and told Lee to dream up a superhero team.
Lee at the time felt comics were a dead-end career. But his wife urged him to give it one more shot and create the complex characters he wanted to, even if it led to his firing.
The result was the Fantastic Four. There was stretchable Mr. Fantastic, his future wife Invisible Woman, her brother the Human Torch and strongman The Thing. They were like a devoted but dysfunctional family.
“Stan's characters were always superheroes that had a certain amount of humanity about them or a flaw,” said Shirrel Rhoades, a former executive vice president of Marvel and its publisher in the mid-1990s.
“As iconic as Superman may be, he's considered a Boy Scout. He doesn't have any real flaws,” Rhoades said. “Whereas you take a Spider-Man, kids identify with him because he had his problems like they did. He suffered from great angst.”
Lee involved his artists in the process of creating the story and even the characters themselves, in what would come to be known as the “Marvel Method.” It sometimes led critics to fault Lee for taking credit for ideas not entirely his own.
He described his creative process to Reuters in outlining how he came up with his character Thor, the god of thunder borrowed from Norse mythology.
“I was trying to think of something that would be totally different,” he said. “What could be bigger and even more powerful than the Hulk? And I figured why not a legendary god?”
To give Thor more rhetorical punch, Lee gave him dialogue styled after the Bible and Shakespeare.
As for Tony Stark-Iron Man, he was based on industrialist Howard Hughes, Lee told interviewers.
Lee became Marvel's publisher in 1972. He went on the lecture circuit, moved to Los Angeles in 1980 and pursued opportunities for his characters in movies and television.
Through it all, he kept connected with fans, writing a column called “Stan's Soapbox” in which he often slipped in his catchphrase “'Nuff Said” or the sign-off “Excelsior!” In his later years, he gave constant updates via Twitter.
“Stan was a character. He was a character as much as any he ever created,” Rhoades said. “He created himself, in a way.”
He also made cameos in most Marvel films, pulling a girl away from falling debris in 2002's “Spider-Man” and serving as an emcee at a strip club in 2016's “Deadpool.”
The Walt Disney Co bought Marvel Entertainment in 2009 for $4 billion in a deal to expand Disney's roster of characters, with the most iconic ones having been Lee's handiwork.
By that point, Lee had all but parted ways with Marvel after being made a chairman emeritus of the company. But even in his 80s and 90s, Lee was a wellspring of new projects, running a company called POW! Entertainment.
“His greatest legacy will be not only the co-creation of his characters but the way he helped to build the culture that comics have become, which is a pretty significant one,” said Robert Thompson, a pop culture expert at Syracuse University.

Loud & clear: Audible comes to India
","Less than 24 hours after Audible — the audiobook publisher and retailer currently owned by Amazon — is launched in India at a glitzy event at the Royal Opera House in Mumbai, I sit down for a phone call with Donald Katz, Founder and CEO. This week’s launch means that Indian customers now have access to over 2,00,000 English-language audiobooks and original content, including 400 exclusive titles by local authors. And Katz is the high-profile, sneaker-wearing, start-up loving founder behind it all.
“I was most excited to talk to you,” he starts, going on to ask me about my background in theatre. “Are you aware of the things we’re doing with playwrights, and of our theatre fund?” he asks.
I am momentarily stumped, wondering if Katz — named one of America’s Top 25 Disruptive Leaders (by Living Cities) — has come better prepared for this interview than I have. But it is also not a surprise. He credits his past as an “inquisitive journalist” (he has served as a contributing editor for publications like Rolling Stone and Esquire) with giving him sharp observational skills, incredible honesty and a desire to “find the truth”. That, combined with his interest in early-stage start-ups, has helped make his 23-year-old company one of the largest success stories of technology in the creative space.
From Anne Hathaway (The Wonderful Wizard of Oz) to Kate Winslet (Matilda, among others), Audible is replete with celebrity narrators, and the Indian platform is no different. The showstopper at the launch this week was a rendition of Hussain Zaidi and Jane Borges’ Mafia Queens of Mumbai, the 2011 book about the female doyens in Mumbai’s underworld, narrated by actors Radhika Apte, Kalki Koechlin and Rajkummar Rao.
But to call Audible just an audiobook seller would severely limit its vast scope. It has revived plays, commissioned new works and has convinced established authors like Michael Lewis to bypass print and go straight to audio. Above all, the company has helped make audio books cool again.
“I'm just excited about customising the cause of the creative community throughout,” says Katz, about this remarkable journey. “You see how we have branched out into so many realms of the professional creative class.” 
He admits that the rise of Audible is “non-obvious. It’s not a super-fast, interactive, short-form experience”. But he is also able to explain the acceptance of the medium. “As a writer, I realised we’re all pretty much writing to the same, fairly smart, sophisticated person who is precisely the person who doesn’t have a lot of time,” he says. 
The idea with Audible was to give people the opportunity to consume quality content. After the 2008 merger, users were able to login to Audible with their Amazon credentials. Along with the other pioneers of the space (hello, podcasters), it has successfully offered audio as a content solution that fits in with the busy-ness of modern life. Commutes, elliptical machines, laundromats — all perfect settings for a good (audio) book.
Audible’s global expansion is slow and calculated, placing great emphasis on local context. On audible.co.jp, for instance, audiences can listen to anime actors performing dramatic recreations of manga, “which is appropriate because the book culture there is very large”. 
In India, the customisation (which includes a range of exclusive titles by Indian authors, such as Durjoy Datta’s first audio romance, The Last Boy to Fall in Love), also extends to pricing. A subscription to the platform will set you back by ₹199 per month, while American customers typically pay around ₹1,090. 
When I ask Katz about future plans for India, he and Shailesh Sawlani, the country GM for Audible India (ex-Uber), emphasise that an expansion to regional languages is definitely on the cards. “It’s just the beginning,” he concludes.

Radhika Apte and Rajkummar Rao on their collaboration with Audible
","After a star-studded launch event at Mumbai’s Royal Opera House this week, Amazon-owned audiobook retailer and publisher Audible has officially entered the Indian market. With over 2,00,000 titles, of which around 400 are exclusive works by Indian authors, the service is priced at ₹199 per month (versus the approximately ₹1,080 fee paid by American customers).
The headliner of the launch event was the audio rendition of investigative journalist Hussain Zaidi’s 2011 book Mafia Queens of Mumbai, which delves into the stories of the lesser known female figures of Mumbai’s underworld. Narrated by actors Radhika Apte, Rajkummar Rao and Kalki Koechlin, it was one of many titles released for an Indian audience. Other titles include Durjoy Datta’s The Last Boy to Fall in Love and Dale Carnegie’s How to Win Friends and Influence People (as narrated by Shernaz Patel).
“It was challenging,” says Rajkummar Rao — the National Award-winning actor whose recent film, Stree, has won both critical and commercial acclaim — about his foray into voice acting. “I thought it would be a chance for me to explain something new, to narrate a story with just my voice.”
Even though Rao, Apte and Koechlin stem from the visual medium, their participation in this venture does not come as a surprise. The women especially have been dabbling in new mediums, leading the cohort of Bollywood actors producing over-the-top (OTT) content such as web series, podcasts and Netflix originals. And they believe that India is well-positioned for the audiobook boom. “With phenomenal actors like Radhika and Kalki, and an average actor like me narrating a story, I think people will get used to the format in India,” says Rao, jokingly.
Radhika Apte, who heard about Audible earlier this year when it was recommended to her by a friend, concurs. “We have a culture of storytelling,” says the actor who has just wrapped up performances in The Wedding Guest and Lydia Pilcher’s untitled project. “And at a time when there is so much bombardment of visual content all the time, I think it’s very therapeutic and meditative to listen to something.”

Lost Disney film showing Mickey Mouse's predecessor found in Japan ","When Yasushi Watanabe bought a cartoon film decades ago as a high school student in the Japanese city of Osaka, he had no idea he was purchasing animation history.
But the modest reel he bought for just 500 yen ($4.40 in today's money) has been revealed as a rare lost cartoon produced by Walt Disney featuring a character that led to the creation of Mickey Mouse.
The discovery was reported by Japan's Asahi Shimbun daily, which Watanabe contacted after reading a book about the history of “Oswald the Lucky Rabbit”, the character Disney created in the 1920s.
While Disney created the character, complete with oversized ears and a button nose, he lost the rights to another company, prompting him to develop a new cartoon figure: Mickey Mouse.
The book said seven of the 26 short films featuring Oswald that Walt Disney produced were missing, and Watanabe remembered his childhood reel.
It was labelled in Japanese “Mickey Manga Spide” -- Mickey Cartoon Speedy in English -- and featured a dog policeman on a motorbike chasing Oswald and his girlfriend in a car.
As the trio speed around valleys and along roads, the characters and the vehicles stretched and shrank, the Asahi reported, using a technique that later featured commonly in Disney works.
The newspaper contacted the author of the book and the Walt Disney Archives and confirmed that the reel was indeed one of the missing films, originally titled “Neck 'n' Neck.”
“We're absolutely delighted to learn that a copy of the lost film exists,” Becky Cline, director of the archives, told the newspaper.
“As I've been a Disney fan for many years, I'm happy I was able to play a role (in the discovery,” added Watanabe, an anime history researcher who is now 84.
His childhood purchase is now housed at the Kobe Planet Film Archive, and another film showing 50 seconds of the same cartoon has also been unearthed at the Toy Film Museum in Kyoto, the newspaper said.
In 2014, Norway's National Library announced it had discovered a copy of a Walt Disney cartoon featuring Oswald, which had been thought lost.
The cartoon, titled “Empty Socks,” was the first Christmas film made by the US entertainment giant and was discovered during an inventory at the library's facility near the Arctic Circle.
A year later, another short film featuring Oswald was uncovered in Britain and screened for the first time in 87 years.

'Motta Maadi Music' to celebrate Kamal's songs ","It’s a breezy summer evening in Chennai and a motley group of people are plonked on a jamakalam spread across a nondescript motta maadi (terrace) in Nanganallur. A nearby temple bell chimes and it looks like the group is prepping for a paatu class. But not really. They whip out their smartphones and search ‘Strawberry Penne’ lyrics.
They are in the middle of a Motta Maadi Music session, the sixth one this year, themed around AR Rahman. The stars are out just in time as everyone sings in chorus, “Vinveli peneee!”
Literally meaning open terrace music, this initiative brings together people for one sole purpose — to sing their hearts out together. “My only aim is to get people to lose inhibitions and sing,” says Badhri Narayanan Seshadri, a sound engineer and an independent musician, who conceptualised Motta Maadi Music and on whose terrace the event takes place. This is perhaps why the event has become so popular across all age groups in just six months. It is only the voice of the collective crowd that is heard: the perfect fix for someone who loves singing but is too embarrassed to attempt anything.
Badhri is also part of Hrudhya, the band which plays at every session, lending support to the audience. 
The first session, conducted in January, saw a little under 25 people milling about on the roof. Ilaiyaraaja night and Rahman night, however, witnessed at least 180 participants. “We did not do any promotion whatsover, except create a Facebook event page,” Badhri says. “The massive attendance was all word-of-mouth.”
On an event night, Badhri is busy shuttling between setting the instruments, giving directions over the phone and trying to pump up the audience. His family helps out too: his mother prepares piping hot filter coffee for the first hundred people, his dad and uncle make sure there are no parking problems for those who attend. Some members of the audience were so completely involved in singing, that they did not notice a plate of biscuits and a tray of soft drinks passed around by Badhri’s family.
He is open to the idea of providing a platform for other bands to showcase their original music during the event. “It is tough for young bands to find a large audience. I’d be happy to have a band performing in the middle of our session.”
But in the end, it is all about celebrating music. Badhri says the audience have now started owning Motta Maadi Music. “From me hosting the event, it has gone on to become their show. They choose the songs, they set the tempo and the tone for the night.”
Entry is free for Motta Maadi Music’s upcoming session, Haasan Night, celebrating songs of Kamal Haasan, scheduled on November 17. The performers for the evening are Pramodh (lead guitar), Kiran (violin), Ramya (keys), Vishwesh and Achyuth (bass), Vignesh (cajon). Visit www.facebook.com/ MottaMaadi Music for details.

Netflix mulls ‘content code’ in India
","Global streaming major Netflix may consider joining a broader initiative to develop a content code that could help in self-regulation of the over-the-top (OTT) media industry in India, a source close to the company said.
Reacting to a news report that Netflix was likely to censor content distributed in the country — a report that Netflix denied in a terse one-line statement — the person, speaking to The Hindu on condition of anonymity, said: “There was a meeting at the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) event on October 30 that invited people from across the entertainment industry along with online portals where self-regulation of content was discussed.”
Discussions at the meeting touched on the possibility of setting up a self-regulatory subscription video-on-demand industry content code, similar to what is followed by ASEAN countries, according to the source. “I can’t confirm if Netflix will do something like this,” the person said, adding “but it stands to reason that they will look at it.”
A recent public interest litigation (PIL) filed at the Nagpur Bench of the Bombay High Court drew the court’s attention to ‘obscene and vulgar’ TV shows being streamed through online portals and sought prescription of some regulatory guidelines.
Delhi-based NGO Justice for Rights Foundation filed a petition in the Delhi High Court complaining of “unregulated, uncertified, sexually explicit, vulgar, profane, and legally restricted content” on online platforms in the country. On being asked by the Delhi High Court to intervene, the Central government admitted that there was no policy on regulating online content.
Last year, Amazon Prime Video removed a portion of the fourth episode of The Grand Tour — where Jeremy Clarkson drives a car made of animal carcasses — respecting Indian sensibilities. The move was largely recognised at the time by media outlets as a preemptive cautionary measure.
According to the source , a willingness to consider self-regulation was misinterpreted as likelihood that the platform may censor content.
“In my understanding, it’s something similar to, for example, parental controls and other measures that will protect children from adult content, a feature that Netflix already offers,” the person said, without elaborating.

Being Kaikeyi...
","Anjana Chandak sits in quiet contemplation waiting for the audience to settle down. Dressed in rich cream silk and wearing lots of jewellery, she appears very much the queen that she will play shortly, Mai Kaikeyi. Ranjana Singhal of Thats Y Food, along with the Coimbatore Metropolitan Ladies Circle 23, has organised an evening that promises to be different. And it is.
“I am Kaikeyi,” begins Anjana and, for the next 45 minutes, she tells us what it means to be arguably the most reviled and hated woman in Indian mythology. “I am one of those whose name crops up in revulsion, rage and contempt. Do you know of anyone who has named their daughter ‘Kaikeyi’?”
Five minutes into her monologue, it becomes obvious that Kaikeyi is a woman wronged. When Dasharatha asks for her hand in marriage, he is already a much-married man and years older than her. “Was it wrong on the part of my father to ask Dasharatha for an assurance that my offspring would be the crown prince? My husband readily gave his word and then reneged on it. I saved my husband’s life in battle and he granted me two wishes. When I asked him to deliver on them, he went back on his word. My husband waited till Bharat was out of Ayodhya to announce Rama’s coronation. Why?” 
Kaikeyi stands there and speaks her mind. She admits that she did not realise the consequences of her actions but asks why history was so merciless to her that it did not give her a chance to repent. There is remorse perhaps, but anger too. “I was wronged and then I was branded as evil personified and forever maligned,” she says. “When my son rejected me, I thought nothing of going to Chitrakoot and, in the presence of hundreds of people, begging Rama to come back.” That is how much she loved her son, but that fact is glossed over.
Kaikeyi doesn’t raise her voice once. Yet the passion, intensity and anguish is there for everyone to see and hear. There is pin drop silence as she finishes saying what she has to say. She has tears in her eyes, but her head is held high. 
Anjana then speaks to the audience as herself. She asks how often we have been guilty of judging people without giving them a chance to defend themselves. “We are always looking for scapegoats when we want to explain something that has gone wrong. Darkness and light are both in us. Sometimes the darkness takes over and we lose our sense of right or wrong; of justice and decency. But then again there is light and we make amends. But Kaikeyi was not given that chance to redeem herself or repent. She was branded and hanged for being a blot on womanhood. Is that just? Mythili Sharan Gupt’s poem Kaikeyi ka Anutap  (The repentance of Kaikeyi), is what inspired the monologue,” she explains.
An interior designer by profession, Ajnana took a leap of faith into art that reflects her spiritual growth. “I did a series of paintings on Varanasi and have just finished a series on Kabir,” she says.
Despite the fact that Hindi is not widely spoken or understood in Coimbatore, the audience (many of whom did not know Hindi) was moved. Anjana’s expressions, tone of voice and emotional delivery told them everything. One young mother said she was determined to tell the story of Ramayana to her child from Kaikeyi’s perspective too. Many of those present said that Anjana had rendered Kaikeyi into a woman of substance; a powerful one who was not afraid to speak her mind or fight for her rights. A much more empowered human being than the ‘ideal mother and wife’ mould a woman is always cast into, whether or not she wants it. “We would rather be a real woman like Kaikeyi than a Nirupa Roy,” was one of the pithy comments.

Narcos Mexico: Of men and monsters
","The Mexican drug war has claimed more than 1,20,000 lives since 2006 when the country’s military got involved. Back in 1997 — a decade before the Latin American country’s government stepped in to reduce drug-based violence — American producer Eric Newman had just heard about the Cali cartel in horrifying detail. 
“This was eight years after the Berlin Wall had come down and we had effectively vanquished communism,” he remembers. “We had completely ignored and contributed to allowing drug traffic take route. The level of violence in ’97 hadn’t gotten as bad as it eventually did. The events in [the] 80s and early 90s Mexico have contributed to this [situation]. Opioids have killed so many people and it’s truly scary.”
The vast amount of information he unearthed was too expansive for a feature film which Newman initially wanted. “To do it properly, you have to do it in a longer format. You can’t portray humans doing inhuman things and also [simultaneously] humanise them in two hours.” Cut to 2015, and the launch of Narcos, the show, which has Newman as executive producer and showrunner, was responsible for a hike in Netflix subscriptions all over the world. After dissecting Colombian drug kingpin Pablo Escobar’s life and works in two seasons and the gruesome methods of the Cali cartel in the show’s third season, the scene has shifted to the Guadalajara cartel.
In what is essentially a reset for the show, Narcos Mexico chronicles the rise and fall of drug king Félix Gallardo who single-handedly organised the drug business in Mexico. Newman along with the stars of the new season, Diego Luna and Michael Peña were recently in Mumbai to launch the series. “He managed to seat on the table, people who were trying to kill each other,” says Luna who plays Gallardo. “He managed to get them to protect each other and create a system that was more important than any man. He could be engaging and charming and he was like a politician.”
Hot on Gallardo’s heels is American DEA agent Kiki Camarena (Michael Peña) who, though fiercely motivated to do the right thing, has just about everything against him. Though the show focuses on the often excruciating cat and mouse chase between the two, it transcends being a mere thriller about drugs. “Someone once called [our show] pulp non-fiction and I like that very much,” laughs Newman. “Our goal is to take the signature landmark events and we string together a story and sometimes we have to take liberties. Even a documentary has a fair amount of subjectivity but through the courageous work of journalists we have been able to create a pretty reliable narrative.”
 While Newman deftly gives his audience self-inflicted manicures with the horrors rendered by the drug war, he also breaks down why the law enforcement of both countries has failed its people and allowed the opioid industry to flourish. At the heart of Narcos Mexico, is the callousness of Americans to do their job, the extensive political corruption of the Latin American country and the victims that are a result of an insatiable need for money and power. Through ten one-hour-long episodes, the show dissects the origins of how the opioid war has decimated thousands of lives. “I have always been drawn to the interconnected nature of this world,” says Newman talking about how the cocaine trade in London is the same in Mumbai or even Mexico, coming from the same source. Drug addition, according to the producer, should be treated as a health care crisis instead of a law and order one. Pena reiterates, “The news in America is very one-sided…that the cartels have done all this horrible stuff. I think if we stop the demand, then the drugs too will stop.”
While the trio admit that Narcos Mexico is entertainment, they are hopeful of drawing attention to and maybe starting a discourse on drug wars. “The danger is more prevalent now,” emphasises Newman, adding that while we are so busy looking for monsters, we might oversee those formed by the appetite for drugs in America. “It’s as stupid as thinking that a wall is somehow going to solve our problems. We have an obligation to paint these people, not as we wish they were, but how they actually were. Escobar did evil things for sure, but he’s a man just like anyone else and if we deny that then you miss the next one that comes along.”

4K version of Rajinikanth's 1995 superhit 'Muthu' to release in Japan
","Rajinikanth’s 1995 superhit Muthu has been restored in 4K and will be re-released in Tokyo, Japan, this month.
The film directed by K.S. Ravikumar and produced by Kavithalayaa Productions will be released in other screens and cities in Japan by mid-December. 
This is the first time a restored movie is being released abroad. Muthu was launched earlier in Japan as the Dancing Maharaja, acquiring cult status. 
In a short, two-minute video, Rajinikanth has wished the people of Japan and welcomed them (Japanese audience) to watch the film. “This video will be played before the movie begins,” said Kandaswamy Bharathan, joint managing director, Kavithalayaa Productions. The video bytes given by the superstar will be used for promotions across Japanese TV and social media channels.
“We have restored the print in 4K and 5.1 CH surround. We went frame-by-frame and removed the glitches. We roped in a Mumbai-based firm for this purpose,” he added.
In addition to taking up 4K scan and repair work from original negatives, 5.1 CH digital remix was carried out under the supervision of music director A.R. Rahman. It took nine weeks to complete the entire process and give a new avatar to this movie. 
“In the 90s, we had monoaudio and so had to convert it to suit today’s technology,” said Mr. Bharathan. 
The film will be in Tamil with subtitles in Japanese.
Muthu was first released in Japan in October 1998 across 50 screens. The title of the film was Odoru Maharaja’ (Dancing Maharaja) and it completed over a 100-day run with the highest box office collection in the Japanese market then. In 2006, former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh made a special mention about the film in his address to Japan’s Parliament.
According to Mr. Bharathan, the Japanese identified Muthu as a movie of tolerance, compassion and with great human.
The new trailer has been released in Japan and has gone viral. 
Eden Entertainment, a Japanese distribution firm, and Kavithalayaa are working towards making this release a grand success. 
The film will run in over 25 screens with an average seating capacity of 250 each, according to sources.

Zach King on life as a ‘digipreneur’
","Sitting in his workspace in Rossmoor, California, Zachary King and his team are battling floods and playing with fire. Or at least, they are making it look like they are. 3D printers at their disposal, they are engineering visual illusions that King likes to call ‘practical magic’. 
Out in the digital stratosphere, his weeks-old video on magic tricks for travel (converting a globe into a neck pillow, squishing a suitcase so it fits between your palms) has already amassed over 1,75,000 views. With over three million followers on YouTube and 21 million on Instagram, King has spent 10 years honing the skills that allow him to conjure visuals that look like magic but are actually masterful applications of his editing prowess.
“It was a take on a Steven Spielberg, or the brilliance of George Lucas, really,” he says about his aesthetic and emphasis on special effects. Visuals from Jurassic Park and Indiana Jones pushed King towards film school, a journey that quickly transgressed into the the digital space a decade ago. 
Discovering virality
King forayed into the digital world when he started uploading videomaking and editing tutorials on YouTube, helping his then audience of almost 50,000 master Final Cut Pro (hence the nickname Final Cut King). A stray comment on one of the videos changed his path.
“My audience asked me one question: how can you take these visual effects and apply it to a story?” he recalls. So, he joined hands with college buddy Erin to make his very first viral video in 2011: Jedi Kittens. Featuring two light-sabre wielding, duelling kittens, the video — replete with special effects that showed the cats performing impossible stunts — amassed three million views in 24 hours.
“We couldn’t believe it. Going viral was something we’d seen happen to other people, never us,” he explains. 
The success of that video prompted King to join Vine, where creators only had “six seconds to make an impact”. With growing acclaim in the influencer community, he started receiving offers for brand deals and collaborations.




What is in a medium?
Today, with a team of 20 and a transition from Vine to Instagram (with an active YouTube presence), King believes that the current digital world is “a whole other animal”.
“Each medium is its own learning,” he says. “While YouTube is great because of how much time it allows, that’s even more time to lose the audience’s attention span. On the other hand, mediums like Vine and Instagram have been amazing exercises in creative control and prioritising content — they’ve been like my training grounds.”
How to build a following
 Ask King what the ticket to a viral video is, and you might receive a counterintuitive response.
“It’s simple — don’t try to go viral,” he advises. “Instead, focus on quality content. You can’t get complacent, you have to constantly evolve.”
Inspired by the works of visual effects artist Andrew Kramer and Film Riot (Ryan Connolly’s web show that explores filmmaking), and the continuous innovation by platforms like Disney and Pixar, King cites his follower base as his largest motivator, not the views.
And then there is mentorship. He is passionate about sharing his trade tricks with young, new-age digital influencers. To do that, he has teamed up with Apple’s video training collaboration program, Today at Apple, where he will host sessions on video editing, sharing his knowledge about the same technology that he picked up from the Apple genius bar when he started out.
“Creators nowadays are in their teens, sometimes at an age where they can’t judge what good content is and why they’re creating what they are,” he says. “As people who have experience and seen a bit of success, it’s our job to show the next generation that if you put out good content, you will attract an audience. It’ll take longer, but it’s more sustainable, more rewarding.”
This newfound role as a guide is one of King’s largest passions as he envisions a new-fangled digital world for his two kids to grow up in. But where does the real magic happen?
“In my home, in front of my kids, at the kitchen table, sometimes. I love doing the most basic magic tricks for them, watching them freak out,” he laughs. “After all, that’s where the magic all began.”

One, two, three, keep watching: Why autoplay is critical part of our lives
","After reading many rave reviews, I recently decided to watch The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel, available on Amazon Prime. It’s a period show about a hilarious young woman’s self-discovery after her husband leaves her, in the New York of the ’50s. I thought I’d stick to one episode, maybe two, one evening. But it turned, as these things often do, into a marathon session. I literally did not have to move through the four episodes I saw in one sitting — one would finish and, sure as day, the next one would follow without any external input from me. Do I, then, curse the autoplay? Or do I bless it with all my heart for turning me into a bum (a very content one, admittedly)? 
Inbuilt stupidity
The YouTube autoplay feature, when it first came out, was arguably the most annoying thing on all of the Internet. Its inbuilt stupidity was frightening. So, for example, if you’re listening to a classic by the Spice Girls, and the song finishes and you look away for a second, next thing you know, you’re halfway through a cooking video on how to best use Mediterranean spices. And that was on a good day. Like the hot water running out in the middle of a shower, or a raisin in a savoury dish, or a much-loved uncle turning out to be openly bigoted, the autoplay threw up unpleasant surprises in the most unexpected of ways. It was the worst, and everyone hated it. But YouTube persevered with it, for the benefit of seemingly no one. 
There’s a music streaming platform called SoundCloud, mostly used for underground or noncommercial music — it’s useful for artists, as they can upload their music for free. Their autoplay, too, used to be a royal nuisance. The Artificial Intelligence guiding it — the algorithm — had perhaps an IQ in the low double-digit figures. Like, if I heard a random Indian electronic producer’s mid-tempo, ambient, easygoing song, it would invariably be followed by extreme, indecipherable metal from the coldest parts of Europe.
It slowly got better, providing users with better follow-ups. As did the YouTube autoplay, which now throws up loosely related (as opposed to flamboyantly unrelated) hits. In fact, YouTube even allows its users to turn the feature off, some five years after users begged for it. 
User experience
But it doesn’t matter anymore. No one bothers. Because the autoplay is a critical part of our lives today. Streaming videos online — through Netflix, YouTube, Amazon Prime, even Hotstar or ALTBalaji — is pretty much all about ease and effortlessness. The UX, the user experience. If I watch one single episode of one single show from start to finish, the internal algorithms of these platforms will throw a hundred related shows or films that I “might also like because [I] watched that one show that one time.” Their goal is to keep me watching, keep me horizontal and listless and utterly inept, for as long as possible. This increases numbers, you see. 
That little box
The same way, as one episode nears its conclusion and the end credits roll, a little box on the bottom right appears. Within 15 seconds or so, the next episode will start on its own, unless you cancel the command. It’s great for a Sunday afternoon, when the burdens of the week gone by have only just begun to ease off, and all you want to do is lie in bed and stuff your face with junk food. In that sense, it’s most definitely a blessing. 
But, the way I see it, there’s something more diabolical at play here. I recently found myself watching something online, on a platform which didn’t yet have an effective autoplay. And I was complaining about it. I was literally whining about the fact that I had to move my arm 10 inches forward, click a few things on the screen, and then move on to the next episode. Is this what I have become now? 
Quite apart from the laziness it encourages in the name of ‘comfort’, the autoplay also affects my rationing of time. Like how I’ll occasionally open a live video of a band on YouTube. Once it finishes, I’ll gladly move on to the next suggestion that’s offered to me. And then the next. And the next. Next thing I know, the sun is out and the crows and pigeons are at it again. Streaming of videos, by its very existence, allows users to waste time with something familiar running in the background. You’re not doing nothing, but you’re not doing anything particularly meaningful or worthwhile either. An additional feature that makes us do even less is… well, it’s confusing for me. I’m torn between how brilliant and ludicrous it is.

Time to laugh
","Young Jagan Krishnan had rockstar dreams only to realise that music was more than just strumming a guitar. But no, this is not a sob story. “I was pretty cool about it and quite sheepishly open. In fact, I have been laughing off all those supposedly difficult situations in life. That uncanny streak of humour in me made me try stand-up,” says Jagan. 
And so over the past three years, he has been making people laugh their lungs out through his easy-to-digest comedy shows. He does this along with his long-time friend Mervyn Rozaria, a typical carefree Chennai lad known for his spontaneous jokes.
After touring Puducherry and Dindigul, their show Oru Time Pakalam is set to be performed for the first time in Madurai, this weekend. So gear up for 90 minutes of laughter that’s going to be entirely in Tamil.“Our brand of comedy is simple, relatable and from everyday happenings. It’s not difficult to understand,” says Mervyn. “Since stand-up is concentrated only in Chennai, we thought of targeting audience in smaller towns. That way, exposing them to the art form and also tapping in on the market there.”
The show is a breezy comedy on Tamil pop culture, with humourous takes on cinema, music, politics, and current news and trends. “It was only a 15-minute script initially, which we developed after lot of refinement. We usually perform in open mics and gauge response and feedback. We make on-the-spot improvisations, add lines specific to the city we perform in, and make spontaneous jibes,” says Mervyn. 
The duo’s first show Academy awards became a hit and ever since, they started collaborating. “We share the stage equally but since both of us are from different backgrounds, our shows are diverse, thus offering variety. The format is not the usual trolling. We make sure our comedy is effortless and not offensive,” adds Jagan.
The show is jointly presented by Eight-O-Eight and Evam and will be on at JC Residency, Chinna Chokkikulam on November 24 at 7 pm. For tickets, visit bookmyshow.com or call 7373000034, 7200039444

The influencer: Why Alyque Padamsee is relevant in our digitally-led world
","Lintas. Home of the creative giant, Alyque Padamsee. Birthplace of innumerable iconic brands and campaigns. Even a rookie like me could feel the creative frisson that powered the agency when I joined it, though the founding father had moved on by then. It did not matter that I never got to meet him; you could not work in Lintas in the ’90s and not know every minutiae about the God of Advertising. The corridors resounded with folklore, the conference room mirrored his brilliance, and every single person walked around with an aura that comes from living in the presence of genius. If I sound a tad over the top, let me put this in perspective: I needed only two words to justify my decision to be a professional copywriter to my irate father. Alyque Padamsee.
Ad guru. Theatre don. Author. Activist. Philanthropist. And most of all, visionary. He constantly loomed one step ahead of the curve; not just in terms of ideas that broke the mould, but all the way down to their brilliant execution. In auditoriums and boardrooms alike, Alyque was ‘lit’. And that says it all — a term coined by today’s 20-somethings that best describes a man old enough to be their great grandfather. Yes, he was pretty darn ‘woke’ too, doing everything he could to erase religious divisiveness, pushing for women’s rights and a corruption-free governance. He is hailed today as ‘the brand-father of Indian advertising’ for transforming inanimate products and services into living brands. The legacy he leaves behind though, might be bigger than the super brands and mega markets he helped create. It can be found in the prescient communication dictums he introduced us to, each one still relevant in these digital times.




Decades before Instagram, Twitter and Facebook introduced us to the phenomenon called followers, Alyque had a loyal tribe of disciples. An influencer par excellence, his approval or lack of it, changed the destinies of people, brands and companies. His carefully-curated public profile drew media, clients, theatre fans and the general public to him. Alyque was the brand ambassador not just for Lintas, the agency he spearheaded, but for the entire advertising industry in the ’80s.
Alyque redefined brand communication. He turned a one-way product monologue into a conversation between the brand and its consumer. He used focus groups to listen to what the consumer had to say, and then created a product experience that engaged them and gave them a legitimate reason to interact. The Liril waterfall film was literally that: a Bollywood-fuelled fantasy of the harrowed Indian housewife, looking for a five-minute respite in her shower. It was iconic for many reasons, mostly because it opened up an interactive relationship between brands and their users. Today, this is the building block of digital marketing, which focusses on people, their problems and needs, and not the product.



Ad man Alyque Padamsee’s alternate world on the stage


If you want to know your brand, get to know its consumer. Lalitajee, the astute Surf lady who became the spokesperson for the ’80s Indian housewife, was based on Alyque’s mother. Which is what made her so real and credible. Cut to today, where instant consumer feedback and reviews literally drive digital marketing. A brand is only as successful as its data analytics.
Alyque knew what women wanted: they wanted to be heard; to be seen in all the roles they played. To fantasise about frolicking like heroines under waterfalls (Liril); for sex to be more than just a housewifely chore (Kamasutra); to be savvy householders who safeguarded the health and nutrition of their families (Dalda, Complan). But most of all, they wanted to be acknowledged as discerning decision makers. Alyque nudged the Indian female consumer out of the shadows, and gave her a strident, unapologetic voice.
Hundreds of sheepish Indian men finally found the nerve to quit sneakily using the fairness cream that belonged to the woman in the house. They went out and bought their own Fair & Handsome, after Alyque convinced Emami that was a market waiting to explode. He didn’t just give them a product they were yearning for, he gave them societal acceptance. The men’s personal care shelves in the supermarkets have been groaning under the weight, ever since.




We all love memes, those memorable captures that go viral and turn something or someone into an overnight phenomenon. Alyque’s compelling storytelling in his ad films created memes literally every time he raised his creative baton. The 80s and 90s resounded with Lalitajee’s temple tapping, (Bhai sahib, Sirf ki kharidari mein hi samajhdari hai.. , the endearing Cherry Charlie’s Chaplinesque tap dance, the Liril water nymph’s la la lala …… and so many other ‘snapshots’ that got locked into the memory banks of viewers and consumers, to be replayed over and over again, creating rock-solid brand recall.
Way before celebrity image consultants or social media managers became a thing, Alyque had been appointed Communication Adviser to then Prime Minister Rajeev Gandhi. He may well have been responsible for introducing the power of branded communication to Indian politics. A staunch supporter of the India Against Corruption movement which later morphed into AAP, he was the man behind their strategic ‘Sweep Them Away’ campaign.
We are all unlikely to forget the ice bucket challenge on Facebook. The world watched hundreds of people across the globe dunk themselves with ice water, to raise $115 million dollars towards research for ALS. Who would have imagined the power wielded by a simple bucket of water? Alyque did, years ago, in an Advertising Review presentation. The video part of his presentation happened to end on an ad film that culminated with a bucket of water being tossed. At that precise moment, the audience watched Alyque take a bucket of water right in the face, on stage. They watched in stunned silence as the showman took off his glasses, wiped them clean and proceeded to continue with his presentation. It was his seamless transition from the screen to the stage where he stood. Almost as seamless as his transition from theatrical genius to brilliant adman.

'Narcos: Mexico' - old wine in an old bottle
","A recent article in Vanity Fair spoke about how the era of Netflix’s first phase of serial programming is nearing its end. House Of Cards finished its run (with a whimper, I might add) recently, and the still-popular Orange Is The New Black will bow out next year. With Bloodline, Sense8, and Marco Polo already gone, and the streaming service dropping at least half-a-dozen great new shows and original films yearly (the Coen brothers’ new film, The Ballad of Buster Scruggs, released last week), Netflix programming is at a turning point.
Strung midway, between nostalgia and the future, is Narcos, which returned last week in a rebooted avatar called Narcos: Mexico. Few thought the show would have legs after the demise of its most famous character, Pablo Escobar, at the end of the second season, but the real reboot happened last year, when showrunner Eric Newman and his team of writers rounded off the story of Escobar’s biggest rival, the Cali Cartel, in style. The third season made up for the lack of a magnetic central character with solid storytelling and marvellous moments fraught with tension and excitement.
 

Narcos Mexico: Of men and monsters


Narcos: Mexico, really, is more of the same, even though the creators would like us to see it in a new light. For starters, the show once again employs the redundant voice-over technique with the sole purpose of reminding viewers that the drama is, indeed, based on real events. The title theme, even though superimposed with fresh visuals, also remains the same (no complaints there).


What’s truly fresh about Narcos: Mexico — but which never quite realises its potential — is the willingness to take the spotlight away from the villain of the piece. Narcos always kept its bad guys in the forefront. DEA agents Steve Murphy, in the first two seasons, and Javier Pena, in season three, were the ones whose point-of-view we saw the story unfold from, but they never quite went beyond their role of narrators. At best, they remained the foil to the exploits of Escobar and the Cali Cartel.
Narcos: Mexico, instead, plays out like a battle of wits between two men on either side of the law — Kiki Camarena (Michael Pena) and Felix Gallardo (Diego Luna). DEA agent Kiki Camarena finds himself posted in Guadalajara, where he discovers that the Mexican drug business is a well-oiled machine, and the administration hand-in-glove with marijuana traders. Around the same time, Felix Gallardo is rising through the narcos ranks, using his sharp business acumen to unite warring gangsters under a single cartel. These are two very interesting characters, performed well by the respective actors, but both tied down by the constraints of the plot.
At the end of the day — real as the events may be — Narcos: Mexico suffers from all the familiar tropes that make a crime drama. Unchecked ambitions, a powerless law-and-order machinery, distraught families, etc. The writers infuse life in this hackneyed template with some outstanding moments from time to time, and which should be enough to satiate fans of the show… for now.
The question isn’t if the Narcos universe remains as fascinating as it was before, but for how long.

Take my joke back home: Amit Tandon on weaving hilarious stories on stage ","Amit Tandon has been very busy in the past few months — a new show ‘Not Getting Wiser’, international tour to the US and Australia and his shifting to Mumbai. “That is enough for one year,” laughs Amit. In fact, the US trip was a pleasant surprise; he had planned to do only 15 shows, but ended up doing 50! 
Amit was married with two kids when he entered the comedy circuit. It seemed a natural progression to be the ‘married guy’ in his act and make wisecracks about his marriage. Considering his writings have always revealed different layers of his life, his ‘Not Getting Wiser ...’ goes a step ahead to talk about relationships in general, not just with his wife. “There are other people and it gets a lot closer to my life in terms of my childhood and transforming into a parent,” he shares, adding, that the stories make the audience nostalgic. “A lot of these stories touch them as they have been a child or parent or both. We have been brought up with the same set of threats like ‘Papa agaye.’ It is satisfying to see how they look into each other’s eyes and relate to it.” 
WhatsApp has not just changed the way we chat and share but the way we laugh too. With funny jokes and videos shared on social media, it is a challenge for comedians to create their own niche. Amit’s USP has been his writings which enhance the ‘recall’ factor . “We laugh at the jokes on WhatsApp but forget them the next morning. What I try to bring on board is different. You have to take my joke back home and even recollect it after a week or month. I want to keep the flavour of my jokes identifiable.” 
 His acts are also without the sexual innuendos and cuss words. “I come from a middle class family and with two kids at home, I’m used to controlling my language at home. A lot of comics who use cuss words are part of the younger generation and it is acceptable with this generation. My clean humour became a selling point and a good marketing strategy as well.”
His company The Grand Masters of Comedy is an attempt to bring humour into the corporate world. Having worked in a corporate company, he admits the stress levels are high. “It is not just through comedy shows but we want to bring comedy into their everyday lives.” 
He recalls the jokes that would accompany his emails when he was running a recruitment firm. “The client started noticing it and said it was good to see a joke at the end of the mail. The jokes brought a smile and refreshed them. Also, when an employee is getting married, a group of us would go to his cabin and laugh for two minutes. We would call it ‘Hasya Sabha’ and the whole atmosphere would lighten up.”

(‘Not Getting Wiser’ with Amit Tandon is on at Sri Satya Sai Nigamagamam, Srinagar Colony on November 30, 8 pm onwards. Tickets:www.bookmyshow.com)

Theatre group Sanchaya turns 30
","Among the longstanding theatre groups of Bangalore, Sanchaya stands for a set of values that are consistently being practised by its members, ever since it was founded three decades ago. For many in the theatre fraternity Sanchaya is a surprise -- because the troupe is not run by a single person but a group committed to meaningful theatre.
Sanchaya took birth in 1988 under the guidance of G.S. Rama Rao, a teacher at MES High School, Jayanagar. “It all began when we, as high school students, wanted to stage a play as a tribute to theatre personality S.K. Madhava Rao. After this performance, it became a regular practice to perform plays and soon it took shape of a theatre group,” recounts Keerthi Bhanu, who has been with the group since its inception.
Later it was moulded by the likes of C.G. Krishnamurthy, Suresh Anagalli, S. Surendranath, Joseph, Shashidhar Barighat, Iqbal Ahmed and others in different capacities. “It was C.G.K. who motivated us to ‘think big’ in 1992. He urged us to have faith in theatre. We were able to produce Anke Tappida Shankarlal with a budget of one lakh, a big amount in those days, only because of his encouragement and forethought,” recalls Bhanu.




Recognising a dearth of lighting technicians in Kannada theatre, Sanchaya held a workshop in association with National School of Drama about a decade ago.
“Five lighting technicians who are currently working for various theatre groups, are a result of that workshop,” says Bhanu.
A group of about 80 members practising different professions, Sanchaya has staged 47 plays so far, with every play being staged for at least 25 times. Some of their prominent plays are Pratibimbagalu, Tadroopi, Sahyadri Kaanda and Tempest. When other theatre troupes plan to cut down on the number people required to stage a production, Sanchaya has always made sure that more than 15 members are involved in presenting a play.




“It has been our policy to become larger, including more number of people each time,” adds Bhanu the spokesperson of the group that is thrilled to celebrate the troupe’s 30th anniversary.
At the inauguration ceremony of ‘Sambhrama-30’ on November 30, C. Basavalingaiah, Director, NSD will be the chief guest and television actor Srinivas Prabhu, senior theatre person K.V. Nagarajamurthy and film director Shylaja Nag will grace the function. Theatre director Abbooru Jayateertha, theatre persons Sundar Raja Rao and Uncle Shyam, Ananda Rao, N.E.S.F., Karnataka and K. Nagendra, retired Principal, MES School will be honoured as part of the celebration. The inauguration function will be held at H.N. Kalakshetra, Jayanagar.
Following the inauguration, two plays will be staged at Rangashankara on December 1 and 2. Dario Fo’s Kododilla Bidodilla, translated and directed by Krishna Hebbale, will be staged on December 1. William Shakespere’s Tempest will be performed on December 2. It is translated by Srikanth B.R. and directed by Joseph John.
The plays will be staged at 3.30 p.m. and 7.30 p.m on both the days.

Ambareesh was like none other ","The ageing and elderly Anand Kumar returned to his home in Mysore with his siblings after performing an elaborate ceremony to mark the first year of the demise of their younger brother, a doctor. Just when they were settling, he saw his siblings bundle into a car after hushed confabulations and leave in a hurry. It was only when he turned on the TV that he learnt about the demise of his brother Ambareesh. The family was worried about how he would take it since Anand Kumar had undergone multiple heart surgeries and injured his leg recently. His son’s friends rushed home and offered to take him to Bengaluru the next day. 
“They knew his fans would swarm the place. I went directly to Kanteerava Stadium and returned the next day for the cremation,” said the doting elder brother, his laboured voice conveying his loss. “My last conversation was when I invited him for a function to honour my son Chandan Kumar the flautist. He agreed, but didn’t turn up. I later learnt he had come to Mandya but returned due to ill health. One of my sons who was very close to him fainted and another rushed from the U.S. I sat with SM Krishna when the last rites were being performed and we reminisced fondly about their bond.”




I had met Ambareesh with Rajendra Singh Babu at Hotel Woodlands in Bengaluru where he had a permanent ‘cottage’. My first interaction with him came when I was visiting my friend cinematographer Gowrishanker. Gowri got a call from Ambi (as Gowri addressed Ambareesh),summoning him pronto because the expensive camera the actor had recently bought wasn’t working. Gowri asked me to accompany him since I’d done a course in photography. It was near noon and Ambi was in the kind of silken robe rich people in films wear when they retire for the night. We found that the camera was fine but the batteries had died. “Shows how much I know about cameras,” smiled Ambi. After some small talk, he insisted Gowri share the freshly prepared Biriyani while offering to get me idlis from a nearby eatery.
I wouldn’t claim to know him very well though we kept bumping into each other. There would be a flurry when he called the late R.T. Narayan, Ramya’s foster father, to announce he was visiting. A bottle of his favourite Scotch would be fished out and a Man Friday would mix it with the right amount of water before his arrival. There would be discussions about cinema and mostly the ever tumultuous political scene. He was as much a reluctant politician as he was an actor. He had to be dragged by his friends to Premier Studios where the screen test for ‘Nagara Havu’ was being held. Even his mentor Puttanna Kanagal tolerated his late coming, insisting he be in most of his films after ‘Nagara Havu’. “It was not intentional. I would be hosting friends from Madras. On the way to the studio I would think of excuses and Puttanna would sulk. He would say he was there to tell tales not listen to cock and bull stories.”




Everyone has an Ambareesh anecdote. His producer friend Hitesh Jhabak called from Chennai to say he was moved to tears watching the funeral. “I had come to Bangalore to watch a India-Pakistan cricket match with common friends but decided to stay back in Bowring Institute and watch it on TV since I would have to climb stairs at the stadium. My friends had left when Ambareesh who had heard about this swept in. He insisted I accompany him, bypassed security and took me to the ground floor of the pavilion. He got me a comfortable seat and then left. It was so touching because I didn’t know him as well as my friends. That’s Ambareesh and the reason people love him,” he said.
If you’re a prude you’d find Ambareesh's boisterous nature and language generously sprinkled with profanity and rude. Some people tolerated more than appreciated this side of his nature temporarily, till he effortlessly won them over with his large-heartedness and hospitality. I was once at the airport to receive my sister-in-law from Malaysia. Ambareesh, who had travelled by the same flight, obviously disembarked first and passed by after wishing me. After a few minutes, he returned and asked why I was there and left only after enquiring if I needed any help with Customs. These tiny gestures would disarm anyone. 
Sumalatha proved to be the magical calming factor in his life. In what is considered his most candid interview in print I asked if he had warned her that he was not marriage material. “I did. I never planned to marry. When I built a house, I wasted a dance floor, swimming pool and things I cannot mention. I wanted a Bohemian lifestyle. Now I feel if I hadn’t married her, my life would have remained incomplete,” he said, with a twinkle in his eyes. His friends like Rajni and Chiranjeevi advised him to give up smoking but he didn’t. “Believe me, my liver is healthier than Baba Ramdev’s, but I neglected my lungs. I could not walk one day,” said Ambi, with a tinge of regret.




Sumalatha laughed when I asked if she had consulted colleagues about Ambi who had the reputation of a Lothario. “There was no need. Suhasini asked me to watch out. People were full of stories. My make-up man advised me to not even sit close to him. Personally, I liked him from day one. I relied on the opinion of spot boys and their tales of his generosity. The set came alive after he entered. He drew me out and made me laugh. I knew I could not change him. Some things did bother me. He would be surrounded by fifty friends in the evening. It was the reason for quarrels, but later I took it in my stride because he was happiest when he was with his friends.” When Sumalatha called him, ‘Goddess’ flashed on Ambi’s mobile.




It’s strange why Ambareesh neglected his health since he had every reason to live long, not only for his doting wife and son, but the amount of love he received and gave to everyone he came in contact with. He confessed to sheer negligence. It was probably too late before he realised the extent of damage his indulgences had inflicted. People will miss him for different reasons but the Kannada film industry has lost its most colourful personality. He would have opened a bottle of the best Scotch to celebrate his reunion with Raj, Vishnu and Shankar Nag though. The good times continue for Ambi wherever he is. For once his mentor Puttanna Kanagal will berate him for coming early!

'Crazy Rich Asians' fails to click with Chinese audiences ","
Chinese audiences do not seem too concerned about the U.S. box office hit “Crazy Rich Asians,” despite its all-Asian cast and theme of rising Asian prosperity.
Industry data show that the film made just $1.2 million over the three days of its initial release, far behind local productions in the world’s second-largest movie market. That compared with the $24.2 grossed by the Chinese crime drama “A Cool Fish,” according to figures from the consultancy Artisan Gateway cited by Variety, an industry journal. 
According to Chinese film industry veteran Wei Junzi, the romantic comedy’s focus on Southeast Asian culture did not resonate with mainland Chinese, despite the cast’s ethnic makeup. “It’s a good genre movie,” Wei said. “It’s also an interesting comparison with the current China-U.S. relationship. You think you know about China, but in reality you don’t.” 
The film’s poor performance in China contrasts sharply with its near-rapturous reception in the Chinese diaspora, especially in the U.S. where it was hailed as the first all-Asian box office smash. 
Critic Shi Hang commented that since Chinese audiences were used to all-Asian productions, the casting didn’t hold much novelty. “What the public was excited about abroad was all-Asian-faces, but, sorry, we watch all-Asian-faces every day so it is less valuable here,” Shi said. The film’s over-the-top displays of wealth and entitlement may also have been a turn-off for some viewers in a country where the widening gap between rich and poor rankles many. “It is understandable in a comedy atmosphere, but it gets harder for me to get into the story,” he said. 
The Warner Bros.’ breakout romantic comedy earned $173 million in the U.S. and was a box office hit in Singapore, where it is set. Like most comedies, John M. Chu’s film hasn’t been as much of a sensation elsewhere. It took months to secure a China release date, a delay some attributed to its portrayal of extremely wealthy Chinese Singaporeans at a time when China’s ruling Communist Party is cracking down on corruption and displays of crass consumerism. That time lag may also have enabled many Chinese viewers to access pirated versions online or through streaming services. 
The film’s performance in China is potentially worrisome for Warner Bros. Meanwhile, its planned sequel, “China Rich Girlfriend,” is expected to better capitalize in China. 
Another upcoming film targeting Chinese audiences is a live-action version of Disney’s 1998 animated classic “Mulan,” which told the story of a plucky Chinese girl who took her father’s place in battling invaders from the north. That film also boasts an almost entirely Chinese cast, led by popular actress Liu Yifei in the title role. 
“Will this be just another movie about Chinese culture, with you Americans’ own interpretation?” Wei demanded.

Mentalist Nipin Niravath’s show ‘Cryptic’ aims to bust myths surrounding occult practices ","
Nipin Niravath started off as a street magician. But, having always been fascinated by investigative stories and movies, he wanted to delve deeper into the workings of the mind and started coming up with “mentalism experiments.” Ever since his first mentalism show in 2008 proved a hit, the 35-year-old has endeavoured to focus his energy on perfecting this “art of reading minds.”
“I’m neither a doctor nor a black magician and I would prefer to be called a psychological entertainer,” says Nipin over phone from Kochi. His upcoming show, ‘Cryptic: Impossible to Imagine’, is aimed at debunking myths about such arcane fields and exposing certain sham practices in the society. 
“There are a lot of fake theories and practices based on astral projection, ouija board, exorcism etc. Through my performance, I attempt to connect them to the real psychological phenomena behind them for a rational understanding,” says the mentalist.
Nipin explains that Cryptic, an audience-immersive show, is presented in an “investigative” format through the story of a serial killer based on a true incident that took place in Sweden in the previous century. “The killer murders nine people but is nabbed by the police while he is plotting his tenth murder. He is put behind the bars where he kills himself. This is, in fact, a popular story among mind-readers. I open the case diary 145 years later...,” he says, choosing to keep the details cryptic.




Nipin points out that Cryptic will be an out-and-out mentalism spectacle and not a magic show. “One key difference is that magic uses a lot of stage props where as in mentalism, the prop is the mind of the audience. It works by manipulation of their thoughts. One cannot keep a script as the entire show depends on the situation and the audience,” he says, describing the performance art as a regaling combination of “psychology, showmanship, the art of influencing and a bit of magic for the wow factor.”
More than verbal communication, what a mentalist taps into is the non-verbal signals during a performance using well-practised mind-reading techniques. “Body language and micro-expressions are more revelatory to a mind-reader than the subject’s words. No matter how much we try to hide, our body language gives it away,” he says.
Over to Nipin and his bag of tricks.
‘Cryptic: Impossible to Imagine’ will be held at Vyloppilli Samskrithi Bhavan on December 9 at 6.30 pm. Contact: 9020333322

From college to University
","A definite step towards the University social life in Bangalore was taken on March 3, 1930 when University Union was inaugurated by Dr. E P Metcalfe. The University Council entrusted the management of the Union in its initial stages to a provisional Working Committee, and after the first annual elections held on August 13, 1930 Prof. C. R. Narayana Rao was nominated the first President of the Union. The main aim of the Union was to create a necessary atmosphere for fostering in the minds of the rising generation, and the future citizens of our state, the ideals of true and enlightened citizenship. The membership of the union was compulsory for both the teaching staff and the students of the Central and Engineering Colleges and optional for Intermediate College and Medical School. 
The Union provided a well-equipped reading room and amenities to play indoor games like chess, draughts, carom, ping pong and these were very popular among the members. Equally well attended were the literary, drama and musical events. An outstanding event in the history of the Union was the debate held in October 1933 in which the members of the British Universities’ Debating Team participated and appreciated the Union activities. Similarly, a debating team visited from the United Provinces in January 1935. 
University Union had its own independent building to carry out its activities. Even today it exists in its original form to the left, at the beginning of Palace Road which starts from Kempe Gowda Road. Indian Council for Historical Research is located on the first floor of this heritage structure.
It is very interesting to note that Central College had started a hostel for its students more than a hundred years ago, perhaps one of the earliest Government hostels to come up in the city.
After the Plague outbreak in Bangalore in the year 1898, Dr. John Cook, the then Principal desired that all the students who came from the rural areas should live in a healthy locality close to the college, instead of staying in infected parts of the city either in small rented rooms or in friends or relatives houses. He urged the Government to acquire the land attached to the then Kitchetty Choultry and to build two residential buildings with necessary kitchens and out-houses large enough to accommodate ninety-six boarders. The Government sanctioned the proposal and immediately instructed the Department of Public Works to complete the building as early as possible. 
They started the work in the beginning of the 1900 and completed both the buildings by the end of the same year, and handed over the same to the Principal, so that he could allow the students to occupy the new hostel on their return to College after the Christmas holidays. 
Meanwhile, the Principal had prepared the list of the students who were in need of such assistance and the hostel started functioning from February 1, 1901. A small library and reading room and little recreation facilities were also provided. A small dispensary under the care of an assistant surgeon was attached to the hostel for the benefit of the boarders. 
In the beginning, a full time superintendent was appointed. 
Subsequently, Government wanted the Hostels in the state to be self supporting institutions, and consequently, the College Hostel was converted into a grant-in-aid institution in 1908. Since then, the Principal was assisted by a resident Warden who used to be one of the faculty members of the college. Many stalwarts like C.R. Narayana Rao of Zoology, Dr. M.A. Sampat Kumaran of Botony, Prof. B.S. Madhava Rao of Mathematics Departments have served as the resident wardens of the Students Hostel. 
Even after 118 years, the hostel buildings, the identical twin heritage beauties of the city, can be seen in their original form to the left of Palace Road, a building after ICHR. 
Just like in academics, students excelled in literary, cultural and sports too. For over a decade from 1888. The Central College was the despair of all opposing teams, local and moffusil, in both cricket and tennis. Mr. J.G. Tait, a great sports man himself, was coaching the cricket team. This was a great inspiration to the college team to maintain superiority over all other teams in the annual Madras Cricket Tourneys and carry off finally the Brandt Hutchins Trophy by winning it successively for three years in 1893, 1894 and 1895. For several decades, Intermediate College field was the venue for all important cricket matches in the city.
In tennis too, for the first one decade the College remained unbeaten, winning the Girdlestone Trophy in Bangalore and the Travancore Tennis Trophy at Madras. The reputation of the College in hockey and football became popular after 1915 and brought laurels to the College. Even in gymnastics and athletics, the fame of the College had spread far and wide..
In 1920 itself a little attempt was made to begin Scouting. However, in 1923, ‘The University Rovers Corps’ was brought into being and the scouting formally entered the precincts of the Central College. Soon, the Corps were called for service by the Bangalore Session of the Indian National Congress in January 1924. Training in Musketry and first aid formed the principal occupations of the Corps for a number of years. 
Thus, in the first sixty years of its existence and during the subsequent decades, Central College has retained its distinct identity. 
Now, it belongs to the newly formed Bangalore Central University (BCU).

Cultural conversations ","This dance form translates the heart, the soul, the body and its core muscle strength of the artist into kinetic movements of emotions and expressions, making it one of the most intense and dynamic Indian dance forms. 
SPIC MACAY Karnataka Chapter sponsored the Mayurbhanj Chhau from Odisha. It is a folk Martial Arts dance, performed by Mayur Arts Centre, Bhuvaneswar at Satish Dhawan Auditorium, Indian Institute of Science.




SPIC MACAY, a non-profit, non-political, voluntary movement formed in 1977 by Dr. Kiran Seth, a professor at IIT- Delhi, strives to bring more awareness about traditional Indian values amongst students through increased exposure to the rich cultural heritage of India and to make education more holistic. With that objective, SPIC MACAY organized more than 7500 programmes in over 1500 schools and colleges in over 817 towns in India and abroad impacting more than two million students. SPIC MACAY Karnataka Chapter has been instrumental in organising performances of several stalwarts. Volunteers play a major role in this important work. 
 The team from the Mayur Art Centre, Pradip Kumar Mishra, Rama Naik, Dibar Naik (Senior), Birabal Mohanta, Aruna Behera, Rabindra Bindhani, Jyotisankar Mohapatra, Dibar Naik (Junior), Bajuram Tudu, Budheswar Munda performed three items, titled ‘The War Dance’, ‘Shiva Tandav’ and ‘Chakravyuh.’ 
The supporting musicians were - Surendra Soren on Dhol, Ashok Baitha on Mohauri (Shehnai like wind instrument), Baidyanath Ghunian on Chad Chadi and Yuvraj Dhada on Dhumsa).




Pradip Kumar Mishra, explained that “Chhau dance is an Indian tribal martial dance which is popular in Seraikella (Bihar), Purulia (West Bengal) and Mayurbhanj (Orissa). Based on the place of their origin and development, the three dance styles are called Seraikella Chhau, Mayurbhanj Chhau and Purulia Chhau. The two styles of Saraikela and Purulia use masks, but Mayurbhanj doesn’t. So, it showcases a distinctive appeal with wide range of movements and dynamic choreography. Technically it is richer than the other two styles. It is also called paika nrutya. The word paika is derived from the Sanskrit word padatika meaning the infantry - hence the name of the dance is paika (battle) nrutya (dance). The primary aim of this dance form is to develop physical strength, excitement and courage in the dancing warriors - the presiding deity of Mayurbhanj Chhau is Lord Bhairab ( Bhairav ).”
Talking about the beginning of his Centre, Pradip Mishra said: “The Mayur Art Centre was founded in 1980 by Late Devendra Naik Pattnaik who was Secretary, Odisha Sangeet Natak Akademi, who authored the books like ‘Abhinaya Darpan’, ‘Bharatiya Kala’. The Centre is devoted to the training, preservation, performance and research of Mayurbhanj Chhau. 
The Centre receives support from Govt of India which offers stipend to the students, but it is not sufficient. He appealed to all the philanthropists and art promoters to support their cause. 
The three dance themes presented :
 ‘The War Dance’ as the very title conveys, opened with loud drum beats and thumping steps of the dancers in their typical war attire holding shields and swords. The war dance was composed in 1912 by Late Ram Chandra Bhanj, the then ruler of Mayurbhanj on the arrival of the King George V, the ruler of England. This is a form of rehearsals of battle through dance movements. Their daredevilry left the audience gasping and that set the mood for the items to follow next. 
Shiv Tandav - In Hindu theology Shiva is the god of dancing. Through dance he creates, preserves and destroys, which is the cyclic process of the world. In dance these three dominant moods are delineated by various yogic postures and vigorous movements. The dancer who performed as Shiva had a certain aura around him, that comes with serious dedication and concentration. His gestures, spiral movements and foot work brought the stage alive. 
The dance depicted an episode from the Mahabharatha, the great epic based on the war between the Kauravas and Pandavas. Chakravyuha is the name for a complicated war strategy by which the enemy forms a circle. It is a challenge to the opponent to penetrate the circle. But only few of the members from either group had the knowledge and the expertise. 
This ‘Chakravyuha’ took the audience to a pinnacle of excitement and involvement. The final scene of Abhimanyu getting killed was so overwhelmingly natural, it left many teary eyed. 
Prof. Ananth Ramaswamy, who coordinates on behalf of IISc with SpicMacay in organizing these Events was exuberant and veracious in his observation. He said: 
In this rapidly changing world, the internet and the glamour world have created a disconnect among the youth with the traditional art forms which have been the inner strength and fabric of India. It is this chasm that is being bridged by the yeoman service being rendered by SPICMACY by reaching out to the youth of this nation.” 
Om Puri Gosain Research Scholar at ICER, IISc ‘The best thing is that we young people get the opportunity to volunteer the programs. The war dance depicted, how war rehearsals were being conducted. The Chakravyuh dance seemed a real one. The live musical instruments were fantastic. I was glad that they didn't use any recordings. The music and dance co-ordination was goose bumping. Depiction of ""Veer rasa"" could be clearly seen. Such programmes should be conducted more often”.

Revenge of the birds ","The wait is over. The most expensive Indian film has hit the theatres. I was reminded of 2007 when I was invited to watch the premiere of ‘No.73, Shanti Nivasa’, a remake of ‘Bawarchi’ directed by Sudeep. The mall where the show was held was teeming with people late in the night, it was surprising. The halls showing films were barely filled, but the box-office was besieged. Fans had thronged the aisles clamouring for tickets to watch ‘Sivaji’ due to hit the screens the next day. That sort of pre-release craze for Rajni’s films has died down post ‘Kabali’, and the fact that it barely delivered what the trailer promised. Even Shankar wielding the megaphone and considering the fact that that his previous collaborations with the superstar set the box-office ablaze failed to fan pre-release fanaticism for ‘2.0’. The advance bookings were just about average. Tickets were easily available for any show on the first day in Bengaluru in most multiplexes. Fans will unleash a Twitter backlash but these are plain facts. The reviews and collection figures from across the country are mixed. There was a freefall in the collections on the second day but things seem to have improved, marginally. The producers, Lyca Productions are claiming that the film is a mega blockbuster and nobody but Subashkaran will be privy to the truth because they’ve distributed the film themselves in most places.
I watched the morning show on Monday, the fifth day following the film’s release at a multiplex and there were eight others beside me. “Don’t go by that,” says Venkatesh Reddy, who owns and controls theatres in the city. “The 2D version is a washout but collections have been encouraging wherever the 3D version is playing. If the producers had invested in helping single screens convert into 3D format instead of asking them to bear the cost the film would have done much better. I think the time taken and the cost just tired them out and made them want to get it over with,” says the veteran distributor also blaming the Government for the number of single screens being razed down. “The producers of ‘My Dear Kuttichathan’ had the foresight and helped theatre owners convert in a phased manner resulting in the film’s success,” says Venkatesh.
A Rajnikanth film does not need or depend on technical wizardry, never has but for Shankar who prescribes puerile placebos for serious social ills spectacular cinematography and opulent sets are a shield for his shallow storytelling abilities. His protagonists have always taken the law into their hands right from ‘Gentleman’ playing vigilante. Of course, the convenient excuse is that the so called protectors are also the perpetrators. Shankar dazzles you with form rather than making you reflect or ponder. He’s good at pointing out problems but the solutions doled out are purely cinematic and violent. The so-called comedy in his films is embarrassing and his handling of romantic sequences leaves you cold. Even Kamal who can make the most insipid of scenes look convincing looked all at sea in the sequences with Urmila and Manisha in ‘Indian’.
Cinema offers solutions that we wish were practical. Capitation fees have skyrocketed since Shankar made his directorial debut in ‘Gentleman’ which dealt with it. Little or nothing has changed. Technology is a necessary evil and in a world where human life has little value how many will give up the mobile phone to save hapless birds? ‘2.0’ is strangely about a robot designed to fight a force that has been wronged and surprisingly only in Tamil Nadu. Mobile phones are sucked into space and a huge container loaded with replenishments is destroyed only after it crosses into Tamil Nadu. Anyway a flashback shows Akshay Kumar -- styled to look like ornithologist Salim Ali -- distressed that the increase in bandwidth has birds disoriented and falling from the skies. As in most Shankar films we have him complaining to apathetic politicians and police officers. He commits suicide, hanging from a cell phone tower and returning in the form of a giant bird to take revenge. Now this is what a hero in a Shankar film would normally do so why do we have the scientist Vaseegaran reviving the robot Chitti to fight him? It’s a moral dilemma that Shankar does not deal with convincingly. The sequences are unnecessarily lengthy and pointless making most of the proceedings tiresome. The scientist sitting in a van being tossed around is embarrassing. Shankar is clueless about where the plot is heading and in desperation introduces various versions of Rajni in different styles and sizes. Rajni is even made to perform a takeoff on a scene from ‘Anniyan’ which evoked applause. In the end Rajni explains that Pakshi Raja the character played by Akshay was a good guy whose modus operandi was all wrong. Isn’t that what all our heroes do on-screen whether it’s stalking the heroine or mercilessly killing the baddies?
Rajni’s fans are already claiming dizzying collection figures worldwide. I hope the producer Subashkaran agrees. Fans also wanted their Thalaiver’s film to beat the box-office collections of ‘Bahubali’ but then the superbly made fantasy had a strong story and a riveting narrative beside the well executed visuals. 
Form can never compensate for lack of content and ‘2.0’ has just Rajni which is no longer enough.

Not as fiery as its predecessor ","I recently received a WhatsApp forward that said people in the US are either detectives or criminals. I sighed and deleted the message immediately, but when I watched the second season of The Sinner I felt that the joke was somewhat right.
The uncouth statistics may be absolutely ridiculous; however, in The Sinner’s universe, the characters are either involved in committing crimes, or investigating them. I greatly enjoyed the first season, and, I even wrote about it in this column a few months ago. The new season is not related to the Cora Tannetti case from season one, and, it features Detective Harry Ambrose (Bill Pullman) alone from the previous installment.




In season one, Cora (Jessica Biel) stabbed a guy on the beach, and, she was made to shuffle through her memory banks by Ambrose to find out why she did it. The latest season, too, opens in a similar manner – a 13-year-old boy named Julian Walker (Elisha Henig) kills Adam (Adam David Thompson) and Bess (Ellen Adair), his caretakers, by poisoning their tea.
The Sinner is probably the only show that’s making the whydunnit genre popular in the West currently. Now, for a moment, think about this – how could a jolly family trip to the Niagara Falls, as that’s where we’re told they’re headed towards, turn gory? In fact, Julian decorates the dead bodies by placing little rocks on his victims’ eyes. If you think that Julian is settling some kind of a score by doing this, you’re wrong. His motives are entirely different, and it’s quite impossible to guess that in the first episode. 
Also, Julian’s age makes it easy for the viewers to side with him (than with Cora), and, that predominant factor seeps into the storyline naturally. Detective Heather Novack (Natalie Paul), who’s neck-deep in her own solitariness, isn’t sure of her prowess, so, she requests Ambrose to help her out. He doesn’t mind going back to his hometown, Keller (where the murders happened), to work on the case, but, his face shows several forms of uneasiness that tells you he’s worried about something.




These tiny threads that appear in the beginning become a part of the sub-stories in the later episodes. Though, they’re all as good as the initial punch, they don’t stand a chance with the awesomeness of the first season. Since the flow of the narration was already established there, we know everything about the investigative methods employed by Ambrose. When everybody shuts their door, Ambrose is the only person to keep it open, and, offer a helping hand to the accused to understand them better.
And just like how it unfolds in season one, season two is also stacked with red-herrings and diversions. The point that needs to be noted here is the role that parents play in both the seasons. While the debate with regard to the kind of parenting that’s best suited for children is getting hotter day after day, The Sinner shows how kids are misled by their own parents. Cora had strict and religious parents, and, Julian’s mother, Vera Walker (Carrie Coon), lies to him about many things to protect him. But, he falls into a deeper mess because of the baseless lies he’s been fed throughout his childhood. The show subtly points fingers at the parents for the crimes committed by the children. And the writers need to be lauded for bringing this aspect into The Sinner.
Coon, who plays an unreliable character, is my favorite from this season as she perfectly controls her emotions during her conversations with Bill Pullman’s Ambrose. Of course, Pullman does a fine job, too, but Coon certainly walks away with the most fascinating performance. And, as a child who doesn’t know whom to trust, Henig displays vulnerability and confidence, at different points, with ease.




If the second season of The Sinner manages to hold your attention, it’s mainly because of the ingeniousness of the cast members.

Bridging the past and present
","
Watching a concert by TV Shankaranarayanan at RLV College, Tripunithura, set me thinking about the present scenario in Kathakali. Classical theatre has undergone a major paradigm shift in the recent past. If ‘major set’ Kathakali, usually comprising senior artistes and musicians, was an attraction for connoisseurs in the past, youngsters seem to be crowdpullers today.
 Kathakali artistes in their late fifties and sixties and above feel that nowadays many people want to watch only the youngsters on stage. Sixty was once considered young in Kathakali. Now they find themselves too old to be called young and too young to be considered senior. This is the dilemma faced by many artistes in all departments of Kathakali, whether it be it in acting, music, percussion or costuming (chutti). 
Kathakali artistes, in general, lead an insecure life, because they have left the comforts of worldly life to pursue their passion, which comes with its share of insecurities and setbacks. Not always financially rewarding, Kathakali is a passion for the artistes and what drives them on is the pleasure they derive from the art form. An artiste, even when he/she has a family and financial responsibilities, has to deliver what is expected of him, socially and emotionally, on the stage and also remain on top of his art. Rewards, usually, come in the form of awards much later in life. 
The current crop of ageing artistes have grown up watching their seniors getting all the adulation. Now when they have reached that stage and age, they find that the attention has shifted to the younger lot. This is the fate of people in that age group irrespective of their field of work. 
Coming back to Kathakali, it’s a positive sign that a new set of talented young artistes are coming up. On one hand, organisers opt for them because they are ‘minimum guarantee’ artistes and are cost effective, for there isn’t a lot of money to be spent on a Kathakali performance. It is again interest in the art form that motivates organisers to conduct and sponsor Kathakali festivals and plays. 
When talented youngsters are available at reasonable rates, organisers can’t be blamed for preferring them to expensive artistes. They also might find it easier to deal with the youngsters who may not indulge in artistic tantrums and are eager to impress connoisseurs. 




But, on the other hand, are we not sacrificing experience and masterly performances at the altar of finance and youth? Are we not getting carried away by a populistic approach at the cost of the art? Do we just need to celebrate the 70th and 80th birthdays of the veterans and forget them till their next milestone? Don’t we need them on stage to guide the younger generation and pass on their experienced wisdom that may otherwise be lost to the art form? In the prime of youth, at least some young artistes might want to innovate or deviate from the pattern or rebel against convention. In the absence of the guiding lights of an art form, who will show these youngsters the right path or guide them in the right direction? Wouldn’t they be left to fumble and fall if the veterans are pushed into oblivion? 
As an aswadaka of the old generation and an artiste of the new generation, I sometimes get confused about the right and wrong of the present scenario. Although I am a beneficiary of all the changes that is happening in Kathakali, I sometimes miss the old world charm and joy of watching a Kathakali performance. Though I am a performer and an organiser, I consider myself primarily an aswadaka before anything else. And that comes into play when I watch a performance and that is what set me thinking while listening to the masterly concert. 
Even when there is so much appreciation about the performances of a few artistes, that alone doesn’t make Kathakali what it is. We are discarding a lot of other aspects in Kathakali, which deserves a re-examination before its too late. I remember a performance by Keezhpadam Kumaran Nair as Kuchela when he was in his late eighties. Kumaran Nair, always known for his innovative approach, didn’t disappoint the crowd even then.




 The monologue, ‘Danavari mukundane’ was enacted without using even one mudra. This simply took the art to a different level. That, I feel, is the standard every artist should aspire to reach. 
Another performance that resonates in my memory is that of Lavanasuravadham. This was the second story of a full-night performance. Half the audience had left. Gradually, I got involved in the performance and got so engrossed in it that I remember each and every scene in the play even now. Music was by Sadanam Para Narayanan Namboodiri and Sadanam Sivadas. I was awestruck by the magic happening on stage. Listening to Narayanan Namboodiri for the first time, I realised that this was the Kathakali music I had grown up with. Sivadas was working on the cymbals as it ought to be used, which rarely happens these days. Some musicians get so engrossed in singing that they forget to use the instruments properly. The whole performance stood out as an integrated whole. That, I believe, is the essence of Kathakali; team work where every weft and warp weaves together a beautiful piece of artistry. 
At a time when innovation and change is the trademark, discipline, framework and time management also need to be given due importance. Isn’t it the skill of the artiste to perform within the time limit without compromising on content and nuances of the art? When rasikas seek out only the popular, isn’t it important to realise that it’s only a part of the whole? 
Technology and social media have brought in a new face to the art. Programmes are shared live on Facebook and they reach aswadakas in different parts of the world in real time. A performance is not judged by the immediate audience but people afar. Opinions are shared instantly. That is an advantage. However, the flip side of it is that prejudices also show up with equal vehemence. Nevertheless, a fair exchange of ideas is helpful in grooming upcoming artistes. Visibility also increases, which is important for a performer.
Rather than limiting themselves to the virtual world, Facebook and Whatsapp groups are now promoting the art. A Facebook group devoted to Kathakali conducted two full-night programmes in Kerala on a grand scale and Whatsapp groups are also conducting annual programmes by including amateur artistes as well. This is the bright side of technological development for Kathakali. 
However, it is imperative to start seeing Kathakali as a whole and not as an act of one artiste or musician. It is an integrated whole and that is the magic we want to see on stage. That’s what makes Kathakali stand out, because it is different each day. 
The chemistry among the artistes and between them and the audience decide the day. It’s this unpredictability that takes rasikas to far off places just to watch a show. So let’s respect the old and nurture the young. 
The writer is an academic and Kathakali artiste

The second season of ‘The Marvelous Mrs Maisel’ is a winner
","When Miriam “Midge” Maisel glided into our lives last year, we were smitten.
In The Marvelous Mrs Maisel, creator Amy Sherman-Palladino gave us a protagonist who, at the lowest phase of her life, found redemption in comedy. A Jewish housewife in 1950s New York, Midge (Rachel Brosnahan) discovered an innate ability to have a roomful of people in splits. As she took dainty steps into the world of stand-up comedy, we cheered her on. Even as the first season pretty much swept the Comedy category at the Emmys earlier this year (the first streaming series to do so, ever), its real achievement lay in giving us the comfort of discovering a fascinating world.
The sophomore season of the hit Amazon show gives us more of that world. Having dealt with the responsibility of setting up half-a-dozen characters in its first run, The Marvelous Mrs Maisel fires on all cylinders in its new season, which arrived this week. More importantly, it’s moved on from the major plot point of Midge separating from her husband, Joel (Michael Zegen), into more varied, colourful storylines.
A lot of the first season was spent on the aftermath of the big breakup. Midge’s temperamental Jewish father, Abe (Tony Shalhoub), often acted out unreasonably over the separation, while her mother, Rose (Marin Hinkle) oscillated between being in denial and panic-struck about her daughter’s future. Meanwhile, Joel took the familiar “douchebag husband” route, starting off as a heartbreaker who eventually realised his folly and wanted Midge back in his life. All of these tracks chugged along together, throwing up momentary laughs, while we only really cared about Midge’s own journey of discovering her comedic voice at nondescript comedy clubs and her volatile relationship with her manager, Susie (Alex Borstein).
This time around, Sherman-Palladino seems to have realised the true potential of her oddball characters, and breaks the story up into delightful little plot lines that could spin off shows on their own. Abe and Rose, having dealt with the bitter blow of their daughter’s broken marriage, go about fixing their own. Shalhoub and Hinkle are both adorable, and their chemistry is sparkling enough for you to not miss even Midge when they’re on screen together. Joel, meanwhile, has taken on a more mature turn — supporting Midge’s budding career as a stand-up, and trying to turn around his parents’ failing business. Susie and Midge share a warmer relationship now, even though the former struggles to turn Midge’s fortunes around, so she could turn her own.
Tonally, the show seems a lot more settled, with Sherman-Palladino’s unique sense of humour and affinity for repartee coming to the fore (she created the hugely popular Gilmore Girls, which enjoyed similar traits). The laughs come thick and fast, and even though they are functioning in a slightly more disconnected way here than in the first season, the characters’ lives seem to be more seamlessly intertwined.
Meanwhile, Brosnahan remains TV’s shining star of the moment, turning in another winning performance. We were smitten earlier; we’re in love now.
The second season of The Marvelous Mrs Maisel premièred on Amazon Prime on December 5. This column helps you navigate online (and offline) television, a world of endless options.

Cardi B to separate from rapper husband Offset ","Rapper Cardi B announced on December 5 that she is seeking a divorce from her husband Offset after just over a year of marriage, saying “I guess we just grew out of love.”
In an Instagram video, the “Bodak Yellow” singer, one of the biggest names in the music industry this year, said although she and Offset were good friends and business partners, “things just havent been working out between us for a long time.”
Cardi B, 26, and Offset, 26, a member of rap trio Migos, married secretly in September 2017 and had a child in July.
“Its nobody fault. I guess we just grew out of love but we are not together anymore. I dont know. It might take time to get a divorce and I'm going to always have a lot of love for him because he is my daughters father,” she said.
She captioned the video, “There you go ... peace and love.” Offset responded to her Instagram post with the comment, ”Y'all won.”
Cardi B has reached success in the past year with hit singles “I Like It,” “Girls Like You,” with Maroon 5, and the Bruno Mars collaboration “Finesse.”
The singer's brand of female empowerment and sexuality won three American Music Awards and three MTV Video Music awards earlier this year. She is expected to figure highly in Grammy nominations to be announced on December 7.

Sans logic or humour
","“Tuck your brains away. Don’t look for logic. Enjoy this full length comedy play.” This was the announcement just before Sowmya’s play, ‘Oodha Colour Ribbon,’ began. The play is written by Chithra Ram and directed by T.V. Radhakrishnan. The play was part of Kartik Fine Arts’ Kodai Nataka Vizha.
Looked like the audience implicitly obeyed those words for there was hardly a sound heard throughout. Of course, many tiptoed out of the hall while the play was in progress, disillusioned by the stale jokes.
It is time playwrights stopped depicting lawyers, constables and auditors in poor light. There are other ways to highlight the sense of humour in them. The dialogue here was just babble.
Addle-brained hero Madhavan with protruding teeth was an insult to Kamal Hassan’s ‘Kalyanaraman.’ Jeyasurya as Senior Advocate Varadachari was the only saving grace.
Every time the hero’s friend Ajith (T. Rajendran) had to deliver a lengthy dialogue, he turned towards the audience and said his bit in a stand-at-ease position. Sure enough, it had the audience in splits.
Now for the plot... Madhavan (P.T. Ramesh), a lawyer, joins Varadachari’s office and falls in love with a junior lawyer, without realising that she is his senior’s daughter. He plans a kidnap drama with help from his friends.
Veteran Karur Rangaraj, convicted because of Varadachari, escapes from jail with the intention of kidnapping his daughter. The friends, meanwhile, kidnap Varadachari’s wife. The captives are taken to the same place and both parties demand a heavy ransom from the senior lawyer. These scenes remind you of the film ‘Ullaththai Alli Thaa.’
The actors are to be sympathised with for being saddled with such a sloppy script.
Looks like the writer and the director themselves followed the announcement to a T. For, the play had neither style nor substance.

Replaced by a Robot
","The problems faced by aging parents, who are left to fend for themselves by their U.S.-settled wards, were highlighted in Chennai Navabharath’s ‘Oru Robovin Diary.’
The play was staged as part of Kartik Fine Arts’ Kodai nataka VIzha.
Veteran actor Koothabiran was the anchor, who lived the role of Nataraja Iyer. He capitalised on his real age to execute his role with ease. The sag at times seemed inevitable.
Natarajan’s son Ramkumar (Vignesh Ratnam), daughter-in-law Charukesi (Anuradha Ganesh) and grandson are about to return to the U.S. after their vacation in Chennai. Nataraja Iyer is unable to bear the separation and pleads with his son to stay back, something he has been doing for the past 22 years.
Ramkumar, a software engineer, designs a robot which is programmed to carry out his father’s every command. And the machine does it --- preparing coffee, administering medicines or playing songs, it does anything and everything. Ramkumar assures his father that it will make good his absence.
The director N. Rathnam’s effort to enact part of the robot, was praiseworthy. Nowhere did he flounder, either in his mannerism or in dialogue delivery. Rathnam, who takes credit for the story and dialogue as well, packed the scenes with a fair amount of melodrama.
Vignesh Ratnam, as somebody torn between the lure of material comforts and the love for his father, exhibited appropriate expressions. For instance, his anguish when he is informed about the pink slip waiting for him in the U.S. Anuradha Ganesh as the nagging wife, was convincing. T.P. Sreeram as the wise family doctor, who advises Ramkumar about relationships, N. Ganesan as the cook and R. Venkatraghavan as Ramkumar’s greedy father-in-law, did justice to their roles.
Incisive dialogue pepped up the play. Background score by Sanjana and Nikhil had a right mix of peppy tunes and melancholic phrases, and helped. However, one felt making use of the veena, flute and the sitar would have lifted the emotional scenes to greater heights.

Summer potpourri
","Lines that highlight the quaintness of the lingo of a particular section of society may add a flavour, but they cannot serve as the foundation of a play.
In Arangan Arangam’s ‘2BHK’ (story, dialogue and direction Srirangam Rangamani), the focus seemed to be on the peculiarities of the Iyengar lingo, with content playing second fiddle. It seemed as if the writer was focussed on what unique Iyengar terms he could include, and had then built a story around it. As a result, food was a major component in the dialogue, perhaps just to include typical Iyengar words such as ‘akkaravadisal’ and ‘satramudhu.’ The story meandered, and it wasn’t clear if it was about a house, or about wedding expenses. It also had regressive observations, for example- “A girl belongs to her husband’s family, head to toe,” and “A middle class man must never have a girl child.”
The process, where the prospective groom and in-laws meet the girl, was portrayed in such an old fashioned way that one wondered which period the story was set in. The idea of a sponsored wedding is old hat. In 2008, Venkat did an entire play centred round that notion and even gave it the title, ‘Sponsored Kalyanam.’ Why did Sangeetha as Vaidehi always call her mother in an annoyingly whining tone? There was nothing to shore up the proceedings, which stretched to 140 minutes.
Stage Creations came up with ‘Appa, Appappa..’, by S.L. Naanu. Sivaraman (Kathadi) is a retired man, who is convinced that his family is disrespectful towards him. Even innocuous statements are seen as slights by this hypersensitive senior citizen. He decides that the only way to get his family to respect him, is for him to ‘disappear’ for some time, the premise being that absence will make their hearts grow fonder. So he runs away from home. The play was billed as a comedy, but it wasn’t all that funny. There was, of course, the ‘Kathadi’ factor in operation, so that every time he appeared on stage, there were laughs and claps. But strip that away for a dispassionate look and you will realise that the comic element was not that strong. ‘Running away’ is not new to Kathadi, something he did in his 1970s play, ‘Runaway Husband.’ That was a hilarious play. The ‘runaway Appa’ of 2014 didn’t quite measure up. Mocking those with Hansen’s disease was insensitive and objectionable.
“Oh! What a tangled web we weave, when first we practise to deceive!” It’s a tangled web indeed, which Raghav (Sriram) weaves in Dummies’ ‘Sugamana Poigal’. Egged on by his friend Mohan (Prasanna Sridharan), Raghav gets Ramasamy (R. Giridharan) to take the place of his father. The deception is necessitated by the threat of suspension, which Raghav faces in his college. Afraid that Raghav’s tomfoolery may jeopardise his career, Ramasamy sets him right. Raghav shows his gratitude to Ramasamy in a unique way. Prema Sadasivam as the college professor was a bit over the top, though it was not entirely her fault. The lines written for her made her sound schoolmarmish. Since there is an impersonation, there are the usual mix ups.
Sreevathson, who has written and directed the play, made good use of the potential for humour in these situations. Comedy based on such mix-ups can be successful only if all the actors in the scene get the timing right and do their roles well, and Giridharan, Prasanna and Sriram didn’t let down the playwright. Prasanna and Sriram were sprightly, but the day belonged to Giridharan as the compulsive drinker Ramasamy, whose heart is in the right place.
Sreevathson said his play was inspired by one of writer Mari Selvaraj’s articles.

Variety on a platter
","While the villages of Assam were busy preparing for the Bihu festival (which began on April 14), Guwahati and its suburbs were engaged in the evenings by the performing arts festivals that were going on from the last week of March. The prominent one was Uttara Purba Nat Samaroh, from March 31 to April 8, conducted at the Rang Bhawan, Maligaon, Guwahati, by the Sangeet Natak Akademi North East Centre in association with the Asom Natya Sanmilan, which has been working in Assam for the last 53 years for the promotion of diverse theatre.
The festival opened with the Assamese play, ‘
The Lesson,’ by Guwahati-based Rangapeeth and was directed by veteran Dulal Roy, the president of Asom Natya Sanmilan, who played a significant role in building up artistic theatre in Assam.
A translation of Eugene Ionesco’s absurd play ‘La Leçon’ (1950), it ridiculed the known and little known facets in humans through the interactions of a professor and his female student and a maid, who appeared occasionally.
The pressure of studies meaninglessly makes her resort to juvenile behaviour. On the other hand, it meaningfully reflects the amorous sentiments concealed within the aged professor. Naba Baruah and Karabi Pathak in the roles of the Professor and student respectively showed a wonderful onstage chemistry.
The Nepali play ‘
Hum Hi Apna Aap,’ inspired by Dongri writer Padma Sachdev’s Hindi novel, ‘Ab Na Banegi Dehari’, by NSD Sikkim Theatre Training Centre Repertory Company is about the agony of lovers.
Rewati, a widow, falls in love with the god man, Saint Giri Baba. She is prepared to leave everything to live with him but fear of society holds him back. Moreover, to strengthen the blind faith of the village folks in God, the saint has to take Samadhi.
The Bengali play, ‘
Ek Ananter Khoj’ by Natyabhumi, Agartala, written and directed by Sanjoy Kar portrayed well the irreverent attitude of today’s youth, who are not only mobile-facebook-internet savvy but at times into drugs too. The messages of Swami Vivekananda help them to regain a quality life. While the ideology was strong, the drama was less so in this light play that did profile well the talent of young Ankita Saha in the role of Mandira, the protagonist.
Written by Jyotishman Chattopadhyay, the Bengali play ‘
Krishnapurer Rupkatha’ by Nandipat, Kolkata, kept the audience glued to their seats in all aspects, which included the outstanding Kamal Chattopadhyay, who was superb as Gora, a villager. The honest, down-to-earth milkman of Krishnapur, Brindaban Ghosh ( played by Bimal Chakraborty, the director of the play), is transformed into the centre of power and lawbreaker, when he becomes rich by virtue of Goddess Laxmi, who has taken shelter at his home disguised as an old and almost blind woman. The play pointed out that corruption is not an inherent trait of any ‘system,’ but a global phenomenon that is linked to power.
The Hindi play, ‘
Jahajin,’ by Patna based Raaga, also made a strong political statement from a different angle. Written by Rajesh Chandra and directed by Randhir Kumar, it interrogates the concept of development advocated by successive rulers. Does development mean the welfare of the privileged and displacement of the sons of the soil? While putting forth the tribulations of the less fortunate, the presentation made suggestions about mutually supportive developments.
Unfortunately, the Manipuri play ‘
Nagamandalam’ (yes, Girish Karnad’s celebrated play!) translated and directed by Kshetri Jugindro and presented by the Imphal-based Manipuri Ensemble was a catastrophe.
But ‘
Model Vihar’ (Hindi) by Nisarg, Lucknow, on the following day was a compensatory feast. The entire credit goes to the brilliant Lalit Singh Pokhariya, who scripted, directed and handled four roles. The encounters of Sewakji, an acclaimed writer, teacher and intellectual, with city snobs were laced with humour –its hallmark. It was an unforgettable one-man show.
The Nagaon-based Rangalaya’s ‘
Koina Konda Shil’ (Assamese), written and directed by Mrinal Kr Bora, was the festival’s concluding play. The theme was a captivating, five-centuries-old Assamese folktale about the tragedy of a newly wedded royal duo and their entourage.
The strength of the play was primarily in its theme and the rich folk musicals, especially the mellifluous vocal renderings by young Amrita Kaur; nothing noteworthy from the actors.
All the plays essentially banked on dialogue-oriented long narratives rather than the language of the theatre and stage techniques. It also appeared that some of the directors are yet to free themselves from some of the typical NSD clichés. However, with two plays from the hosting state, the Uttara Purba Nat Samaroh successfully highlighted the recent developments, diverse facets and ongoing practices in the artistic theatre of these regions with statements on the aspirations of its people.

Lure of foreign lands
","The basic characteristics of Kewal Dhaliwal’s theatre are the intensity of emotions, imaginative use of draperies to create visual poetry and a scant décor to be in tune with the leitmotif of the play. The acting style he envisages for his actors is marked by a strong motive and vitality to establish an emotional chord with the audience.
These aspects were very much in evidence in his production of “Gaddi Charan Di Kaahal Bari Si” in Punjabi, a part of the Festival of Performing Arts featuring works of the recipients of Akademi awardees organised by the Sangeet Natak Akademi at Abhimanch in New Delhi recently. Remarkable for its focus on the plight of people who attempt to migrate illegally to make it big in foreign countries, the production has overpowering emotional appeal. At another level, it severely indicts the unscrupulous agents who trade in human miseries.
A graduate of National School of Drama and a committed theatre artist, Kewal has immensely contributed to the professional theatre movement in Punjab. He has received the Sangeet Natak Akademi Award 2013 for his contribution to Indian theatre as director.
Kewal has drawn the title of his play from the poetry of Surjit Patar, the renowned Punjabi poet, to symbolise the disillusioned young people in Punjab attempting to go to foreign countries by resorting to illegal means. In most cases, their quest turns out to be a chimera, culminating in eternal hell. With this central theme, Kewal has dramatised four short stories by significant Punjabi writers. To harmonise these different stories into an artistic whole, he has created the character of Sutradhar and between the changes of scenes Patar’s poetry rendered by a chorus to the accompaniment of beats of drum is used which enrich the emotional power of the production.
The play opens with the dramatic version of the short story “Sukh di Ghari” by Baldev Singh Dhinsa. Rotting in a German jail, the victim writes to his father back home, recounting his torturous journey from India to Germany as an illegal immigrant. He is transported from one place to another in a box to avoid being detected by the Police. He recalls the way a goat in his village is kept in a wide open box. His condition was worse than the goat. In this process, he has lost all his dignity and is worse than an animal — just a lifeless object.
The second story enacted is “Pailan Paunda Sap” by Jaswinder Singh. It depicts the shameless manner a husband is forcing his wife to stage a fake marriage ritual with another man to be able to secure her visit to the country in which he is working. Anguished with the conduct of her husband, the woman retaliates. The husband takes pride in adopting a modus operandi to outsmart immigration authorities. He is happy that his wife can leave the country with her fake husband. Through the encounter between, the husband and the wife, the petty mind of the husband and his shameless act is revealed as well as the dilemma of the wife who hates her husband.
Harpreet Sekha’s short story “Ram Gau” deals with the life of a headmaster in a village in Punjab who is respected by the villages and revered by his students. His voice has great weight in the affairs of the village. His family members are settled in Canada. Now that he has retired from service, he is invited by his kith and kin to stay with them in Canada. As soon as the initial excitement of living with his family members subsides, the headmaster is metamorphosed into a stray cow that nobody looks after, everyone shoos him away. Now the headmaster becomes desperate to leave Canada and return to his roots but nobody listens to him. He has lost his freedom, respect and friends; he is a lonely figure, lifeless.
The condition of women among the illegal immigrants are the worst. This heartbreaking reality is reflected in the dramatised version “Galat Aurat” by Veena Verma. The play revolves round an ambitious and beautiful girl who is educated and has dreams of marrying a well-placed and respected young man. Considering a young man working in a foreign country most suitable bridegroom for her daughter, her father marries her off to a Youngman settled abroad. After the marriage is solemnised, he stays for few days with the bride. During this brief period, the girl gets conceived and later gives birth to a male child. The husband leaves her with the promise that he would soon come back with the essential papers and would take her with him. But years have passed and he doesn’t return. Forced by circumstances, the woman leaves India with her son to meet her husband with forged documents. Facing hardships and indignities that are in store for illegal immigrants, she is subjected to rape by different men at difference places. By the time the brute and rapacious agents manage surreptitiously to arrange a meeting between her husband and herself, she is reduced to a miserable wreak. Her husband refuses to recognize her, leaving her in the lurch and be destroyed by wolves in the form of men.
Pavel Sandhu as the prisoner in a jail in Germany; Gurinder Makna as the headmaster migrated to Canada and Mandeep Kaur as the victim of unscrupulous agents desperate to meet her husband, impart to their portraits emotional depth and truly live their characters with riveting performances to grab the attention of the audience.

An ode to creativity and friendship
","Satyajit Ray was recording the background score for Pather Panchali (Song Of The Road) with Pandit Ravi Shankar. The sitar maestro was totally involved in his work when Ray asked him to stop. An astonished Shankar stared at Ray as he asked Shankar to record only as much as required.
Shankar was astonished but never questioned Ray. He did exactly as he was asked too. The result was simply brilliant. The sitar counters during the monsoon rains in Pather Panchali sounded like a flowing rivulet. Restraint was the motto of Ray in every department of filmmaking including music. Shankar understood this very well and his rapport with Ray is legendary.
Way back in the 1940s, Ray saw Neechanagar and Dharti Ke Lal. He was fascinated by Ravi Shankar’s score in both films. The use of the sitar, country drums and flute during the climax of Neechanagar moved him. He made up his mind to work with Shankar if he ever directed a film.
His dream came true with Pather Panchali in 1955. So strong was their association right from their debut film that both worked together again in Aparajito, Apur Sansar and Paras Pathar with resounding success. Shankar read the script of Apu Trilogy a number of times and submitted himself totally to the filmmaker. In Ray, Ravi Shankar discovered a true creator, who understood the language of cinema.
Ray was not the proverbial dictator. His views at work were crystal clear. He never imposed himself on his artists, technicians or composers. Yet he never allowed any of his teammates to go overboard. Be it Ravi Shankar, Vilayat Khan or Ali Akbar Khan, Ray handled them with equal efficiency.
Though Shankar cannot be exactly termed Ray’s musical soul, like Maurice Jarr was of Sir David Lean’s, the Ray-Shankar combination created cinematic wonders acclaimed internationally. The usage of the bamboo flute created emotional waves in Aparajito while the sitar interludes in Paras Pathar had a comic but meaningful touch.
In the late 1950s, Ray decided to shoot a full-length documentary on Ravi Shankar. He prepared the script with the required sketches in his inimitable way. Ray for the first time used water colours for his drawings in the script of this documentary. Sadly, the documentary never went on floors.
Harper Collins, India in association with Satyajit Ray Society is publishing the script in a book form, Ray’s Ravi Shankar that will be released by the iconic actor Naseeruddin Shah at Kolkata on Ray’s birthday today (May 2) as he delivers the Satyajit Ray Memorial Lecture.
The original script and story board are intact making Ray’s Ravi Shankar a delight for readers of all ages. Just as Ravi Shankar was Ray’s, Ray was Ravi Shankar’s to the core.
Ray started composing for his films himself with Teen Kanya (
Three Daughters by Rabindranath Tagore) 1961 onward. Still he maintained his relationship with Shankar till the end of his life. So grieved was Ravi Shankar at Ray’s demise that he composed and created an exclusive album in his memory.

All set for Cannes
","“At the end of the day, I am a film star,” declared Sonam Kapoor. Her declaration came as an endorsement of her favourite look created by L’Oreal Paris for its new L’Or Lumiere collection. The collection was launched by Sonam Kapoor in Mumbai just in time for Cannes Film Festival 2014 this month, where she and the brand’s two other Indian ambassadors — Aishwarya Rai-Bachchan and Freida Pinto — will walk the red carpet.
“The collection focuses on the Indian skin and we should accentuate it,” said Sonam, looking every bit the style diva in a sequined silver flair dress.
Being a star has its own advantages. Like Sonam puts it, the time spent in Cannes will be like a “three-day holiday” that involves representing one’s country and looking beautiful. “When you meet other international actors and models you realise that you are living in a bubble. The world is lot bigger than you think,” she said.
Every year the Raanjhanaa actor makes it a point to take with her to Cannes a bit of Indianness, be it a sari that she wore last year, or jewellery the year before. What’s in the bag this year? “I don’t know. Everyone thinks I plan my look in advance but I don’t. But there will be something Indian this time too.”

Put your best face forward
","We all love the red carpet — the gowns, the hairdos and the works. Namrata Soni — L'Oréal Paris’ make-up expert, is one of many who works behind the scenes to ensure the stars get their looks right for the flash bulbs. She even created the looks for the brand’s latest make-up collection — L’Or Lumiere, which its ambassadors will sport at the red carpet in Cannes Film Fesival 2014. Armed with the expertise and experience, Namrata tells us how to make the red carpet glamour work for the Indian skin tone — there are 32 shades of it, I’m told!

Why has L’Oreal chosen to focus on Indian skin this time?

I think it’s high time we did. We are all used to seeing only white faces, so we need to tell people it is okay to look the way you are, be the colour you are.

What are the colours that will work for the Indian skin?

Indian skin ranges from very fair to very dark, so it is important to understand one’s skin colour. My website explains how one can determine their under tone so that they can choose shades accordingly. But personally, I feel that there is a perfect red lipstick for every skin colour.

There are many who are not comfortable sporting bright lip colours.

The trick is understanding make-up. If you feel a colour is too dark, apply it as a stain or just a hue of it. There has to be some colour on the face to make us look brighter and fresh. Indians are too obsessed with maroons, browns and black.

So you suggest experimenting with make up?

Yes. One should not be scared to experiment. It is just make-up, you can wash it off. I always tell people, you need not remove the entire make-up too. Just dab the tip of a cotton bud with make-up remover and wipe off just aspect that does not work for you.

While preparing for the red carpet, what is the one aspect that people generally overlook?

Nails! They are also equally in focus. You see stars posing with their hands on their dress or holding their clutches. They need to be well manicured. And if you’re not the type to change colour to match your outfit everyday then I suggest you go for any neutral colour, or a gold with pearl finish for the red carpet — it goes very well with Indian skin tone.

Some tips…

- First, look after your skin. Also, don’t worry about concealing too many flaws. Instead, focus on highlighting a feature. I hate dark eyes and dark lips. Only either of it should be highlighted, not both.
- If you have no time to get ready, even mascara and a smear of blush will work wonders.
- According to me, the winged liner will always be in vogue. It especially suits the Indian face.

Kya Dilli Kya Lahore: Familiar tale of Partition
","Partition is one of those unresolved issues that continues to occupy the mindspace on both sides of the border with creative people looking to find a closure to the wound. This week actor Vijay Raaz takes to direction with the subject. The intention is laudable but the execution leaves much to be desired. It is a verbose attempt to underline the futility of war. It deserved to be mounted on the big stage but the writing is more suitable for theatre than celluloid.
Set in 1948, Samarth (Manu Rishi) is a cook attached to the Indian army. He takes on Rehmat (Vijay Raaz), a Pakistani soldier sent to bring the secret files about a clandestine Indian operation to dig a tunnel between Delhi’s Red Fort and Lahore. The two talk more than fight and gradually discover over a period of time that they have more similarities than differences. It was expected to give goosebumps but after a few thought-provoking lines, the narrative falls into a pattern where the two talk out reams of paper. There is very little space for silence in a setting where the two engage in a verbal spat from a distance. It seems ideal for the stage but the pitch creates predictability on big screen.
With the films based on Partition, establishing a sense of nostalgia and loss is a given, and here when Samarth talks of his childhood in Lahore and Rehmat rewinds to his past in Delhi, we get the point. When they talk of exchanging their moons, one can feel the lyrical presence of Gulzar, who has also presented the film, in the background but somehow the film fails to get to the next level.
The appearance of Raj Zutshi as the Indian postman and Biswajeet Pradhan as the Pakistani Captain on the scene gives hope but once again they flicker only to establish what you already know about such stories. There are no surprises in store. It is easy to get into No Man’s Land but what you do there determines your ability to engage the public. Vijay is honest in his effort as an actor and with Manu manages to hit some right notes but as a director it turns out to be a laboured attempt.

Kya Dilli Kya Lahore


Genre: Drama

Cast: Vijay Raaz, Manu Rishi, Raj Zutshi, Biswajeet Pradhan

Plot: Two soldiers from either side of the border spar only to discover that they have more similarities than differences.

Bottomline: A skit has been stretched to screenplay.

The Amazing Spider-Man 2: It’s all coming together
","Where director Marc Webb was finding his feet in The Amazing Spider Man (2012), coming to a big blockbuster after his small, intimate movie debut with 500 Days of Summer, in this sequel he displays a surer hand. While quieter moments are sweet and touching as always, the grand, eye-popping ones are delightfully gob-smacking.
It is graduation day and Peter is running late as he is busy spinning a web around Russian mobster Aleksei Sytsevich. As Spider-Man, Peter goes about saving the city from assorted bad guys but as Peter Parker, he struggles with the promise he made to Gwen’s father about keeping away from her. Peter’s best friend, Harry, returns from boarding school and on his father’s death takes over Oscorp. When Harry learns he has the same degenerative disease that killed his father, he thinks Spider-Man’s blood will save him. Peter is reluctant because he does not know what the side effects would be.
There is also electrical engineer Max Dillon who idolises Spider-Man but like all fans, turns violently against him because of a perceived insult. To add insult to injury, Max falls into a tank of electric eels and turns into a human generator. Peter also wants to find out the truth about his parents’ disappearance. There is a lot going on in Peter’s life and he would need his spidey super powers to stay on top of things.
The movie is engaging, thrilling and very funny. Andrew Garfield makes for a cutely conflicted super hero while Emma Stone as Gwen is the smart, sassy girlfriend we’d all like to have and Sally Field as Aunt May would win favourite aunt competition hands down. Jamie Foxx is self-effacing as Max and manic as Electro while Dane DeHaan looks like a very young Leo DiCaprio as Harry and suitably demented as Green Goblin. Paul Giamatti as Russian mobster and Rhino personifies the hammy and unstoppable.
The colours are happy, the web slinging zingy and the little details like a superhero doing his laundry and colouring all clothes red and blue is delightful. Just two postscripts: As always wait for the end credits to roll for that wee extra and nervous flyers have quite a bit to be anxious about!

The Amazing Spider-Man 2


Genre: Action

Director: Marc Webb

‘Nothing has come easy to me’
","Rajkummar Rao and his co-star Patralekha were among the Citylights team that spent a few days in a small hamlet near Sadri in Pali district, 150km from Udaipur in Rajasthan, observing the lifestyles of people in the area. “That’s my job. It’s necessary that I do enough groundwork so that my character, that of a migrant from Rajasthan, looks believable on screen. I observed people, their traits and tried to understand what they do and how they live,” he says.



Citylights is Rajkummar’s first release after he was conferred with the National Award for Best Actor for his portrayal of the slain human rights lawyer Shahid Azmi in Shahid. The mention of the National Award brings a hearty smile but he doesn’t want the award to weigh on his shoulders. “I’ve been choosing films going by scripts I can connect to. That’s how I want it to be. I don’t want to select a film thinking I am a National Award winning actor,” he says.

 People hated me in ‘Queen’, which is great. My character was not supposed to be likeable. 
Rajkummar can play a solo lead, like in Shahid and Citylights, be a part of ensemble casts like in Shaitan, Chittagong and Kai Po Che and quietly shine in supporting roles like he did in Talaash and Queen. His filmography reveals an astute mind at work, trusting his instincts and choosing films that won’t be forgotten easily. “Nothing has come easy to me, since my days in Delhi. There’s a lot of hard work behind what appears like an effortless performance. I like to understand the context of a film and my character, but I don’t rehearse much. I prefer an organic method of work,” he says. The organic method of acting, he feels, makes the character appear spontaneous on screen.
As he basked in all the positive reviews to Shahid, he followed it up with a chauvinistic character in Queen. “The feedback was fabulous. People hated me in the film, which is great. My character was not supposed to be likeable,” he laughs.
Speaking about Citylights, he confesses he hasn’t watched the original British-Filipino film on which it is based. Like Hansal Mehta, he didn’t want to be influenced by the original. “I went by the script given to me and felt it would be better to approach the character from my perspective,” he says.

Citylights was initially to be directed by Ajay Bahl. Once he stepped aside, Rajkummar suggested Hansal Mehta’s name. “It was a co-incidence that the Bhatts had watched Shahid a couple of days ago, were impressed and keen to have Hansal Mehta on board,” says Rajkummar.

Short and impactful

The actor’s repertoire includes a three-minute short film titled Mumbai Mirror, directed by Shlok Sharma. “The film is four years old, but is being discussed in social media now,” he says.

Mumbai Mirror is a forceful short that shows how a secular person can turn communal in minutes. “We shot the film in two to three hours,” says Rajkummar, adding, “Whichever project I take up, I make an effort to relate to the characters. Citylights, for instance, is a story anyone can connect with. We see our cities teeming with lakhs of migrants. The story could happen anywhere.”

The saga of a pioneer
","Before the digital technology enveloped us in India for recorded music, it was gramophone records and cassettes that dominated the audio world gradually making way for the CD and MP3 formats of recording to take over. One of the longest serving and well-known personally in the audio industry is H.M. Mahesh of Sangeetha Cassettes, the man who started the company in 1979 as a 35-year-old.
Tracing the 1944 Kasargod-born Mahesh’s life is essential as this ‘man with a vision’ not just found his way to flag-off the cassette world, but was responsible in sieving the best musical talents of Karnataka to showcase them to a wider audience. Born in Gadinaadu of Kasargod, Mahesh, after his B. Sc. from St. Aloysius College in Mangalore, headed straight to Madras in 1968 to acclimatize himself with the world of recorded music, as “passion to gain knowledge in this art had always been bugging me,” says the die-hard music connoisseur.
Those were the days when all South-Indian films were done in Madras. The Karnataka stars behind the film world too as Rajkumar, lyricist Udayashankar, R.N.Jayagopal, Vijay Narasimha had a stronghold there for their shootings and recordings. “As my father H.M. Narayana Bhat was a journalist in Karnataka, my writing for him regarding the Kannada stars in Madras, proved a win-win situation for both of us. I got to meet all of them and observe not just the making of films but closely absorbed the nuances of the line-of-work required in pre-recorded music too, especially with respect to gramophone records popular in those days ,” says Mahesh.
It was Udayashankar who first introduced Mahesh to Saraswati Stores in Madras, owned by AVM Meiyappa Chettiar, for undertaking labelling work on Kannada records which needed a Kannadiga for getting them perfected. Saraswati Stores (or the Columbia Recording Company) was the leading distributor for the South for the Gramaphone Recording Company in Calcutta who dealt with gramophone records of all kinds.
Mahesh was subsequently offered a job there and his work was extended to improving the collection. He was heart-broken when he discovered the dismal share of recordings available from the Kannada film, light and classical world, barring a few of MLV’s Dasarapada and Kalinga Rao’s recordings. Improving the Kannada collection became one of Mahesh’s passionate occupations, even as he toured Bangalore, Mangalore, Mysore, Hassan, Chitradurga, Shimoga, Hubli-Belgaum-Dharwad and Bellary to find out more from the dealers.
In the early 1970s, he brought out P.B.Srinivas and S.Janaki’s recording with ‘Gajamukhane Ganapathiye,’ that proved an instant hit. Many more first timers gave Karnataka a boost, but what indeed made history in Kannada film song gramophone record sales was Rajkumar’s ‘Sampathige Sawaal’ and his number ‘Yaare Koogadali’ totally recovering the Kannada collection of the Columbia Recording Company. Mahesh says, “Udayashankar again helped me get Rajkumar for a private recording with ‘Mantralayakke Hogona’ in 1972 followed by his LP in Kannada with Raghavendra Swamiji’s ‘Guruvara Bantamma’ which is treasured even today!”
Mahesh’s recordings of Kannada devotional songs from Bhadragiri Keshavadas had the singer advise him to “take up cassette recordings as done in foreign countries” and in 1979, Mahesh started ‘Sangeetha Cassettes’, and he became the first licensed pre-recorded cassette manufacturer in India. “Nothing would have been possible for me without Parvathamma and Rajkumar, for their first contribution for Sangeetha Cassettes was annavaru’s songs on Anjaneya and Raghavendra Swami. After importing machines from Japan for cassette recordings ‘our own Rajanna’ was there for several more of his own hits, followed by recordings of Balamurali Krishna, R.K. Srikantan, R.S. Ramakanth, B.V. Karanth, C. Ashwath’s with Rathnamala Prakash, Ananthaswamy’s ‘Bhava Sangama’ and a whole lot of other classical artistes from Karnataka.
‘Sangeetha Cassettes’ went on to record artistes of repute from all over India, Mandolin Srinivas being one of its earliest one. Mahesh was also the first to approach Congress Member Rajiv Gandhi to have the Excise Duty on Cassettes reduced to 15 per cent from the shocking 25 percent slapped on a cassette costing Rs. 45! “It was Rajkumar and Parvathamma who helped me again and got the excise duty removed totally later,” says an emotional Mahesh, recollecting the innumerable help Rajkumar has rendered to the people of Karnataka. Sangeetha Studios now runs as Vijaya Studios in Chennai, while all Sangeetha’s cassette recordings can be downloaded at sangeethamusic.com.

Sip, sipper, blend
","Diva of talk shows Oprah Winfrey’s tea brand, Oprah Chai Tea hits the shelves this week.
“I like things really spicy, I like things chai’d up,” declares Oprah in a YouTube video that details her search for a blend that would reflect her.
Oprah is seen selecting “more enticing” flavours, and rejecting the ones that are “not robust enough”.
“As this process was going on and on (at Starbucks tasting room), I could tell that the tea needed a little more ginger and a little more pepper... I like things that have a little kick to them,” she explains.
Oprah Chai Tea, finally ready, is described as a bold mix of cinnamon, ginger, cardamom and cloves, blended with loose-leaf black tea and rooibos. The operative word here is blended or blending, which is also the topic of this week’s column
Why is tea blended? What is the art of blending?
The obvious reason is to create a totally separate identity for the tea, different from the original.
The most challenging factor in blending is achieving consistency, so that the blend sipped anytime of the year, anywhere, tastes the same. The challenge of consistency arises from the fact that tea crops are influenced by the vagaries of nature.
Now, creating a blend for a personality – Oprah Chai Tea being an example – calls for an approach vastly different from the one required in creating a blend for a particular market.
Bespoke teas address the challenge of matching a brew with a personality.
“It is a fascinating art, one that requires reading the mind of the consumer,” says the blender and speaks about the grammar of tea.
Oprah’s tea should be bold and robust like her. A brand for Beckhman, or closer home, for Amitabh Bachchan, would necessarily be stylish and made using high-grown orthodox leaves. Strong CTC dust or full-bodied Assams would best describe Rajnikanth.
A light flavoury cup made using cold-weather Nilgiris would match mellow, romantic beings.
On the subject of customised blends, here’s a little anecdote about renowned financier J.P. Morgan.
A lover of fine living and tea, his personal blend was dissed by a blender who called it “the worst tea” he had ever tasted.
Morgan replied, irritated, “What do you know about tea? Nothing.”
The blend, still being sold, is a combination of Formosa oolong, black teas and Lapsang Souchong.

Tea Sangria

(Make Tea Sangria to match your personality. Add fruits that best describe you or choose the tea that defines you)
Strong black tea infusion – one litre
Sugar – to taste
One grapefruit or a bunch of green grapes
Pineapple – half
Ripe mango – one
Lemon – one, squeezed for juice
lce cubes
Prepare tea infusion and sweeten with sugar to taste and cut grapefruit, pineapple and mango into bite-sized pieces. Put fruits in a punch bowl with infusion. Add lemon juice, stir and refrigerate for a few hours. Serve with ice cubes.

Not played to perfection
","Finally getting long-overdue Tony nominations this year, The Glass Menagerie has never been an easy play to start with. Overlaid by a pall of despair and abandonment, the play is based on Tenneesee Williams’ own family and was the work that first catapulted him into fame and has since been a Broadway staple.
Mumbai-based Act One Scene One’s version that played in the city on Thursday was not an ambitious production. It stuck faithfully to the original, propped by a set of solid performances with Shernaz Patel as Amanda, Ira Dubey as Laura, Jim Sarbh as Tom and Cabir Maira as James, the gentleman caller. Williams’ play is a brilliant work, the performance was more than competent, and the English was refreshingly Indian. And yet the evening was strangely unsatisfactory and I spent a long time trying to understand why. The sense of overwhelming loneliness and desolation that infuses the original play was somewhat muted in Rajit Kapur’s version. It felt lighter; more a gentle Micawber-like gloom that one believed would be raised soon, with Micawber-like optimism, until the final scene of desertion seals the nail in irrevocably. This sense of cheeriness came from Amanda, a role that Shernaz played with gusto, and of course from the witty lines themselves. The problem though when someone is as loudly jovial and interfering as Shernaz was, is that you cannot really believe that her character could send someone over the edge, as it does Tom. Or is this the Indian in me speaking? Amanda is over-solicitous, she loves her children, she talks and nags non-stop and comes across like an exaggerated version of one of those busybody aunts that every family is saddled with. There was a lack of edge in Amanda that made Tom’s angst seem rudderless.
But, equally, this could have been a Tom problem. Tom did not come across as a dreamy, idealistic writer forced to deal with the killing mundaneness of everyday survival, but rather as a petulant young man annoyed with his mother’s interfering. This made it difficult to sympathise with his melancholy or to see his ultimate desertion as anything more than lazy dereliction of duty.
Ira Dubey was easily the best as the limping, frail and painfully self-conscious Laura. Her suffering and the effort it took her to utter a single word was almost tangible. And her final blooming under the gentle persuasion of James was beautifully done. In many ways, the last act was easily the best. There was movement, there was tension, and there were some excellent performances. Shernaz as the disappointed mother was heartbreakingly good. Cabir’s brief time on stage was well spent. One of the nicest touches was the violinist on the stage, who provided the music but who also played a sort of simplistic Greek chorus role. I wish Rajit Kapur had pushed the envelope on this one, had experimented, perhaps made it shorter, crisper, and changed the setting. I was haunted by the idea of seeing the play staged in a middle-class Parsi or Bengali family. As it was, it was a fine evening of theatre but not a spectacular one.

Rocking to tandanu tandana
","Seven songs with seven different artistes across a variety of genres like blues, jazz, Carnatic, folk, rock and Hindustani — Tandanu, Indian Ocean’s latest album is not just a tribute to music but also a celebration of 25 years of the band.
The band’s seventh studio album, this is a collection of songs that Indian Ocean worked on at different points of time in the last 10 years. “The songs have been put together in collaboration with other artistes, who have lent their own unique touch to the compositions,” says bass guitarist Rahul Ram.
Besides the members of the band, Tandanu features Shankar Mahadevan, Shuba Mudgal, Vishal Dadlani, Pandit Vishwa Mohan Bhatt, Karsh Kale, Selva Ganesh and Kumaresh (of Ganesh-Kumaresh). “All these people said ‘let’s do it!’ when we approached them. There was no talk of what they will get out of this or no questions about how much time they would have to give,” says Rahul. “They are all technically more competent than we are and yet collaborated so beautifully with us.”
The title track of the album, which Indian Ocean and Shankar Mahadevan perform together, is a folk song of Karnataka that Rahul picked up from his aunt. “During the freedom struggle my aunt used to sing folk songs with her sisters. I heard the song first when I was probably three years old and it has stayed in my head all these years,” he adds. The Indian Ocean version of Tandanu, is still only a part of the whole song. “It’s twice as long,” laughs Rahul.
With a new guitarist at the helm, the band feels that their sound, while still retaining its signature style, now has an interesting mix to it. “The album has two songs in collaboration with Carnatic artistes. That apart, Nikhil Rao, our guitarist, has a flair of classical music and it shows in his riffs,” says Rahul.
Indian Ocean launches Tandanu on Pepsi MTV Indies. Every Saturday, one song from the album will be released as a half-hour episode.

Third coming
","Thank God some people don’t change. When most actors, irrespective of their box office draw, decided to walk on haughty air, Govinda was grounded as ever at IIFA. He turned up in a pink coat to launch the first look of his forthcoming film Agni Chakra smiling from ear to ear.
“I have been told that I have a huge fan following in the U.S., something I didn’t realise all these years. Since I am going to start my third innings in the industry, I have decided to start from this platform,” says Govinda, who has once again signed eight-nine films. “I am again playing a cop in the film after a long time but there is a strong comic element as well, as people expect it from a Govinda film.” Govinda is trying to revive his banner Mangal Tara Films with the film.
He refuses to spill the beans on the offer made by Mira Nair for her next film Bengali Detective but confirms that he is playing a football coach in Pahlaj Nihalani’s much delayed Avatar. Nihalani has played a crucial role in his career right from his first hit Ilzam and this time, he seems to have managed to make him lose weight. “This is my wife’s contribution. She has put a full stop on the rich food,” Govinda makes the face of a wretched husband.
Talking about the turn of events, Govinda says, “In between, I tried to run my career in a planned fashion but it didn’t work. It has always been the case with me. Either I have a lot of work or no work at all,” says the actor whose big banner films Run Bhola Run and Banda Yeh Bindas Hai are lying in the cans. “Who would have thought that films of Ashtvinayak and Ravi Chopra would not see the light of the day,” laments the actor who was christened as No.1 star after a series of titles with the tag. He holds his brush with politics responsible for the lull in his career. “Film financiers also have political leanings, you know.”
Recently, Varun Dhawan was seen copying him in Main Tera Hero. Ranveer Singh, who is working with him in Kill Dill has described Govinda as a school of acting and even touched his feet at the Award ceremony. “I am grateful that he thinks that my style is worth copying. It has been a trend. When we were young, the media used to say that we try to copy Dilip Kumar. These days, young actors are working extra hard. I mean on their bodies,” he bursts into laughter. “Most of them have grown up in well-to-do families from the industry and so their real life experiences are limited but I find Ranbir and Ranveer really talented,” says Govinda who is playing Ranbir’s step father in Anurag Basu’s Jagga Jasoos. “It is a well-etched out character and could not be seen just as a fatherly stereotype. I am 50 and am a father of a grownup daughter in real life. So I have no issues playing a father as long as the role is substantial.”
With Kill Dil, he is making his debut with Yashraj Films. “When I was on top, I used to sign eight-nine films in one go and Yash Raj being a top banner wanted the actors to concentrate only on its films. So we could not get together.” He is playing the villain in the film, which is again a rarity for the actor better known for his comic timing. “I too was surprised when Shaad Ali offered me the role. I said I will try for a couple of days and if he or I feel that I am not fitting in we will part our ways. Thankfully, we managed to strike a chord.”
Critics have often dubbed him as a one-emotion actor and perhaps that is the reason that though he forced most Hindi film award juries to create a category of best actor in a comic role but failed to graduate to best actor category. “I am made by the words that begin with ma. Be it my mother or the masses. So I don’t care about the critics,” Govinda gets emotional.

Do the drums
","His Mohawk makes an impact before his music. Ravi Jakhotia was in demand on the stage and off it at IIFA. The Tampa native, with roots in Rajasthan, composed the event’s theme song “Do Da Tampa” that made the locals dance to his tunes and generated the much needed interest in the four-day event with his livewire performance. “Around 8,000 people turned up for the opening night and out of them 40 per cent were local Americans,” says Ravi, who performed again at IIFA Rocks. “While composing the music, I was conscious about bringing out the Tampa culture on the world stage but at the same time wanted to write something that will appeal to Bollywood fans as well. I am inspired by Hispanic music and there is a similarity between Bollywood music and Brazilian and Spanish beats,” he elaborates. The six-minute song has reggae and salsa beats and it helped in creating the mela atmosphere around the event, which many hard-nosed observers described as Oscars on steroids. Improvisation is the key to the performance of this Chamberlain graduate. .
Ravi comes from a conservative family, says he was always interested in music.. “I was considered an outcast. When I asked my father to buy me a drum he found the hobby expensive. So I saved by doing odd jobs in the neighbourhood. It was only when he realised that I am serious about it that he supported.”
Popularly called DJ Ravidrums, he has performed with the likes of Paula Abdul, Ricky Martin, Britney Spears and Black Eyed Peas and has composed music for American comedy Howie Do It, but he considers the IIFA opportunity bigger as it gave him a chance to showcase his own music. “

To the Bard, with passion
","It was B.C. Ramachandra Sharma, the Kannada poet, who got Madhav Sharma interested in the works of William Shakespeare and taught him the beauty of words and language. “He saw my love of Shakespeare and encouraged it. I owe my love for Shakespeare to my uncle, K. Swaminthan, who was professor of English at Presidency College, Madras,” says Madhav, who has over five decades experience in the UK in professional theatre, radio, film and television. He is performing Bharat, Blighty and the Bard, directed by Miranda Lapworth, in the city.
The play explores how Shakespeare offered “a brave new world” to Madhav. “It’s wonderful to be back to my home town to perform,” says Madhav. “Shakespeare came from a little town. I am from Bangalore. Through this performance, I want to share my passion for Shakespeare with my fellow Bangaloreans,” says Madhav, who trained at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, London.
Madhav wrote the play after his visit to Kochi in January. “The Kochi Reading Group invited me for their Shakespeare Festival, the founder of the group Indira Outcalt suggested I write something about the similarities between Shakespeare’s life and my life, she told me, ‘you know there are parallels between your life and his.’ She said not to be shy and to write it. I contacted Miranda, whom I’ve known for many years, and we collaborated for this production. The play has some of Shakespeare’s words and some of mine.”
Madhav says Shakespeare isn’t just meant for the intellectual and the high-browed. “ I believe his texts are badly taught. His works need to be spoken and dramatised, that’s the best way to learn it.”

Bharat, Blighty and the Bard has been well-received by audiences in Kochi. Madhav says people must watch it to really feel the magic and the actor’s passion for Shakespeare. The play is being staged at Jagriti Theatre, Whitefield on May 3 at 8 p.m. and on May 4 at 3 p.m. and 6.30 p.m. Tickets are priced at Rs. 300 and are available at bookmyshow.com and at the venue.

Singing of India
","“It was December 6, 1992. I was sitting with my guru, (late) Hafeez Ahmed Khan. He was teaching but he was very tense and he kept the television on. And on the television we saw that the Babri Masjid was being broken. He was very upset. I was speechless,” recalls classical vocalist and science professor Subhendu Ghosh.
He knew that the shocking event in Ayodhya would have violent consequences that would in turn trigger more violence. “I had heard my parents talking about the communal riots during Partition, but that was before I was born. I myself have witnessed the communal riots of ’84. I walked in the camps at that time, and it was terrible…” Realising that “things have come to this stage”, in the charged days following the Babri Masjid demolition, he resolved with like-minded friends — including Professor P.K. Basant, Minoti Chatterjee (now principal of Kamala Nehru College) and several others — to remind his fellow Indians of the examples of secular traditions, individuals and institutions with which the country’s history abounds.
He had also at around the same time come out with an album of ghazals by poets who wrote on political and secular themes, including Faiz and other writers of the 20th Century. “Some of us friends thought that instead of talking of political discourse we should look back into our cultural history,” he explains. “For example it was always being said those days that the culture of India is Hinduism. I have no objection to that, and I know that Hinduism is a culture that developed around the Indus Valley. But it was not being projected like that.”
It was Basant who suggested that Ghosh being a musician, they should focus on the history of North Indian music. “From the post-Dhrupad period you find the musicians were from different religions and communities. The same is true of the poets. And music and poetry go together,” says Ghosh. The programme that came together was performed by Ghosh along with commentary in many venues and cities for several years till 2004. With professional engagements taking him away from his Delhi base, Ghosh has not been able to continue the routine. Now, some 10 years later, he feels the atmosphere of intolerance, polarisation of communities, extreme casteism and violence has brought the nation to the brink of another period of social catastrophe.
This Saturday, with the commentary of P.K. Basant, Ghosh sings songs from various sources, starting with Amir Khusrau and continuing through Kabir and Nanak, Tansen, Bulle Shah, the Bauls and more contemporary voices such as Nasir Kazmi (whose verses are immortalised in Habib Tanvir’s play Agra Bazar), the poets of the anti-imperialist struggle and Tagore.
“We are in a very adverse situation of communal tension. I am trying to revive this feature.” People may disagree with the views of the musical feature’s creators, but they cannot deny that “this is history. These were people who were loved and who loved India,” says Ghosh.
The format is flexible. Ghosh will be accompanied by young musicians. The languages are many — “I am trying to learn Punjabi, Persian,” he mentions — and in the past he has included poets dear to the different regions where he performed. In Nagpur, for instance, his audience asked for Sant Tukaram.
“We apologise we have not been able to include all the poets who have contributed to the secular fabric, otherwise we would have to spend the whole night.” They all represent people who were “rebels” against the inhuman practices that divide and lead to violence, and they were above caste and religious differences, which is why they were “more human and that’s why they were creative geniuses,” says the vocalist, who has set the verses to musical formats like shabad, qawwali, folk and classical.

The performance, “Secular Traditions in Hindustani Poetry and Music”, takes place May 3, Arpana Caur’s Art Gallery, Academy of Fine Arts & Literature 4/6, Siri Fort Institutional Area, New Delhi, 5 p.m. Phone: 011 2649 8070

Sound of the soil
","Music composer Deva, who is widely known as the ambassador of ‘Gaana paatu’ in Tamil cinema, asks how much time a person would take if he were to walk from Srinivasa Puram to Mayor Ramanathan Chettiar Centre (MRC Nagar) situated along the Chennai’s coast. “Will it take 10 minutes?” Deva asks rhetorically and adds, “Yet, it took me 20 years to make the elite enjoy my songs in their weddings.”
After a brief hiatus of four years during which he mainly stuck to writing devotional music, Deva’s voice was recently being heard everywhere, thanks to composer Anirudh Ravichander, who made him sing ‘Open The Tasmac’ in Maan Karate. “The fact that even young audiences are appreciating my work has re-energised me.”
It was just the breakthrough that he needed to once again get into the thick of the action. Now, he is ready with the album of Dummy Tapasu, which is directed by newcomer, Ravi. 
What made him comeback to mainstream movies again? “Ravi narrated an impressive subject, which is a love story set in the slums of Chennai. The situations that he came up with challenged me intellectually: a mother crooning a lullaby and an 80-year-old man singing about his life-experiences. I couldn’t say no to such challenges,” says Deva.  
When Deva ruled the charts , he specialised in ‘Gaana’. How does he plan to stay relevant in today’s music industry when every other composer includes one ‘Gaana’ song in the album? “The industry is today dominated by tech-savvy youngsters and one needs to be aware of modern sounds. I would like to work with fresh voices and experiment in my second innings.”
Looking back, does he feel that ‘Gaana’ artistes have found acceptance? “This genre was always popular with the people, but nobody wanted to feature it in films. I did it because I have grown up listening to such songs. I felt that they needed a bigger audience. I am especially impressed with the lyrics that people like Gaana Bala are writing today. When I did it, there were many who thought that it was too crass. But, the audiences have embraced it now.”
As a mark of recognition, perhaps for having been instrumental in popularising Gaana, he has recently been appointed the chairman of Iyal, Isai, Nadaka Mandram by the Government of Tamil Nadu.
“My mandate is to popularise the traditional arts of Tamil Nadu. It’s keeping me busy,” he says.
Does he feel confident that he can compete with youngsters who are exposed and plugged into music from around the world?
“I have become tech-savvy. I hope to do a few things differently than before. And I am ready to fight it out.”

A digital take
","Digital cinematography is the future of film making, says cinematographer C.J. Rajkumar, known for his work in acclaimed short film Aayeesha, Janaki Vishwanathan’s Kanavu Meippada Vendum and Gnana Rajasekaran’s Periyar. “Film cameras have become obsolete and the recent shutting down of Prasad Film Laboratories only proves it. With the fading away of celluloid film projection in theatres, going digital seems inevitable. Now, almost every film is shot digitally. Imtiaz Ali’s Highway was shot on a Sony F 65. A.R. Murugadoss’s Thuppakki was made with Arri Alexa digital cameras,” he says.
Rajkumar has written Pixel, a book in Tamil, on digital cinematography. It throws light on how cinematography and cinema have evolved with the times. The book, released recently, documents the history of digital cinematography and gives detailed descriptions of cameras, from DSLRs, Canon cinema E.O.S. cameras, Red cinema cameras, Arri Alexa series and Sony cine alta digital motion picture cameras to black magic cinema cameras and lenses. The 21 chapters in the book also cover the topics of data management, editing, post-production, digital colouring and details of cinema cloud computing.
“The book is a guide for beginners as well as cinematographers. I have shared my on-field experience of over a decade in the industry. I have used almost 90 per cent of the cameras described in the book,” he says.
Rajkumar says data management is important in digital cinematography. “Saving high resolution digital images is always a problem. I discuss software that helps one compress them in low-res format for editing. The changes can be recaptured and aligned with the original images,” he explains.
The book has earned appreciation from veterans in the film industry, including Kamal Haasan, late director Balu Mahendra, Mahendran and cinematographer P.C. Sreeram. Balu Mahendra had included Pixel as a part of the cinematography syllabus in his film school. “Their feedback has been encouraging,” Rajkumar recalls.
The author has also worked in films such as Mann, Asthamanam, and Panithuli. His short film En Veettin Mutrathil Oru Maamaram was selected in the competition section at the 59th Berlin International film festival. The Backwaters, another short film in Malayalam, was screened at many international film festivals.
Talking about the origin of digital cinema in India, Rajkumar gives examples from the Tamil film industry. “There have been experimental ventures such as P.C. Sreeram’s Vaanam Vasappadum, Kamal Haasan’s Mumbai Express and S.A. Chandrasekhar’s Mutham. But, it was success of films such as Thavamaai Thavamirindhu and Unnaipol Oruvan (shot in Red digital cameras) that made filmmakers take digital film making seriously.”
Rajkumar lists some of the must-watch digital feature films in the book. He says that 5D Mark II and III cameras are a boon to small budget film makers. Films such as Ballpen (Kannada), Vazhakku Enn 18/9 and Madhubaanakadai have been shot using these. “The market is flooded with thousands of digital cameras. The challenge for a cinematographer is to choose the right camera for the right script.”

The book, designed by Kalaikuviyal, and published by Discovery Book Palace is available at bookstores. Call: 044-65157525 for details.

Rushes: Carpet Carnival
","Deepika Padukone not only won awards for her acting but also won the nod of the fashionistas when she turned up in a red sheer and appliqué gown designed by Zuhair Murad. The lace work added to the subtle charm. Sridevi was equally graceful in an Oscar de Lenta black gown. Priyanka Chopra looked stylish in a Monique Lhuillier outfit with smoky eyes. Kareena Kapoor turned up in a stunning black Armani gown. The plunging neckline could have created trouble but Kareena carried it off with grace. However, Sonakshi Sinha overdid it in an Aamit Agrawal outfit which accentuated her curves.
The usually dependable Bipasha Basu and Malaika Arora didn’t add anything to their reputation as they played safe with black in Rocky S and Shivam and Naresh creations. Among the second line, Dia Mirza picked the ever reliable Sabyasachi Mukherjee’s full sleeved sequined pink gown that made a loud understatement. Nimrat Kaur impressed with her traditional Vikram Phadnis sari and mang tika, newbie Vaani Kapoor dared to bare in a Rakesh Agrawal gown and Kalki Koechlin looked statuesque in a Gaurav Gupta creation. However, Parineeti Chopra baffled with her outlandish choices. So did Richa Chadda and Monali Thakur.

Modi Effect

The impact of Narendra Modi could be felt in Tampa as well. Anjani Pandey, a local of Indian origin who came to watch the IIFA event, said that Smriti Irani and Tarun Vijay have already visited the county months before the election, and if he is to be believed, they made the participants speak to BJP’s Prime Ministerial candidate as well. Tampa has about 35,000 residents of Indian origin and many of them are Patels from Gujarat. So it was not a slip of tongue when Shatrughan Sinha declared from the stage that India should vote for a candidate who is courageous and a man of conviction. A seasoned Hindi film critic commented that Tampa is also suffering from Modiabind (an alliteration of motiabind which means cataract) and Namonia .

The Young Guns

Siddharth Malhotra turned out to be the best known young male actor at the event. Every time his face was splashed on the big screen, the crowd roared in unison. Besides him, such enthusiasm was shown only for Hrithik Roshan and Ranveer Singh. It came as a surprise for the media because Siddharth is just two films old and his performance at the event lacked energy. One actor who was eager to be seen was Gulshan Grover. He was among the first ones to be on the carpet, irrespective of its colour, and was eager to give sound bytes like “I like to party”, and when nothing worked he delivered his good old ‘bad man’ punch. Trying to be cool, he carried two pairs of sunglasses. One on the eyes and the other in the pocket!

Selfie-obsession

The selfie craze was seen at IIFA as well when co-host Shahid Kapur decided to take a selfie which included Kevin Spacey among others. Now Spacey was part of this year’s Oscar selfie as well which brought Twitter house down, but no such obsession was shown by Bollywood fans. Not to be outdone, before starting her performance with “Ek Do Teen”, Madhuri Dixit, who looked a little overweight, took a selfie with the cheering crowd. Then there was a belfie as well — where Farhan Akhtar, Shahid, Boman Irani and Govinda flaunted their derriere and Bipasha Basu clicked.

Desire, be a lady tonight

Somewhere, behind closed doors in their solitary world


Somewhere under the sheets with an indifferent lover


Somewhere is the woman who will not be denied

So reads the cover of Sita’s Curse, a poignant novel about a middle class Gujarati housewife, Meera, who chooses to defy society’s norms and makes atypical sexual and relationship choices. According to its author Sreemoyee Piu Kundu, “We have a rich repository of erotic writing in India, but it had to take something like Fifty Shades of Grey for us to wake up to it. I found that exceptionally weird. What happened to the centuries in between?”
She isn’t completely wrong. Erotica is scarcely a new phenomenon in India. There is a deeply entrenched vein of sensuality running through the Indian literary and cultural history — the Kama Sutra, the temples of Khajuraho, the verses of poet-saint Andal, Jayadeva’s Geet Govinda are ample proof. Over time, middle class morality seeped into the system and desire for the sake of desire began to be seen as an illicit pleasure. Sensuality was equated to illogical hedonism and though isolated pockets did get seduced by the sexually explicit writing of authors like Kamala Das, Ismat Chugtai, Shasti Brata and Khushwant Singh as well as the odd anthology of short stories, the audience continued to be a niche one.
Until, of course, EL James’ Fifty Shades of Grey hit the market three years ago. It wasn’t impressive — the story-line was scarcely original (Pauline Reage’s Story of O, Anne Rice’s Sleeping Beauty Triology, Leopold von Sacher-Masoch’s Venus in Furs and Marquis de Sade’s Justine have used a similar theme before and a lot better I must add), the writing was pedestrian, the plot predictable, the characters clichéd and rather limited.
Yet the book sold over 100 million copies worldwide, was translated into 52 languages, it became the fastest selling paperback and talks of a film adaptation are underway. The massive response seems to indicate that this was the first time desire had been chronicled so audaciously.
But James is only a small part of a literary tradition that includes the verses of Sappho, the diaries of Anais Nin, novels such as Lawrence’s Lady Chatterley’s Lover and John Cleland’s Memoirs of Fanny Hill, Emmanuelle Arsan’s memoirs, the poetry of Octavio Paz and Pablo Neruda and many more—timeless classics that delved deep into the various facets of human relationships including sexuality.
However, James managed to procure a far larger audience and went completely mainstream, garnering a huge response from women.
What made it so markedly different? Why did so many women choose to read this book?
“I liked the book because of the characters and how they complemented each other. I did find the sex content exciting but she could have used better language to describe it,” says Rekha Ram, a freelance writer.
Adds Nandita Aggarwal of Hachette, “I think there is a need for women to express themselves and prove that desire is not a forbidden phenomenon. Most of these stories resonate with a lot of women who feel guilty about their sensuality. Perhaps one of the reasons that Fifty Shades of Grey did so well was that it started off by being an e-book. Women are a lot less inhibited online as there is a degree of anonymity.”
And what do women derive from reading these novels?
Sreemoyee says, “The aim of erotica is not a heightened sense of arousal but of consciousness. It is about understanding your body, your desires, your passions, your sexuality and knowing that it is okay to go after it.”
It goes beyond gender dimorphism because as Sreemoyee puts it, “Sex offers a beautiful sameness as two bodies and two souls coalesce. I want Sita’s Curse to be the beginning of a dialogue in which we can voice our needs without fear of being criticised, isolated and banished.”

Of children and wild berries
","“My first inspiration for Kaphal was a friend’s child,” says Mumbai-based filmmaker Batul Mukhtiar. “The child’s father works in another city and visits occasionally. Once, when the father would not allow him to see a particular movie, the child asked his mother when the father would go back!”

Kaphal – Wild Berries has won the National Award for Best Children’s Film, and Batul is a relaxed person today. Working on a script with cinematographer husband Vivek Shah, she says she would like to shoot soon but that the award has not really translated into any pressure to perform. Kaphal won the Golden Elephant for Best Director at the 18th International Children’s Film Festival India and the Swarna Kamal for Best Children’s Film at the 61st National Film Awards India.
On the contrary, she says that the award “feels like a validation of the long struggle to tell the stories I want to tell. And a validation of the extremely difficult shoot that Kaphal was, and all the hard work that every single person in the cast and crew put into the film, for very little money.”
The film tells the story of two boys whose father returns home after living in the city for five years. The boys suddenly have to handle a father — contend with no gifts but abide by all his rules. They hatch a plan to send him back to the city, but who said plans go according to plan?
“The difficulties of a long-distance relationship are compounded in extreme situations like a Garhwal village, which are not easily accessible by phone, where life is hard anyway, and where the absence of livelihoods leaves people with no choice but to leave home,” says Batul.
Why did she pick such a region-specific name for her film? “A lot of people don’t know what kaphal means. So before they see the film, they are curious. But after they see the film, they understand,” she says. Asked how conducive the environment was while filming, Batul says, “I have known some people from the village in which we shot for over 25 years. Also, we made an effort to employ as many villagers as we could during production. So we received a lot of co-operation and support while shooting. Without this, it would have been impossible to work there, given the difficulties of terrain, weather and lack of infrastructure.”
Also, since the children starring in the film are all from the region, the villagers are proud of the acclaim the film and the children have received. In fact, the decision to cast local children in leading roles has created just the right impact. “The location plays a very important role. The terrain is very difficult, and I wanted the children to run all over the hills, like I had seen local children do. I could not risk asking city children to do this.”
Talking about the Children’s Film Society of India, she says, “I think the CFSI is an organisation that we should all be proud of, one of the rare government institutes in the world that makes films for children.” CFSI has the budget to make three to four films a year, and has over 250 films in its archives. Unfortunately, it does not have the infrastructure to market these films. These films are viewed only during festivals, special screenings or on DVD. Says Batul: “It is still very difficult to market children’s films in India, because exhibitors and distributors have a preconceived notion of what children will like. But if you visit the International Children’s Film Festival of India, you’ld see thousands of children with no prior exposure to world cinema enjoying all kinds of films, even those with subtitles. It’s a pity that our children do not get the opportunity to see local content more easily.”

'We'll learn on the job'
","Ask him what bugs him most these days and pat comes the reply, “Everyone seems to have only one question nowadays for me. I can’t understand the question, ‘Are you prepared?’ How can anyone be prepared for fatherhood or anything else as momentous as that?” What? He doesn’t get irked with people asking him about why he has only one film at hand? “That’s secondary. People are more interested in knowing how prepared I am to handle being THE PAPA!” he laughs.
Avantika, Imran's wife, is expected to deliver their first child in June. “We’ll learn on the job. A baby’s coming into our life and we’ve had some practice of being human now. So how difficult can that get? For things that we can’t handle and will eventually know how to handle there's no reason to get all stressed out,” he says, elaborating on his approach to fatherhood. Imran is possibly the first and only actor who decided to proclaim last month that he was officially on paternity leave. On the work front, the actor who was once very enthusiastic about Vikramaditya Motwane’s Bhavesh Joshi, has since opted out and has reportedly been replaced by Sidharth Malhotra (
Student Of The Year, Hasee Toh Phasee). “When I heard Sidharth was doing the film, I thought that was great. I still feel it’s going to be a fabulous movie. I opted out due to some reasons. Vikramaditya and I are not at war because of it. But I don’t want to disrespect our ethics by talking about what happened and why,” he says. Imran has signed Nikhil Advani’s upcoming film, reportedly on the lines of Delhi Belly.
Remind him of the ease with which he essayed that character, and he says, “It was the easiest role of my life. I was being me! That humour — sometimes deadpan, sometimes gawky — is totally me,” he says. Imran will begin work on the movie in mid-July. Ileana D’Cruz is expected to be cast opposite him.

Tall, dark, handsome and asleep
","With Naan Sigappu Manithan (NSM), Vishal has dozed his way into the box office. Few would have expected a film about a man with a sleeping disorder and zero heroics to strike a chord with people. But it did, and Vishal says he was confident about the script. The film has given him the best exposure after Bala’s Avan Ivan, for which he sported a painful squint through the film.
 “I could not relate to the character of Indran, the timid hero of NSM; but I realised it would be a challenge to be accepted in that role. I did not want to go back to the safe track,” says Vishal, whose film is still running to packed houses. “I decided to do what Indran would do, not what Vishal could do. I had to convey the innocence of a typical middle-class boy and his body language.”
Vishal admits he did wonder if he should experiment or fall back on the commercial mould after the success of Pandiya Naadu, but Thiru’s script bowled him over. “That film gave me the confidence to take up projects with a solid kernel but made in the commercial format,” he shares.
“Gut instinct overrules everything else in my life. Once I take a decision, I don’t listen to even family,” says Vishal. This instinct saw him sign up with hit-maker Hari for his next production, Poojai. Hisco-star in the film is Shruti Haasan. “People will be surprised by this film. It is not a mindless action film, but a nice family entertainer. It’s great to team up with Hari after our successful Thamirabharani.”
After a string of hits and some misses, Vishal admits that one can’t always make the right choice. “We are not astrologists; no one can predict how a project will pan out. But we give every film our best shot.” The actor says that after the producer, the leading man has the biggest responsibility to ensure a film does well.” Vishal, as the lead, had to take that role seriously when Thimiru was not shaping up well; he stepped in to co-direct the film. But for that, this VisCom graduate has always liked to surrender to the director’s vision. “When you are putty in the hand of a director who knows what he’s doing, it’s better for you as an actor. The film also turns out well,” he says.
In all these years, Vishal has played a range of roles — from lover boy and angry young man to an effeminate lead and a man fighting personal demons. But he’s never played the anti-hero. “That’s one thing I hope to see myself doing,” he says.
He’s also done an interesting role in Sunder C’s caper Madha Gaja Raja (
MGR), which has been lying in the cans for a long time now. “The release date is still not clear but I’ve full faith in the product. It’s a film that will stay fresh whether it releases next month or next year,” he says.
The last two years have seen Vishal double as producer. His Vishal Film Factory (VFF) was born when he had to start Pandiya Naadu. “I did not want to take a risk with another project; I was scarred by the experience with Samar and MGR. It was a decision that was forced upon me.”
He straddles both roles effortlessly. “When I shoot, I stay an actor, and as a producer I invest a lot of time in pre-production work. And in the last two weeks preceding a film’s release, I hardly sleep.” Now, VFF is looking to make movies with other heroes. “I’m listening to some scripts,” says Vishal.
Despite some bad experiences, Vishal says every film is a leap of faith, in the script and the director. It is this faith that has seen him star in a slew of multi-starrers. Has he ever felt threatened? “All my friends are non-egoistic actors. We all keep our profession away from our friendship,” he says. Great friends with actors Arya (Jammy), Jiiva, Vikrant, Vishnu, Vinay Rai, Shanthanoo, Jayam Ravi, Siddharth, they hang out together whenever possible, he says, doing things guys their age normally do. “It’s a riot when we meet. It’s lovely that we bond as individuals, not as stars with hang-ups.”
Even now, Vishal smiles thinking of the early rejections he faced. People said he was not ‘hero’ material. It has been some turnaround, as his name is now almost synonymous with ‘tall, dark and handsome’. “I never let rejection affect me. I don’t allow adulation get to me either. I stay myself,” he says.

'Characters are more important than actors’
","For director Nagraj Manjule, winning national awards is nothing new. His first short film Pistulya too won the national award for Best Debut in the short film category. Now, Manjule has won the National Award for Best Debut for Director for Fandry. And not just the national award, Fandry has won the Grand Jury Prize in the Mumbai International Film Festival, The Best Indian Film of Year 2013 awarded by the International Federation of Film Critics, as well as Best Film, Best Film (Audience), Best Director, Best Cinematography, and Best Actor awards at the Pune International Film Festival. Nagraj Manjule talks about his approach to cinema, his childhood, politics, and why caste is the centre point of his creations.

Congratulations on your second national award. How important is this award to you?

Thank you. It’s not just me; Somnath Awaghade has won the Best Child Artist award as well and that makes me happier. I value the National Awards above all and, given the kind of reception the film received, both from critics and viewers, I was hoping to do well. The awards are as important as the people watching your film. After all, we make films for people to watch. And winning a national award makes people realise the importance of that film.

You have been travelling a lot, taking Fandry to different festivals. How was the response overseas?

I had just returned from the U.S. I had to cut the tour short for the National Awards, but the film was appreciated at the Los Angeles Film Festival. I was invited to several universities as well. For them, the Indian cinema is largely about Bollywood, about song and dance. Fandry was a different experience; especially the fact that casteism is still deep-rooted and dominant in today’s India shocked them. We would have detailed discussions on issues ranging from Dr. Ambedkar to Indian cinema. It was a great experience. I also met Karen Tenkhoff, the producer of The Motorcycle Diaries, who loved Fandry and said she would love to work with me.

Is Fandry’s story based on your childhood?

Fandry is a coming-of-age story about Jabya, a boy belonging to the Kaikadi community. His family survives by doing petty jobs in the village and also has the extra responsibility of catching the pigs in the village. I was born in the Wadar community in Solapur’s Karmala area. Our profession was to break stones. Though my father never caught pigs, we were actually expected to do that. As a schoolboy, I was ashamed of this reality. Fandry is the word used for pigs in my village and they used to commonly call us too by the same name. Nobody saw anything wrong in this. It was an insult to me, but I had no idea why it was me who was suffering. As a student, my caste was imprinted on me even in school.

And the girl you fell in love with at school?


How did you turn to cinema?

I have done many jobs. I joined the police after school. I went on to become a watchman, worked in general stores, in a telephone booth. I did all this for money while studying. After my M.A. in Marathi, a friend told me about a Mass Communication course. I love telling stories. One of my friends, a faculty member, asked me to sign up. My main attraction was the possibility of a chance to make a short film and tell my story.
I did that through Pistulya and that gave me my first National award. It reinforced my belief that I could tell stories in a way that people would like. I wanted to express myself; this is one of my needs. Not just films; I write poems and draw pictures too. I have realised that I can’t live without this.

Are you inspired by any particular director?

Not really. My introduction to foreign language films was five years ago. I grew up on typical masala films, which all of us like. Idolising a particular person is like following a big truck blindly. Your chances of landing in a pothole increase a lot. I prefer to tell my stories in my way.

Why did you choose untrained actors for your film?

I did it purposely. People always follow actors; I follow characters. According to me, a film’s characters are more important than the actors. For any film, its characters have to be strong. People like Amitabh Bachchan are great actors, but if the role isn’t strong enough what can they do?

Why did you pick caste as the theme for both your first films?

Caste is the reality of our society. Those who don’t suffer the discrimination feel there is no casteism. Just because the middle class thinks that casteism has vanished doesn’t make it a reality. Take the very simple example of marriage. Does a Brahmin groom voluntarily look for a Dalit bride? Caste has become a part of our routine life. Look around you, check among your friends and close circles. I have not tried to profess anything in the film; I only wanted to show the reality.

In an industry where people are hesitant to take a stand on any issue, don’t you think you will be sidelined for your strong views?

Being an Ambedkarite is an honour and there is nothing wrong in it, nothing to hide. He professed the ideology of equality; and was not for any particular caste. He showed the way that every progressive person would like to follow. What’s wrong in following him? I am really not bothered about being sidelined. I was never on the centre stage so how can I be sidelined?
I don’t have high aspirations of being part of the glamour world or the talk-of-the-town. I want to tell my stories to people in my own way. I have my friends, who will be with me in future. I am happy with them.

Many think that Fandry’s end supports violence. What do you think?

If you think that a small boy throwing stones amounts to violence, how do you evaluate society’s treatment of that boy and his family before that? Wasn’t that violence? As a society, we have the habit of calling any retaliation by the oppressed section as violence. We conveniently ignore the oppression and choose to see it as a way of life.

After two national awards, audiences are expecting a lot from you. Do you feel the pressure?

As a society, we love worshipping. People often tell me that they expect greater work from me in future. I counter them; because I hate it when someone calls me great. I am a human being. I also deserve a chance at committing a mistake.

Winning tunes
","Two ex-lovers relive their teenage love story during a bus journey through picturesque Sri Lankan countryside. That is the story of the music album Thaen Sindhum Pookal.
It won Best Music Video Album at the recently concluded 5th Norway Tamil Film Festival. And, music director M. Rajesh, who also sang in the album, is elated. “This is the first international recognition for our team,” he says.
“Director T. Piriyanathan worked as a cameraman for weddings before making the album. He has captured stunning visuals of Sri Lanka. The actors, the cinematographer and choreographer, all of them from Sri Lanka, have contributed immensely towards the album’s success,” he says.
Rajesh has been a part of the music industry for six years now. He has composed music for over 15 short films, telefilms and a number of jingles.
He has also composed a folk melody for the yet-to-be released film, Vadakkum Therkkum. The award-winning song is a classical number with Western beats.
“It was originally composed for an audio album Kadhalir Dhinam that was released in Switzerland. Later, a team from Sri Lanka chose to shoot a video, and here we have an international honour,” he smiles.
The album, released on YouTube in January, has been viewed over 16,000 times and garnered many likes.
The lyrics have been penned by award-winning writer S.V.R. Phamini.

Outtakes: Guy Maddin
","WHO is he?
Canadian artist, filmmaker, writer, scenarist, cinematographer and film editor who has directed 10 feature films and close to 50 short-length films since the mid-eighties. Maddin is among the most celebrated Canadian filmmakers of today alongside David Cronenberg and Atom Egoyan. His recent cinema straddles the realms of installation art and conventional film production.

What are his films about?


Themes


Style


WHY is he of interest?
Maddin’s films are some of the earliest examples of a truly post-modern cinema, not only in the way they rework traditional forms to comment on them, but also forge a new vision out of such cinematic cross-referencing. While purists may object to Maddin’s ironic appropriation of silent cinema aesthetic as being too clever for its own good, the anachronistic elements within these films are a sort of evidence that Maddin intends to mould these appropriated elements into an idiosyncratic novelty.

WHERE to discover him?
Just six minutes in length, the explosive The Heart of the World (2005) comes across as a perfect distillation of the key themes and style of Maddin’s cinema. Cut to a pulsating score, the film follows a scientist, Anna, who saves the world from a certain ‘heart attack’. The Heart of the World is made in the vein of early Soviet propaganda films, with their intense formalism and ideological rigidity intact, while at the same time commenting upon the psycho-sexual bases of those films. Maddin’s film, as it were, is a post-modern commentary on modernism.

Punjab Kesari 1938
","Te. Po. Krishnaswamy Pavalar was a Tamil scholar and playwright of the early decades of the 20th century. He wrote plays about the Indian freedom movement and for the upliftment of Tamil culture. One of his Tamil plays, Khadarin Vetri (Victory of Khadhi Carter), with the Indian freedom movement as its theme was staged with success in faraway London in 1923 and was well received by even Britishers! His other play Pathi Bhakthi was also filmed and its rehash came out as a cult hit film Sathi Leelavathi (1936). It also introduced many new talents to Tamil cinema, such as S.S. Vasan (as writer), Ellis R. Dugan (director), M.K. Radha, T.S. Balaiah, N.S. Krishnan and last but not the least, M.G. Ramachandran in his movie debut as a police inspector.
One of his plays in Tamil was Punjab Kesari (The Lion of Punjab) which was successfully staged all over the Tamil-speaking areas of the old Madras Presidency and also neighbouring nations like Ceylon, Malaya (now Singapore and Malaysia), Burma.
It is a matter of regret that today he has been forgotten. However, for the tricolour portrait of his by the famed artiste and painter K. Madhavan commissioned by MGR, the world would not have known how this great scholar and patriot even looked like! Punjab Kesari also garnered much fame and name during the 1930s. Interestingly the title bears an allegorical reference to one of the forgotten leaders of the Indian Freedom Movement Lala Lajpat Rai, known as “The Lion of Punjab”.
 With the success of the play, Punjab Kesari was made into a Tamil movie in 1938 with K.P. Kesavan who played the title role. An import from Tamil theatre Kesavan was quite popular during the early years of Tamil cinema. A rationalist and an agnostic he did not believe in playing roles in films of Hindu mythology or ones containing superstitious elements and illogical happenings. He opted out of such films which sadly cost him his career and he faded from public memory. Today only old-timers and film and theatre historians remember him. Later, Kesavan acted in a social film Iru Sahotharargal directed by Ellis R. Dungan.
 
Punjab Kesari (1938) had a conventional hero in the film, which was played by the popular stage actor then making his way into Tamil cinema, P.U. Chinnappa who soon rose to become one of the top singing stars of the1940s. The movie was directed by a Bombay-based Parsi filmmaker then active in Tamil Cinema, Frem Sethna. However, the movie met with only limited success.
 The screen story of Punjab Kesari is long, full of twists and turns and somewhat predictable. It is about a freedom loving man named Punjab Kesari (Kesavan), a detective, and his assistant (Kali N. Ratnam) who calls himself by an unusual name ‘Karapaanpoochi’ (cockroach). Sundaranathan (Chinnappa) is a young man in love with a young woman Padmabai (Rajalakshmi), the daughter of a rich man Somanathan Prabhu (H. H. Sarma). The rich man decides to get his daughter married to the young man but there is a villain, (Perumal) who covets her and her wealth, with a gang behind him. They kill the rich man and foist the murder on the hero. He goes to prison, and a kind doctor (Kannan) engages the detective Punjab Kesari to find out the truth. Punjab Kesari and his assistant unmask the killer and the truth. Sundaranathan and Padmabai marry and live happily.
 The film opens with a song, ‘Vande Matharam’  and Tamilians are urged to participate in the freedom struggle. Interestingly there is a Carnatic music composition of Saint Thyagaraja ‘Tholi nenu chesina pooja palamu’ sung by the heroine, Rajalakshmi.
The film was produced at the National Movietone Studio in Kilpauk, Madras, where today the famous Seetha Kingston School is situated. It was produced by Star Films. In spite of the interesting story line and popular actors of the day film, the film was only a reasonable success.

Remembered for: The storyline and impressive performances by the cast.

Nee Enge En Anbe: Lost in the retelling
","How does one describe atmosphere in the context of cinema? To call it the very air that the movie needs to breathe would not be an exaggeration — but that’s too unspecific. Atmosphere is in the cinematography, which adds tone and texture to the happenings. It’s in the music, which percolates from one scene to the next and glues them together, even if they occur in different locations. It’s sometimes in the staging, the way the shots are set up, the way the interiors and exteriors are brought to life, so that the film feels like an organic whole, from start to finish.
Without atmosphere, a movie is just a collection of scenes that fit oddly, like misshapen jigsaw pieces. We may be able to get a sense of the whole puzzle, but only in our heads. We sense what could have been. What we see, though, is someone labouring to make the pieces fit. It isn’t pretty.
What Nee Enge En Anbe could have been is a solid reimagining of Sujoy Ghosh’s intensely atmospheric Kahaani, rejigged for the Tamil audience (or at least director Sekhar Kammula’s estimation of the sensibilities of the Tamil audience). The story is more or less the same. A young NRI returns to India in search of her missing husband. The major difference is that in the Hindi original, the heroine was pregnant, a development that instantly drew us to her plight and, at the end, resulted in a memorably pulpy twist.
But we cannot have a Tamil film based on a pregnant heroine (her name is Anamika), especially if she’s played by a glamorous star like Nayantara, who can’t even part with her fake eyelashes. (In some close-ups, it appears as if a lavishly plumaged bird has come to roost in the outer reaches of her eyes.) How, now, will she earn our sympathies?
So the director cooks up a series of utterly conventional damsel-in-distress scenarios. When Anamika takes her complaint to the police station, she’s told, rudely, that her husband has probably run away. Later, she is propositioned by a lecherous senior cop.
The peril of being female and alone in India is a terrific subject for a movie — but Nee Enge En Anbe is not that movie. It is a police procedural wrapped in a vigilante thriller, with mysterious hard disks and a soft-spoken assassin on the loose. Kahaani wisely folded its feminist inquiries into the subtext. When these layers are made the text, we get a movie that’s stranded awkwardly between ideas and action.
The revelations are dispensed with in lumps of ugly exposition. The twist ending is not built up to — when we look back at what happened, it doesn’t really add up. The chases are badly staged. There are many unintentional laughs, particularly from the ineptness with which a beehive is written into the script. And when a great tragedy occurs, we are manipulated in the cheapest possible manner, with a little boy placed at the centre.
Still, some of this could have been salvaged had there been an iota of atmosphere, which can sometimes be manifest even in the way the characters are shaped. The assassin in Kahaani was introduced to us as a boring life insurance agent used to being screamed at by a much younger boss. Then, this man, whom we dismissed as a baby-faced loser, surprised us by whipping out a gun and offing a series of innocents.
In Nee Enge En Anbe, the man has no shading, no alternate life. He’s just a killer who comes out of nowhere. It may be difficult to explain atmosphere in the context of cinema, but it’s easy to detect the lack of it. Why go about fixing something that ain’t broke?

Genre: Procedural, plus vigilante thriller

Director: Sekhar Kammula

Cast: Nayantara, Pasupathi, Vaibhav

Storyline: A young NRI returns to India to search for her missing husband

Bottomline: An unsuccessful attempt to transpose a multiplex Hindi hit into a more generic Tamil-audience-friendly movie

Puraani Jeans: Puraane scenes
","The idea was to use Puraani Jeans as a simile but they’ve ended up with a metaphor.
If the makers wanted to say that friendship is like old jeans (the longer it lasts, the more comfortable you get), they have ended up making a film with a worn-out plot, a story full of holes, faded stars at their career worst, treatment that went out of fashion a couple of decades ago and an overall dullness in the way it looks.
How do you establish friendship in a Hindi film? Well, the bunch of friends need to sing a song together that includes all of them jumping into a lake. Rang De Basanti, Rock On, Kai Po Che…
What keeps the gang of friends together? Their love for music, they have to be part of a band, one has to be the poet and the other the showman. Kabhi Haan Kabhi Naa, Rock On, Pyaar Main Kabhi Kabhi…
What leads to a rift and heartbreak? The girl in the triangular love story, of course. Saagar, Kabhi Haan Kabhi Naa, Saajan…
The only thing that can make these worn-out clichés worse is how it plays out — the direction is noteworthy for the fact that it makes not just the new actors but even veterans including Sarika and Rajit Kapur look like amateurs (Both of them play it loud, looking completely uninterested).
While Aditya Seal looks like the love child of Neil Nitin Mukesh and Akshaye Khanna (with the acting chops of the former and the permanent pout-face of the latter), Tanuj Virwani is Ashmit Patel and Suniel Shetty rolled into one (with the looks of the former and the acting chops of the latter). Isabelle Leite looks every bit the Katrina Kaif successor — foreigner with a presence so electric that it doesn’t matter that she cannot act.
Fast music, lines said in a hurry, and energy in screaming ‘Friends Forever’ every few minutes do not translate into pace.
The film takes half its running time to get to the point of the predictable heartbreak. It goes further downhill post-interval, with very little left to find out.
But the only thing we want to know is this: Why would the makers rehash scenes done so many times and way much better before?
And the craft just tells us one thing: Puraani Jeans, your fly is open.

Genre: Drama

Director: Tanushri Chattrji Bassu

Cast: Tanuj Virwani, Aditya Seal, Isabelle Leite, Sarika, Rati Agnihotri, Rajit Kapur

Storyline: A bunch of friends, a love triangle and the inevitable heartbreak

Bottomline: Jeans so low that you can see the crack. Look away.

The Amazing Spider-Man 2: Swing low, sweet Spiderman
","The success of the superhero formula—both in comics and on film—rests on the utterly fantastic premise of the hero’s invincibility. Freakishly evil enemies may be plotting to undo them in diabolical ways, but it’s an immutable law of this genre that the hero, untainted by the faintest wisp of self-doubt, always triumphs. Tinker with that elemental simplicity, and you mess with the minds of our caped superheroes and show them up to be all too fallible. Like the rest of us lesser mortals, in fact.
In the latest edition of the Spider-Man franchise, The Amazing Spider-Man 2, director Marc Webb advances that cardinal error—so manifest in a few earlier outings too—and ‘humanises’ the masked do-gooder to the point where, for all his superhero swagger, he effectively stands de-iconised and perhaps in serious need of psychological counselling to redress his existential, schizoid, arachnid angst.
Worse, Webb overreaches himself and packs in way too many sub-plots and villainous characters, so that he becomes hopelessly ensnared in the elaborate web of his own narrative. The plotline, at its simplest, would have sustained sufficient interest. Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) relishes his Spider-Man call of duty, but it’s murder on his relationship with Gwen Stacy (an adorable Emma Stone). Added to which, he’s anxious to unearth the back story of why his parents abandoned him as a child.
These and other strands — including the re-entry into Parker’s life of old friend-turned-foe Harry Osborn (Dane DeHaan) and the advent of new ‘friend’ Max Dillon (a sub-par performance by Jamie Foxx) who, after an encounter with electric eels (I’ll say no more), metamorphoses into the villainous, ‘power-hungry’ Electro — bind Parker fatefully to Oscorp Industries, the evil corporate empire.
But Webb’s treatment of that plotline doesn’t quite have the tautness and tensile strength of, say, Spidey’s web. Perhaps some of this is born of the nature of the medium: whereas comic books lend themselves to episodic treatment where the narrative can (and does oftentimes) stretch for years, Webb has to condense them into two-hours-plus of non-stop action. But because he over-ambitiously appears to have gone all in, the appeal is less than spectacular.
Which is a pity, because The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is in many ways a lavish and technically splendid production. The CGI special effects are so stunningly real that when Spider-Man leans over a skyscraper ledge or swings through Manhattan, you feel vicariously vertiginous. And the scene in which Electro blacks out Times Square is masterful in milking its mayhem quotient. And although Webb occasionally takes permissible liberties with the plotline, he remains faithful to the comic book effect, right down to Spider-Man’s classical bug-eye contours.
But while there’s enough and more in the film to keep confirmed Spidey fanboys gushing with adoration, it is unlikely to net a new following.
In the final analysis, it may not be Spider-Man, torn though he is by searing internal conflicts, who needs counselling. It’s the franchise itself that needs to be put on the couch.

Genre: Superhero action

Director: Marc Webb

Cast: Andrew Garfield, Emma Stone, Jamie Foxx, Dane DeHaan, Sally Field

Storyline: Spider-Man battles the baddies, goes through more existential angst, and proves that even superheroes have limits

Bottomline: By humanising Spidey overmuch, they’re killing his superhero soul

Un Samayal Araiyil: Ilaiyaraaja at his best
","
What it is about…

Prakashraj Productions’ Un Samayal Araiyil is the remake of the Malayalam hit Salt N’ Pepper. The cast includes Prakash Raj, Sneha, Tejus, Samyuktha, Thambi Ramaiah, Oorvasi, Aiswarya and Kumaravel. Preetha is the cinematographer. The music is composed by Ilaiyaraaja and the lyrics are by Pazhani Bharathi. The dances are choreographed by Pony Verma. The audio was released by Ilaiyaraaja and received by the whole unit of the film.

What they say…


Producer, director and hero Prakash Raj: Directing is a creative job and I am happy to do it. As I am directing only one film at a time, I am relaxed. I am blessed to work with maestro Ilaiyaraaja for the second time; our first film together was Dhoni. The maestro has given me some wonderful tunes.

Music director Ilaiyaraaja: Prakash wanted a song that would have all things associated with the kitchen. We sat down to write the lines for it. Usually, when I leave the recording theatre I forget music and try to concentrate on other things. But for the first time, I was thinking only about the song. The very next day, when I was having a bath, the line flashed through my mind. I immediately rushed to the studio, called Prakash and told him about it. He said that was what he needed and used it as the opening line of the song, ‘Intha Porapputhan’.

Music Highlights: There are four songs in the album and one could feel the maestro’s enthusiasm in each. The last one, ‘Kaatru Veliyil’, sung by Ilaiyaraaja, is the best. ‘Intha Porapputhan’ sung by Kailash Kher is an interesting track about what one craves for in life. Pazhani Bharathi’s lines for the song are striking. ‘Eeramai Eeramai’, sung by Ranjit and Vibhavari, is attractive, while ‘TherindhoTheriyamalo’ sung by Karthik and Ramya is another melody that has the distinct stamp of Ilaiyaraaja.

Vallavanukku Pullum Aayudham: Strong lyrics, beautiful singing
","
What it is about

P.V.P.Cinema and Handmade films Production jointly comes out with “Vallavanukku Pullum Aayudham” presented by Pearl V.Potluri and produced by Param V.Potluri and directed by Srinath. The film is a remake of Telugu super hit movie “Mariyada Ramanna”. The audio was released by the director of the Telugu movie S.S.Rajamouli and was received by Santhanam and his unit. The cast includes Santhanam, Ashna Zaveri, Nagineedu, Mirchi Senthil, VTV Ganesh, and Rajakumaran (husband of actor Devayani). The director of photography is Shakthi and Richard M.Nathan, music is scored by Siddarth Vipin, edited by Saikanth, dances are choreographed by Rajesh Kanna and stunts are composed by FEFSI Vijayan and Dilip Subburayan and the art is taken care of by A.R.Mohan. How a young man runs from pillar to post staying in the same house of the people who wants to kill him forms the base of the story line.

What they say


Producer Param V.Potluri: We were having the rights of the Telugu super doper hit movie “Mariyada Ramanna” for nearly two years. We wanted Santhanam to do the lead role in the film but he was busy as usual. We did not want some other actor to do the heroes role in Tamil except Santhanam. So we waited and some months ago I met him again and asked him to act in the Tamil version of the Telugu film. He immediately said ‘yes’. That is how this film became a reality. Now that the film has been finished we are happy that it has come out well.

Director Srinath: I and actor Santhanam are good friends for more than ten years. I started as an assistant director to Kadir and Jeeva and acted in about 30 films as friend of the hero and other roles. My passion was to direct a movie. At one point of time Santhanam told me that both of us must do a movie.
I started writing a script for him. At that time he asked me to see the Telugu movie “Mariyada Ramanna”, which both of us liked and decided to do it in Tamil. I felt that Telugu film is like a talkie movie of Charlie Chaplin. We have done some changes to suit the Tamil audience and when I saw the film in Tamil now, I liked it very much. Bicycle will be portrayed as one of the characters and it will the highlight of the film.

Hero Santhanam: Few of my friends wanted me to do the lead role in the movie. I was happy to do the friends role of the hero and make them laugh to their hearts content. Producer Pottluri wanted me to do the hero role and showed the Telugu film. I was keeping my fingers crossed. When I decided that time has come for me to take a decision I decided to do the film “Vallavanukkum Pullum Ayutham”. Doing a heroes role is really tough as it needs full concentration and a perfect body to fight and dance. In a friends role I was using only my mouth to speak my dialogues. I have worked hard and all my friends also worked with me and now the film is over and I liked it and felt that they would also like it.

Music director Siddarth Vipin: I got a call from Santhanam’s office and I went and met both Santhanam and director Srinath. They told me three conditions and first is I must know music, second I must attend the phone calls and last but not the least, I must not treat the other person as if he is borrowing money from me. I was ready for all the conditions and grabbed the opportunity and worked with at most care and have come up with some good music. All the persons in the unit were happy about the music and appreciated my work.

Music Highlights: There are five numbers in the album and ‘Rail Ade’ written by Na.Muthukumar and sung by Naresh Iyer and Shreya Goshal is the best. The fast kuthu number ‘Takkaru Takkaru’ is mainly for the front benchers and ‘Otrai Devathai’ written by Madhan Karky and sung by Karthik is sure to win the listeners with its beautiful melody and singing by the singer. ‘Chellakkutti’ is written by Lalithanand and sung beautifully by singers Ranjith and Vishnupriya Ravi and the music enhances the number. Ananthu sings the last number in the album, which is the theme song of the movie written by Muthulingam who is always strong in the words.

Fans throng Chamundi Hills to catch a glimpse of Rajinikanth
","Chamundi Hills in Mysore, which is filled with pilgrims from the crack of dawn, had a different crowd on Friday. For, Tamil superstar Rajinikanth, who is camping in the region to shoot for the film Linga, visited the temple.
Mr. Rajinikanth’s fans had been waiting at the temple from 4 a.m. to catch a glimpse of the superstar, who offered prayers to Sri Chamundeshwari and Lord Ganapathi.
Mr. Rajinikanth, clad in silk dhoti and shirt, reached the temple around 4 a.m., accompanied by Kannada film star and Minister for Housing M.H. Ambareesh and his wife, Sumalatha.
After they offered prayers, the ‘muhurat’ shot of the Tamil movie was filmed opposite the temple.
Mr. Ambareesh told presspersons that Mr. Rajinikanth was a popular actor and had fans all over the world and it was a matter of pride that Rockline Venkatesh of Karnataka was producing the film.
The film, being directed by K.S. Ravikumar, will be shot in parts of Mandya and Kerala, according to Mr. Venkatesh.

Refutes reports

Deputy Director of the Palace Board T.S. Subramanyam refuted reports that permission was denied to shoot the film at the Mysore palace. “Nobody has approached us officially, though a director called us about 15 days ago and wanted to know the procedure for seeking permission for shooting at the Bangalore and Mysore palaces and at the Maharaja’s residential palace here. I told him that the Bangalore Palace was a private property while the Mysore palace administration was vested with the government. After this, nobody came forward to seek permission from us,” Mr. Subramanyam said.
He said any decision on granting permission for film shooting had to be taken by the Palace Board comprising the Chief Secretary to the State government and the Deputy Commissioner.

Premchand had a great influence on me: Gulzar
","Poet and film-maker Gulzar on Friday said that famous Hindi litterateur Munshi Premchand had a profound influence on him, and that his film characters would invariably have similarities with the ones etched out by the great writer.
Releasing the televised adaptation of Munshi Premchand’s masterpiece novels Godaan and Nirmala on a DVD produced by the national broadcaster here, Gulzar said he sees Premchand’s characters all around him.
Gulzar said Nirmala’s story was about human relations. “Premchand specialised in this subject. It revolves around an under-18 girl who suddenly becomes a woman when she gets married to a man much older to her.”
Explaining his search for a village which had some similarity with the environment prevailing in Premchand’s novel Nirmala, Gulzar said he travelled extensively and finally found one existing on the Maharashtra-Gujarat border.
“For making Nirmala for the Doordarshan series Tehreer Munshi Premchand Ki, I decided to venture out of the studio. After much scouting, I stumbled upon a village which had the same environment as had been described by Premchand. I was so taken aback that even after 60 years, the condition of the villagers was still the same.”
Speaking about the cast of the serial, the film-maker complimented Marathi actor Amruta Subhash for essaying the character of Nirmala with much conviction. “She is in Delhi today as she would be collecting the National Award for a Marathi film. I should have brought her along for this interaction,” he said.
Gulzar said he first read Premchand’s works Haj-e-Akbar and Idgah while still in school.
“As a child I used to see my mother baking crisp tandoori rotis in a particular way. When I read Premchand I felt he had written about my mother. Later, after entering college I read Premchand’s writing in English and got an insight into the zamindari system and the gap between the rich and the poor. While making films, I could feel that Premchand was extremely observant and even described animal movements and characters in great detail.”

Back in town, and how!
","The very mention of Dr. Rajasekhar brings to mind several movies where he established himself as an angry, not-so-young police officer who goes about bashing up the baddies. As is common for most stars, he hit a bad patch for a while. Now, he is excited about Pattapagalu, his movie that set for release very soon. What is significant is that it’s a product from Ramgopal Varma’s ‘Factory’. Also in the pipeline is Gaddam Gang, directed by debutant Santosh, with Anjani Lavania as the heroine.
Now, it is to be remembered that the hero and his wife, yesteryear actor Jeevitha, have been in the news time and again for their political moves. The latest is his proclaimed support to BJP’s prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi. The duo even met the Gujarat Chief Minister recently and expressed their wish to see him successfully occupy the PM’s chair. At the beginning of the week, Dr. Rajasekhar also released a video with a song in praise of Mr. Modi.
A small film’s plaintive call!
Its my life is the name a small, new film that hit 36 screens across Andhra Pradesh this Friday. Typically, it was one of those movies that is hurt by the release of two big movies the same day. Made on the banner of Yasaswani Reels and produced by S.S. Naidu, the movie was directed by Ramineni Netaji, who worked with veteran director Kodanda Rami Reddy on blockbusters like Khaidi in the past.
This film got sandwiched between two relatively big-budget movies – Sekhar Kammula’s Anaamika, the women-centric movie starring Nayanatara and director Maruthi’s Kotha Janta with Allu Sirish and Regina Cassandra in the lead.
Although the damage was painful, producer Naidu is confident that it will appeal to people if it can draw a crowd over the weekend, with the presence of veterans like Kota Srinivasa Rao, Raghu Babu, Ranganath, Melkote and Surya in the cast, apart from a majority of freshers.
“The film is based on the concept of how important education is new and revolves around the theme of parents forcing their children to study what they think is important, instead of going by the young ones’ desire. How such behaviour induces stress in their children and what happens is what my story is all about,” says Naidu, about his 130 minute-long product!

Indian films brain-dead,says Naseeruddin Shah
","Acclaimed actor Naseeruddin Shah has laid the blame of making brain-dead films on film-makers, arguing that these films were a result of concerted efforts by determined speculators.
“In India, we are regurgitating ideas, which are 100 years old. The poor quality of acting in India is a reflection of the quality of writing, sensibility and quality of vision surrounding it. While everyone is concentrating on the lowest common-denominator, an actor’s work is expected to be honest,” he said.
He said an actor was “a messenger entrusted with delivering the goods completely and securely without obstructing or damaging the goods in any way.” He was in the city to deliver the third annual Ray Memorial Lecture on the occasion of celebrated filmmaker Satyajit Ray’s 93 birth anniversary on Friday.
Talking about ‘an honest actor’, he said the only way an actor can be dishonest is by indolently refusing to live up to his/her potential. Acting is a craft, he said.
Elucidating an actor’s responsibilities, he said an actor’s performance in a film was “dependent on factors over which he has no control.”
“Since the actor is the most visible part of the visual presentation, it was the actor who garnered both the bouquets as well as brickbats. Unwittingly, he was held responsible for theatre and its symbol,” he said.
Stating that Indian films made in the past had equally “dreadful acting and writing”, he said sensibilities of the people backed the kind of films made even then. He said Indian films had not gone through much change since then. “We can’t seem to break out of the proscenium mould that we’ve got stuck in. We’ve put our heroes on a pedestal for too long… and it’s time that we got engaged with them… and learn from their strengths and weaknesses.”
Highlighting the quantum leap in American films, thanks to the advent of television, he said better writing and an honest picture of what was false had helped generate innovative writing and better American films.

A Rajini film is always special: Rahman
","When you see a shot of two kids running into an open field in the Hollywood flick 
Million Dollar Arm (MDA), which is releasing this Friday in India, check out the music that goes along with it. You’ll hear a Tamil song — yes, you read that right — playing in the background. That number, ‘Thirakkadha kaatu kulle’, sung by Unnikrishnan and Chitra, featured in the 1999 film 
En Swasa Kaatre, and will be heard again, this time by global audiences.
It’s evident that music composer A.R. Rahman is at work again. So, how did this song fit into a Hollywood flick? “Frankly, I really didn’t know how it landed there,” he laughs, “The makers were researching my Indian music and must’ve stumbled upon this. When I saw the movie, I was like, ‘Wow, where did that come from.’ But it felt so good. I didn’t feel any need to change it.”
Interestingly, the lyric go with the situation in the film. “It’s strange because when they picked up this song, they had no clue what it meant. But the situation was about kids who have achieved something major. And when the lyric – 
Thirakaadha 
Kaatukulle Pirakaadha Pillaigalpole — plays along with it, it just sounds so fantastic,” says Rahman.

 The pressure to deliver a hit song is much more in India. In Hollywood they tend to concentrate more on the score 

Million Dollar Arm came to the Mozart of Madras through Disney and he accepted to do the score due to the subject and his state of mind at that time. “I was in a good mindscape when this project came,” he recalls, “For three years, I was avoiding Indian-based subjects in Hollywood as I was anyway doing them in Hindi. The last thing I wanted was to be typecast as a composer who’d only work on English films with an Indian setting. But when this script came along, I thought it was a good time to start again. It helped that the story was also hybrid in nature.”
The themes of both 
Slumdog Millionaire and 
Million Dollar Arm have similarities, for they focus on the underdog. Does he consciously pick such subjects? “Oh no, not at all,” he quickly clarifies, “It’s just a coincidence, that’s all.” His Hollywood film is slated for an Indian release this Friday, at a time when fans across the world will be celebrating Superstar Rajinikanth’s 
Kochadaiiyaan, which has music by Rahman too. How different was it working on these two films? “
MDA is more contemporary. In terms of music, it is more orchestral. Rajini’s film, on the other hand, is a period film and working on that was very different. Both the movies, of course, have got their own set of audiences.”
Rahman also seems to have taken his role as a singer very seriously, having crooned in most of his recent albums. Ask him if he’s becoming choosy these days as a singer, “Not at all…it’s just that I want to spend a lot of time with the song before I can deliver it. I need to do 
riyaz regularly in order to sing well. I need at least three hours a day for that but I’m not able to get that kind of time now, with all the travelling and composing assignments and as the head of my music school. That’s why even when other composers call me for singing; I don’t usually take it up. To sing the way I want to, I need to work hard and practise. I feel that my voice is God’s gift and a lot of people seem to like it. Actually even I like it,” he chuckles.
With a host of projects, both nationally and internationally, he’s a busy man. Is time-management a big issue? “Well, travelling does take a toll on my health. I think I have to reduce the number of films I commit to — I might be doing too much now.”
After delivering a global hit song like ‘Jai Ho’, do Hollywood composers come up to him with requests for another ‘viral hit’? “Actually, the pressure to deliver a hit song is much more in India,” he says, “In Hollywood they tend to concentrate more on the score. If they want a hit song, they’ll somehow manage to get it from you.”
Back in Tamil, Rahman has Shankar’s 
Ai and Vasanthabalan’s 
Kaaviyathalaivan.  “
KaavithalaivanI completed the last song of Kaaviyathalaivan just a few days back,” he reveals, “I thoroughly enjoyed working on it as it has elements of classical and folk music.”
And there’s more good news for fans of the Rahman-Rajini combination, for they’re coming back again for the Superstar’s next film, titled Lingaa. “It’s too early to talk about it,” he smiles, “But yes, a Rajini film is always special.”

Tunes from Kolkata
","Madhubanti Bagchi’s earthy, full-throated rendition of a popular Baul (Bengali) ‘Nodi Bhora Dheu…’ (the river is full of tides...) for Masala Republic, captures the ebb and flow of life where man is hapless in this journey.
A Bengali rock band doing the title song for a Malayalam film is fitting, ironically. Kerala is after all home to a considerable population of Bengali migrants. Kolkata-based band Mrittika was, however, clueless about this fact when they were asked to do the film’s title track.
The only exposure the band had had to Malayalam and Kerala until then was a television show on Kappa TV. Playing mostly in Bengal, the suggestion that they could play for a TV show in Kerala was a surprise. “Someone from Kerala who was familiar with our music told us about the show. We got in touch with the channel and we were on,” says Madhubanti, one of the band’s vocalists, over phone from Kolkata.
The trip to Kerala, and the recording, was an adventure. She says they just wanted to ‘see’ how people took to their brand of music.
The seven-member fusion band comprises, besides Madhubanti, Suchal Chakraborthy (vocals), Diptangshu Chakraborthy (guitar), Zafar Ansari (keyboards), Nilanjan Ghosh (drums), Sudipto Sarkar (bass) Shouvik Mukherjee (zitar) and Suomojyoti Ghosh (flute).
It counts among its influences musicians as diverse as Ustad Bade Ghulam Ali Khan, Pandit Ravi Shankar, A.R. Rahman, Trilok Gurtu, Jimi Hendrix, John Coltrane and Miles Davis. ‘Nodi Bhora Dheu…’ is a popular Baul song.
The band, which does covers and originals, presented a combination of Bangla and Hindi numbers and was surprised by the response. That show led them to the film.
One of the editors of the film put them in touch with the director, G.S. Vishakh. Philosophy in a satire might appear misplaced, but the director disagrees, “The film is about a journey, and the song is the score for the journey – literally and metaphorically.”
Why a Bengali band for a Malayalam film was the question that even Mrittika wondered about. For authenticity’s sake, says the director. “We were told about the film’s Bengali context and then everything fell into place,” she says.
A rough video of the filming also helped. The choice of song fell on the band. The philosophy-laden Baul song combined with one of the band’s Sufi original, was zeroed in on and approved.

Pranab sees films as moral anchors
","Reminding creative people of the Indian film industry that they need to use their artistic pursuits to create socially relevant cinema, President Pranab Mukherjee on Saturday said filmmakers should deploy their creative efforts to propagate core values such as patriotism, respect for women, compassion and tolerance.
Conferring film awards in various categories at the 61st National Film Awards at Vigyan Bhawan here, Mr. Mukherjee said the cinematic content of films should have a desirable impact on the social behaviour of people, especially the new generation. “Faced with erosion of values in today’s context, cinema should play a catalytic role in resetting our moral compass.”
The highlight of the function was when the compere announced the name of noted poet Gulzar for the prestigious Dadasaheb Phalke Award for his lifelong contribution to cinema. He was given a standing ovation and received a warm pat on the back and acknowledgement in words from the President.
Mr. Gulzar, dressed in his signature style of immaculate white kurta pajama, said there were only two institutions in the country which were secular. “One is the Army and the second is the film industry, where people cutting across religion and caste work together. I can vouch for the fact that people in the film industry are secular, honest people.”
Late filmmaker Balu Mahendra’s film, Thalaimuraigal, dealing with the breaking of walls of orthodoxy and religious and linguistic bias in a small village in Tamil Nadu, bagged the Nargis Dutt Award for the best feature film on national integration. For ‘
Bhaag Milkha Bhaag,’ filmmaker Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra received the award for best popular film providing wholesome entertainment.
“As a citizen of India, it is a proud moment for me to get the award from the highest office in the country. It is not a sports film but one dealing with the Partition and lost childhood. Moreover, it is about the spirit of Milkha Singh, who achieved so much despite being displaced along with millions of people,” said Mr. Mehra.

An eternal bond with Rajkumar
","The streets of Bangalore may be infamous for its traffic which comprises around 85,000 autorickshaws. Yet, one autorickshaw manages to stand out in the crowd.
Proudly sporting the bright yellow and red Karnataka flag, this autorickshaw, adorned with nearly 60 posters of ‘Annavaru’ (the legendary Kannada matinee idol Rajkumar ), belongs to 47-year-old Satish.
Dressed in a crisp white t-shirt and pants, Satish even sports the flag and a photograph of Dr. Rajkumar on his nameplate and watch.
No wonder that his autorickshaw has caught the fancy of people. Like a celebrity , Satish gets requests to pose for photographs from people along with his autorickshaw.
This class five dropout says he has been a die-hard Rajkumar fan for close to two decades now. Although he has been riding an auto for 25 years, he says his life took a turn when he watched the film Sampattige Saval. “Every dialogue in that movie that our Annavaru delivers has given me strength in life,” he says, as he touches the photo of Rajkumar to his eyes.
So ardent is his affection for the superstar that Satish says he fasted several days until Dr. Rajkumar returned from the forest when he was kidnapped by the forest brigand Veerappan.
Satish got to meet his idol twice and has even made him sit in his auto. “The warmth he showed to me during those two times has made me believe in myself more. I want to achieve everything that my Annavaru set out to do. I want people to take pride in Kannada,” he says.
His attempts to make people who are new to Bangalore learn Kannada has won him mixed responses. “While some agree, some others just smile and click pictures with me and go home.”
His other proud moment was when he appeared in the film Raj in which Dr. Rajkumar’s son Puneet played the lead. “In the film, I had to come out of the theatre and say the tickets are over. It was a small role but I am thrilled to have shared screen space with Annavaru’s son,” he says.

Laughing their way to happiness
","It was five hours of continuous laughter, entertainment and merriment at Sumo’s Convention Hall in Jayanagar where hundreds of members from laughter clubs across the city gathered to celebrate World Laughter Day. The first Sunday in May is celebrated as World Laughter Day.
The sound of loud infectious laughter could be heard ringing across the hall, forcing everyone who stepped into the room to crack a smile. The gathering, comprising mainly of the elderly, laughed out loud with various “kinds” of laughter and breathing exercises that included clapping and cheering. In keeping with the IPL season, members also showed off some cricket-based laughter exercises like ‘umpire laugh’ and ‘sixer laugh.’
This was followed by imitations of noted personalities by mimicry artist Gopi who had the audience in splits, and various cultural programmes . The women’s group of the Devagiri Laughter Club came dressed in saris and put on colourful sunglasses for their fusion dance. With 200 clubs in the city, Bangalore has earned the tag of having the most number of laughter clubs in any city in the world. Now, the State has over 400 clubs, of which 25 are exclusively for women.
The Karnataka Laughter Clubs president, Lion Prof. P. Sadashiv said that that as modern lifestyles had become stressful, laughter clubs would help bring about a change in the attitude of an individual to help him lead a healthy and happy life.

Tamil epic gets shorter to take to Chennai stage again
","Kamban, the author of Ramayanam, said that his effort to portray the life of Rama is akin to a cat aspiring to drink the water of the ‘parkadal’.
Condensing the five volumes of Kalki Krishnamurthy’s 
Ponniyin Selvan, which ran as a serial for four years, into a three-and-a-half hour play is no mean task. As 2014 marks the completion of 60 years of Kalki’s Ponniyin Selvan, Chennai-based production company SS International Live and theatre group Magic Lantern have adapted the novel for the stage. It will be performed for a week at Music Academy from June 8.
“We have adapted the novel in such a way that all the 55 characters we have culled out from the novel will appeal to the audience,” says Pravin, the director of the play.
Even though the title suggests that King Raja Raja is the hero of the novel, a slew of other characters, particularly Vanthiyathevan, Tirumalai alias Azhwarkadiyan, Nandini, Pazhuvettariyar Brothers, cast a magic spell on the reader.
“The adaptation has been done keeping in mind those who have already read the novel and those who are going to view it as a play,” says Mr. Pravin, adding that the one of the challenging tasks was penning the dialogues in standardised Tamil, considering the complexities of the plot of the novel.
It is Magic Lantern that first directed the play in 1999. “Actor Kamal Hassan watched the play in 1999 and suggested that we should bring down the duration to three-and-a-half hours.  Carnatic singer Bombay Jayashree is also keen on involving herself in some way,” say D. Muralidharan and R. Ananda Krishnan of SS International Live.
The two persons who played an important role in the adaptation of the play are Elango Kumanan of SS International and his brother Kumaravel, who wrote the script for the play. Both of them are grandsons of late M. Rajamanickanar, an authority on Chozha history.
“We are also planning to organise an exhibition showcasing the historical details of the novel,” says Mr. Kumanan.

Star maker’s ‘take two’
","Donning different roles from his childhood as child artiste, theatre artiste, theatre-director, television artiste, associate director, star maker, and now an actor, Lanka Satyanand is all smiles when you talk to him about cinema.
After making his silver screen arangetram with Billa Ranga, the star-maker is now keen on making it big as supporting actor in Telugu films.
Over the years, the only aspect that has not changed is his love for acting.
Satyanand says, “Acting is the only skill I am well versed with. It is a profession which I will never be tired of. However, when you are passionate about your job, it doesn’t really matter whether your talent is being nurtured behind or before the camera.”
From Pawan Kalyan to Mahesh Babu and Varun Tej, the star-maker has so far trained 74 actors and created a successful brand image as far as training is concerned.
But, how was his experience facing the camera after almost two decades in a different profession altogether?
“Honestly speaking, the experience was beautiful. I have been fond of acting since my childhood. Surprisingly, nobody ever approached me with any kind of a role till date. That’s why, when director Pradeep Madugula offered me a meaty role in his recent flick Billa Ranga, I grabbed the opportunity with both hands,” he confesses.
Though the star-maker is acting in another untitled film directed by Suneel Kumar Reddy, he is keen on grooming 100 actors shortly.
“Once I hit a century in my training career, I will write a book on film acting that covers my 22-year-old experience as a star-maker. After a short break, I will also be contributing to Telugu film industry by doing supporting roles,” adds Satyanand.

Skating on thin ice and winning the game of life
","Arjun Harishchandra Waghmare’s move to Mumbai from the impoverished Yavatmal district in Maharashtra had all the ingredients to make for a traumatic experience. But the 12-year-old managed to skate his way in the metropolis and do much more than survive.
Director Amole Gupte’s upcoming film could have well been a story about David conquering Goliath. Or, in a bleaker world, about Sisyphus trying to push a boulder up a hill without succeeding. But Hawaa Hawaai goes beyond grit and determination to emerge as a story of a young band of boys who dare to dream.
The eponymous protagonists of the film are a pair of rickety roller skates. Aiding them to take flight are five pre-teens: each representing different layers of Mumbai’s underbelly. Hawaa Hawaai is as much a film about skating, friendship and dreaming; as it is about the unending crisis unfolding in rural India. It is a film about children but you don’t need to be a child to appreciate it.
Mr Gupte who has been working with children, shot to fame with Taare Zameen Par and Stanley Ka Dabba. His latest film started taking shape in Mr Gupte’s head about 10 years back when he would accompany his son, Partho, for skating lessons. He is now the central character in Hawaa Hawaai.
Partho who also acted in Stanley Ka Dabba said Hawaa Hawaai was a challenging film. In that, he was playing a character whose life was very different from his own. “I had to understand what it meant to be a poor child in India.” Deepa Bhatia, his mother and editor of the film took Partho – who was 11 at the time-- to stay with poet-farmer Shrikrishna Kalamb’s family in Akola. Hawaa Hawaai is dedicated to the debt-ridden farmer who hanged himself to death in March 2008.
“In Mumbai, I played games on the computer or on the tablet. There, I learned to play marbles and lattu with other children. I used to wake up early to fill water,” said Partho (now 13). Mr Gupte started filming the day after the Vidarbha tour ended.
The other four child actors playing streetchildren come from different slums in Mumbai. In the film, when the window of a car goes down and Bhuraa’s face appears as he sells gajras, you feel you have seen this face at many signals in the city.
Each of the boys is endearing as he goes about carrying on with his life-- assisting a mechanic in a garage or working in a jari business or ragpicking from garbage mounds. As Lucky, the skating instructor says: “Such little children. Such big hearts.”
Mr Gupte has known the children for more than six years, as they have been students of his cinema and theatre classes. “I believe cinema has the power to empower them. I don’t audition. They don’t mug dialogues. They imbibe the character,” he said.
And imbibing is how Tirupati Kushnapalli (11) played his part. “I started paying attention to children carrying garbage. I used to feel bad. I would invoke this feeling while acting,” he said.
The film, agree all the actors, has become a life-changer. “I realised I have much to be happy about. I have a family. I have a home,” says Salman Khan (14). Salman’s home in Mumbai is on a construction site where his father works as a labourer.

Rangoli Metro Art Centre remains closed on first anniversary
","It’s been a year since the Rangoli Metro Art Centre opened on the city’s M.G. Road. Citizens who flocked to the popular public space expecting some grand celebration were disappointed to find that the centre was closed.
The Art Centre, which is generally closed on Tuesdays, remained so on its anniversary as well with its drawn barricades and shut doors .
From the popular drum jam to staging plays and cultural performances, the centre has been a major draw for people of all ages . So much so that citizens, who bemoaned the loss of the boulevard, now aver that the Rangoli Art Centre has made the public space accessible to all.
Unaware that the centre would be closed, many citizens visited the place only to be informed by the guards that it was not open.
Madhav, who works in a hotel on M.G. Road, said that instead of being closed, the Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Ltd. (BMRCL) should have organised some celebrations to mark the centre’s anniversary. Likewise, Venkat Swamy and his 13-year-old daughter Bhavana were disheartened to find the art centre closed. U.A. Vasanth Rao, general manager, BMRCL told The Hindu that “every day is a celebration” at the art centre while admitting that no celebrations were planned for its anniversary. He also said that the BMRCL hoped to bring in more innovative activities towards a revival of traditional art and culture, remarking “We have received public acceptance. We hope to have bigger and better events in future.” that a market place for artisans would be set up soon at the centre.

Benaka attempts to revive theatre music
","Bengaluru Nagara Kalavidaru (Benaka), a theatre group, is conducting a 15-day Rangasangeeta Shibira (workshop on theatre music) from May 31. Addressing presspersons on Monday, noted theatre and cine personality T.S. Nagabharana said that the workshop is an attempt to promote Rangageethegalu, which are a part of theatre.
Benaka was founded by doyen of Indian theatre B.V. Karanth, who lent theatre a different perspective through his music.
“People still vividly remember his compositions for landmark plays, including Sattavara Neralu, Hayavadana and Gokula Nirgamana.

Attempt at revival

The workshop is an attempt to revive the great theatre music tradition. Senior theatre musicians would conduct classes in this genre of music for three hours every day.
At the end of the workshop, participants will perform at a function organised by Benaka,” Mr. Nagabharana said.
He said that present day theatre troupes lack talented singers and, hence, the need to spot new talent and train them. “There is a feeling that many popular plays are not being staged due to a lack of singers. The workshop is an attempt to fill this gap,” he said.
Senior theatre artiste Paramashivan, actor-director Krishnamurthy Kavatar and poet H.S. Venkatesh Murthy, apart from Benaka artistes Kalpana Naganath, R. Srinath and Gajanana Nayak, will be the resource persons in the workshop.
Those aged above 15 years and interested in theatre songs can send their applications to R. Srinath, ‘Anuradha’, No. 225, 5th Main Road, Padmanabhanagar, Bangalore 560070 by May 20. For details, call 9902929001 or 9483965396.

Within the next four hours, the verified account (@superstarrajini) had more than 1,00,000 followers and was adding hundreds every minute . However, the actor was not following anyone as of Monday night.
The first tweet also had a link to a video recording of the iconic actor stating: “I am happy to connect with my fans through social media, starting with Twitter.”
The news of Rajinikanth having a verified account set the Twitter world abuzz, and his legions of fans started celebrating it in expected fashion. One of the common reactions to the news was that “Twitter has started following Rajinikanth”.
While it took a couple of hours for Rajinikanth’s twitter account to gain the ‘verified by Twitter’ status, some fans were already poking fun and making internet memes in which the official Twitter account was digitally altered to show the “verified by Rajinikanth” emblem.
Several fans were overjoyed that the usually media-shy actor was taking to the social network. However, doubts were raised about the actor directly tweeting on the account. According to a press release, the Twitter account of the actor is being managed by the agency Fluence, a “celebrity digital network”.
The agency is also reportedly managing the digital lives of several celebrities in the country, including Amitabh Bachchan, Salman Khan, Sonu Nigam, Shaam and Karishma Kapoor.
Everyone who followed the actor’s account got an automated reply with a poster of his upcoming movie Kochadaiiyaan. This proved to be a bit annoying for some users as they pointed out that their Twitter timelines were spammed by the automated messages. The press note from Fluence noted that the automated ‘welcomegraph’ would be sent to anyone following the account in the first week.

You were young when you joined Theatre Unit, School of Dramatic Arts, in Bombay. Tell us a little about the journey from there..

I started at age of 15 and Mr. Ebrahim Alkazi became my guru. He was in Bombay running this school. My father was posted in Bombay then and I was looking for something to do. It was my first experience with theatre. I was trained by Mr. Alkazi for nearly two years and then my father moved to Delhi, and I left with him. My time at that school transformed my life. Mr Alkazi opened the whole world of theatre for me. I was trained as an actor, and he was a great teacher, very methodical. I was also fortunate to get a lot of great exposure, and the other students were all of different ages. People around me were all different ages. I acted in my first play “Antigone” with Satyadev Dubey. It was a very nice exposure, where I could interact with not just people of my age but others too. Once in Delhi, I did my graduation from Miranda (Miranda House, Delhi University). In DU, I got lots of opportunities. It was an exciting time. Everything was flowering. The theatre scene was getting a lot of exposure from the West, and there were new plays and translations as well as lots of folk theatre. St Stephen’s College had a lots of theatre activity, I worked in the Unity theatre which was launched then, and with Sheela Bhatia. She and I did a few plays together. And then, Joy Michael started Yatrik and we all joined it together. I was a founder member. After graduation, I got a scholarship and moved to France to study mime under Jacques Lecoq.

Almost 60 years down the line, it’s impossible to not notice changes, both within yourself and in the country’s theatre map.

Growing up, I worked with best possible people, Mr. Alkazi, Begum Zaidi, Habib Tanvir. I couldn’t have had a better time, or exposure. Over the years, a lot of experimental theatre has come up, which is very exciting. There is also a lot of quantity of theatre but, unfortunately, less quality. I think in terms of quality there were some great plays happening in the earlier days. There were great directors then, and not that there aren’t now. Over the years, I met people like Amal Allana and worked a lot with her. She in a way changed me as an actress. I always had played these heroines and did these leads that were strong emotional parts. Then she gave me challenging roles that were different to anything I had done earlier. For instance, she made me play Chandragupta Maurya at 19. She had this gender thing. She made Manohar Singh play Mother Courage. She helped me a great deal to develop as an actress.
Today a lot of young people are involved in theatre. But people want to do plays in two weeks nowadays. There is a lot of theatre that is commercial, with people looking for immediate results. But then, there is a lot of great serious theatre happening too. I like the stuff coming from Kerala, including Jyotish’s work, which was here for the META awards. I also like Deepan Sivaraman’s work. He has imagination and is bold. That’s the kind of theatre I love. His work is also relevant to the times. Other than these, great work is also coming from other states, like Bengal and Karnataka.
The audience today has also grown enormously. You go to plays and can’t find people you know. Before, you knew everyone because the same people would attend the plays.
Today, foreign directors are coming to India, since there is so much talent here. They come looking for source of inspiration, and I think it’s fantastic what’s going on in theatre today.

And as an actress, how do you approach roles? Is there a specific method you work with?

Everyone has their own method. There are books on method acting. I go by the best way which was with Mr. Alkazi. You know, I watched him very carefully in my impressionable years. He is absolutely amazing with characterisation. He made you study the role very carefully, had many discussions to find out what the character was about, examined his/her interaction with other characters, and the play’s theme. Once you understood your part in the play, you had to get a hook into it — had to find that one thing in the character and observe that something in the world around you. Of course, there is no fixed way of approaching it. What you have to do is search for the truth of the role. You can’t put on and pretend. It takes time. I know that Amal gives five months to a play, Mr. Alkazi gives it three months. Sai Paranjpye is another person I really enjoyed working with. She had a way of persuading you to enter the character in a particular way. Imagination plays a great role in entering the character, as does observation. You also need to practice a lot, come in front of the director, show him something. If that fails, try something else.

Did the extensive experiences with many directors shape your own work as a director?

I’ll tell you something, how I became a director is very interesting. It was because I was an actor. I observed a great deal. The way Mr. Alkazi used to teach his actors, I took it very seriously. He used to give us one hour long individual classes on speech, pace, volume, emphasis, pronunciation. And then, I was a teacher too. So I found it very interesting to do a play and teach all these actors.

You once said that you will never act in a play your were directing yourself. Does that still hold true?

Yes, I could never do that. I think you lose your distance and perspective that way.

And how do you choose the plays you act in and direct?

I’m very particular about choosing a play. After all, you have to put so much time into it, it’s your life’s blood. So I do plays that I want to do, that mean something to me. Like “Rashômon”, I found it very relevant and engaging. Secondly, I’m very devoted to Federico Garcia Lorca. I still want to do one more play of his. I feel very connected to his work, still feel like he’s speaking to me. I’ve acted in and directed “Yerma”, directed “Blood Wedding” twice, as well as other plays by him. Now if I get a chance I’ll do “The House of Bernarda Alba”.

As someone who has worked with speech and voice, and taught theatre, do you see it as something that must be an inherent talent, or one that can be cultivated?

That’s a very interesting question, because I honestly believe that you have to have a flair, that one spark, from the start. You might go a whole lifetime not discovering it, which is very sad. Once it’s been discovered though, then it can be trained. But to begin with it has to be inherent.

Some plays touched a chord
","Even a simple theme can be impressive depending on how it is presented. Prolific writer and veteran Josier Cheena’s ‘Ishwaryam,’ presented by Raja Mathangi Creations, belongs to this category. The result of ignoring bountiful Nature and the environment for materialistic gains, was the premise chosen by Cheena, who also took the credit for dialogue and direction.
When playwrights act, their characters are usually loaded with dialogue. But Cheena, choosing the role of a partially paralysed person (Jagannathan), given to eccentric and violent behaviour, speaks few lines. Kudos to him for sustaining that awkward posture and gait. Saravanan as Jagannathan’s son, Sriram, was natural, scoring in the scenes where he tackled his difficult wife, Ranjani, played well by Saidai Jayanthy. Ravikumar as Dr. Madan, engaged in the task of tapping into Jagannathan’s psyche did a commendable job. Master Saravanakumar as baby Deepika, stole hearts with his affection for the grandfather.
Writing an original comedy can be tough, especially in this age when internet has so much to offer. Rail Priya’s ‘Ivan Oru Madhiri’ gives you a sense of déjà vu with the typical cast of a government office (late comers, disgruntled attendants, etc.). Add to it a Hindi speaking boss and the resultant misunderstandings, a hero, who solves all problems and a young women caught up in a love triangle.
Rather than trying to ape Maadhu Balaji (Crazy fame), Ananthu should evolve a style of his own. His sense of timing, nevertheless, is impeccable. Sudarshan as Siva the junior clerk, shows potential but has been underutilised. A balanced Sundaresan as superintendent (Mohan), hero Pattabhi (Ananthu), Siva, Ganesh (Devarajan) the ever effervescent attendant, Ezhumugam (Krupa), work together in the Weather office. It seems it is all play and no work and until the interval the play moves on with no semblance of a storyline. The proceedings gather momentum with Priya (Swetha), a young woman joining the office on a transfer.
Blending into the story were Sundaresan’s wife Meenakshi (good show by Sreemathi) and their truant son Kumar. Rajgopal as Gupta, the Deputy Director, is impressive with his Hindi and English.
Swetha as Priya was a bit artificial with her body language and accented English. Music was a letdown. Railpriya should think of new concepts to use the talent of its team in a better way.
Gurukulam Original Boys Company ’95’s play, ‘Andha Naal Gnabhagam’ (ANG) on May 1, was a perfect holiday fare. S. Gowrishankar’s simple story line, which had a philosophical touch and neat dialogue made it a memorable fare.
Hindustani music on the flute and the violin served as a soothing background score And the actors delivered. Jokes peppered the flow without appearing to be contrived.
Four close friends plan a weekend reunion at a mansion in Triplicane, where they had lived together before their careers took off 30 years ago. While three of them are married, shy Balu is still a bachelor living in the same mansion. Viswanathan Ramesh as Ignatius Prabhakar, a leading consultant living in Delhi, was outstanding with his Nagercoil dialect.
As a soft spoken bank manager and an acquiescent husband, Sundar (M.B. Moorthy) and his well educated but domineering wife Gomathi (Srividya) were a picture of contrast. Bearded V.P.S. Sriraman as Rangarajan was loud and bold in his arguments. Malathy Sampath as Kothai was the typical benevolent house wife.
Some members in the audience sure would have gone down memory lane as Sundar recalled the names of eating joints that once flourished and have since closed down. On the whole a moving performance.
-
Often the end of a play or film makes a lasting impact. The character of Neelamani in Mayura Priya’s ‘Yenna Kavi Paadinaalum’ will remain etched in the memory of the audience.
P. Muthukumaran, in charge of story, dialogue and direction, acts as Neelamani, a 35 year old mentally-challenged person. His performance was outstanding. ‘Kala Nilayam’ Chandru, a veteran who lends dignity to his roles, played Malaikottai Mahadevan, a Carnatic music vidwan of repute. Sowmya Ramnarayan, as his wife who teaches music at home, not only sang well but impressed as an actor too. Debutant Nandini Srinvas as Nayaki, head of a rich Nagarathar family and a widow with a magnanimous heart, scored full marks with her histrionics. Voice is the asset of Gopinath, who played Gunasekaran the second son of Nayaki. Karur S.P. Rangaraj (remember the old lady, Poornam’s mother-in-law in Thani Kudiththanam), who just celebrated his 80 birthday, showcased his experience throughout as the cook and mentor of Nayaki’s family. Guhaprasad’s music added to the mood. Music, in fact, was used well to take the story forward in this play.
The superlative in the name of the group that brought to a close the 25 Summer Drama Festival of Kartik Fine Arts, remained only on paper. An insipid screenplay with no semblance of a storyline marked Best Arts’ presentation, ‘Vaibogamey’. K.S. Seshadri’s story simply refused to move beyond a point. Sangeetha as Jothika and Venkatesh as Krishnan were natural, while R.S. Rajagopalan as ‘Neutral Narayanan’ went overboard. The sermon by Venkatesh in the last scene, which ran close to ten minutes, tested one’s patience. What an archaic and sad way to finish the drama festival.

Kochadaiiyaan: The wait continues
","Keep aside the pumpkins and coconuts — you could use them while cooking for now. Stash the crackers to be used at a later date. Aarthis and
 abhisekhams can wait too.
For, come Friday morning, the city will not wake up to 
Kochadaiiyaan as expected. Fans who have awaited a Rajini film for four years will have to wait for the experience for a couple of weeks more.
On a gloomy Wednesday morning, Rajinikanth fans in the city were getting ready to welcome Kochadaiiyaan, their idol’s return to the big screen, though in a digital avatar. At the centre of all this was Saidai G. Ravi, a die-hard Rajini fan, who has been running a fan club since 1988, which now functions as a head office for around a 1000 fan clubs in and around Saidapet. He was running from pillar to post to make sure that the banners were ready and the 100-ft cut out has been erected at the theatres screening the film. After the uncertainty over the release ended, he had made elaborate plans at three theatres – Parangimalai Jothi, Kasi and Udhayam – that included setting up an LED banner, beaming images of Rajini from the past and present, worth Rs 3 lakh, and a fireworks display. “We planned to start our celebrations at Parangimalai Jothi theatre by 4 p.m. and were scheduled to go to Kasi theatre. We then planned to reach Udhayam theatre, where we were set to organise a small fireworks display. We have also erected a 100-ft cut out of our idol,” he said.
But all these plans went for a toss when the makers pushed the release to May 23 “to cater to the demand for multiple language and the 2D and 3D versions to release the same day.” “We are disappointed. This has never happened as far as I know,” said a fan, who was eager to watch the first day first show (FDFS) of the film.
People who were planning to catch the FDFS have already made other plans for Friday. But, what’s special about watching a Rajini film on the release day? Well, they say that a Rajini film is never just a film. It’s an experience.
The fun, frolic and frenzy surrounding that is exactly what Amish Kumar, who has done several albums, wished to capture when he set out to film his latest video. “A couple of years ago, I was fascinated with the 12/12/12 phenomenon and decided to do an album celebrating Rajinikanth,” he recalls, “I’d included a fast-paced song titled ‘Koottam Seru, Kosham Podu’ in that.” As the release of Kochadaiiyaan kept getting delayed, Amish decided that he’d do a music video with the song to keep the interest afloat. “I wanted to say, ‘The release is around the corner. Let’s start the music.’”
To do that, he headed to Bangalore, where the Superstar actually spent a major part of his life as a bus conductor. “We wanted the video to be grand,” says Amish, “However, we didn’t want to choreograph or stage anything. So, we let all the locals just react – just react as if they were in a Rajini film FDFS. The point was not to come up with a perfectly-choreographed video; it was to show the emotion behind the movie-watching experience.” Amish even got in singer Velmurugan to feature in the video and add to the celebrations.
For now, even as many movie-goers who’ve already booked tickets expect their money back, some die-hard fans are heaving a sigh of relief. Take Saidai Ravi and his friends, for instance. They’re happy that they will get more time to plan things for the big day, which is still two weeks away. “We were short for time because theatre owners were not letting us put up flex boards until the confirmation of the film’s release. Now, we wait for a bigger celebration on May 23,” he said.

The wonder years
","Halitha Shameem grew up in many cities, but home for her was always Dharapuram. She spent her holidays there, watching boys play by the Amaravathi river that flowed past the town. Her debut feature film as director, Poovarasam Peepee, is also about a bunch of boys who lead a carefree life and play whole day long, till they are forced to grow up, overnight. The colourful trailer promises a cracker of a film.
Halitha, 27, who graduated in electronic media, trained for seven years under Pushkar-Gayathri, Mysskin and Samuthirakani before venturing out on her own. And, this, she says, is the first story she could think of. Poovarasam Peepee is produced by cinematographer Manoj Paramahamsa, who has also shot the film’s lyrical frames.
“We all go through a period when we lose our innocence. It could be triggered by anything — anger, violence… I wanted to make a film about the effect of violence on childhood,” she says.
On one level, the film is a frothy summer adventure, something on the lines of Enid Blyton’s Famous Five, she says. “Strangely, I’ve never ever read Famous Five in school. But I imagined the five having great fun!” The kids in the film, played by Gaurav Kalai, Pravin Kishore and Vasanth (seen in Veyyil and Aaranya Kaandam) court danger, and deal with it in their own, sweet way, she explains.
The film was shot over 60 days in and around Pollachi and Dharapuram. So, how was it working with kids? “Great fun. We chose them through an audition, and barring Vasanth, the others were rank newcomers. It’s lovely working with kids. Once you make them understand what you want, your work is done. You don’t have to deal with egos and jealousy,” says Halitha.
The young director has shown the film to two of her mentors, who loved it, and she is now waiting to show it to Mysskin.
Now that the film is all set for release, how does it feel? “It’s really not sunk in yet. I’ve been too involved with the film. I am also its editor, colourist and lyricist. I’ve given a lot of myself to the film,” she smiles.
So, what does the title refer to? “Ah…that? That’s what many of us played with as kids. A peepee made with the leaf of the Poovarasam tree. It sounds magical. Like childhood.”

Son shine
","Partho, who won the National Award for the best child actor in Stanley Ka Dabba, talks like a seasoned actor. He says he had spent enough time with the character Arjun to understand the nuances.
“I knew even when the odds were against him he is in control of situation. So I kept my expressions in check. And the four boys in the film are my friends. We have a give and take kind of relationship when it comes to acting,” he says. Deepa says, given a chance, Partho would like to spend a sleepover with his band of boys rather than his school friends.
On getting a crew cut for the film, Partho says he was initially hesitant, “because the film was shot during my school holidays when I could really flaunt my thick mop but as you know the character demanded it and I said what the heck, cut them! In a way it proved to be blessing because after I cut I could feel the impact of water when I took shower and it felt great. Also, when I went back to the class, the teacher presented it as an example of discipline.”

‘Integrity is key’
","Deepa Bhatia, who has edited the film, Hawaa Hawaai, says as always her job was to bring out the director’s vision from the material. “And Amole is pretty clear about what he wants. In his screenplay, you will find minute details like where he would like to have the sound of flute in the background. We didn’t want to milk the emotions for popular appeal. For us, integrity is the key.” She qualifies it with the example of the coach in the film not realising that Arjun is not getting sufficient diet.
“It is something that the upper middle class takes for granted. We don’t even think about it but the film doesn’t overemphasise on it and let the audience feel it. Similarly, the fact that Arjun is a little different from other kids is subtly explained through his upbringing. He gets surprised when his friends call their father baap and not pitaji,” she elaborates.
Deepa agrees that Stanley Ka Dabba and Hawaa Hawaai have a sparsely feel in comparison to Taare Zameen Par, which kept on underlining what it was trying to do.
“I edited all three but when a star comes into the film, the integrity does get compromised a bit. In the original script, the film was supposed to end when Ishan wins the competition; he runs into greens and there are some imaginary hurdles in the ground which he jumps but in the final cut he runs into the arms of Aamir Khan. The layman may not have noticed it but the educators working with kids found it problematic because in a way we are again making the child dependent.” But, Deepa adds, the film did more than it is expected of a film. “It brought change in the curriculum and the examination system at the primary level.”

Repetition breeds irritation

If you are looking for a child actor in your film, casting director Mukesh Chhabra should be on top of your dialling list. Chhabra impressed the trade when he cast a bunch of livewire kids in Chillar Party. The film became a sleeper hit without any known face and Chhabra’s demand soared. Recently, his yet another find created waves as Parth Bhalerao captured the imagination of the audience in Bhootnath Returns. He not only entertained with his uninhibited performance but also outwitted Amitabh Bachchan in many scenes.
“The trick with casting child actors is to look for a fresh face every time. I believe, a child actor is good as long as he doesn’t know that he is acting. Generally, because of the lazy attitude or the producer’s pressure to milk the success of the child, filmmakers start repeating the same two-three kids again and again and the child is reduced to a showpiece, who keeps repeating himself or herself,” says Chhabra, who has a vast network of talent spotters across the country.
“I noticed Parth in a small role in Marathi film Killa. The challenge was to stand up to Mr. Bachchan but he was not at all overawed.” He advises that if a child actor wants to pursue acting as an adult he should take a break, complete his education and then return.

Indian documentary ‘Silent Screams’ wins U.S. festival awards
","A documentary film about politics of rape in India has bagged three awards at the 2014 New York Festivals International TV and Film Awards.
“Silent Screams — India’s Fight Against Rape” directed by Pria Somiah and written by Manira A. Pinto won a Gold World Medal for ‘Best Investigative Report’ as well as two Bronze Gold Medals each in the ‘Current Affairs’ and ‘Human Concerns’ sections respectively.
The film follows journalist Namita Bhandare as she meets rape survivors, law-makers and enforcers, activists and lawyers to understand the politics of rape and the plight of victims in their fight for justice.
The trigger for the documentary, produced by Miditech for Channel NewsAsia was the >brutal gangrape of a 23-year-old in Delhi on >December 16, 2012 and the subsequent rising up of people across the country to express shock and outrage.
In exclusive interviews, Nirbhaya’s parents and brother describe her last few days, repeat achingly sad conversations and demand justice for her brutal and unnecessary death. The film also investigates the case of a 15-year-old Dalit girl.
It also looks at the role of the judiciary and the police in the case that came to be known as the ‘Kolkatta Park Street case’.
Director, Pria Somiah, said, “The survivors we met in the making of the film were not weak or frightened women. They were brave, strong-willed and determined women and girls who wanted justice.”
“They wanted their families and the community to shift the shame to the perpetrator. They wanted the conversation to change over who is to blame for rape. We wanted the film to document what has come to become an important milestone in the women’s movement not just in India but the world over,” she added.
Scriptwriter Manira A. Pinto said that it was an honour to script “Silent Screams”.
“Nirbhaya’s story is a universal story, just as rape is, which is why it sparked a nation’s conscience and made the world sit up and take note of it,” she said.
The film has already won the Asia Pacific Broadcasting Union - Perspective Award 2013, in Hanoi. It has been screened at the Mumbai Women’s International Film Festival 2013, Mountain Echo’s Festival in Bhutan and distributed across colleges, NGOs and legal aid organisations across the world.
New York Festivals International TV and Film awards, currently in its 57th year received entries from over 50 countries over a variety of categories. The jury chose winners amidst competition from 700 entries.

Summer blockbusters: Babysitters for adults
","I watched the new Spider-Man movie last week. I use the word “new” cautiously, for it only refers to this Spider-Man instalment being the one that was released most recently. Otherwise, it’s the same old, same old. There’s a secret from the past. There’s a tragedy in the present. A friend turns foe. There’s comedy, as when Aunt May forbids Peter Parker from doing the laundry because the last time he turned everything blue and red. Then there are the villains, who keep coming at him as if on an assembly line. First, there’s Electro, who was bitten by eels and is now some sort of human power supply. (I kept waiting for a joke where someone asks him about his “current employment;” it never came.) Then there’s Green Goblin. Then, just as you thought the film was over, someone straps himself into a steel suit with a horn and calls himself Rhino.
The Amazing Spider-Man 2 isn’t a bad movie. It’s just not a very good one. It’s probably not even a movie — more an adult version of the animated films that come out every month and function as babysitters for a couple of hours. You could miss The Amazing Spider-Man 2 and watch it when it premieres on TV. Or you could you just wait for The Amazing Spider-Man 3, where we’ll see more self-referential gags, more secrets and tragedies, more villains created by accident. Maybe a computer geek will fall into an open manhole and emerge as Drain-O, who threatens to kill the residents of New York City by unleashing a stink.
Meanwhile, Godzilla emerges from the oceans this week. I must say it sounds more exciting than the prospect of a new superhero movie. For one, the last time the giant lizard clomped around our screens was in 1998. That’s a reasonably long leave of absence. And two, the cast consists of Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Ken Watanabe, Elizabeth Olsen, Juliette Binoche, Sally Hawkins, David Strathairn and Bryan Cranston.
In other words, there are no superstars. In other words, anyone can die at any time. It’s hard to pretend that Tom Cruise’s life is in danger, but Aaron Taylor-Johnson could end up as mid-morning snack and no studio executive is going to have a heart attack.
Otherwise, I expect no surprises from the new Godzilla movie. I’m not enough of a fan of the franchise to react to the trailer the way this person did on one of IMDb’s message boards: “MUTO might be a serious threat, but how is unleashing Godzilla on it remotely close to being a good idea?” I don’t know what any of that means. It doesn’t matter much, either, that unlike in the 1998 film, this Godzilla actually looks like the creature from the Japanese daikaiju (giant monster) films.
Apart from a core group of the faithful, most people are only going to care about whether the film lives up to what Frank Darabont, one of the film’s writers (and the director of The Shawshank Redemption), said in an interview: “What we’re trying to do with the new movie is not have it camp, not have it be campy. We’re kind of taking a cool new look at it. But with a lot of tradition in the first film. We want this to be a terrifying force of nature.”
But we can bet that Godzilla won’t be too terrifying. That might mean that the younger viewers would stay away and that, in turn, would mean that the parents who don’t want to shell out babysitting costs would stay away as well. So, no, the new Godzilla cannot afford to be too terrifying. It cannot afford to be too idea-driven, harping on Godzilla being a metaphor for nuclear weapons, because that would mean stretches where the action slows down for conversation, and that’s not what global audiences, many of whose first language isn’t English, are going to line up for.
This is the reason most of these summer blockbusters look the same — because they aim to satisfy such different markets with a single product. The days are gone when a studio would allow Tim Burton to make his nihilistic and nightmarish Batman movies. In 1992, Batman Returns grossed some $160 million in North America and some $100 million worldwide. Today, The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is released worldwide before it opens in America. It had already grossed some $150 million before the first American ticket had been sold. With this kind of potential global profit, no one’s interested in taking huge creative risks. Why break your brain over what’s essentially going to be just another babysitter for adults?

Monster facts

- Godzilla means daikaiju or giant monster, from Japan’s tokusatsu films, a genre of SFX films.
- Its first appearance was in Ishirô Honda’s 1954 film Godzilla.
- It has inspired video games, comic books, novels, TV serials and more.
- Godzilla is supposed to be a metaphor for nuclear weapons.
- Godzilla’s roar was made by rubbing a resin-coated glove along the string of a contrabass.

Marriage by any name
","On May 16, when election results will be announced, director Anees’ 
Thirumanam Ennum Nikkah, a love story that tries to say why differences between Hindus and Muslims need not always be a flashpoint but can be embraced, will be released.
Having grown up in a society where religion was never politicised as it is today, Anees wanted his first film to address a young generation that seems to have begun to wear its religious identity on the sleeve.
“It was never like this when I was growing up. For instance, Hindus would pay respects to the most respected Muslim leader of the village during temple festivals, and he would be a part of the group that would pull the temple chariot. But somehow, we have come to a stage today when differences are perceived as a problem,” he says.

Thirumanam Ennum Nikkah was to be a film that would break the myths surrounding different social and religious groups. “Often, communities have been reduced to something they are not in reality. Which is why I wanted to make a film about a Tamil Iyengar boy falling in love with a Muslim girl,” he says.  The special vantage point that he possessed helped him represent the Muslim community not as a homogenous entity, but as diverse and vibrant. “There is a lot of diversity even among the Muslims living in Tamil Nadu. For instance, Tamil-speaking Muslims and Urdu-speaking Muslims have different rituals and customs. The sad part is that even Muslim youngsters today aren’t aware of these differences.”
Are there any risks in making such a film? “The key is to ensure there is balance. While the film features the Muharram, Ramzan and Nikkah festivities in great detail, it also features Avani Avattam and Navarathiri Golu celebrations. In fact, I have even showcased a lesser known festival, the Murshid, which I believe is the Islamic equivalent of the Golu and celebrated privately in homes.” In fact, this is one of the reasons the film has been delayed so much. “I had to wait for these festivals,” he says.
Has he been critical of any community in the film? “Critical? This is not that film,” he smiles.

Amole Gupte does not mask his emotions. “It’s still fresh… I am sensing the loss of a great influence in my life,” he says, talking of how his father initiated him into the arts. “Music with Sawai Gandharva, the renaissance on the Marathi stage, Prabhat Films…."" Amole’s father was called MGM because of his vocal paralysis. “He sounded like that,” says Amole, attempting to mimic his dad’s growly voice.
Best known for the heart-warming 2007 hit Taare Zameen Par, Amole’s latest Hawaa Hawaai is another milestone. After 
Stanley Ka Dabba, he teams up again with son Partho to put together a poignant story of a poor boy's struggle to succeed as an individual. The story unfolds through the sport of skating and Saquib Saleem plays Partho’s coach. “What my father sowed in me, I am sowing in the next generation,” says Amole. “I am an outsider here. It’s an uphill climb in this 
taaya-chacha  industry.”
As creative director of 
Taare Zameen Par, Amole oversaw what was a turning point in Indian filmmaking, specifically in children’s films. “It’s the intent,” he says, “I have had 2,000 children working in my last two films and none of them has missed school for a single day. Not because I worship schooling but because peers are an inherent part of growing up and I wouldn’t want them to miss out on that. Also, I don’t want any child ‘workers’.”
During the shoots, Amole carries a recorder for live sound and a basic DSLR. There are no lights on the sets and no night shoots. “If a child spends 10-14 hours on the sets, what’s the difference between them and those at Sivakasi’s fireworks industry?” he asks. For every film, Amole holds a series of workshops at Pali Chimbai Municipal School, where children from three different schools land up. And contrary to popular belief, Amole says it isn’t difficult for children to act, since they are such generous givers. “Children at my workshop dramatise 
Tughlaq with utmost ease. The privileged ones come but I call them tourists. They go away as easily as they come. The underprivileged walk 3 km to my workshop. One of them, Ashish Gaikwad, has just graduated from Subhash Ghai’s Whistling Woods International as film editor. Seven years ago, when 12, he joined my Aseema Cinema Studies Class. On my birthday, two years ago, he presented me with a three-minute film 
Tahaan (‘thirst’). Unknown to him, Subhash Ghai showcased it as the finale for Whistling Woods’ graduation day and gave him a full scholarship,” says Amole.
Amole is today the chairperson of Children’s Film Society of India (CFSI) but does not know how long he will continue. “Children’s Rights is my agenda. If they agree to it, I will continue. Nothing has happened for the last 14 months. I think it is criminal to make a child work long hours. Take children’s reality shows. There is no counselling, no logic. Children can be traumatised and depressed but no one cares. If there is a provision for animal rights, children deserve it too. The NCPCR has asked me to contact the Broadcasting Content Complaints Council (BCCC). But this isn’t a complaint; it is to ensure that tomorrow there are no mutton shops here. But even as the head of an industry body I am not getting any traction.”
Ask him about working with Partho and he says, “I was given utmost respect by my parents when I was growing up. We do the same with Partho. He plays the guitar well. I am not raising an actor. For us, shooting is just ‘
chalo ek workshop karte hain.’ After 
Stanley Ka Dabba, Partho had some 100 offers including commercial endorsements, but that’s not on our horizon.”

Never fear Fridays…
","“It’s not so much of an action thriller as a mind games flick,” says Suniel Shetty of Koyelaanchal due for release on May 9. He’s been touring the length and breadth of the country to promote his film and exhaustion is an understatement. “I don’t want to let the producers down. Vinodji (Khanna) and I are the only known faces in this film and the rest, though supremely good, are not known. He (Vinod) is busy with the elections and campaigning so that leaves only me!”
It’s a late evening chat but Suniel is passionate about the coal mafia issue dealt with in the movie directed by Ashu Trikha and gets talking instantly. “We shot in Jharkhand and even today if you step into these coal-rich areas such as Jharia or Ranchi, you see toxic smoke and fire running for kilometers. We were told that they are abandoned coal mines. The miners get an approval for ‘N’ number of trucks of sand to quash the coal fire after mining. But they put in only a fraction of sand in it thereafter. And people are living dangerously close, only feet away from these mines. The locals feel that the government has turned mafia after nationalisation whereas the government wants to break their stronghold,” he says.
Koyelaanchal is the story of how upright IAS officer Nisheeth Kumar (Suniel) takes on the might of local coal mafioso Saryu Bhan Singh (Vinod Khanna) and turns his own game against him. “I was spurred on by the response to my film 
Red Alert: The War Within. It didn’t do well commercially but that was because it did not get the right kind of release. But the response it got internationally and at film fests inspired me to take on work which persuades people to think about alternate realities. 

“Koyelaanchal is not an arthouse film. It just deals with a burning issue of our country. Coal theft has direct implications on inflation,” he says. “We haven’t glammed up the film either. There is one song where we have had men dress up as women because that’s what happens in these regions.” Suniel is hoping his film boosts the morale of IAS officers in the country and propels them to action. “
Singham and Dabanng did it for police officers. I hope IAS officers get strength by watching our film.”
Suniel says that he is looking at striking a balance between good work and living life king size. “I have made some mistakes like signing films with anyone who came with an emotional appeal. I never had the backing of a Yash Chopra or a Karan Johar but I’ve given hits. I tried my hand at production, which took three years of my life and didn’t succeed. It took me a year to clear up that mess. After that, I had a serious migraine problem for a year. Homeopathy cured it and now I am back in business. I believe in aging gracefully. So I wish to do only age-appropriate roles,” says the 53-year-old.
Suniel’s daughter Athiya is poised to enter films with Salman’s first solo production Hero, a remake of Subhash Ghai’s eponymous 1983 film. She is cast opposite Sooraj Pancholi. “Salman hadn’t even met Athiya before she reported for the shoot. Sometimes, it seems like he is launching his own child. He talks about how strongly he will promote this film. Athiya is excited and working hard and all I have told her is to value two things: each one’s time and the producer’s money. Also, never fear Fridays.”

Heroines say ‘I do’, producers say ‘We don’t’
","When actress Laila, who redefined bubbliness in Tamil cinema, walks down the streets of Mumbai, where she lives with her husband and two children, she still gets admiring glances. Sometimes, she is mistaken for a college girl. But when South Indian producers and directors call the actress, all they offer are ‘mother’ roles. “Why should I play the hero’s mother? I don’t look like one,” argues Laila.
When reigning queen bee Simran swapped the arc lights for a life with her love in 2003, lead roles all but dried up, except for a meaty role in Gautham Menon’s Vaaranam Aayiram. Madhoo, the Roja girl, marked her return to Tamil films as a mother in Balaji Mohan’s rom-com Vaayai Moodi Pesavum. After marriage and children, Nadiya, the South Indian film industry’s eternal sweetheart, has got ‘dignified’ roles, not lead roles.
Married actresses just don’t get to play romantic leads in Tamil cinema. Immediately after the popular Amala Paul recently announced her marriage with director Vijay, news came of her being dropped from Telugu movie Vastah Nee Venaka, the makers claiming that her being married would affect the film’s takings.
It’s a problem actresses face, admits a top director. “Producers tend to think that married actresses lack ‘desirability’ and won’t draw in audiences. That mentality has to change. Married male actors flaunt their children with pride and still have women fans, don’t they? Why is this not applicable for actresses? Does talent vanish overnight after marriage?”
A producer, on condition of anonymity, defends the case. He points out that even a top-billed Kareena Kapoor was not successful after marriage in teeny-bopper roles — love story Gori Tere Pyaar Mein did not set hearts racing. Even an Aishwarya Rai, who took a break after getting pregnant, managed only a couple of films after marriage. In reality, though, Hindi films have been far more forgiving than Tamil ones. Dimple Kapadia famously got some of her most fantastic and seductive roles after marriage and kids. More recently, Vidya Balan has attracted author-backed roles, and Kajol starred in Fanaa and My Name is Khan.
“Why don’t audiences and producers understand that a woman has so much to give even after marriage or children?” asks a Tamil director. “Why can’t they be given maternity leave and welcomed right back?” Agrees Laila: “We go through so many experiences; a new range of emotions are within our reach now; things that we have lived, felt.”
As Suriya says, after a point, actors should not matter; only characters should. “An actor’s job is to camouflage himself into a character and ensure the audience never sees the actor on screen. Where does one’s personal status get into this equation?” he wonders. It remains a blind spot, though, in the Tamil industry. Things will change, says G. Dhananjayan, chief, South Business, Studios, Disney-UTV, when South India embraces the multiplex culture. This would mean more mature audiences with fewer hang-ups. “It’s up to the industry to tap their talent and write roles to suit their new status,” he says, pointing out that Meena was perfect as a homemaker in Malayalam blockbuster Drishyam.
The question, though, is not about ‘correct’ roles. The question is, if much-married actors can woo heroines half their age, why can’t a married actress get the same roles she did a month before she got married? Balaji Mohan, whose Kaadhalil Sodhupuvadhu Yeppadi and Vaayai Moodi Pesavum were both multiplex darlings, agrees: “People must have the ability to look beyond this.” But clearly, both industry and audiences still have a long way to go.

Different in small screen

Interestingly, leading ladies on the small screen, especially Hindi TV serials, have managed to hold on to lead roles, even romantic ones, after marriage. Think of the fragile-looking Sangita Ghosh. She scorched screens every evening with her smoking-hot chemistry with the much younger Ruslaan Mumtaz in the just-concluded Jee Le Zara. Then there’s Shilpa Shirodkar, who took a break after marriage only to make a comeback with the popular series Ek Mutthi Aasmaan, where she plays the lead — a domestic worker with dreams for her children. A gracious Poonam Dhillon plays the lead in Ekk Nayi Pehchaan, a story about a loving but illiterate wife of a business tycoon who learns to read, thanks to her bahu’s efforts.

The butterfly effect
","Dibakar Banerjee backed it, Yash Raj Films produced it, Namrata Rao edited it and Guneet Monga is selling it. A world premiere at Cannes, that too in the ‘Un Certain Regard’ section — an official selection into the world’s most prestigious film festival. Is this what they call a dream debut? In a telephonic interview, director of Titli Kanu Behl says we make it sound all rosy, as he takes a break from the race to get a print ready for sending to Cannes. Excerpts from the chat:

Did you set out to make 
Titli
 a film about genetics, to explore nature vs. nurture, or was it purely born of your turbulent relationship with your father?
It is not that intellectual. It really stems from personal experiences I was trying to understand. We started out with a premise. A story about oppression. A young boy wants to escape his oppressive older brother. And then we asked ourselves what is being said here that’s not been said before. It wasn’t working. And we realised that we were blaming one character and copping out. The older brother Vikram, where did he start out? And after the second draft, we realised we had just shifted the blame to another. So where does it begin, where does it end? That’s how we cracked the third draft. We realised the film was about circularity and about a cycle that needs to be broken. We become who we hate.

You had Ranvir Shorey in mind for Vikram as you were writing it.

Yes, I knew who the two older brothers would be — Ranvir Shorey and Amit Sial. Titli had to be someone new. Fortunately, we were able to get the actors we wanted. Actors bring people to life, they break patterns, add spontaneity and make it real. We extensively workshop-ed with exercises designed to create a memory bank of experiences (backstories) for the characters to invest their performance with.

So did exploring your personal experience turn out to be cathartic?

It has been a cathartic experience because my father plays one of the characters, the father. So in many ways, it was an interesting experience… But the catharsis is a little over-hyped. I can’t say it changed me completely but I was able to understand everything much better. If that’s being at peace, yes, it has been cathartic. But it hasn’t been a huge emotional curve. The writing experience, penning it down, thinking about everything… proved to be much more interesting than making the film.

Not sure how appropriate this question is, but you also made peace and roped in your ex-wife Namrata Rao to edit the film. How did that go?

Nobody could understand the film more than she could. I knew I could go back to her and we worked closely on it. She knows the milieu, she knows the world, the characters, because she’s lived in Delhi. She was a boon... She helped turn it around in a way that wouldn’t have been possible otherwise.

So basically you had one of the best directors backing you, the biggest banner producing it, one of the top editors editing it and now Guneet selling it.

It all sounds hunky dory from what you are saying, but it was sensitive and tricky material. The early period of writing was pretty difficult. I was a young writer who had a weird story, an anti-establishment story that takes on one of the holy grails of Indian cinema — the family. First, I was on my own. Then I convinced Sharat to write it. We spent 18 months and got into the NFDC Screenwriters Lab. The script got some weight behind it.
I had pitched something else to Dibakar when he was making Shanghai and he didn’t like it. He had asked me to write something more honest. When he read Titli, he told me: What I told you a year and a half ago has worked. The story is universal and yet personal. It is a really difficult film to make and sensitive films like this get lost during release. He said, let’s get a studio, so it comes out right. But we have to make it with our limited resource ethos... A small indie film is a beast of its own. We shot in Delhi in peak summer in a start-to-finish schedule and it was both physically and emotionally sapping… four or five days before the end of shoot, I wanted to run away.
Even the critically acclaimed Ship of Theseus didn’t quite manage to set the box office on fire. What expectations do you have from Titli?
As filmmakers, we have to realise that cinema is a commercial art form. Certain films have a larger audience and there are others with a limited audience. I started out by actively taking the pressure off myself by asking Dibakar how much to make it in. We cut out the toys — no track, trolley, steadicam. I’m curious to see how it’s received.

What does the Cannes selection mean for the prospects of the film?

I’m too much in the middle of it, doing the sound mix, getting it made as we speak… So I don’t know what it means. A biggish audience is going to see it for the first time and I can’t wait to see the reactions.
