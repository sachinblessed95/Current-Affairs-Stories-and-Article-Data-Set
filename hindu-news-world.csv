Exiled former President of the Maldives Mohamed Nasheed promises to contest elections again
","Mohamed Nasheed, the exiled former President of the Maldives, said on Friday he hoped to contest presidential polls this year, following a surprise Supreme Court ruling that ordered his immediate release.
“Now that all my civil and political rights have been restored, I will be able to contest elections,” he told The Hindu in Colombo.
The Maldives witnessed turmoil on Friday, after the Supreme Court late on Thursday nullified the convictions of Mr. Nasheed and eight others, terming their trials “questionable and politically motivated”. Mr. Nasheed was barred from contesting any election in the Maldives after his controversial 2015 conviction on a terrorism charge.
 

Maldives Supreme Court orders release of former President Mohamed Nasheed, eight others


The development, in the wake of growing allegations of corruption and authoritarianism against President Abdulla Yameen, sparked violent clashes in Male between police and large groups of dissidents. While opposition supporters demanded immediate implementation of the ruling, police used force to disperse the crowd, local sources said.
“The police pepper-sprayed many of us. They were trying to disperse the crowd that had assembled spontaneously in a show of solidarity and to celebrate the verdict,” Rushdha Rasheed, a journalist of Raajje TV, present at the rally, told The Hindu over telephone.
The Supreme Court in its ruling observed that the earlier trials were a violation of the Constitution and international law. The apex court has ordered new trials.
In an official statement issued on Friday morning, the government said it would “vet and clarify” the ruling. On Friday evening, the international spokesperson at the President’s office, Ibrahim Hussain Shihab, said the administration had “shared its concerns” with the Chief Justice over the ruling.
In a press briefing held in Male, Attorney General Uz. Mohamed Anil assured the media that the administration was working with all relevant authorities of the state, to carry out the speedy implementation of the Supreme Court ruling. However, the government is yet to implement the order, according to sources in Male.
 

I will return, even if I have to spend the rest of my life in jail: Mohamed Nasheed


India urged the Maldives government to “respect” the verdict. “In the spirit of democracy and rule of law, it is imperative for all organs of the government of Maldives to respect and abide by the order of the apex court. We also hope that the safety and security of the Indian expatriates in Maldives will be ensured by the Maldivian authorities under all circumstances,” the Ministry of External Affairs said in a press release.
Meanwhile, President Yameen dismissed the Commissioner of Police, Ahmed Areef. According to opposition sources and local media reports, the top cop tried to take measures to implement the ruling on Friday, even as some within the police and military reportedly resisted it. Asked about the Commissioner’s sudden removal, the President’s office confirmed the move, but did not give a reason.
On the apparent reluctance of the Yameen administration to act on the ruling, Mr. Nasheed said: “President Yameen knows that if he implements it, we [the Opposition] would have a majority in Parliament. He is reluctant because he does not want to contest elections against me.”
Mr. Nasheed has been living in London since 2016, after the U.K. granted him political asylum. The likely re-entry of Mr. Nasheed foretells a significant change in politics in Male, especially at a time when opposition forces were finding it hard to field a candidate to fight Mr. Yameen in polls.
Male has been buzzing with the prospect of some change for some time now, political sources in Male said, particularly after Opposition forces began working closely with each other in the last year.
In Mr. Nasheed’s view, while a “combination of factors” were likely to have prompted the court ruling, the “last straw” was a recent raid on a resort run by Gasim Ibrahim, a prominent Opposition politician and a high-profile businessman. Critics said the raid was politically motivated.
“Moreover, people have begun realising that there is a strong radical Islamist strand within the government, the deep state. China’s growing debt trap in the island is also concerning many, about the Maldives possibly relinquishing the country’s sovereignty to China,” he said.
Observing that India’s statement on the development was “very welcome”, Mr. Nasheed said India must not only be “more closely engaged” with Male, but also watch the developments closely and make sure the rule of law is upheld in the Maldives.

Face of money: Ukrainian artists create Trump portrait ","They shot to fame in 2015 with a portrait of Vladimir Putin made of bullet shells from the killing fields of eastern Ukraine. Now, the two Ukrainian artists are back with a portrait of Donald Trump made from coins and poker chips.
Threats forced Daria Marchenko, 35, and Daniel Green, 34, to leave their homeland in November 2016. They now lead an itinerant life, travelling and exhibiting their work in the United States and Latin America. 
The Trump portrait, finished one month ago, is made of nearly 4,000 one cent and five-cent pieces. Poker chips are used for the US president’s shoulders.
The artists are now searching for a place for a public unveiling.
As with their Face of War portrait of the Russian leader, the Trump version, called “Face of Money” plays in the light revealing different expressions. 
They came up with the idea of the enormous portrait — nearly eight foot by five foot — last summer when Mr. Putin ordered the United States to reduce its diplomatic footprint in Russia by 755 employees.
Mr. Trump responded by thanking Mr. Putin, saying it would allow the United States to cut down its payroll and “save a lot of money.” 
“I thought, ‘oh my God, you are so cheap, how can you be American president’?” says Mr. Green. “At that moment, I thought coins is the best way to show his portrait.”
The duo deliberately chose one cent and five-cent pieces, the smallest denominations of U.S. currency, to illustrate their point.
The poker chips are a nod to the casinos the billionaire once ran in Atlantic City, New Jersey.

Japan’s ‘Insta-gran’ turns famous
","An 89-year-old Japanese woman armed with a camera and an appetite for mischief has shot to fame for taking side-splitting selfies — many of which appear to put her in harm’s way.
Kimiko Nishimoto tweaks the nose of fear: she has amassed more than 43,000 followers in just a few months since she started posting her hilarious snaps on Instagram.
The goofy photos show the fun-loving pensioner riding a broomstick like Harry Potter or, even more alarmingly, knocked over in an apparent traffic accident. “I’ve actually never injured myself taking a photo,” said Ms. Nishimoto at her home in Kumamoto, western Japan.
“I’m always focusing hard on taking a fun photo so I really don’t think about the danger too much,” she explains.
Ms. Nishimoto, who only took up photography aged 72, reveals she quickly became hooked on the hobby after being invited to join a local class.
A decade later she secured her first solo exhibition — held in her home town — but Ms. Nishimoto’s recent decision to showcase snaps of her daredevil stunts on social media has now catapulted her to stardom. Such is her celebrity now that many fans were shut out of her exhibition at a Tokyo gallery in December as it struggled to cope with the crowds.
“At first I didn’t even know that my photos were that popular,” she says, “It’s not so much that I’m trying to shock people, I just take photos that I find funny. It’s just a bit of fun really.”
Ms. Nishimoto manages her social media accounts herself through her smartphone, while her son helps her to set up some of the shots. She has three grandchildren and six great-grandchildren.
Many of Nishimoto’s photos show her face contorted in mock anguish.

Fraternity songbook in Austria glorifies Nazis "," A scandal in Austria over a student fraternity songbook with lyrics glorifying Nazis has put the new government under pressure and prompted soul-searching about the country’s relationship with its past.
The songbook, contained lyrics such as “Step on the gas... we can make it to seven million”, a reference to the six million Jews killed in the Holocaust.
The timing could not have been worse for Udo Landbauer, a candidate for the far-right Freedom Party (FPOe) in elections in Lower Austria State last Sunday — and the Germania fraternity’s vice-president.
After what Mr. Landbauer called a “media witch-hunt” and protesting he knew nothing about the book, the 31-year-old resigned on Thursday and suspended his party membership pending an investigation. The affair has thrown a spotlight on the FPOe and on the fraternities that many senior party members belong to.

‘British press focusses on negative reports on India,’ says India’s High Commissioner in London "," The British press focussed too much on negative stories about India, India’s High Commissioner in London Y.K. Sinha said at an event in Parliament this week, urging parliamentarians and others in both countries to become champions of a stronger bilateral relationship. 
Pointing to the The Times, the Guardian and the Financial Times (the last of which he said had been very bullish on India until very recently), he said stories about India focussed on negative angles. “Where is India’s success story? Why is everyone queuing up to assiduously woo India?: there must be a reason. There is something right happening in India and I’m afraid that story is not being well publicised,” he said at an event organised on the contribution of Indian companies in Britain.
Despite India being set to grow at 7.1% this year and 7.8% next year, it was still being criticised for not growing fast enough, said Mr. Sinha. “India is the story of today and it will be the story of tomorrow... Engaging India is extremely important.” The High Commissioner said that while India and Britain’s long history could be seen as an advantage, it also could be a disadvantage. “People here feel they know India well but I’m afraid they don’t,” he said.
His emphasis on the bilateral relationship was echoed by Baron O’ Neill , the economist who coined the phase BRICS. “India could do so much better,” he said, arguing that given demographic trends, the country could be growing at 12.5%. 
“Between 2015 and 2035 just the increase in India’s working age population will be bigger than the combined working population of the four largest EU countries… if that translates into people actually having jobs... in my judgment, India could easily repeat in the next 20 years at least what China has done in the past 30 years and grow by double digits... They need to do more stuff in order to achieve this,” he said. 
PM’S U.K. visit 
The High Commissioner also highlighted Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s forthcoming visit to Britain — which will combine the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in London in April and a bilateral visit. 
The Commonwealth had until recently suffered from “benign neglect”, he said. As Britain prepared to leave the EU it was time for the country and others to look towards the Commonwealth not just as “an old boy’s club to talk about shared legacies of the past…we have to be forward looking,” said the High Commissioner .

China asks microblogs to tighten web policing "," China on Friday ordered the country’s microblog operators to establish mechanisms to remove false information, in the latest move by authorities to tighten web policing.
The Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) said the Twitter-like microblog platforms had allowed the spread of pornographic, vulgar and fraudulent content.
In addition to making sure to remove such content, companies should also keep a copy of what users post for at least six months, the CAC said in an online statement.
“Microblogging service providers shall play an active role in promoting economic development and serving the general public by promoting the core values of socialism,” it said. The statement did not go into any detail on what the new mechanisms should include.
China tightly controls the Internet through a censorship system known as the “Great Firewall” and closely monitors social media networks for sensitive content. 
Regulations in force since 2000 say websites are responsible for “ensuring the legality of any information” posted on their platforms.
China’s leading microblogging website by far, Sina Weibo, already uses automated scans and censorship teams to remove inappropriate content, but has not disclosed how many employees are involved in the work. 
Regulations that came into force last June require online platforms to get a licence to post news reports about the government, economy, military, foreign affairs, and social issues.

Giants grow in Galapagos nursery
","Crowded under a rock in the Galapagos archipelago, the baby tortoises wait for the sun to go down to leave their shelter.
Nothing disturbs these eastern Santa Cruz tortoises (Chelondis donfaustoi), which were determined just two years ago to be a new species native to the Ecuadoran islands that inspired Charles Darwin.
Kept safe on Santa Cruz island and raised in captivity, their nursery is one of three centres in the archipelago’s national park where 12 species of giant tortoises, unique in the world, are bred.
Stretching their necks and poking their heads out of tiny shells, they nibble on nutritious, starchy leaves of tropical plants brought in from the continent 1,000 km away. Digestion plunges them into afternoon slumber.
Long lifespan
“We let them stay a little hungry. That way, when they return to the wild they go looking for their food,” the director of the national park, Walter Bustos, told AFP.
It’s not yet time to let the tortoises go free. For that, their shells have to be 23 cm to 25 cm long, meaning around four or five years of age. That’s an insignificant span for these reptiles that can live up to a century and a half, reaching up to two meters (over six feet) long and weighing up to 450 kilograms.
Up until 2002, the scientific community believed all the tortoises on Santa Cruz island, the second biggest in the Galapagos, came from the same species, Chelonoidis porteri. But after years of genetic studies it was discovered in 2015 that those on the eastern part of the island, on Cerro Fatal (Deadly Hill), were a species apart: Chelonoidis donfaustoi.
There are not many of them, fewer than 400, and the threat of predators prompted park authorities to collect their eggs to hatch them and raise the babies in protective captivity to ensure their survival.
The plan is to release them, once mature, in the same spot where their original nests were found.

Trump accuses Justice Department, FBI of pro-Democrat bias
"," U.S. President Donald Trump publicly attacked the FBI’s leadership on February 2, accusing them of politicising their investigations in favour of Democrats as he gets set to approve the release of an explosive memo alleging the agency’s abuse of power.
The extraordinary accusation is the latest salvo in the President’s open conflict with the top U.S. law enforcement agency amid an investigation into possible Trump campaign collusion with a Russian effort to sway the 2016 presidential elections.
Mr. Trump is expected to give a green light for the the publication of a Republican-drafted memo accusing the agency of abuses in obtaining a warrant to monitor a member of Mr. Trump’s campaign team over his contacts with Russian officials. 
“The top Leadership and Investigators of the FBI and the Justice Department have politicized the sacred investigative process in favour of Democrats and against Republicans,” Mr. Trump tweeted. He called the alleged bias “something which would have been unthinkable just a short time ago. Rank & File are great people!”
Mr. Trump nominated both Attorney-General Jeff Sessions and FBI director Christopher Wray as leaders of their respective departments. The Republican President hand-picked the latter to replace James Comey, whom he abruptly sacked in May 2017.
Now just six months into his tenure, the 50-year-old Mr. Wray — who has made clear he does not support releasing the memo — finds himself on a collision course with the President.
The four-page memo was written by Republican lawmaker Devin Nunes, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, and purports to show the Justice Department and the FBI as deeply politicised, anti-Trump agencies.
Its release would amount to an outright rejection of the FBI’s extraordinary warning on January 30 that it had “grave concerns about material omissions of fact that fundamentally impact the memo’s accuracy”.
Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House intelligence committee, reacted swiftly to the President’s tweet: “The country’s top elected leader has agreed to selectively and misleadingly release classified info to attack the FBI — that’s what would’ve been unthinkable a short time ago.”
Democrats and critics in the intelligence community say the release is a stunt aimed at casting doubt on the independence of the FBI and Justice Department, using very selective information that cannot be countered publicly without revealing more secrets about government counter-intelligence operations.
They hold that the ultimate goal of the memo, with Mr. Trump’s support, is to undermine special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into possible Trump campaign collusion with Russia and possible obstruction of justice.
Speaking to CBS on February 2 morning, Mr. Schiff said the President’s early morning missive made plain that the memo’s release was “designed to impugn the credibility of the FBI — to undermine the investigation; to give the President additional fodder to attack the investigation”. “It’s a tremendous disservice to the American people, who are going to be misled by this — by the selective use of classified information.”
Based on highly classified documents dealing with Russian espionage, Mr. Nunes’ memo is his summary of what lay behind the FBI obtaining a so-called FISA national security warrant in 2016 to monitor Trump campaign official Carter Page, who had many Russian contacts.
Mr. Nunes alleges that the basis of the warrant application was the “Russia dossier”, information on contacts between the Trump campaign and Moscow compiled by former British intelligence agent Christopher Steele.
The dossier remains contentious and unproven, and was financed in part by Democrat Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign — a fact that Mr. Nunes says shows the FBI and Justice Department’s anti-Trump bias and abuse of power.
Paul Ryan, the Republican Speaker of the House of Representatives, defended the memo on February 1 as an attempt to protect American civil liberties. “This memo is not an indictment of the FBI or the Department of Justice,” Mr. Ryan said.
“What it is, is the Congress’s legitimate function of oversight to make sure that the FISA process is being used correctly,” he said, adding “this does not implicate the Mueller investigation.”
Other Republicans, including Representative Jeff Duncan, seemed less reticent to cast it all in a political light.
“Having read ‘The Memo,’ the FBI is right to have ‘grave concerns’ — as it will shake the organization down to its core — showing Americans just how the agency was weaponised by the Obama officials/DNC/HRC to target political adversaries,” Mr. Duncan tweeted.

Man who drove van into London mosque worshippers jailed for 43 years "," A British man found guilty of murder after he drove a van into Muslim worshippers outside a London mosque last June, leaving one dead and injuring many more, was jailed for life on Friday and told he would serve at least 43 years behind bars.
Darren Osborne became obsessed with Muslims after watching a BBC TV drama about child sex abuse involving British Pakistani men and just weeks later carried out the attack in Finsbury Park, north London.
The 48-year-old killed Makram Ali (51), and injured 12 others, two seriously. He was found guilty on Thursday of murder and attempted murder after the jury took less than an hour to reach their verdict.
“This was a terrorist attack. You intended to kill,” said judge Bobbie Cheema-Grubb, sentencing him at Woolwich Crown Court in southeast London.
“You had not been radicalised over a long period of time but your rapid decline into irrational hatred of all Muslims turned you into a danger to the public,” she added. “You will pose a significant risk to members of the public .. for a very long time, perhaps for the rest of your life.”

Van carrying gas canisters injures 18 in Shanghai crash "," The driver of a minivan hauling gas canisters set fire to his vehicle while smoking a cigarette Friday, plowing into pedestrians and bursting into flames, leaving 18 people injured in the heart of the Chinese financial hub of Shanghai. 
Police ruled out the possibility of a deliberate attack and described the crash as an accident. The 40-year-old minivan driver, whom police identified only by his surname Chen, lost control after a fire erupted in his van, which held several plastic bottles of gasoline as well as six canisters of liquid gas.
A cigarette butt found by investigators in the van likely started the fire, Shanghai police said in a statement on Friday evening. They said Mr. Chen had been alone in the vehicle. 
Mr. Chen was being treated for severe smoke inhalation and was in a coma, and nine other people were still hospitalized, police said. Chen works for a Shanghai metals company and had no criminal record but is now under suspicion for transporting dangerous materials. 
The incident, which took place during a morning commute period near Shanghai’s People’s Park and a vast plaza that is also home to the headquarters of the municipal government, provided a brief scare for a city that was hosting British Prime Minister Theresa May. Vehicle attacks by extremists have killed scores globally in recent years, including some in Chinese cities. 
The minivan veered onto a sidewalk and burst into flames around 9 a.m. on busy Nanjing West Road in the heart of Shanghai, a metropolis of almost 25 million people that is widely regarded as China’s most cosmopolitan city. 
“It couldn’t stop, crashed into the corner and caught fire,” said a cleaner who works in a building across the street from the crash site. Like many Chinese, she asked only to be identified by her surname, Xu. 
She told The Associated Press she saw smoke coming out of the van as it drove down the street before careening out of control. 
The website of the local Xinmin Wanbao newspaper and other local news media said the van struck five to six people waiting for a light change at a busy pedestrian crossing. 
Videos on social media showed injured people lying on the pavement next to a Starbucks cafe and others pinned under the tires of the van. Firefighters were seen trying to put out a blaze inside the vehicle. 
Ms. Xu, the cleaner, said she saw two men struggling to pull a person out of the van. “Other people told them to stop. Then the police and ambulance arrived,” she said. 
A man who witnessed the crash on his way to People’s Park said in a video interview carried by Chinese media that the minivan seemed to be moving fast as it veered across the road. 
“The minivan did not slow down. The driver must have been in a panic at the time. He didn’t slow down and just directly crashed,” said the witness, who wasn’t identified. “It was on the other side of the road and made a turn over to this side. People saw it and quickly tried to get away but a lot of people were still hit.” 
The man said firefighters removed liquefied gas canisters from the vehicle.
At the nearby Changzheng Hospital, Shanghai resident Liu Axing told AP that his daughter, Liu Jianying, was crossing the street on her way to work when she was struck by the van. 
She was undergoing surgery for a broken shoulder and pelvis, Mr. Liu said as he pulled up a picture on his phone of his daughter pinned under the vehicle’s front wheel, seemingly unconscious. 
Three people were more seriously injured than her, Mr. Liu added. 
A relative of one patient in the emergency room, who declined to be identified, said at least five or six crash patients were being treated there.
Before police declared the crash an accident, there were fears of a repeat of 2013, when five people, including three attackers, were killed when a four-wheel drive vehicle plowed into a crowd in front of Tiananmen Gate in the center of Beijing. The attack was blamed on separatist extremists from the Turkic Muslim Uighur ethnic group native to northwestern China. 
Vehicle attacks have also taken place in Europe and the United States, most recently in October, when eight people in New York City were killed by an attacker claiming allegiance to the Islamic State group. 
Friday’s crash occurred just as the British Prime Minister was speaking at a business event in Shanghai. Ms. May’s speech was at a forum in the Lujiazui district on the opposite side of the Huangpu River from People’s Park. 
Other speakers at the event included Li Shufu, the chairman of Chinese carmaker Geely, and Nobel Prize-winning physicist Kostya Novoselov. Ms. May on Thursday met Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing as part of her three-day visit aimed at establishing a new trading relationship after Britain leaves the European Union. 
The crash came at the start of the Lunar New Year travel period, when hundreds of millions of people return to their hometowns for the most important family holiday of the year. During the weeks-long travel period, authorities emphasize safety on the road and aboard planes, trains and ferries. 
Li Jing, a professor of disaster management at Beijing Normal University’s School of Social Development and Public Policy, said the incident also points to the need for increased safety awareness in China, where gas canisters and other highly dangerous objects are sometimes transported on flatbed tricycles even in major cities such as Beijing. 
“Because of his complete ignorance of safety rules, his action has amplified harm and risk to the public resulting in such casualties,” Li said of the driver. “It indicates how urgent it is for the government to step up promotion of public safety knowledge and awareness.”

","The Afghan president slammed Pakistan on Friday, blaming it for a wave of massive deadly attacks that have ravaged his nation recently and accusing Islamabad of harboring the Taliban. 
In a televised speech to the nation, Ashraf Ghani insisted the “center of Taliban terrorism is in Pakistan” and demanded that authorities in the neighboring country “show some concrete action to rid their territory of insurgents.” 
Mr. Ghani, flanked by Afghanistan’s top Islamic clerics, also urged those among the Taliban who wanted to talk peace with the government to separate themselves from those who want only to fight. 
On Wednesday, Afghan officials visited Pakistan with what they describe as evidence of Taliban attacks emanating from militant training centers in Pakistan. Afghanistan’s Intelligence Chief Masoom Stanikzai and Interior Minister Wais Ahmed Barmak presented documentation and confessions from arrested insurgents claiming to have been trained in Islamic seminaries in Pakistan. 
“The Afghan nation is waiting for clear action” from Pakistan, said Mr. Ghani, adding that so far Afghanistan got only promises of cooperation from Islamabad. Pakistan’s Foreign Secretary Tehmina Janjua will travel to Kabul on Saturday with Islamabad’s response, after reviewing the Afghan documents. 
Kabul and Islamabad have repeatedly traded accusations that the other is harboring enemy insurgents. 
The United States has also criticised Pakistan for providing sanctuaries for the Taliban, who are fighting U.S. troops in Afghanistan. President Donald Trump accused Pakistan of “lies and deceit” and demanded Pakistan evict Taliban insurgents, particularly the Haqqani network from Pakistani safe havens. The U.S. has suspended military assistance to Pakistan to back its demands. 
Pakistan has denied providing sanctuaries to militants. On Friday, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it stands with Afghanistan “in fighting the menace of terrorism.” 
The ministry’s statement noted that Pakistan has erected 975 security posts along the porous border with Afghanistan, while Kabul set up only 218. It called for more border security from Kabul, saying insurgents in Afghanistan have carried out 417 attacks in Pakistan in 2017. 
Meanwhile, Mr. Ghani said he has ordered a wide-reaching review of Kabul’s security following massive deadly attacks in recent weeks that have left killed nearly 200 and wounded hundreds more. 
“The Kabul people are demanding that we make a serious review of our security arrangements,” he said.

France sends more police to Calais after Eritrean, Afghan migrants clash "," Police reinforcements arrived on Friday in the French port city of Calais after clashes among migrants left 22 people injured, with the interior minister warning of more potential violence among those seeking to cross into Britain. 
Interior Minister Gerard Collomb told reporters in Calais on Friday that five of the victims were injured by gunfire in Thursday’s fighting, blaming migrant traffickers and “totally organized” gangs. Police were seeking a shooting suspect but have made no arrests, he said. 
Firearms are rare among migrants, and the shootings were the most serious clash in recent times among migrants around Calais. 
Mr. Collomb said that while in the past such violence was spontaneous, he said it appears to be growing more organised. He said local authorities have dismantled six migrant trafficking networks already this year, compared to 20 in all of 2017. 
The prefecture of the Pas-de-Calais region said the gunfire was the culmination of a showdown between Afghan and Eritrean migrants, fighting each other with sticks and stones, after a meal distribution near the Calais hospital. 
In a second confrontation, up to 200 Eritrean migrants cornered 30 Afghans near the former site of a makeshift migrant camp that housed thousands of people before it was evacuated and destroyed in 2016. 
Mr. Collomb said the government will start meal distribution to migrants outside Calais in the coming two weeks, instead of leaving it to aid groups, in an effort to stop feeding spots from becoming fixed nodes of tension. 
Insisting that “very few” people successfully sneak across to Britain, Mr. Collomb said, “if you want to go to Britain, you shouldn’t go to Calais.” 
He also called for long-term solutions to speed up asylum decisions and deport economic migrants with no right to refugee status. 
Tensions have been high in Calais since the camp was destroyed. More than 1,130 French security forces have been posted in Calais to keep migrants out of the port and Eurotunnel and to stop them from setting up camps.

Britain’s May discusses trade barriers with China’s Xi "," British Prime Minister Theresa May said on Friday she discussed with Chinese President Xi Jinping the importance of removing barriers to commerce, especially for British food, drink and financial services, as the two countries move toward a future trading arrangement for after the United Kingdom leaves the European Union. 
Ms. May said the two leaders in their Thursday discussions agreed on a “trade and investment review” as a first step to future bilateral arrangements. 
“As President Xi, quoting Shakespeare, said to me yesterday, what’s past is prologue. And I wholeheartedly agree. The U.K. and China are opening a new chapter in our golden era,” Ms. May said. 
Ms. May discussed her meeting with Mr. Xi at a conference in Shanghai where she was introduced by the founder of Chinese online shopping giant Alibaba, Jack Ma. 
She is to fly home later Friday, capping a three-day, three-city visit to China. 
Ms. May’s meeting with Mr. Xi also included discussion of cooperation under China’s “Belt and Road” mega-plan for trade and infrastructure links across Asia. 
Ms. May has been hesitant to endorse the trillion dollar-plus initiative, although on Wednesday she expressed conditional support for British involvement as long as such projects adhere to established global business practices. 
Business deals worth more than 9 billion pounds ($13 billion) were to be announced before her visit ended, Ms. May earlier announced. 
Bolstering ties with China became more urgent after Britain voted in 2016 to leave the EU, compelling it to forge new trade agreements outside of the 28-nation bloc. 
British exports to China are up 60 % since 2010, and China is expected to be one of the U.K.’s biggest foreign investors by 2020. 
Ms. May’s visit coincided with the crash of a minivan into pedestrians in downtown Shanghai on Friday morning in which 18 people were injured. Police ruled the crash an accident caused when the driver set the vehicle on fire by smoking then lost control.

At least 90 migrants feared dead in shipwreck off Libya ","About 90 people were feared drowned after a smuggler’s boat mostly carrying Pakistani migrants capsized off Libya’s coast early Friday, the U.N.’s migration agency said.
Ten bodies have washed ashore near the Libyan town of Zuwara following the tragedy in the early morning, said International Organization for Migration (IOM) spokeswoman Olivia Headon, citing information from its partner agencies. Eight were believed to be Pakistani, and two Libyans.
""We are told that two survivors swam to shore, and one person was rescued by a fishing boat,"" Ms. Headon said by phone from Tunisia's capital to reporters at the U.N. in Geneva. ""We are working to get more details on the [capsizing] and where the survivors are so that we can assist them better.”
The spokeswoman said Pakistani nationals have been taking an increasing share among the number of migrants attempting to cross the Mediterranean to Italy and Europe via Libya. By nationality, Pakistanis made up the 13th largest nationality represented among migrants making the crossing, while they grew to the third-largest national contingent in January.
IOM says 6,624 people crossed the Mediterranean in January about two-thirds of them to Italy alone about a 10-percent increase from a year earlier in January. About 250 people died in the crossing in January, six fewer than a year ago in the same month.

Iran arrests 29 women as headscarf protests intensify "," Tehran police have arrested 29 women for appearing in public without a headscarf as protests against the dress code in force since the Islamic revolution of 1979 intensify, Iranian media reported on Friday.
 Those arrested were accused of public order offences and referred to the state prosecutor’s office, the Fars, ILNA and Tasnim news agencies reported without elaborating.
 Chief prosecutor Mohammad Jafar Montazeri had played down the escalating protests on Wednesday, saying they were “trivial” and “childish” moves possibly incited by foreigners.
 He had been asked about a woman detained earlier this week for standing on a pillar box in a busy street without the mandatory headscarf.
 Unprecedented images of at least 11 women protesting the same way had been widely shared on social media.
 A prominent human rights lawyer told AFP on Tuesday that one of the detained women had her bail set at more than USD 100,000 (80,000 euros).
 Mr. Montazeri said those flouting “hijab” rules -- which require headscarves and modest clothing -- must have been encouraged by outsiders.
 But even religiously conservative Iranians have voiced support for the protests, with many saying that religious rules should be a personal choice.
 At least two photos shared on Twitter on Wednesday showed women in traditional black chador robes, standing on pillar box with signs supporting freedom of choice for women.
 One held a sign reading: “I love my hijab but I’m against compulsory hijab.” 
Female activist Azar Mansouri, a member of the reformist Union of Islamic Iranian People party, said attempts to control female clothing had failed over many decades.
 “Women show their opposition to such forceful approaches by their very clothing, from resisting covering their hair to wearing long boots and leggings,” she wrote in a series of tweets this week.
 Women have increasingly flouted the Islamic republic’s clothing rules in recent years and often let their headscarves fall around their necks.
 Morality police once rigidly enforced the rules, but are a much less common sight since President Hassan Rouhani came to power in 2013, promising greater civil liberties.
 The protests appear to mirror that of a woman who stood in Tehran’s busy Enghelab (Revolution) Street in December without a headscarf and waving a white scarf on a stick.
 She was reportedly kept in detention for nearly a month and has since kept a low profile.

Trump again bats for merit-based immigration
","United States President Donald Trump has reaffirmed that he favours an immigration system which is fair, equitable and based on merit instead of visa lottery, a mechanism he described as “terrible.”
He made the remarks on Thursday during his address to the 2018 House and Senate Republican Member Conference in West Virginia.
“We want an immigration policy that is fair, equitable, but that is going to protect our people. We want people coming into our country based on merit and based on the fact that they are going to love our country, respect our people and our country,” Mr. Trump said.
“We don’t want visa lottery. ‘Pick a lottery ticket. Pick a lottery.’ We don’t want that. So we want it [immigration] based on merit,” he said to a wide applause from Republican lawmakers.
The White House had earlier defended President Trump’s proposal for a merit-based immigration system, saying the flood of low-skilled immigrants into the US has suppressed wages, harmed American workers, and strained federal resource.
Mr. Trump told the Republican conference on Thursday that the Congress now had a chance to pass into law the immigration reforms that the American people have been demanding for decades and that many of them have been working on for their entire careers.
“We have a great opportunity as a Republican Party. As the Republican Party, we have a great opportunity. We are getting very little help from the Democrats, but I hope after I leave this room, we’re going to get a call from these people saying, ‘Let’s go’,” the President said.
Mr. Trump said nearly seven in 10 Americans support an immigration reform package that includes a permanent solution on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals or DACA.
DACA recipients are often referred to as ‘Dreamers’ — people who were brought to the US as children by their parents.
“And I’ve been hearing about DACA for so many years. Some people call it DREAMers. It’s not DREAMers, don’t fall into that trap. It’s just much different than DREAMers. And I said the other night, you know, we have dreamers too. We have dreamers in this country, too. You can’t forget our dreamers. I have a lot of dreamers here,” he said. He alleged that the Opposition Democrats do not want to help the ‘dreamers’
“We want to take care of DACA, and I hope we will. We need the support of the Democrats in order to do it, and they might not want to do it. They talk like they do, but I don’t think they do. But we’re going to find out very soon,” he said.
“We want something that is very, very tough and strong, in terms of the border. We need to end chain migration, and we need to cancel the terrible visa lottery. And those are the four pillars that I talked about the other night. We call them the White House framework — a plan that will finally bring our immigration system into the 21st Century,” Mr. Trump said.

U.S. wants Pakistan to act against terrorist sanctuaries
"," The U.S. has made it clear that it expects Islamabad to take action against terrorists in sanctuaries inside Pakistan, a top American diplomat has said.
 Deputy Secretary of State John J Sullivan, who recently returned from a visit to Afghanistan, said the U.S. also expects Pakistan to contribute to a lasting and enduring peace in the region.
 “That was certainly part of my conversations with the Afghan leadership,” Mr. Sullivan said in a briefing with reporters on his return.
 “We have made clear to the Pakistani government our expectations for them to take action against terrorists that are in sanctuaries in Pakistan, to reduce the pressure and the threat of violence in Afghanistan,” he said.
 The trip to Afghanistan, Mr. Sullivan said, was an important opportunity for him to reaffirm the U.S.’ commitment to strengthening its partnership with the country.
 He met with Afghan President Ashraf Ghani; Chief Executive, Dr. Abdullah Abdullah; Foreign Minister Salahuddin Rabbani and other government leaders during the visit.
 “During each of these meetings, Afghanistan’s leadership made it clear to me that despite the recent tragic events, the Afghan government will continue to work to create the necessary conditions to bring the Taliban to the negotiating table, and establish an environment for a sustained peace,” Mr. Sullivan said.
 “We applaud this conviction, as the path to peace and reconciliation must be an Afghan-led and Afghan-owned process, as we have laid out in the President’s South Asian strategy,” he said.
 Mr. Sullivan rued that despite everyone wanting peace at this stage, the Taliban still seemed unwilling to come to the negotiating table.
 “The Taliban’s reprehensible attacks targeting innocent civilians demonstrate that they are not ready to enter into good faith peace negotiations,” Mr. Sullivan said.
 “The U.S. will continue to support its Afghan partners to defeat the ISIS, Al-Qaeda, and other terrorist groups in Afghanistan, and deny them and their affiliates safe haven and material support,” he said.
 Mr. Sullivan said he discussed security cooperation, and the importance of holding timely, credible and inclusive parliamentary and presidential elections with the Afghan leaders.
 “During an executive committee meeting of the Afghanistan compact, we reviewed Afghanistan’s progress in the areas of security, governance, rule of law, economic development and peace and reconciliation,” he said.
 Responding to a question, Mr. Sullivan said President Donald Trump’s recent comments ruling out talks with the Taliban is a reflection of the ground realities.
 “Our policy is to continue to put pressure on the Taliban to bring them, eventually, with patience and perseverance, to peace talks that are Afghan-led and Afghan-owned,” he said.

Dallas man executed for May 2001 killings of daughters
","A former Dallas accountant condemned for fatally shooting his two young daughters while their mother listened helplessly on the phone was put to death in Texas.
John David Battaglia received lethal injection for the May 2001 killings of his 9-year-old daughter, Faith, and her 6-year-old sister, Liberty. Battaglia and his wife had separated and the girls were killed at his Dallas apartment during a scheduled visit.
The punishment was carried out after the U.S. Supreme Court rejected appeals from his lawyers to review his case, contending Battaglia, 62, was delusional and mentally incompetent for execution.
His was the nation’s third execution this year, all in Texas.
The 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals earlier in the day rejected an appeal that argued a lower court improperly refused his lawyers money to hire an expert to further examine legal claims of his mental competency.
The Supreme Court has ruled that prisoners can be executed if they’re aware the death penalty is to be carried out and have a rational understanding of why they’re facing that punishment.
Attorneys for Battaglia contended he didn’t have that understanding and that the state’s highest court, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, misapplied the Supreme Court’s guidance when it ruled that Battaglia is competent.
State attorneys said the Texas courts ensured proper legal standards were followed and that Battaglia had been provided expert help and a court hearing in accordance with Supreme Court precedents.
Another unsuccessful appeal challenged the effectiveness of the pentobarbital Texas uses as its execution drug.

Fidel Castro’s eldest son commits suicide: Cuban media
"," Official Cuban website Cubadebate said Fidel Castro Diaz-Balart, eldest son of late Cuban revolutionary leader Fidel Castro, committed suicide on Thursday aged 68. Mr. Diaz-Balart had been in a “deeply depressed state.” A brief note read on state television said his treatment had “required an initial hospitalization then outpatient follow-up.” 
Mr. Diaz-Balart was known for his resemblance to his father, earning him the nickname Fidelito or Little Fidel. He studied nuclear physics in the former Soviet Union and served as scientific adviser to Cuba’s Council of State. He was vice-president of the Cuban Academy of Sciences. He previously led its nuclear program. 
Mr. Diaz-Balart was born to Fidel Castro’s first wife, Mirta Diaz-Balart, a woman from Cuba’s aristocracy who Fidel married in his youth before beginning the revolutionary struggle that later brought him and his brother Raul to power.
By his maternal lineage, Mr. Diaz-Balart is cousin to Republican Congressman Mario Diaz-Balart, who represents Cuban exiles in Florida. 
Fidel Castro, the father, died in November 2016 at the age of 90.

All 955 miners trapped for over a day in South Africa gold mine 'unharmed'
","All 955 gold miners who were trapped underground for more than a day in South Africa following a power cut resurfaced unharmed on Friday, the mine’s owner, Sibanye Gold, said.

The miners were stuck in the Beatrix gold mine, in the small town of Theunissen near the city of Welkom, for around 30 hours after a massive power outage caused by a storm prevented lifts from bringing workers on the night shift to the surface.
After several hours engineers were able to restore power, allowing the hoist to bring up the miners — who had been trapped since Wednesday evening — in batches.
Asked if there had been any casualties, Mr. Wellsted said there was “no indication so far that anyone has been in distress"" although it had been a ""traumatic experience.”
Several ambulances arrived on-site overnight, the AFP reporter said.
Nervous family members had earlier patiently gathered along the road to the shaft, kept at a distance by security guards.

Vehicle ploughs into pedestrians in Shanghai, injuring 18 "," Eighteen people were injured on Friday, three seriously, after a vehicle caught fire and mounted the pavement in a busy part of central Shanghai and ploughed into pedestrians, said police.
According to preliminary investigations, the fire was caused by a 40-year-old driver surnamed Chen who was smoking a cigarette inside the vehicle, the Shanghai public security bureau said on its official Weibo feed. Mr. Chen, who is currently receiving treatment, is suspected of illegally transporting dangerous substances, police said.
The Shanghai government said in a short statement the vehicle hit the pedestrians on a road running next to People's Square, injuring 18 people, three of them seriously.
Shanghai-based news portal The Paper said the vehicle was a minivan, and cited eyewitnesses as saying it was on fire as it drove onto the pavement, knocked people down and came to a stop in front of a Starbucks outlet.
A Shanghai-based Starbucks spokesman told Reuters the store was not damaged and its customers and employees were safe. “The store is currently closed and we will assist the authorities in their investigations,” he said.
The incident coincides with a visit to the city by British Prime Minister Theresa May.

Maldives Supreme Court orders release of former President Mohamed Nasheed, eight others
","In a surprise ruling Thursday evening, the Supreme Court of the Maldives ordered the immediate release of exiled former leader Mohamed Nasheed and eight others, terming their trials a violation of the constitution and international law.
The apex court has ordered new trials, citing the “questionable and politically motivated nature of the trials of the political leaders,” according to a news report of the AFP.
The government has said the administration “is currently working to vet and clarify” the ruling, and sources in Male indicate that the order is yet to be implemented.
“While the ruling makes significant implications on various points of constitutional import and criminal justice procedures, it was issued without representation of the State from either the Attorney General or the Prosecutor General,” international spokesperson at the President’s office Ibrahim Hussain Shihab said in a statement.
Tweeting on the development, former President Nasheed said late Thursday: “Welcome tonight’s SC ruling calling for the immediate release of political prisoners and the restoration of their civil and political rights. President Yameen must abide by this ruling and resign. Urge all citizens to avoid confrontation and engage in peaceful political activity.”
Even as the Male administration has said it will work to engage, and consult with, the Supreme Court in order to comply with the ruling, the police have reportedly clashed with dissidents on the streets of the capital early Friday, as they demanded the release of politicians whose convictions were overturned. “The police pepper-sprayed many of us there. They were trying to disperse the crowd that had assembled spontaneously in a show of solidarity and to celebrate the verdict,” Rushdha Rasheed, a journalist of local news channel Raajje TV, who was present there, told The Hindu over telephone.  
With his terrorism conviction now lifted, Mr. Nasheed will be able return to Male. He has been in London since 2016, when the United Kingdom granted him political asylum. As the Indian Ocean island prepares for Presidential polls this year, the SC ruling and his possible return foretells a significant change in the course of politics in Male.
President Abdulla Yameen's official website said the defence minister had called on the Maldivian people to put on a united front and work together to maintain peace and stability.
U.S. Ambassador for Maldives Atul Keshap welcomed the Supreme Court decision. “I urge the government and security services to respect this ruling, which bolsters democracy and rule of law all Maldivians,” Mr. Keshap tweeted.
The country has been mired in political unrest since Nasheed, its first democratically elected leader, was ousted in 2012. He was later sentenced to 13 years in jail on terrorism charges after a trial denounced as hasty and unfair by the United Nations human rights chief.
Mr. Nasheed, who has been in exile in the United Kingdom but wants to contest a presidential poll this year, had sought U.N. help to restore his political rights. The joint opposition in a statement welcomed the rulings and called for the immediate resignation of President Yameen.
“The Supreme Court's verdict effectively ends President Yameen's authoritarian rule,” it said in a statement.

Suicide bomber kills at least 3 soldiers in northern Pakistan "," At least three soldiers were killed and seven wounded on Saturday in a suicide attack on an army base camp in northern Pakistan, officials said, in a region that was once controlled by a local faction of the Taliban.
Attacks have decreased sharply in the picturesque Swat Valley but can cause alarm in a region where Pakistani Taliban insurgents took partial control in 2007, before being ousted two years later in a major military operation hailed as an important blow against Islamist violence.
Swat was the first sizeable region outside Pakistans lawless tribal regions bordering Afghanistan to fall to the militants. More than 2,000 Taliban fighters have been driven out of the region, government officials say.
The Pakistan Army's public relations wing said in a statement that the “suicide attack” in the Swat Valley took place at the “army unit sports area"".
A security official who asked not to be identified said the suicide bomber blew himself up as soldiers were playing a volleyball match that was being watched by a number of local civilians.
He added that the casualty count could rise as a large number of people had gathered in the area.
The attack was claimed by the Tehreek-e-Taliban, also known as the Pakistani Taliban, in a statement sent to the media.
“God willing Tehreek-e-Taliban has started the process of revenge attacks,” Taliban spokesman Mohammad Khurasani said in the statement. “Wait for more [attacks] to follow.”
The military has been on alert for signs of a Taliban resurgence as it seeks to rebuild civilian institutions and win over the local population as a bulwark against radical ideology.
Since being chased out the region, the Taliban have carried out revenge attacks against anti-militancy activists and attempted to extort money from business owners in a region where Pakistan has stationed more than 4,000 soldiers.
Pakistan's Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi condemned the attack in a region that has also increasingly become an important part of the country's domestic tourism industry, with ski resorts popping up along the hills of the Swat Valley.
“No cowardly attack can deter us in pursuing our struggle against the menace of terrorism to its logical conclusion. We will continue our fight till the last trace is rooted out,” the prime minister said in a statement.

Syrian militants down Russian fighter jet, kill pilot
","Al-Qaeda-linked militants in Syria downed a Russian fighter jet on Saturday and killed its pilot after he ejected from the plane and landed on the ground in the embattled northwestern province of Idlib. The pilot resisted being captured and fired at the militants who then shot and killed him, according to one of the militants and Syrian monitors.
The Russian Defense Ministry confirmed the downing of the Su-25 and said the pilot was killed in fighting with “terrorists.” A report on the ministry’s Zvezda TV said preliminary information indicated the plane was shot by a portable ground-to-air missile in an area under control of al-Qaeda’s branch in Syria.
The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the plane was downed on Saturday afternoon near the rebel-held town of Sarqeb, which Syrian troops have been trying to take under the cover of Russian airstrikes.
Russia is a key ally of President Bashar Assad, and has been waging a military campaign on behalf of his forces since 2015. Since then, Syrian troops have captured wide parts of the country and in recent weeks have been making advances in Idlib. The province is also a base for al-Qaeda’s branch in Syria and other Islamic groups.
A Syrian militant in the area told The Associated Press that the Russian pilot was shot and killed when he resisted capture. The pilot opened fire from his pistol as the militants were trying to seize him, said the militant, who refused to be identified by his real name because was not authorized to speak to the media.
A video circulating on social media shows a lifeless body of a man, his face stained with blood, as bearded gunmen stand around him. One of the armed men shouts: “He is Russian.” The authenticity of the video could not be independently confirmed but it corresponded to events reported by the AP.
Earlier in the day, the Observatory and the media arm of al-Qaeda-linked militants reported intense airstrikes in Idlib. The Observatory reported more than 35 airstrikes on Saraqeb since late Friday, adding that many of its residents are fleeing.
The Ibaa News Agency of the al-Qaeda-linked Levant Liberation Committee, said Russian and Syrian warplanes and helicopter gunships have been pounding Saraqeb and the village of Tel Mardeekh in Idlib since the early hours of Saturday.
Syria’s state news agency, SANA, said Syrian troops captured the village of Maasaran as well as the Tel Tokan hill, cutting links between Saraqeb and the rebel stronghold of Maarest al-Numan to the south.
Syrian government forces and their allies launched a push into Idlib six weeks ago, inching closer to a key highway that connects Syria’s two largest cities, Damascus and Aleppo.
The U.N. says more than 270,000 people have been displaced in Idlib because of the government onslaught since Dec. 15.
Meanwhile, fighting raged on Saturday between Turkish troops and allied Syrian opposition fighters, and a Syrian Kurdish militia in the northern Syrian enclave of Afrin.
The Turkish military said two of its soldiers were killed in Syria and a third was killed on the Turkish side of the border in an attack by Syrian Kurdish militiamen.
The military said Saturday’s deaths were related to Turkey’s operation against Syrian Kurdish-held Afrin, codenamed Olive Branch. One of the soldiers was killed when a Turkish tank was hit in Afrin.
A total of eight Turkish soldiers and at least 24 allied Syrian opposition fighters have died so far in Ankara’s offensive, which started on Jan. 20.
The Turkish operation aims to clear Afrin of the U.S.-backed Syrian Kurdish militia, known as the People’s Protection Units or YPG, which Turkey considers to be a terrorist group and an extension of the Kurdish insurgency within its borders.
Turkish presidential spokesman said Turkey will not tolerate the presence of a Syrian Kurdish militia “anywhere” along its southern border, hinting that Ankara might expand its military operation underway in the Syrian enclave of Afrin eastward.
The spokesman, Ibrahim Kalin, said Saturday that Turkey’s first demand is to see the YPG move east of the Euphrates River and leave the town of Manbij, where American troops backing the Syrian Kurdish fighters are stationed.
Mr. Kalin called on the United States to “disengage” from the YPG and said Turkey will continue communications with “our American allies to avoid any confrontation.”
Turkey shares a 911-kilometer border with Syria. The YPG controls much of the territory along the border and an uninterrupted strip from Manbij to the Iraqi border.

Maldives govt. yet to implement SC ruling ","Nearly 48 hours after the Maldives Supreme Court overturned the conviction of nine opposition leaders, including the exiled former President, Mohamed Nasheed, the Male administration is yet to release them, raising domestic and international concern over the delay.
On Saturday, authorities indefinitely postponed Monday’s Parliament session, citing “security reasons”, and the government dismissed the acting police commissioner from the post, a day after it sacked the police commissioner, following a tweet from the Maldives police saying it would uphold the Supreme Court ruling.
The Joint Opposition, including the Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP) led by Mr. Nasheed, has expressed concern over President Abdulla Yameen’s “refusal” to abide by the ruling. “We are deeply fearful that the government’s refusal to implement the Supreme Court order could escalate unrest and incite violence across the country,” it said in a statement.
The government has maintained that it needed to “vet and clarify the order”. “No deadlines are being considered at this point — the focus is on , through consultations, implementing the ruling in the swiftest manner possible within the proper rules of procedure,” Ibrahim Hussain Shihab, the international spokesperson at the President’s office in Male, told The Hindu.
President Yameen has said he did not expect the ruling. In a report published on Saturday evening, the Male-based Maldivian Independent quoted Mr. Yameen as saying: “I didn’t expect this Supreme Court ruling at all, but as they are the top court and there’s a ruling, the state and all relevant authorities have to do a lot of work to see how to implement it.”
Addressing supporters gathered in Male, Mr. Yameen said: “If they [the Opposition] need to see who has support now, if it takes holding elections early I would do that.”
The administration has neither released the nine persons, nor reinstated the 12 parliamentarians expelled earlier for defecting, despite the order mandating both. If reinstated, the legislators would raise the Opposition number in Parliament to a majority. The developments have sparked greater anxiety among locals critical of the Yameen administration.
“I hear that my husband has been shifted to another prison and kept in isolation,” Mariyam Nashwa, wife of former Vice-President Ahmed Adeeb, told The Hindu over telephone. Mr. Adeeb was among the nine persons the apex court named for immediate release, pending a fresh trial.
For months, Ms. Nashwa has been pleading with the authorities to grant medical leave to her husband who was diagnosed with glaucoma. “He has also been advised cancer screening, but even after the ruling, the government is refusing to release him.”
After the ruling, India, the U.S. and the EU, among others, have urged the government to respect the order and ensure that democracy and rule of law prevail.
Top UN officials and human rights watchdogs are also putting pressure on Male to comply with the order. The UN Secretary-General even offered to facilitate all-party talks to find a solution to the “political stalemate” in the Maldives.
“For the rule of law to retain any meaning, this ruling must be implemented and the witch-hunt against the political Opposition and other critics must come to an end,” said Biraj Patnaik, Amnesty International’s South Asia Director.
Following inaction for two days, countries, including the U.K., have issued travel advisories warning visitors of possible violence in Male, given the mounting frustration among people awaiting government action.

Ramallah gets its ‘MeToo’ campaign
","A young Palestinian-American is the driving force behind a nascent #MeToo movement in this patriarchal corner of the world, selling T-shirts, hoodies and denim jackets with the slogan “Not Your Habibti (darling)” as a retort for catcalls and writing down women’s complaints from her perch in a West Bank square. 
Yasmeen Mjalli, 21, wants to encourage Palestinian society to confront sexual harassment, a largely taboo subject. “What I am doing is to start a conversation that people are really afraid to have,” said Ms. Mjalli. 
Palestinian police receive few complaints about street harassment, said spokesman Loay Irzeqat. He believes some women fear unintended consequences, such as male relatives attacking accused harassers. 
Police mostly deal with online harassment, with about one-third of some 2,000 electronic crimes cases in 2017 revolving around men blackmailing women for sexual or financial gain, he said. Typically, extortionists threaten to publish photos deemed compromising, such as showing a traditional woman without her headscarf. 
Women lack legal protection, despite improvements such as the establishment of a police sex crimes unit, said Amal Kreishe, founder of the Palestinian Working Woman Society for Development to which Ms. Mjalli donates some of her proceeds. 
Still, Ms. Kreishe has witnessed gradual changes. More women seek counseling from her group, which has referred about 200 complaints to police over the past two years compared to a few dozen in previous years.

Tillerson plays up U.S.-Mexico cooperation in ‘war on drugs’
","U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson insisted on Friday that the U.S. and Mexico are bolstering cooperation in the fight against drug trafficking, brushing aside concerns about the impact of his boss Donald Trump’s anti-Mexican barbs. The U.S.-Mexican relationship has been strained by Mr. Trump’s attacks on Mexican immigrants and the North American Free Trade Agreement — and his insistence on building a border wall.
But as Mr. Tillerson kicked off his first major tour of Latin America, he and his Mexican counterpart sought to play down any tensions, focussing instead on fighting what Mr. Tillerson called the “devastating impact” of the international narcotics trade. “We’ve created... a different approach as to how we cooperate to attack the entire supply chain of this devastating impact of drugs — cocaine, heroin, fentanyl, opioids,” Mr. Tillerson said after meeting with Mexican Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray and Canada’s Chrystia Freeland in Mexico City.
Mr. Videgaray said all three countries had agreed to place “special emphasis” on fighting both the supply and demand side of the problem: the Mexican drug cartels fuelling a wave of bloodshed in his country, and the U.S. and Canadian consumption making it a multi-billion-dollar business. 
However, Mr. Videgaray stayed mum as Mr. Tillerson sought to explain Mr. Trump’s wall proposal and immigration crackdown as part of a shared security push.
The three also found common ground on the Venezuela crisis, calling for President Nicolas Maduro’s government to restore constitutional rule.

U.S. officials crack down on ‘sanctuary State’ California
","U.S. immigration officials said on Friday that they raided 77 California businesses this week as operations intensify in the State, whose own authorities are defying President Donald Trump’s hard line on immigration by not cooperating with federal enforcement agents. 
The raids took place in cities including San Francisco, Sacramento and San Jose in the north of California — a “sanctuary State” where, since January 1, law enforcement has been mostly prohibited from working with federal officials seeking to arrest undocumented immigrants. “The actions taken this week reflect... stepped-up efforts to enforce the laws that prohibit businesses from hiring illegal workers”, with a focus on “protecting jobs for U.S. citizens and others who are lawfully employed”, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) said in a statement.
In 2017, the government carried out 1,360 similar raids and arrested more than 300 people — with businesses paying out over $100 million in restitution and fines, ICE said. 
U.S. immigration authorities also recently adopted a policy that allows officials to enter courtrooms to arrest undocumented immigrants. Previously, courtrooms were considered “sanctuaries” so as to not discourage witnesses from testifying during trials. Meanwhile last month, ICE agents carried out visible raids on around 100 7-Eleven convenience stores across the country to discourage managers from hiring undocumented workers.

Cheating encouraged in new Monopoly version ","Do not pass Go. Do not collect $200: just steal it.
A new version of the decades-old board game Monopoly encourages players to cheat, but plastic handcuffs will leave them “locked up” if they are caught. The aim of the game remains as it has been since its creation in 1935: to become the richest player through buying properties and collecting rent.
But a recent study “revealed that nearly half of game players attempt to cheat during Monopoly games, so in 2018, Hasbro decided it was time to give fans what they’ve been craving all along,” a statement from Monopoly’s manufacturer said. The “Cheaters Edition” will be available at the end of this year.
It adds 15 cheat cards covering the most common types of traditionally unsportsmanlike play such as moving tokens more spaces than allowed by the dice, avoiding rent, or stealing money from the bank.
If they can get away with it before the next players’ turn, the “cheaters” will be rewarded with Monopoly money, a hotel, or $200 from the bank. “But get caught and you’ll pay the consequences! Pretend handcuffs will leave offenders “chained” to the board until they are released,” Hasbro says.
In another change, there is no longer a designated banker. Each player controls the central money pool during his or her turn — making it easier to pull off a heist.
While Hasbro says it “has finally decided to embrace our less-than-honest fans by encouraging them to partake in those iconic (yet sometimes unspoken) Monopoly moments,” the new version has its detractors.
“Monopoly is a horrible game,” and a cheaters’ monopoly would be even more so, said Edward Castronova, a specialist in media and games at the University of Indiana.

Massive Mayan ruins found in Guatemala
","Researchers using a high-tech aerial mapping technique have found tens of thousands of previously undetected Mayan houses, buildings, defence works and pyramids in the dense jungle of Guatemala’s Peten region, suggesting that millions more people lived there than previously thought. 
The discoveries, which included industrial-sized agricultural fields and irrigation canals, were announced by an alliance of U.S., European and Guatemalan archaeologists working with Guatemala’s Mayan Heritage and Nature Foundation. 
The study estimates that roughly 10 million people may have lived within the Maya Lowlands, meaning that kind of massive food production might have been needed. “That is two to three times more [inhabitants] than people were saying there were,” said Marcello A. Canuto, a professor of Anthropology at Tulane University. 
Researchers used a mapping technique called LiDAR, which stands for Light Detection And Ranging. It bounces pulsed laser light off the ground, revealing contours hidden by dense foliage. 
The images revealed that the Mayans altered the landscape in a much broader way than previously thought; in some areas, 95% of available land was cultivated.
“Their agriculture is much more intensive and therefore sustainable than we thought, and they were cultivating every inch of the land,” said Francisco Estrada-Belli, a research assistant professor at Tulane University, noting that the ancient Mayas partly drained swampy areas that haven’t been considered worth farming since. And the extensive defensive fences, ditch-and-rampart systems and irrigation canals suggest a highly organized workforce. 
“There’s state involvement here, because we see large canals being dug that are re-directing natural water flows,” said Thomas Garrison, assistant professor of Anthropology at Ithaca College in New York. The mapping detected about 60,000 individual structures, including four major Mayan ceremonial centres with plazas and pyramids.

“We are always overwhelmed at how much interest there is across the whole world for The Spice Girls. The time now feels right to explore some incredible new opportunities together.”
“We all agree that there are many exciting possibilities that will once again embrace the original essence of The Spice Girls, while reinforcing our message of feminine empowerment for future generations.”
On their social media accounts, Bunton promised the “future is looking spicy”, while Horner said Girl Power was “alive and well”.
The girl group have sold 85 million albums worldwide.

Egypt unveils ornate tomb of ancient priestess in Giza
","Egyptian archaeologists on Saturday unveiled the tomb of an Old Kingdom priestess adorned with well-preserved and rare wall paintings.
Antiquities Minister Khaled al-Enany told reporters that the tomb on the Giza plateau near Cairo was built for Hetpet, a priestess to Hathor, the goddess of fertility.
The tomb was found during excavation work in Giza’s western cemetery by a team of Egyptian archaeologists led by Mostafa Waziri, secretary general of the Supreme Council of Antiquities.
The Antiquities Ministry said the cemetery houses tombs of top officials from the Old Kingdom’s Fifth Dynasty (2465-2323 B.C.), and that several have already been dug up since 1842.
The newly discovered tomb “has the architectural style and the decorative elements of the Fifth Dynasty, with an entrance leading to an ‘L’ shaped shrine”, the Ministry said.
“The tomb has very distinguished wall paintings in a very good conservation condition depicting Hetpet standing in different hunting and fishing scenes or... receiving offerings from her children,” it said.
The paintings also show scenes of musical and dancing performances as well as two scenes featuring monkeys — domestic animals at the time — one picking and eating fruit and the other dancing in front of an orchestra. Mr. Waziri said the paintings were unusual.
“Such scenes are rare... and have only been found previously in the (Old Kingdom) tomb of ‘Ka-Iber’ where a painting shows a monkey dancing in front of a guitarist, not an orchestra,” he said. That tomb is located in Saqqara, a necropolis about 20 km south of Cairo.
Mr. Enany said the tomb includes “a purification basin on which are engraved the name of the tomb’s owner and her titles”. “A German expedition had found in 1909 a collection of antiquities carrying this lady’s name, or a lady who has the same name, and these antiquities were moved to the Berlin museum at the time,” he said. “And 109 years later, we find this tomb that carries Hetpet’s name.”
Mr. Waziri said archaeologists will continue to excavate the site and hope to make new discoveries.

Thai students take a jibe at junta’s undeclared watches ","Thai students with huge banners and caricature puppets on Saturday delivered the latest satirical swipe at the junta’s number two — known as the “Rolex General” for his collection of undeclared luxury watches.
The watch scandal has seized a kingdom growing weary of military rule and sparked a spate of creative protests that are challenging the junta’s stranglehold on dissent. On Saturday, students leading an annual pre-football match ceremony in Bangkok wheeled a series of massive parade floats around the pitch — including several poking fun at junta No. 2 Prawit Wongsuwan.
The 72-year-old general has been the a target of public ire ever a since photo circulated of him in December lifting a hand to block his eyes from the sun, revealing a diamond ring and a pricey Richard Mille watch.
Since then, online sleuths have unearthed photos of the junta bigwig wearing some 25 luxury timepieces that he allegedly failed to list when declaring his assets.
One parade float on Saturday showed a puppet in the general’s now iconic sun-blocking pose, with a glittering ring and watch beaming from his massive paper mache hand.
In recent weeks, a growing number of activists have taken to the streets to defy a junta ban on protests and call for elections.

‘N. Korea is flouting sanctions’
","North Korea is flouting sanctions by exporting coal, iron, steel and other banned commodities, earning nearly $200 million in revenue last year, a UN report said on Friday.
A UN panel of experts also found evidence of military cooperation by North Korea to develop Syria’s chemical weapons programmes and to provide Myanmar with ballistic missiles.
North Korea “continued to export almost all the commodities prohibited in the resolutions, generating nearly $200 million in revenue between January and September 2017,” said the report by the experts.
Coal shipments were delivered to China, Malaysia, South Korea, Russia and Vietnam by ships using “a combination of multiple evasion techniques, routes and deceptive tactics,” said the report.
The Security Council last year adopted a series of resolutions to tighten and expand exports bans aimed at cutting off revenue to North Korea’s military programs.
Seven ships have been barred from ports worldwide for violating UN sanctions with coal and petroleum transfers, but the experts said much more must be done to confront “these rampant illicit activities.”
The panel found that North Korea “is already flouting the most recent resolutions by exploiting global oil supply chains, complicit foreign nationals, offshore company registries, and the international banking system.”

Tremors of Afrin attack reach Europe
","Turkey’s military intervention in Afrin, a northwestern Syrian town on the border region, to oust the Kurdish People’s Protection Units (PYG) militia is not only escalating the the conflict in Syria but has also triggered protests and counterprotests by Kurdish and Turkish migrants around the world. Turkey sees the YPG, the militia of the Syrian Kurdistan which is guarding the border towns that were freed from the Islamic State, as an ally of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which has been listed as a terrorist organisation by Ankara.
Military tensions between Turkey and the YPG have been brewing for a few years along the border. With the invasion finally under way, the tension appears to be spilling over to other countries. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has large crowd of supporters among the Turkish diaspora, mostly living in Europe. The same goes for the PKK, which has thousands of Kurdish supporters across Europe. Germany and Austria, where tens of thousands of Turkish and Kurdish migrants have been living for decades, saw several demonstrations late last week. In Austrian and German towns, the protesters marched either for the Turkish government or for the Kurds. Posters of Mr. Erdoğan or Abdullah Öcalan, the jailed leader of the PKK, were everywhere.
However, not every immigrant is happy with the turn of events. “In times of globlisation, people should find a way to engage each other and not fight over political or religious differences. I believe that people like President Erdoğan should not welcome that. The Turkish-Kurdish community is totally split,” said Serkan Kaya, 28, a pharmacist from the city of Innsbruck in Austria. Mr. Kaya, who has Kurdish and Turkish roots, believes the ongoing situation in Afrin “will not just kill innocent people” but also “destroy many friendships”. “In fact, it’s an abuse of the olive branch, which is a symbol of peace,” he said, referring to the code name of the operation.
Turkish immigrants have come out against the war too. “I feel there is a fundamental problem rooted in Turkish society. In no other country the military is so overly glorified and soldiers seen as the pride of the nation,” said Anil Altintas, 26, a student from Berlin. He says many of his compatriots do not take human rights violations by the Turkish military seriously. “The so-called strength of the Turkish nation has been a very popular narrative — not only under Erdoğan but also throughout Turkish history,” Mr. Altintas said.
Demonstrations took place in Turkey as well. Mr. Erdoğan threatened that there will be a “heavy price” for those who protested. Dozens of journalists and social media users have already been arrested for criticising the operation. The crackdown at home is having a ripple effect on the protests abroad.
“It’s problematic. We have already seen escalations during demonstrations. I think it is very obvious that the lines have been drawn clearly. Extreme positions are dominating both sides of the conflict,” said Cengiz Gunay, vice-director of the Vienna-based Austrian Institute for International Affairs.
According to Mr. Gunay, current events make clear that the so-called peace process between the Turkish government and the PKK is truly over. “It is understandable that the local political establishment does not like to see such protests here [in Austria and Germany]. However, they are partially responsible for these developments. Many immigrants, whether Turkish or Kurdish, do not still feel that they have really arrived here.”

The ‘100-yen’ answers to all of life’s needs
","Shopping in Tokyo conjures up images of swanky boutiques and equally swanky price tags. But the Japanese capital’s real retail engine thrums in the tiny, crammed and endlessly inventive environs of the ubiquitous ‘100-yen’ stores. These unassuming giants of consumerism allow the residents of one of the world’s most expensive cities to shop away with scarcely a dent made to their bank accounts.
The ‘100-yen’ stores do exactly what they advertise: sell almost everything on their heaving shelves for ¥100 (plus ¥8 for tax) — about a dollar. But they are more than just a place for cheaply made tat. They are a place for education as well, where the shopper learns about everything she never knew she needed but simply can’t do without after encountering it.
There is scant logic to the arrangement of goods with only the price tag in common: plant fertilisers rub up against laundry bags, and pencil sharpeners are nested with surgical masks. But where else can you find a banana-holder, an owl-shaped egg-maker, a cherry blossom-shaped carrot slicer, bicycle rain-covers, an origami paper, Halloween masks and everything in between? Small wonder that the combined sales of the four largest ‘100-yen store’ operators was estimated at ¥660 billion ($5.85 billion) in the 2016 fiscal, up by 20% over a five-year period. The clear leader of the pack is Daiso, a Hiroshima-headquartered outfit that opened its first store in 1991 and now runs roughly 3,700 shops across the country. Revenue for Daiso, which stocks about 70,000 household items, was ¥420 billion ($3.79 billion) in the last fiscal.
Part of the success of these stores has to do with Japan’s sluggish economy and stagnant wages that have resulted in a consumer culture focussed on bargains. But their history can be traced back to the pre-bubble era street stalls of the 1970s — makeshift outfits that sold cheap stationary and household bric-a-brac. The 1980s saw the rise of supermarkets, which on occasion would stage popular ‘100-yen sales’, but the stores took on their contemporary avatar only about two decades ago.
The ‘100-yen question’ is: How does the entire operation work in economic terms? How can selling goods for so little turn a profit? The answer lies in mass production of products in low-wage countries, bulk ordering by Japanese retailers and elimination of the middlemen. The disparate items available at these stores are not all of equal value. Some are worth only ¥10 at cost, while others are worth well over ¥100. The cheaper items in effect subsidise the pricier ones, balancing out to a figure that has both shop-owners and consumers smiling. What really makes Japan’s ‘100-yen stores’ stand out compared to ‘one-dollar stores’ and their equivalents around the world is not only that the quality of their offerings is often higher than average, but also the ingeniousness of those who design them.
This correspondent’s favourite is the portable trash bag holder, a neat solution to one of Japanese life’s biggest headaches: what to do with one’s rubbish. There are virtually no public trash cans in Tokyo to get rid of increasingly insipid wads of chewing gum or wet wipes oozing baby spit. You usually have to hold on to these in your hands or stuff them in your bag. But a roll of a dozen trash bags in a compact holder that fits into any tote allows one to peel off a bag to toss garbage into and carry it back home mess-free. An elegant ‘100-yen fix’.

Fishing in troubled waters is now costly
","When Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi last month, voicing concern about Sri Lanka’s recent decision to impose steep fines on any foreign vessel found fishing in the island’s territorial waters, he was simply following his late leader Jayalalithaa’s footsteps.
In 2015, she wrote at least 21 letters to the Prime MInister, asking New Delhi to put pressure on Sri Lanka to stop arresting Tamil Nadu fishermen. In 2016, until October, she wrote 22 similar letters, according to officials. Whether it was O. Panneerselvam as Chief Minister, or V.K. Sasikala as the interim general secretary of the ruling AIADMK after Jayalalithaa’s passing, the top leadership has been consistent in this matter. However, Sri Lanka appears to be firm in its position. Amending its exiting Fisheries Act, Colombo has decided to impose anything between LKR 6 million (approximately ₹25 lakh) and LKR 175 million, as fine on foreign vessels fishing in its seas.
‘Fishermen follow fish and fish know no boundaries’ is a common refrain in Tamil Nadu, when it comes to taking a position on the highly-contested Palk Bay fishing conflict. But for all practical purposes, the International Maritime Boundary Line (IMBL) demarcates territory clearly, and most vessels used by Tamil Nadu fishermen — often bottom-trawlers known for their destructive technique that virtually scrapes the sea bed — have GPS systems installed, enabling fishermen to follow their course easily. The issue continues to be a talking point in high-level bilateral meetings, in addition to figuring extensively in the discussions of the Joint Working Group set up by the neighbouring countries to resolve the problem that has been dragging on for a decade.
Following years of bilateral deliberation and the consistent resistance put up by Sri Lanka’s northern fishermen, the two governments came up with some proactive measures. On Tamil Nadu’s part, with assistance from the Centre, efforts are on to convert bottom-trawlers into boats suitable for deep-sea fishing. The State hopes to get 500 deep-sea vessels ready for use this year, according to sources in the Tamil Nadu government.
This, along with Sri Lanka’s ban on bottom-trawling in July 2017, has had some welcome impact. Both the Sri Lankan Navy and the northern fishermen based in Jaffna and Mannar have observed that fewer Indian trawlers are spotted in their waters. However, that their Tamil Nadu counterparts are yet to completely stop trespassing is worrying the northern fishermen.
According to the Department of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources in Colombo, as many 49 Indian fishermen have been arrested from the beginning of this year, and 10 of their boats confiscated. Though some are sceptical about using strong legislation while responding to what is fundamentally a livelihood issue, others feel that is the only option in the absence of other safeguards for fishermen in the war-affected regions in the north. It is in this context that the northern fishermen welcome the higher fines.
Experts have put forth a range of other suggestions, including setting up an autonomous international authority to manage the Palk Bay and its depleting marine resources — initiatives that will warrant much thought, time and effort from both ends. As for northern fishermen, they only wish that Tamil Nadu will take a more honest and comprehensive look at the problem, while making a case for the livelihoods of the fisher-folk in the State.

President, the best friend of Christian Right? ","The rise of Donald Trump has challenged Americans of all stripes to recalibrate their moral compass, but no section has managed the transition as well as the Christian Right, it appears. The full-throated support that the President received from leaders of the Christian ultras over a fresh sex scandal is the latest case in point. The Christian Right has traditionally sought to hinge its political interventions on grounds of instilling Biblical values in public lives, but it now says that the priority is to ensure favourable policy.
Reports on Mr. Trump’s sexual adventures have long ceased to shock the American public and the latest one — that his personal lawyer paid a porn star $1,30,000 to keep mum about an affair — did not rise to the level of a presidential sex scandal.
The report in the Wall Street Journal, which is broadly sympathetic to the administration, revealed that Mr. Trump’s lawyer Michael Cohen arranged the payment to actress Stephanie Clifford after her lawyer negotiated a nondisclosure agreement, during the 2016 election campaign. Several other allegations of sexual misconduct had surfaced against Mr. Trump in 2016, which pushed back Christian groups only momentarily. Evangelical groups supported him in large numbers and continue to do so.
His alleged liaison with the porn star appeared to test the tolerance of the Christian Right that had long loathed the alleged sexual anarchy of the Left. But prominent evangelists were quick to adapt. Franklin Graham, who heads the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association, said this was a “deep state” conspiracy. “I believe we are in a coup d’etat... There are people in this country who are wanting to destroy the President and take over the government by force,” he said in one interview.
More curious was the new theological interpretation of the separation of church and state offered by Jerry Falwell Jr., a prominent minister and president of the evangelical Liberty University. “Jesus said love our neighbours as ourselves but never told Caesar how to run Rome. He never said Roman soldiers should turn the other cheek in battle... or that Caesar should tax the rich to help the poor. That’s our job,” he tweeted, arguing to keep Christian morality and American politics apart.
The Moral Majority movement that his father founded in 1979 had the exact opposite objective — to instill Christian morality in American public life. The Christian Right’s support for Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush was based on their argument that they were “godly leaders”. Over the past three decades, faith-based political activism has transformed in America as liberal churches declined and conservatives tightened their hold on believers.
The Right that rose to prominence called for virtuous people in office, but has changed tack in recent years. A survey during the 2016 campaign found that 72% of white evangelicals thought elected officials who commit an immoral act can still fulfil their public duties, a significant jump compared to 2011 when only 30% of them held that view. Now, the Christian Right says Mr. Trump has been its best friend in terms of policy and cites measures on abortion, immigration and allowing churches to involve in politics as reasons for supporting him. “We certainly don’t hold him up as the pastor of this country, and he’s not. But I appreciate the fact that the President does have a concern for Christian values, he does have a concern to protect Christians — whether it’s here at home or around the world,” Mr. Graham said.

Britain’s privatisation drive hits a snag
","Carillion, one of Britain’s biggest construction outsourcing companies, was expected to hand over a brand new, gleaming building to Royal Liverpool Hospital in the northern English city in March last year. Carillion had begun the construction in 2014. But due to some complications, including the discovery of cracks in concrete beams, the project completion date was put off to early 2018.
However, the hospital remains a building site, after Carillion’s collapse earlier this year. The company went into compulsory liquidation on January 15, with net debts running to around £900 million and a massive pension deficit, after talks with lenders failed to result in further funding. Carillion, which employed 19,500 people in Britain and further tens of thousands abroad, has held around 450 public sector contracts — from the construction of major projects such as the hospital to the electrification of the Network Rail. With much of its work outsourced to third party contractors — Carillion had around 30 firms working for it on the Liverpool hospital project — the impact of the collapse is yet to fully unfold.
The government faced questions over its decision to continue to award contracts to the company amid concerns about its financial health — there were three profit warnings since July and its share price had collapsed 90%. Further, the company courted criticism for its prioritising of shareholders over sound financials: between 2012 and 2016, the company paid out dividends of £376 million to shareholders, more than twice the amount it had generated in net cash. In the last six months alone, before its collapse, the government awarded £2 billion in contracts to Carillion.
At any time, such a dramatic failure would have provoked a debate on the extent of the government’s use of and private contractors to deliver public services but with a Labour Party, led by Jeremy Corbyn, for whom a nationalisation agenda has become a central plank, it’s all the more so. Overturning the Labour’s long-running commitment to privatisation, the 2017 Labour manifesto pledged to bring key utilities back into public ownership.
“This is not one isolated case of government negligence and corporate failure; it is a broken system,” said Mr. Corbyn during an intense session of Prime Minister’s Questions, pointing to other controversial decisions such as the one late last year to allow two transport providers to forgo payments worth up to £2 billion for the franchise for the East Coast mainline. “We need our public services to be provided by public employees with a public service ethos and a strong public oversight.”
Mr. Corbyn is far from a lone voice. A research paper published by the Legatum Institute (a right-wing, Eurosceptic think tank) found a strong appetite for nationalisation, with over three quarters of those polled favouring the nationalisation of key services from water to rail. The Carillion collapse is likely to further strengthen that sentiment.
However, the collapse of Carillion could have far wider consequences, along with official investigations into what went wrong with the company itself. Britain’s accounting watchdog as well as MPs will look into the role of Carillion’s auditor KPMG. During a parliamentary committee session earlier this week, Labour MP Frank Field grilled the head of the accountancy watchdog on the “oligarchy” existing among accountancy firms, and asked whether the so-called ‘Big Four’ — Deloitte, PwC, EY and KPMG — needed to be broken up.

Gunman opens fire on foreigners in Italian town ","A lone gunman opened fire on foreigners in drive-by shootings in a central Italian city, wounding an undisclosed number of people on February 3 morning before being arrested, police said.
The suspect’s motive wasn’t immediately clear, but the city of Macerata is still reeling from the gruesome killing of a young Italian woman this week, allegedly at the hands of a Nigerian immigrant.
Police said all those wounded were foreigners and they later confirmed the arrest of the unidentified suspect about two hours after the shooting erupted in the city of Macerata.
Video posted by the newspaper il Resto di Carlino showed what appeared to be a body on the ground on a shopping street.
The shooting spree came days after the murder of 18-year-old Pamela Mastropietro and amid a heated electoral campaign in Italy where anti-foreigner sentiment has become a key theme. The head of the anti-migrant Northern League, Matteo Salvini, has capitalised on the killing in campaign appearances, and is pledging to deport 150,000 migrants in his first year in office if his party wins control of parliament and he is named premier.
The teen’s dismembered remains were found on January 31 in two suitcases, two days after she walked away from a drug rehab community.
Police haven’t said how many people have been wounded in the February 3 shootings. The news agency ANSA said two of the injured were black, and that witnesses reported that the car was seen in the area where the woman’s body was found and also near where the suspect lived.
Police had warned people to stay inside while the shootings were ongoing. Authorities ordered public transport halted and that students be kept inside schools, which are open on Saturdays.
Italians vote in the general election on March 4.

Book culture returns to post-Jihadist Mosul
","Literary cafes, poetry readings and pavement bookstalls — Mosul’s cultural scene is back in business, months after Iraqi forces ousted the Islamic State (IS) group from the city following three years of jihadist rule.
At the “Book Forum” cafe, men and women, young and old, sit passionately debating literature, music, politics and history.
Drinking tea, coffee and juice, some smoke nargileh water pipes while an oud player takes the stage to accompany a poet about to read from his work.
Opposite, the only wall not covered with bookshelves is instead host to a gallery of portraits — medieval Iraqi poet Al-Mutanabbi is pictured alongside Palestinian Mahmoud Darwish and a series of abstract paintings.
A few months ago, opening a mixed-gender literary cafe in Iraq’s second city would have been unthinkable — punishable by flogging or death under IS rule.
But with the jihadists gone, Fahd Sabah and his partner have set about realising their dream.
“While we lived under the yoke of IS, I told myself that it was an absolute must to open this place,” Mr. Sabah said. “There was a need to inform people, to enlighten minds, to bring new ideas.”
Like many young graduates in Iraq, the 30-year-old engineer had few prospects of finding employment.
So as soon as the jihadists were driven out of Mosul, he set about finding a venue and preparing to open a cafe, putting his savings into the venture. Within a month, it was up and running.
It was worth the sacrifice, he said. His project aims to create “a new consciousness to overcome this terrible period and the damage left by the war.”
Iraqis are renowned in the Arab world for their literary culture. Mosul, capital of Nineveh province and sitting at the crossroads of ancient trading routes, long boasted a parade of booksellers along its famous Al-Nujaifi Street.
But the IS methodically destroyed and burned books and destroyed libraries.
After the jihadists were evicted six months ago, a handful of activists set up the “Book Pavement” market outside the city’s battle-scarred university.
Ali Najam (23) comes every Friday to scour the stalls of second-hand booksellers next to the concrete carcass of a building disemboweled by bombs.
Today, he has picked up an English edition of Love in the Age of Cholera by Colombian Nobel Laureate Gabriel Garcia Marquez.
“People badly need culture and to build their consciousness after the hardships they went through,” Mr. Najam said. “There’s a need to rebuild people’s spirits, which is even more important than rebuilding the houses and the city.”
Yunis Mohammad, a 33-year-old writer, said that despite the destruction, “Mosul will be rebuilt thanks to the brains of its young people, its intellectuals.”
Abdelmonim al-Amir, head of Nineveh province's writers' union, has said he wants the world, which associates Mosul with “blood, destruction and desolation"", to know that the city has another face.
“Inhabitants and artists must make the human, cultural and academic dimensions of Mosul shine,” he said.
So far, everything is being done on limited means, in a city devastated by war, crippled by unemployment and held back by the slow pace of reconstruction.
“The public authorities in charge of culture must now do their duty,” said writer Hamed al-Zubaidi.
Hind Ahmed, a 31-year-old engineer, said the mission was important to Iraq, which in December announced the “liberation” of the country and the “end of the war” against IS.
“Now the land has been liberated, we must free minds and ideas,” she said, dressed in a white veil dotted with butterflies over a beige coat.
Iraqis must “give everyone the opportunity to participate,” she added. “Men and women.”

Cape Town’s water crisis highlights city’s rich-poor divide ","“Day Zero” is approaching as South Africa’s showcase city of Cape Town prepares to turn off most water taps amid the worst drought in a century. Tensions among the four million residents are highlighting a class divide.
The top international tourist destination has both sprawling informal settlements and high-income oceanside neighborhoods. Some say poorer residents are unfairly blamed as concerns rise over wasting precious water. The military is prepared to help secure water collection points if “Day Zero” occurs.
The Associated Press is exploring how residents are coping as water restrictions tighten in an attempt to avoid the possible shut-off in mid-April, and it spoke with researchers about where the water usage problems lie.
Kirsty Carden with the Future Water Institute at the University of Cape Town pointed to the city’s leafy suburbs. “It has been in the areas where people have gardens, they have swimming pools and they are much more profligate in the way that they use water, because they’re used to the water just being, coming out of the taps,” she said.
Some residents appear to be changing their ways, she said, but “there have been problems in the more affluent areas where people are just, ‘We’ll pay for it.’”
About a quarter of Cape Town’s population lives in the informal settlements, where they get water from communal taps instead of individual taps at home, Carden said. “And there are always pictures of running taps and broken fixtures and ‘Look at the leakage’ and all the rest. But the reality is that those 1 million people out of a population of 4 [million] only use 4.5 per cent of the water.”
In one of the crowded settlements of corrugated-metal homes, resident Vuyo Kazi washed her laundry outside as others poured used water into the street.
“Before, I was using two kettles of water to wash myself,” Ms. Kazi said. “So now I use one kettle of water.”
Under new water restrictions that began Thursday, residents are asked to use no more than 50 liters (13.2 gallons) of water daily, down from the previous limit of 87 liters (23 gallons). The use of city drinking water to wash vehicles, hose down paved areas, fill up private swimming pools and water gardens is illegal. Residents using too much water will be fined.
Across the city, in the seaside town of Scarborough, resident Kelson da Cruz demonstrated the new normal of water rationing, pointing out the bucket beside his shower. The city has even promoted a Two-Minute Shower Songs project by top South African artists to keep water usage down.
“We are restricted with an amount of the water that we can use per day,” Mr. da Cruz said. “So we collect that water, and that water you can use to flush the toilet.” Another jar of water is used for tooth-brushing and face-washing.
Some 70 per cent of water used in Cape Town is consumed in homes, authorities say. Experts have said causes of the city’s water shortages include climate change and huge population growth. The local reliance on reservoirs, while projects such as desalination plants were largely left to the future, has been hurt by three straight years of drought.
Scientists are watching how authorities cope, as this would be the world’s first major city to go dry.
“We always open the tap, the water is there, easy,” Mr. da Cruz said. “I was lucky to travel to some dry countries where water has always been a big issue. So when we moved to South Africa that has always been on the back of our mind.
“And I think South Africa is for the first time is really catching up with the rest of the world. They have to change their habits. You can’t just take for granted something so precious.”

Japan launches micro satellite rocket
"," The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) launched on Saturday the world’s smallest rocket with the ability to put a micro-satellite into orbit, following a failed attempt and several postponements over the last year.
The launch of the low-cost rocket — with a height of 10 metres and 53 centimetres in diameter — took place from the Uchinoura Space Centre in Kagoshima prefecture and was aired live on YouTube, Efe news reported.
The rocket, an improved version of JAXA’s SS—520, was carrying a micro-satellite weighing three kilograms and was developed by the University of Tokyo to capture images of the Earth’s surface.
JAXA had launched the first of these rockets on January 2017, which fell into the sea after launch due to short-circuit caused by vibrations during take-off.
The current launch aimed to test the ability of the Japanese aerospace agency to launch low-cost rockets that can put micro satellites into space at affordable rates against a background of growing demand from the private sector.
Satellites for weather observation or defence that are in use are normally large and are commissioned by the authorities. 
In recent years there has been increase in the development of smaller ones by private firms for use in traffic control or geographical studies.

Spain extradites Russian suspect — thought to be spam kingpin — to US ","Spain has extradited to the United States a Russian citizen who is suspected of being one of the world’s most notorious spammers.
Pyotr Levashov, a 37-year-old from St. Petersburg, was arrested in April while vacationing with his family in Barcelona.
US authorities had asked for him to be detained on charges of fraud and unauthorized interception of electronic communications. He was scheduled to be arraigned on late Friday in a federal courthouse in Bridgeport, Connecticut, where a grand jury indicted him last year.
A statement from Spain’s National Police said officers handed Mr. Levashov over to US marshals on Friday. The extradition was approved in October by Spain’s National Court, which rejected a counter-extradition request from Russia.
The Russian Embassy in Washington didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.
Authorities in the US say they have linked Mr. Levashov to a series of powerful botnets, or networks of hijacked computers, which were capable of pumping out billions of spam emails.
An indictment unsealed last year said he commanded the sprawling Kelihos botnet, which at times allegedly involved more than 100,000 compromised computers that sent phony emails advertising counterfeit drugs, harvested users’ logins and installed malware that intercepted bank account passwords.
On a typical day, the network would generate and distribute more than 2,500 spam emails, according to the indictment.
Mr. Levashov’s lawyers have alleged the case is politically motivated and that the US wants him for reasons beyond his alleged cybercrimes. They had argued that he should be tried in Spain instead, and pointed to evidence showing that he gained access to Russian state secrets while studying in St Petersburg.
Mr. Levashov’s U.S.-based lawyer, Igor Litvak, didn’t return emails or calls seeking comment on Friday.

Suspect held for petrol bomb thrown at Suu Kyi’s villa
","The Myanmar police said they have arrested a mentally ill man who confessed to tossing a petrol bomb into the Yangon compound of de facto leader Aung San Suu Kyi this week.
Ms. Suu Kyi was not home when the crude bomb landed inside the gate of her lakeside villa on Thursday, causing little damage other than a fire that burned a water pipe.
But the incident unnerved supporters of the Nobel laureate, who championed Myanmar’s democratic transition but has suffered a fallout with the international community over her failure to condemn army abuses against Rohingya Muslims.
Using photos taken by a witness of the attack, officers arrested Win Naing (48) in the early hours of Friday, according to a report posted on Yangon police’s official Facebook page.
“He confessed that he took a bottle filled with petrol...and threw it into the compound,” the report said, adding that Win Naing does a security job for a construction company.
Police said they believe Win Naing has “mental health problems” but will continue to take legal action against him.
He told officers that he was motivated to throw the bomb because he had been “cursed by magic,” the police report said.
Ms. Suu Kyi has not commented on the incident, which took place almost exactly one year after the assassination of one of her top legal advisors Ko Ni.
Ko Ni, one of few Muslims to hold a prominent government position in mainly Buddhist Myanmar, was shot in the head as he waited outside Yangon airport while holding his grandson.
The murder horrified the Muslim community and the ruling party in particular in a country where political assassinations are rare.

Russian hacking: what Trump’s secret memo says (and doesn't say) "," After more than a week of partisan bickering and social media-fueled buildup, the #releasethememo crowd got their wish. 
President Donald Trump declassified it. The GOP majority of the House intelligence committee released it. And the public dissection of the four-page, GOP-authored document began. 
What’s the gist of the memo? 
The memo makes a series of allegations of misconduct on the part of the FBI and the Justice Department in obtaining a warrant under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA, to monitor former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser Carter Page. 
Specifically, it takes aim at the FBI’s use of information from a former British spy, Christopher Steele, who compiled a collection of memos containing several allegations of ties between Trump, his associates and Russia. 
The memo says the FBI and the Justice Department didn’t tell the FISA court enough about Steele’s role in an opposition research effort. The research was funded by Democrat Hillary Clinton through a Washington law firm. 
The document also takes aim at several senior FBI and Justice Department officials. Among them is former Associate Deputy Attorney General Bruce Ohr, who it says knew of Steele’s anti-Trump leanings and whose wife worked at the firm behind the opposition research effort. 
What’s new?
The memo provides the first formal government confirmation of the secret FISA warrant and that Page was the person being monitored. 
Information like that is ordinarily considered among the most tightly held national security information, and it almost never gets released to the public.
Though the memo takes issue with the FBI’s methods, it also confirms that the FBI and Justice Department believed there was probable cause that Page was acting as an agent of a foreign power and a judge agreed four times over. 
The memo fills in the timeline of the Russia investigation, showing that Page was under surveillance for months. 
According to the memo, the Justice Department and FBI obtained the FISA warrant on Page on Oct. 21, 2016, and then had it reauthorised three additional times. 
Given that FISA warrants must be renewed every 90 days, the memo indicates that the government monitored Page’s communications for nearly a year. 
It started with Papadopoulous
The whole Russia investigation, that is. 
According to the memo, information about former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos “triggered the opening of an FBI counterintelligence investigation in late July 2016”. 
That’s significant because Trump and his allies in the GOP have tried to undermine the Russia investigation by saying it all stems from the Steele dossier. 
The memo doesn’t provide further details about the information the FBI received about Papadopoulos. But it appears to confirm, in part, reporting by The New York Times late last year that FBI concerns about Papadopoulos started the investigation. 
Papadopoulos pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI last year. Court papers show he had several contacts with people representing themselves as being tied to the Russian government starting in the spring of 2016. 
Court papers also show that Papadopoulos learned the Russians had “dirt” on Hillary Clinton in the form of “thousands of emails” prior to that information becoming public. 
The FBI did use information from Steele, though
The memo says Steele’s collection of reports “formed an essential part” of the FISA application for Page, but it doesn’t specify exactly what information was used or how much. 
It also says that the FISA application relied on a September 2016 Yahoo News article, and claims that the information in the article also came from Steele.
The document quotes former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe as telling the House intelligence committee in December that “no surveillance warrant would have been sought” from the FISA court “without the Steele dossier information.”
According to the memo, the application also included “Steele’s past record of credible reporting on other unrelated matters.” 
No underlying information released 
The accuracy of the memo is hard to assess because the majority of the underlying contents are classified or confidential. 
The memo cites an initial FISA warrant application a document which usually has dozens of pages as well as three additional renewals by the court. None of those documents are public. 
The same is true of the transcripts of the committee’s closed-door interviews with McCabe and other senior FBI officials who had contact with Steele. 
On Friday, the committee’s ranking Democrat, Rep. Adam Schiff of California, took issue with the memo’s characterization of McCabe’s comments, saying the former FBI deputy director was speaking generally about how any FISA application relies on “each and every component” included. 
But the committee’s chairman, Rep. Devin Nunes of California, said late Friday on Fox News the description of McCabe’s comments is “a summation of a long interview and that’s definitely what he said.” He noted that other witnesses have said “similar things.”
‘Minimally corroborated’ 
It’s been a burning question ever since the dossier was published by Buzzfeed News last year — How much did the FBI corroborate? 
According to the memo, not much at the time the FBI obtained the FISA warrant on Page. The memo cites FBI Assistant Director Bill Priestap as saying FBI corroboration of the dossier was in its “infancy” when the court authorized the first FISA warrant. 
It also says an “independent unit” in the FBI conducted a “source validation report” on Steele’s reporting and found it “only minimally corroborated.” 
But without the underlying documents or transcripts of Priestap’s testimony, it’s hard to judge the accuracy of the memo’s description.

Trump to take tougher line on Russia nuke threat ","The Trump administration has said it will continue much of the Obama administration’s nuclear weapons policy, but take a more aggressive stance toward Russia.
It says Russia must be convinced it would face “unacceptably dire costs” if it were to threaten even a limited nuclear attack in Europe.
The sweeping review of U.S. nuclear policy does not call for any net increase in strategic nuclear weapons. That position stands in contrast to President Donald Trump’s statement, in a tweet shortly before he took office, that the U.S. “must greatly strengthen and expand its nuclear capability until such time as the world comes to its senses regarding nukes.”

India-US trade estimated to have touched $140 billion in 2017
","Trade between India and the United States is estimated to have jumped substantially from $118 billion in 2016 to $140 billion in 2017, according to an advocacy group that aims to promote bilateral trade.
In 2016, India was the ninth largest trading partner of the US and one of the major countries with which America has had trade deficit of more than $30 billion. This is expected to continue in 2017 as well, an issue which has repeatedly been raised by President Donald Trump and his top officials in their interaction with their Indian counterpart.
“We estimate that in 2017 India’s trade [with the US] has gone up from USD 118 billion [the previous year] to USD140,” Mukesh Aghi, president of the US India Strategic and Partnership Forum (USISPF) told PTI in an interview.
Official figures of annual bilateral trade are yet to come, but the USISPF estimates are based on its own research and surveys.
India, Mr. Aghi said, has proactively started working on addressing the issue of trade deficit with India.
“India roughly has a thousand plane orders with US companies. That will start bringing trade imbalance in the right direction. India, last year bought $2 billion worth of energy from the US. India spends roughly $80 billion dollars acquiring energy. And I think a lot of that will start moving to the US,” he said.
“I think next five years, you will see a little more balance in the trade between two countries,” Mr. Aghi said.
India and the US have set a goal of increasing the bilateral trade to $500 billion a year.
“I think it [bilateral trade] is moving,” he said.
Overall, the relationship between India and the US is moving in a right direction.

India-China ties a ‘cold war-like’ bond in making: US expert ","India and China have a “cold war-like” relationship in the making but New Delhi is unlikely to join something framed as a US-led front to contain Beijing, a former American diplomat has said.
Alyssa Ayres, who served in the South and Central Asia Bureau of the State Department, made the remarks last week in New York during the launch of her latest book Our Time Has Come: How India is Making Its Place in the World.
“It is a cold war-like relationship in the making. India and China have had a strong commercial relationship, but that is increasingly less satisfying for India, for many of the same reasons the United States is dissatisfied with its trade relationship with China,” she said.
To a question on India-China ties, Ms. Ayres, currently a fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, a top American think-tank, said that for a while the commercial relationship between the two countries had relegated their strategic competition to the backseat.
“I think India [is] concerned about the increasingly larger presence that China is establishing across the Indian Ocean, with a base in Djibouti,” the ex-diplomat said.
She added that India may also be concerned over China’s “deep relationship” with Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and the investments it is making in the two countries.
Asked about the impression in the US that New Delhi is a ""good bet"" to contain Beijing, she has said India is unlikely to be part of such an initiative.
“I think India is going to be highly unlikely to be enlisted in something framed as a US-led effort to contain China. That is not what India seeks to do. It seeks to defend its own interests. It seeks to uphold the liberal world order,” Ms. Ayres said.
“India has been a big supporter of global norms, of freedom of navigation. But it also partners with China in many arenas. The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), India is the number two capital contributor,” she noted.
The BRICS organisation went from being just an idea in a research paper to being a real institution, she said, adding India is very active with that and the five-nation grouping has created its own development bank.
“India became a member of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation. It's hedging its own bets as global governance reform lags on in the 20th-century institutions. And so where it has put some of its eggs in the new organisations basket, it has partnered with China on that front,” Ms. Ayres said.
To another question, she said that there would be a measured response from India if there was a repeat of the 2008 Mumbai terrorist attack.
“Based on what we saw with the surgical strikes of the previous year or the year before last, I would not expect a completely passive response. I would expect something measured, but much more active,” she said.

Maldives’ delay in freeing opposition leaders fuels concern
"," As domestic and international pressure mounts, the Maldives has delayed complying with a Supreme Court order for the immediate release and new trials of nine opposition leaders, freeing them to contest presidential elections this year.
The Indian Ocean nation has been mired in political unrest since Mohamed Nasheed, its first democratically elected leader, was ousted in 2012. He has been in exile on medical grounds from a 13-year jail sentence on terrorism charges.
The Supreme Court on Thursday said the trials of Nasheed and eight others, many of whom had challenged President Abdulla Yameen, had violated the constitution and international law. It found that prosecutors and judges were unduly influenced “to conduct politically motivated investigations” against them.
On Friday, Attorney General Mohamed Anil said he had held discussions with Chief Justice Abdulla Saeed over the administrations concerns about releasing individuals whose offences ranged from terrorism to corruption and treason.
“The prosecutor general is currently in the process of examining the cases to determine the best way to proceed with the implementation of the Supreme Courts ruling, and the prosecutor general will present recommendations at the earliest,” the government said in a statement.
The unexpected ruling frees opposition leaders to run against Yameen in the presidential poll expected to be completed by October. The terrorism convictions would normally bar them from competing unless they received presidential pardons after completing a third of their jail terms.
The joint opposition of the Maldives expressed concern over Yameen’s refusal to abide by the order. “We are deeply fearful that the governments refusal to implement the Supreme Court order could escalate to unrest and incite violence across the country,” it said in a statement.
Hundreds of opposition supporters chanted slogans such as “Enforce the Supreme Court ruling,” and “Defend the constitution,” in a Friday night rally outside the opposition MDP campaign center in Male, the capital.
The United Nations, the United States, the European Union and India also urged Yameen’s government to follow the ruling.
In a statement, the office of U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said, “The Secretary-General reiterates his belief in finding a solution to the political stalemate in the Maldives through all-party talks, which the United Nations continues to stand ready to facilitate.”
“We understand the situation is extremely tense,” Rupert Colville, a spokesman for the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights told reporters on Friday. The agency was “closely watching how the situation develops in the aftermath of Thursday’s decisions by the Supreme Court, and in particular, the reactions of the government, military and police,” he added.
The European Union urged the government to hold “inclusive dialogue with the leaders of all political parties that should pave the way for credible, transparent and inclusive elections”.
Nasheed, who has been in exile in Britain, had sought U.N. help to restore the political rights of which he was stripped after a trial denounced as hasty and unfair by the United Nations human rights chief.
Thursday’s decision also nullified a ruling in which 12 lawmakers lost their parliamentary seats for defecting last July from Yameen’s ruling party, costing him his majority in the 85-member legislature.

Trump steps up fight over Russia probe, approves release of secret memo ","President Donald Trump and his Republican allies on Friday escalated a campaign against U.S. law enforcement agencies over their probe into Russia by making public a classified memo that the FBI had sought to keep under wraps.
The document, drawn up by congressional Republicans, alleges bias against Trump at the FBI and Justice Department in the investigations into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and ties between Moscow and the Trump campaign.
 

Trump accuses Justice Department, FBI of pro-Democrat bias


Ignoring FBI urgings, Trump approved the release of the memo, deepening an extraordinary showdown between the president and senior law enforcement officials over a probe that has dogged him for his first year in office and that is now headed by Special Counsel Robert Mueller.
As soon as Trump declassified the four-page memo, telling reporters its contents told a disgraceful story of bias against him, Republicans on the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee released it to the public.
The document alleges the FBI concealed the Democratic ties of a source the agency used to justify surveillance on a Trump campaign worker. It says a string of senior Justice Department officials signed off on this.
The memo has become a flashpoint in a battle between Republicans and Democrats over Mueller's criminal probe, which is also believed to be looking into any attempts to impede the investigation.
Democrats say Trump's allies hope to use the memo to protect the president and possibly to give him a reason to fire Deputy U.S. Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who hired Mueller and so would be the person to dismiss him, or even Mueller himself.
Asked by reporters on Friday if he had confidence in Rosenstein, Trump replied, “You figure that one out.”
“A lot of people should be ashamed,” Trump said of the findings in the document.
Trump has repeatedly complained about Mueller's investigation, denying any collusion or obstruction of justice. Moscow has denied any election meddling.
In a Twitter message on Friday, Trump accused top U.S. law enforcement officers - some of whom he appointed himself - of politicizing investigations.
It was his latest attack on top justice officials. Trump fired FBI Director James Comey in May last year. Comey later told a congressional hearing that he believed his removal was an effort by Trump to undermine the Russia probe.
Senator John McCain, who is regarded as a heavyweight in Congress on foreign affairs, strongly criticized his fellow Republicans and Trump for attacking the FBI and the Justice Department.
“Our nations elected officials, including the president, must stop looking at this investigation through the warped lens of politics and manufacturing partisan sideshows. If we continue to undermine our own rule of law, we are doing Putins job for him,” McCain said in a statement, referring to Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Details of the memo
The document, commissioned by the Republican chairman of the House intelligence panel, Devin Nunes, uses the case of investigations into Trump campaign aide Carter Page, saying the FBI used a biased source to justify surveillance on him.
 

A year of Trump


It alleges that a dossier of Trump-Russia contacts compiled by former British spy Christopher Steele, and funded in part by U.S. Democrats, formed an essential part of requests to a special court to be allowed to conduct electronic surveillance on Page that began in October, 2016.
It says the initial application and subsequent renewal applications, signed off on by various senior Justice Department officials including Rosenstein, did not mention the link between Steele and the Democrats.
It also portrays Steele as biased, saying he was passionate about him (Trump) not being president.
The memo largely repeated allegations that Nunes and others had made publicly previously and did not appear to include major surprises.
Two days ago, in a rare public rebuke of the president and Republicans in Congress who were pushing to release the memo, the Federal Bureau of Investigation said it had “grave concerns about material omissions of fact” in the document and it should not be made public.
The FBI director, Christopher Wray, was appointed by Trump.
The memo cherry picks information, says Democrats
“The selective release and politicization of classified information sets a terrible precedent and will do long-term damage to the Intelligence Community and our law enforcement agencies,” Democrats on the House intelligence panel said in a statement.
 

A year of Trump: how much has changed in the past year?


The Democrats said they hoped to release their own memo responding to the allegations on Feb. 5.
The entire file that the Justice Department used to apply for permission to eavesdrop on Page remains highly classified, making it hard to evaluate the memos contents.
In his swipe at U.S. law enforcement leadership on Twitter on Friday, Trump said, “The top Leadership and Investigators of the FBI and the Justice Department have politicized the sacred investigative process in favor of Democrats and against Republicans - something which would have been unthinkable just a short time ago.”
He praised “rank and file” FBI employees.
His latest salvo was sure to worsen the president's frayed relations with agencies that are supposed to be politically independent.
James Clapper, the former director of national intelligence under Democratic President Barack Obama, said Trump's attack on the FBI and Justice Department was the “pot calling the kettle black.”
Seeking to defuse the conflict over the memo, Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan backed the release of a Democratic counterpoint document. His office said he backed making the Democrats' rebuttal public if it does not reveal intelligence gathering sources or methods.
Democrats say their counter-memo restores context and information left out of the Republican version. Republicans have resisted releasing that document.

Mango ban: India threatens to drag EU to WTO
","Talking tough, India today threatened to drag the European Union to the World Trade Organisation if the 28—nation bloc did not lift its ban on the import of Indian mangoes and vegetables.
“We do hope that the EU will see sense, considering the strength of the economic partnership between India and EU, and not precipitate the situation any further, which leads us to go to the WTO,” Commerce and Industry Minister Anand Sharma told reporters here.
Sharma said he has already written a letter on the matter to EU Trade Commissioner Karel De Gucht.
He said the government has invested in creating world—class laboratories through the Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA) and their certification processes are acceptable to the EU, the US and other countries.
The Minister described the EU’s move as an “arbitrary action without any consultation.”
“It has no justification and I have said in my communication that it will definitely have a very negative fallout in respect of our economic relationship,” Sharma said.
He said APEDA has the mandate of certification of agri—produce exports and that is acceptable to all countries.
“That is why APEDA and the commerce ministry have taken up this matter,” he said, expressing hope that the issue would be resolved.
On Thursday, when asked if India is considering dragging the EU to WTO’s dispute settlement mechanism over the import curbs, Commerce Secretary Rajeev Kher said the issue should be addressed through consultation.
“I do not think that will be the right approach in this case. EU and India are strong bilateral trading partners. We should sort out differences through mutual conversation,” Kher had said.
On Monday, the EU banned the import of Alphonso mangoes, the king of fruits, and four vegetables from India for the period from May 1 to December 2015 after authorities found consignments infested with fruit flies.
Imports have been restricted as 207 consignments of mangoes and some vegetables shipped from India in 2013 were found to be contaminated by pests.
The UK imports almost 160 lakh mangoes from India and the market for this fruit is worth almost 6 million pounds a year.
India, the world’s largest mango exporter, sells about 65,000—70,000 tonnes of all varieties of the fruit overseas out of its total production of 15—16 lakh tonnes.

In love with Indian culture
","Lilting notes of music interspersed with spurts of claps and laughter flow into the peaceful evening. Surrounded by green hills, swaying coconut groves and cashew plantations, a young group of Germans sit playing guitar and singing songs in this idyllic village in Anandapuram mandal near Simhachalam. The village has been their home for more than six months now. So what is so special about a bunch of German students in the city? Tourists or maybe Indophiles at best? Not quite so.
Johannes Kuchle, Leonie Konrad, Jana-Nita Raker and Melanie Hunger are all undergraduates from Germany who are here with similar agendas – to impart education to tribal children and soak in the vibrant Indian culture in every possible way. Working as teachers and researchers at Bala Mitra (friends of children) school set up by Samata, an NGO, their experiences in the classrooms with the tribal children has been a “fascinating” journey they say.
“It’s remarkable to see the spontaneous creativity in the children of the villages,” says Leonie, who teaches arts and crafts in the school. “They know the names of every tree, the sounds of the birds and they are so amazing with colours and shapes. Being close to nature opens up the mind so wonderfully! Living in the city clogs those natural senses,” she adds.
Their mornings begin with a session of Yoga after which they head to the kitchen unit to learn the different types of tribal and local cuisines. “Bhendakaya (lady’s finger) curry and ‘Pulihara’ (tamarind rice) are our favourites. The cuisine here is so varied and every dish has a distinct taste,” say Jana and Melanie. They both have been working on a special project ever since they fell in love with the local delicacies. “We are translating the tribal recipes into German and planning to come out with a recipe book to give a glimpse of Indian culture and cuisine to German people,” they say. More than 35 recipes have been tried and tasted which will be a part of the recipe book. “A German foundation has agreed to support this idea and we plan to raise money for ‘Bala Mitra’ by selling the book in Germany,” they say.
The classes at Bala Mitra are as unconventional as the school’s new German teachers. Based on the Waldorf (Steiner) education system which is an experiential and imaginative approach to learning, the classes begin with singing sessions under the shade of tall trees. Art is taught by painting the walls of the well and the classrooms with creative ideas. “The Adivasi children have a pure originality about their interpretation of art. A student of class 3 one day made a portrait of mine which was so beautiful,” says Leonie.
Besides focusing on their work, the German students are also exploring the city and capturing a glimpse of the culture and tradition of India to take back as souvenirs. Interestingly, their favourite spot in the city is not the beaches but the busy Poorna Market! “There is so much character to that place and warmth in the people there. In fact, we made friends with the women vendors and also gifted them some photographs that we took of theirs,” says Johannes. While the weekends mean a dose of surfing lessons in the Rushikonda coast for Leonie, Jana explores her roots in India which she left behind when she was a few months-old toddler. Adopted from an orphanage in Delhi by a German couple, this is Jana’s first trip to India as an adult. “There is a lot of diversity in the culture. But I don’t have any childhood memories of it. For me, everything seems new,” says Jana, who documents the activities of the school in their newsletter. As they prepare to leave for the country next month, they wish to take with them the rich memories of their stay here and leave behind some trace of their love for the people through their work.

Plight of Pak. minorities worsening: rights panel
","The condition of minorities is worsening and it is nearly impossible for those accused in blasphemy cases to have a trial in Pakistan, according to I.A. Rehman, secretary general of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP).
Speaking at the launch of HRCP’s annual report “State of Human Rights in 2013’ recently, Mr. Rehman said: “We are worried about the big picture and we do not find any indication of a comprehensive approach to human rights.”
There is only symptomatic treatment and no holistic approach, he regretted. He said the number of those killed in sectarian clashes did not give an idea of the state of fear they were living in. The state should reorient itself to people’s welfare and meet basic demands, he urged.
In the first few weeks of 2013, sectarian violence claimed the lives of over 200 Hazara Shias in Balochistan.
The report documented more than 200 sectarian attacks which killed 687 people. Seven Ahmadis lost their lives in targeted attacks and in the deadliest attack ever against Pakistan’s Christians, over 100 people were killed in a Peshawar church.
A Muslim mob torched a predominantly Christian neighbourhood in Lahore after a Christian man was accused of blasphemy. Hundred houses were burnt as residents fled. Individuals charged with offences relating to religion included 17 Ahmadis, 13 Christians and nine Muslims.
In Badin, bodies of two Hindus were dug up by mobs which claimed that the graveyards belonged to Muslims and only Muslims could be buried there.

Pakistan, UK resolve to work closely with new government in India
","Prime Minister David Cameron and Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif in a joint statement on May 1 underscored the importance of “developing closer co-operation” with the new government that would be soon elected in India.
In a wide-ranging statement on developing bilateral relations, the two leaders laid out the blueprint for cooperation in the areas of trade and investment, culture and education, defence and security, and regional stability.
On his first official visit to the UK after assuming the reins of government in 2013, Mr. Sharif also met with Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg and other senior ministers. He gave a keynote speech at the Pakistan Investment Centre.
Mr. Cameron and Mr. Sharif committed to the opening of a new British Deputy High Commission in Lahore.
A calendar of educational engagement for the next three years includes a commitment from the British Council to train one million teachers of English over the next five years in Punjab, Sindh and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa provinces to upgrade English language teaching in Pakistan.
UK aid, through the Department for International Development will support the delivery of primary and secondary education to help realize Mr. Sharif’s commitment to spend 4 per cent of Pakistan’s GDP on education.
The two sides agreed to increase bilateral trade to £3 million by 2015, and in this regard welcoming the announcement by the UK company Asian Precious Metals of a new £ 100 million project in Pakistan.
On security and defence, the two governments will work towards countering the shared threats of terrorism, organized crime and illegal migration. The UK promised support for Pakistan’s new National Internal Security Policy.
Pakistan also endorsed the Declaration of Commitment to End Sexual Violence in Conflict, a campaign launched by Foreign Secretary William Hague in 2013. He is to co-host, along with the Special Envoy of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees Angelina Jolie, a Global Summit to End Sexual Violence in Conflict on 10—13 June 2014 in London.

“Our reports say that about 250 people including women and children have gone missing and the locals say all of them have died,” Mr. Ayyar told dpa.
He said that 200 houses and large areas of farmland were destroyed in the mudslide, which was triggered by heavy rain.
“The rescue teams have been dispatched to the area and are trying to evacuate the survivors,” he said Last week, some 100 people were killed and more than 7,000 were displaced by flash floods in four northern provinces.
Afghanistan’s northern and central areas suffer heavy rainfall in the spring.

Pakistan raises concern over denial of visas to pilgrims

The statement said the Foreign Office conveyed its deep disappointment and concern over the denial of visas by the Indian government. This is the fourth time that visas have been denied to Pakistani pilgrims in the last one year. This is not only against the bilateral agreement, but also runs contrary to the efforts towards normalizing ties between the two countries and the spirit of people-to-people contacts, the statement added.

India steps up pressure on Switzerland to share bank info
","India has accused Switzerland of “providing protection to taxpayers found to have evaded Indian taxes” and seriously undermining India’s efforts in tackling offshore tax evasion and stashing of unaccounted income abroad”.
Union Finance Minister P. Chidambaram in his third letter to his Swiss counterpart Eveline Widmer Schlumpf within four months strongly objected to Switzerland’s denial of information about account details of certain Indians at HSBC’s Swiss bank branches in whose cases Indian investigators have found “incriminating evidence of tax evasion”.
Mr. Chidambaram also wrote that the interpretation made by Switzerland that it can not share information as per India’s request was not in accordance with international standards. Switzerland had refused to share the said information through a letter dated April 7 to Mr. Chidambaram. The stated reason was that India initiated investigations on the “HSBC” accounts on the basis of information extracted from data a disgruntled HSBC employee had stolen in 2011. India had received this “stolen” data from France.
At the official level meeting in New Delhi in February, the Swiss delegation insisted on a pre-condition, according to Mr. Chidambaram’s letter, for providing the information India is seeking that India needs to demonstrate that the investigation carried out in these cases was independent if the HSBC data was based on information already available with the Indian authorities prior to receiving the HSBC data from France. This pre-condition, Mr. Chidambaram wrote, amounts to Switzerland providing protection to the tax evaders India is investigating.
India has stepped up pressure on the European nation which is considered a major safe haven for alleged black money stashed by foreigners owing to its strong banking secrecy laws. Under global pressure, Switzerland has agreed to ease its banking secrecy laws in recent years. India and Switzerland had signed a tax treaty in 2011 to facilitate greater flow of information about alleged black money. Mr. Chidambaram also reiterated in the letter that India would continue to take a position at the Global Forum about Switzerland lacking legal and regulatory framework for an effective exchange of tax-related information. In the letter dated April 29, the Finance Minister urged Switzerland to honour its “rights and duties” agreed in the bilateral Direct Tax Avoidance Convention (DTAC) with India.

Sour turn in India-EU trade
","The ban imposed by the European Union on the import of Alphonso mangoes and four varieties of vegetables from India until December 2015 after some consignments were found infested with “non-European fruit flies” has naturally upset India. As the biggest producer of the golden fruit, India sends about 70,000 tonnes of mangoes abroad every year. Yet, merely insisting that the 28-member bloc’s action is “unilateral… without any meaningful official consultation,” as Commerce Minister Anand Sharma has done, will not do. The EU had notified India in March of its concerns. Whether the Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority, which is tasked with ensuring that items of export are compliant in terms of sanitary and phyto-sanitary standards as set down by importing countries, was able to fully address them effectively, remains unclear. It is also to be noted that scores of consignments of mangoes and vegetables shipped in 2013 had been found to be contaminated. Periodic problems that come up with respect to shrimp exports over contamination concerns, are relevant here. India certainly needs to put in place fool-proof mechanisms for the examination and certification of export commodities to remove such taints once and for all. Necessary correctives need to be worked out with the involvement of technical and scientific bodies in order that in the lucrative but competitive export markets the country would establish its reputation as a reliable partner meeting health and phyto-sanitary standards.
On its part, the EU should ensure that any cause for a perception of its decision being an unfair one which smacks of a punitive approach and that would potentially jeopardise India-EU trade, is avoided. As the Minister has pointed out, the ongoing negotiations for a broad-based India-EU trade and investment agreement is based on the premise of trust and understanding to put in place a more liberal trade regime. Brussels should note Indian domestic concerns and invoke the necessary correctives on the basis of an appropriate assessment of risks. If it is indeed possible that sections of the EU bureaucracy see here a leveraging factor in the context of talks on a Free Trade Agreement, as also other bilateral issues, that will amount to unfairness. Although Europe is not a major market for Indian mangoes — it accounts for 16 million tonnes annually — any ban typically pulls down prices. About 80 per cent of the exports from India go to West Asia. What India should do is to strengthen its bargaining position by raising export standards and leave no quarter to be found remiss. The entire ecosystem for exports, involving farmers, packers and exporters of agri-commodities, should be geared to meet the quality and safety requirements of countries across the world.
***

>Editorial writer’s clarification: “Total Indian exports to EU countries in 2012-13 was only 4,071 tonnes. The figure of 16 million mentioned was not in terms of tonnes but absolute number of mangoes exported to the United Kingdom alone. Total exports of mangoes from India in 2012-13 added up to only 55,584.98 tonnes (according to data from the Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority), and it is unlikely that the figure would go up to 70,000 tonnes this year.”

Signs of helplessness
","As Ukraine slides steadily towards civil war, the sanctions announced by the United States and the European Union go further than previous attempts but show no results on the ground. On April 28, Washington announced measures against companies, officials, and wealthy businesspeople with ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s government, and the following day the European Union announced sanctions against 15 Russian and Ukrainian officials including General Valery Gerasimov, Russia’s chief of military staff, and Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Kozak, who is tasked with developing Crimea, the Ukrainian province annexed by Moscow on March 1. Among the Ukrainians named, presumably for asset freezes and travel bans, are the pro-Russian Igor Strelkov, an adviser to Crimean Prime Minister Sergei Aksyonov, and Sergei Tsyplakov, reportedly the head of the People’s Militia in Ukraine’s Donbass region. The U.S. sanctions are wider than the European ones, targeting businesses and individuals; 17 companies are involved, mainly in oil and gas, construction and finance. The most notable target is Igor Sechin, president of the Russian state-owned oil giant Rosneft; the financial services firm Visa will have to suspend credit card services to Bank Rossiya and other banks.
The sanctions, however, are less severe than they look, and could cause problems for western firms, which may be able to keep shares in Russian companies whose senior personnel are under sanctions but may be banned from contact with such executives. This could hit BP, which owns 19.75 per cent of Rosneft and has faced huge costs since its 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster in the Gulf of Mexico; its first-quarter profits are down by 24 per cent. Other firms with Russian interests include Chevron, ExxonMobil, and Shell; in addition, the Russian quasi-state conglomerate Rostec, whose head Sergei Chemezov is under sanctions, manufactures components for Boeing, and a Russian regional airline is set to buy Boeing jets. As for Visa, cardholders will be able to withdraw money. The U.S. and the EU may want to block Mr. Putin’s apparent plan to redraw Ukraine’s eastern border, but Moscow could retaliate with its own sanctions, particularly in oil and gas transactions. Secondly, events in eastern Ukraine are now out of Kiev’s control. On April 28, the pro-Kiev Mayor of Kharkiv, Gennady Kernes, was shot and severely wounded; separatists have occupied regional administration buildings in Luhansk, and the government airbase at Kramatorsk has been repeatedly attacked. The western bloc may so far have avoided stating preferred solutions, but its own impotence over Ukraine is increasingly obvious.

Search abandoned for landslip survivors
","Rescue teams abandoned the search for survivors on Saturday after a landslip buried a hillside village in northern Afghanistan, killing at least 300 people under a fast-moving tide of rock and mud.
Local people and emergency workers using shovels tried in vain to find victims trapped under the massive landslip that engulfed Aab Bareek village in Badakhshan province.
Officials said that the final death toll could rise as high as 500 after Friday’s disaster, updating earlier information that 2,500 people were feared dead.
“Based on our reports, 300 houses are under the debris,” Badakhshan governor Shah Waliullah Adeeb told reporters at the scene. “We have a list of around 300 people confirmed dead.”
“We cannot continue the search and rescue operation anymore, as the houses are under metres of mud. We will offer prayers for the victims and make the area a mass grave.”
Relief teams arrived at first light on Saturday to be confronted by the enormous scale of destruction and hundreds of homeless families who had spent a night in the open.
“The first figure [of 2,500 feared dead] that we announced was obtained from local people, not from our technical team,” Gul Mohammad Bedar, the deputy governor of Badakhshan, told AFP.
“We think the death toll will not rise beyond 500.”
Many villagers were at Friday prayers in two mosques when they were entombed by the torrent of debris, and a second landslip hit people who had rushed to assist those in need. “I have lost my sister, my house was partially destroyed,” Noor Mohammad (45) told AFP. “We cannot really get anyone out of the debris. We have lost hope of rescuing anyone.”
Gul Bibi (50) cried while she sat in a tent with some female relatives.
“We were at home when the first landslip happened,” she said.
“We left the house, but my husband and son went back inside, then the second one hit. “We have not been able to find them. We are devastated.”
The landslip in the Argo district of Badakhshan left little evidence of the hundreds of homes it swept away at about midday (0730 GMT) after days of heavy rain.
“There is a very thick layer of mud. It is very difficult for people to take dead bodies out,” Sayed Abdullah Homayun Dehqan, provincial director of the Afghan National Disaster Management Authority, said at the site.

Over 40 dead in Odessa clashes
","More than 40 people have died in deadly clashes between supporters and opponents of the federalisation of Ukraine in Odessa as violence continued to spread across the country’s Russian-speaking southeast.
Clashes in the Ukrainian port city of Odessa erupted on Friday afternoon when around 1,500 supporters of the Kiev authorities armed with guns, chains and bats confronted about 500 anti-government protesters who had set up a tent camp in the city demanding greater autonomy from Kiev.
Pro-government radicals ransacked and burnt down the camp, forcing their opponents to seek cover in a nearby trade union building, which was then set on fire. Dozens of people trapped inside died from suffocation.
Video posted on the web showed a man wearing a bullet-proof vest repeatedly firing at people in the blazing building.
Police said 46 people died in the clashes and the fire and more than 80 were hospitalised.
The sudden flare-up of violence in Odessa, the third largest city in Ukraine, situated hundreds of kilometres away from the flashpoint of armed rebellion in Donetsk region, shows just how far Ukraine has slid towards a civil war.
Kiev said the clashes in Odessa had been financed by allies of ousted Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovich and orchestrated by militants from nearby Moldova’s breakaway region of Transdniestria and from Russia.
Ukrainian Acting President Oleksandr Turchynov blamed “foreign provocation” for the tragedy in Odessa as he declared a two-day mourning in Ukraine. Moscow has angrily denied the charges and pointed the finger at Kiev.
Dmitry Peskov, spokesman for Russian President Vladimir Putin, said the Ukrainian authorities “allowed extremists and radicals to burn unarmed people alive.”
“Their arms are up to the elbows in blood,” Mr. Peskov told Russian news agencies.
Mr. Peskov did not say how Russia could react to the escalating conflict in Ukraine, but pointed out that the Kremlin was getting thousands of calls for help from south-eastern Ukraine and Mr. Putin “is closely analysing the all developments in Ukraine to decide further steps.”
The Ukrainian forces on Saturday took control of Kramatorsk after what the head of Ukraine’s anti-terrorist centre described as “heavy fighting” against anti-government self-defence activists. He did not give any casualty figures, while militants, who are still holding out inside a government building in the centre of Kramatorsk, said 10 people were killed when the military opened fire on civilians trying to stop armoured vehicles from entering the town.
Self-defence activists in Sloviansk on Saturday released a team of international military observers they seized a week ago, handing them over to Russian envoy Vladimir Lukin.

Bhattarai calls for General Convention
","The sharp differences within the ranks of top leadership in the UCPN (Maoist) came to the fore again on Saturday with Dr. Baburam Bhattarai criticising the party chairman’s political report and calling for the party’s highest forum, the General Convention to be convened.
Dr.Bhattarai, a former Prime Minister, dubbed Chairman Pushpa Kamal Dahal Prachanda’s report as superficial and failing to address the changed realities in the party and the country, according to several local reports. In his report to the delegates in the closed-door session in the eastern city of Biratnagar, Mr. Prachanda noted that the party was moving in the right direction by adopting the necessary action plan. Dr. Bhattarai begged to differ.
“The report fails to address the managing of the two-line struggle within the party and its leadership style,” Dr. Bhattarai said in his seven-point rejoinder during the closed-door session.
He called for holding the party’s General Convention as soon as possible to suggest a political plan of action.
The General Convention, which should be held at least once in every five years, was last held in Hetauda in 2013 — after a gap of over 20 years.
He also criticised Mr. Prachanda’s assertion that writing the new Constitution “was becoming impossible.” Dr. Bhattarai said it was possible to have the Constitution drafted by the second Constituent Assembly if honest attempts were made.
“This would be in favour of the party and revolution.”
Dr. Bhattarai, who is known for offering notes of dissent or counter suggestions to the party chairman’s political reports or line of action, said it was necessary to have a healthy debate both within and outside the party on the way forward.
The ongoing conference has also brought to the fore internal differences. Delegates from nearly 10 of the 75 districts could not be chosen due to infighting.

Pakistan Army regaining lost base
","It’s been a season of rather grievous attacks and outraged denials. After Amir Mir, brother of journalist and anchorperson Hamid Mir who was shot in Karachi on April 19, blamed the ISI for the murderous attempt, the empire has struck back in a big way.
On the same day while ISI director general Zaheer-ul-Islam’s photograph was on air for several hours, the Inter Services Public Relations (ISPR) issued a statement condemning the incident and called for an independent inquiry.
Raising allegations against the ISI or the head of ISI without any basis is highly regrettable and misleading, the ISPR spokesperson said.
A week after the attack on Hamid Mir, posters with the DG ISI’s photo and slogans saying ‘Pakistan loves the Army’ appeared in the capital.
Earlier this week there were huge protests in major cities which sought to express solidarity with the ISI and criticised Geo TV.
On Saturday the Jamat-ud-Dawa (JuD), among the groups which put up the posters supporting the Pakistan army, the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) and other political parties organised a protest ironically on World Press Freedom Day. Amir Mughal, of the PTI said the media cannot attack Pakistan’s biggest institution.
Mariana Babar, diplomatic correspondent for The News told The Hindu on the phone that the ISI taking on the media was not something new.
When she started her career under the martial law regime of Zia-ul-Haq, things were more or less the same. The situation appears as if the country has gone back to the 1980s, she pointed out and nothing seems to have changed over the years.
However, she said the media, specially the electronic media should show greater responsibility while reporting news.
While everyone thought that other institutions in Pakistan had become strong like the media, judiciary, and civil society, Ms. Babar said, as soon as they stepped on the toes of the army, it hit back to show that it is still a sacred institution.
The army remains powerful and possessive about its space, she said.
Already The News and the Jang were being stopped in parts of the garrison city of Rawalpindi and other areas.
On the day after the attack on Hamid Mir, except for The News most other English newspapers played down the incident and chose to highlight the ISPR statement. Senior journalists are of the opinion that while it was natural for Mr. Amir Mir to make such statements, an investigation must first be carried out to ascertain facts.There are few who did not condemn the attack on Hamid Mir but the vindication of the ISI has been ferocious.

Sri Lankan daily holds a mirror, to the press
","An English newspaper here on Saturday tried to hold a mirror to the state of press freedom in the country by printing a mirror image of its front page contents.
Readers were in for a surprise on World Press Freedom Day.  The printing of indecipherable words by Daily Mirror, an English newspaper here, seemed to be aimed at sparking questions about the state of media freedom in the country, and what it spawns — self-censorship.
Freedom of pressThe sole legible sentence on the front page read: “Only true freedom of the press can turn things the right way around. Celebrating World Press Freedom Day 2014!”  
The message rang a bell as Sri Lanka, for long, has been grappling with the issue of media freedom. There have been many instances of media persons being attacked, and even murdered.
The country has lost some of its senior journalists, including Lasantha Wickrematunge, editor of the 
Sunday Leader.  
“The fact that none of the perpetrators has been brought to justice is rather worrying,” V. Thanapalabalasingham, Editor of Thinakural, a Tamil daily. Such a situation only breeds more fear and consequently, self-censorship, said media professionals. The culture of self-censorship, in turn, negatively impacted the quality of journalism, they observed.
“Gains in professional standards could be undermined by a culture of self-censorship which could be due to a multitude of reasons, ” said Amal Jayasinghe, bureau chief of Agence France-Presse (AFP), adding that risk aversion and a lack of resources threatened to bring down the credibility of Sri Lanka’s press.
Observing that there was a threat to the freedom of expression, Saman Wagaarachchi, editor of Sinhala paper Lakbima said: “Today, most media organisations are wary of being critical of the government and therefore, self-censorship is a major issue.”
Over the last few years, media freedom in Sri Lanka has drawn increased international attention. The U.S.-backed resolution, adopted by the Human Rights Council (HRC) in March this year, has urged the Government of Sri Lanka to investigate all alleged attacks by individuals and groups on various sections, including journalists.
While mainstream media was faced with challenges, Mr. Jayasinghe observed that it was heartening to see social media take on issues which may be taboo or too sensitive for the established news outlets.

Row over Hafiz Saeed meet
","Chief of the Jamat ud Dawa (JuD) Hafiz Saeed on Friday was invited to address members of the Lahore High Court bar association at a seminar.
JUD spokesperson Asif Khurshid told The Hindu that Mr. Saeed was invited to talk at a seminar in the bar association premises and he dwelt on a number of issues, including the Indian elections, the media and ISI standoff and Kashmir.
The Business Recorder reported that Mr. Saeed said that US and its allies had made Pakistan a battlefield after facing defeat in Afghanistan.
He said it is high time to implement the ""Ideology of Pakistan"" to bring peace in the country. He said people from all walks of life, including lawyers should come forward to eliminate terrorism in the country, according to the report.
However, a controversy has erupted after this incident with reports that some bar members were opposing it rather belatedly. Mr. Khurshid said he had no information of any opposition and the JUD chief went there and spoke at the invitation of the association. He said it was natural that there would be differences, such things exist everywhere but the talk went off smoothly.

Musharraf told to appear in court in Lal Masjid case
","Former military dictator Pervez Musharraf was on Saturday summoned by a Pakistani court on May 22 in connection with a case related to the killing of Lal Masjid cleric Abdul Rasheed Ghazi in a 2007 military raid.
Additional district and sessions Judge Wajid Ali heard the case. Musharraf’s lawyers submitted an application requesting that the former president be exempted from attending today’s proceedings, citing security threats.
During the hearing, an acquittal plea was also submitted in the court on behalf of the retired general.
Musharraf’s counsel Akhtar Shah presented the stance that the Lal Masjid operation was conducted on the directives of the then-administration.
He added that Deputy Commissioner Islamabad had written a letter to Triple One Brigade for conducting the operation.
Shah said it would be an injustice to hold Musharraf responsible for the operation.
The court issued notices to the concerned parties on Musharraf’s applications seeking permanent exemption from court proceedings and acquittal from murder charges.
The plaintiff Haroon Rashid’s lawyer, Tariq Asad, said Musharraf could be produced in court by making proper security arrangements.
He also suggested that Musharraf’s trial could be held in the High Court building. He added that Musharraf was also making his mother’s serious illness an excuse for escaping the trial.

Over 350 killed in Afghan landslide
","A landslide triggered by heavy rain buried large sections of a remote northeastern Afghan village on Friday, killing at least 350 people and leaving more than 2,000 missing. Villagers looked on helplessly and the governor appealed for shovels to help dig through the mass of mud that flattened every home in its path.
The mountainous area in Badakhshan province has experienced days of heavy rain and flooding, and the side of a cliff collapsed onto the village of Hobo Barik around midday. Landslides and avalanches are frequent in Afghanistan, but Friday’s was one of the deadliest.
Gov. Shah Waliullah Adeeb said more than 2,000 people were missing after the landslide buried some 300 homes about a third of all the houses in the area.
At least 350 people were confirmed dead, according to Ari Gaitanis, a spokesman from the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan. He said the U.N. was working with authorities on the ground to rescue people still trapped.
The governor said rescue crews were working but didn’t have enough equipment.
“It’s physically impossible right now,” Mr. Adeeb said. “We don’t have enough shovels; we need more machinery.”
Badakhshan provincial police chief, Maj. Gen. Faziluddin Hayar said rescuers had pulled seven survivors and three bodies from the mounds of mud and earth but held out little hope that more survivors would be found.
“Now we can only help the displaced people. Those trapped under the landslide and who have lost lives, it is impossible to do anything for them,” Hayar said.
Video footage of the scene showed a large section of the mountain collapsed, sending mud and earth tumbling onto the village below.
The landslide was likely caused by heavy rain, said Abdullah Homayun Dehqan, the province’s director for National Disaster Department. He said floods last week in different districts of the province killed four people and eight more were still missing.
Landslides occur frequently in the province, but they generally happen in remote areas and produce far fewer casualties, said Mohammad Usman Abu Zar from the Meteorology Department of Badakhshan province.
Authorities evacuated a nearby village over concerns about further landslides, the governor said. Dehqan said blankets and tents had been sent and about 400 people from nearby villages had gathered to help with the rescue effort.
Badakhshan province, nestled in the Hindu Kush and Pamir mountain ranges and bordering China, is one of the most remote in the country.

Uruguay’s rules for marijuana market

3 Chinese farmers face jail for forming ‘own government’
","When the villagers of Jitan, a small township in China’s central Henan province, were facing a threat to their lands from a powerful developer, they turned to Beijing for help.
When their petitions fell on deaf ears, the villagers decided to take matters into their own hands: three farmers, out of desperation, quietly set up their own ""government office"", and using copies of official seals, began issuing ""orders"" in the style of government directives, telling local developers to prevent their land acquisitions.
Remarkably, for six months, the citizen-run government office – perhaps the only in one party-controlled China run by ordinary people – saw unsuspecting developers follow their orders, assuming that the directives were from the Communist Party. The office even sent out recruitment notices. Ten aspiring civil servants applied.
For half-a-year, China’s only people-run government office appeared to work as a government should: it helped fight for villagers’ rights, and blocked developers’ attempting to forcibly acquire farmland.
However, last month, local CPC cadres discovered the three person-run office and shut it down. The three farmers – Zhang Haixin, Ma Xianglan and Wang Liangshuang – may now face three years in jail, charged with impersonating a public office and fabricating official documents, the Global Times reported.
Their story has shed light on how far China’s villagers, desperate to hold on to their land, or at least to receive fair compensation, are willing to go in an increasingly futile battle against powerful developers, who often have close ties with local Communist Party cadres and leaders looking to boost their coffers.
The story of Ms. Zhang (46), who led the effort to establish a “people’s government”, began in 2007, when she started petitioning provincial government officials against local leaders, who were visiting her restaurant but refusing to pay, the South China Morning Post (SCMP) reported.
Her blocked petitions led her to organise fellow citizens who were fighting for justice, as she led groups of petitioners to the provincial capital, Zhengzhou, even paying for their travel.
When their efforts failed, she decided to set up her own government office. She studied land policy and the law, closely examined official documents and then started issuing orders using copied official seals.
Her “government” operated out of her one-room apartment that sat down the street from the local government office.
Remarkably, their office functioned for a year, issuing orders that helped protect villagers’ rights – and, some would argue, fulfilling the role that the local Communist Party government had failed to perform.
However, earlier this year, a property developer discovered their office and reported it to higher authorities. The Dengzhou city’s prosecutors said the three have now been charged with using fake seals and issuing fabricated documents.
Ma Xianglan, a farmer from a village near Dengzhou, told the SCMP that Ms. Zhang was seen by many as someone who, for villagers, “could get things done”.
“Soon as I saw her, I was disappointed. She was chubby and tanned, standing at 1.6 meters,"" Ms. Ma said. “But when we began to speak, my doubts began to clear as her speech is well paced and she knew a lot about land policy.”
A lawyer told the Global Times Ms. Zhang could face a jail term of three years. For the villagers of Henan, though, she is anyone but a criminal.

OSCE observers held in Ukraine released
","Pro-Russia insurgents in eastern Ukraine on Saturday released the seven OSCE military observers and five Ukrainian assistants who had been held for more than a week.
The observers were seized on April 25 in Slovyansk, as they travelled with an Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe observer team. The insurgents said they possessed unspecified suspicious material and alleged they were spying for NATO.
An observer from Sweden was also seized as part of the team, but was released earlier.
Shortly before the release, the insurgents’ leader in Slovyansk, Vyacheslav Ponomarev, was quoted by the Interfax news agency as saying he ordered the release because of increasing insecurity in the city.
Two Ukrainian helicopters were reported shot down outside the city on Friday, killing two crew members and the Ukrainian Defence Ministry said two other soldiers were killed in a clash on the outskirts. Mr. Ponomarev said 10 local people were killed in a confrontation with soldiers on Slovyansk’s outskirts, but there was no independent confirmation.
Despite the release, tensions in Ukraine heightened sharply after at least 42 people died in clashes between government supporters and opponents in the Black Sea port of Odessa on Friday. The clash began with street fighting between the two sides, in which as least three people were reported killed by gunfire, then turned into a grisly conflagration when government opponents took refuge in a building that caught fire after protesters threw firebombs inside.
Russian President Vladimir Putin’s spokesman on Saturday decried the Odessa deaths as evidence that the interim government in Kiev encourages nationalist extremists.
“Their arms are up to their elbows in blood,” Russian news agencies quoted Dmitry Peskov as saying.

Financial networks supporting LTTE active: U.S.
","After three years of acrimony between the U.S. and Sri Lanka at the >Human Rights Council, the two countries appear to have found common ground on one issue.
Earlier this week the U.S. said the >LTTE’s financial network of support continued to operate throughout 2013, echoing Sri Lankan claims that a section of LTTE supporters living abroad were trying to resurrect the organisation.
The United States Department of State, in its recent report on terrorism, said the LTTE uses its international contacts and the large >Tamil diaspora in North America, Europe, and Asia to procure weapons, communications equipment, funding, and other needed supplies. “The group employed charities as fronts to collect and divert funds for their activities,” it observed, apparently resonating with the Sri Lankan government’s position on the possible regrouping of the LTTE.
The Sri Lankan government, concerned over reported attempts to revive the LTTE in the country’s predominantly Tamil-speaking north and east, took various measures over the last couple of months. Sri Lankan police >arrested over 60 persons, primarily those residing in the Northern Province, on charges of harbouring terrorists. Prominent human rights activist >Ruki Fernando and catholic priest Father Praveen were arrested in Kilinochchi, under the Prevention of Terrorism Act, even as the >Geneva session was on. On April 11, Sri Lankan armed forces shot dead three men who allegedly tried to revive the rebel Tiger movement in the country’s >Northern Province.
On the apparent concurrence of the U.S. — prime mover of three resolutions against Sri Lanka in Geneva — and the Sri Lankan government on the issue of the LTTE’s possible revival has intrigued some in Colombo, activist Paikiasothy Saravanamuttu said collaboration between various international intelligence agencies on the issue of international terrorism did not throw a surprise.
“If there is any hard evidence of a sustained LTTE exercise abroad, I suppose the report is relevant, for the political objectives of those groups [among Tamil diaspora] are well within Sri Lanka,” said Mr. Saravanamuttu, executive director of the Centre for Policy Alternatives, a think tank based in Colombo.
Asked if the U.S. too believed there was a possibility of the LTTE regrouping, the U.S. Embassy spokesperson in Colombo told The Hindu that the report covers the 2013 situation, so the latest information was not included. “The U.S. was the first country to proscribe the LTTE as a foreign terror organisation and continues to list it as a terror organisation. The LTTE was designated a Foreign Terrorist Organisation on October 8, 1997, and was named a Specially Designated Global Terrorist organisation in 2001,” the spokesperson said.

China wants to tap India’s expertise in services sector
","Even as India is on the threshold of electing a new government, neighbouring China sees a huge potential for cooperation between the two countries, especially in economic development, according to Cheng Guang Zhong, minister-counsellor of the Chinese Embassy in Delhi.
Mr. Cheng, heading a four-member delegation on a visit to Chennai from May 2 to 4, said China could gain a lot from India’s expertise in the services sector.
“China is much developed in industrial area and is actually facing the problem of overindustrialisation. India is better in the service area. So it is time for China to learn from Indian experience in the services sector and it can provide its experience to India’s industrial development,” he told The Hindu.
He said the Chinese Ambassador would visit Chennai by month-end and one of the purposes was to identify the place for setting up a Chinese Industrial Park, planned when Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Chinese Premier Li Keqiang exchanged visits last year.
“The Ambassador had already visited Madhya Pradesh, Bihar and a few other States but the place had not been finalised. The specifications of the model of the Park were also not clear” he said.
Mr. Cheng also revealed plans to launch a joint venture project for production of power equipment as there was only one state-owned company in India.
“I was told there is a power crisis” and that bookings made for equipment would have to wait till 2030. “The joint venture project would facilitate manufacture in India itself,” he said, adding it was better than buying equipment directly from China.
Expressing confidence that both India and China had great future in economic cooperation, he said the benefit of cooperation was good not only for revitalisation of the two ancient civilisations in the 21st century but also for the Asian continent as a whole.
“As long as China and India, the two ancient civilisations, can cooperate and join hands, it is good for world peace, development and prosperity,” he stressed.
While India and China were holding talks for cooperation in the Information Technology and Health sectors, the two countries could have broad cooperation in agriculture also, he said..
“We also see a huge potential in the field of infrastructure development and construction, especially in the area of railway, port and road development,” he said.
Asked how China could help India in the agricultural sector, he said China’s agricultural revolution had solved the problem of feeding a 1.3-billion population. The two countries could have cooperation on seeds and high production.
“China is on the way to modernisation of agriculture. Through modernisation we are definitely solving the problems of urbanisation and also creating jobs for farmers,” he said.

Alleged IM operative deported from UAE
","Faizan Ahmad Sultan, named by the National Investigation Agency as a key Indian Mujahideen organiser, was deported by the UAE late on Friday, in what investigators describe as a key breakthrough in foiling the Islamist terror group’s recruitment and fundraising operations in West Asia.
Faizan was escorted to New Delhi by Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) officials and was arrested by the NIA soon after his arrival.
Police sources told The Hindu that UAE authorities detained Faizan soon after he was located by RAW in February, based on leads developed through the interrogation of alleged Indian Mujahideen commander Mohammad Ahmad Zarar Siddibapa. Siddibapa, held while crossing the India-Nepal border last year, is now awaiting trial.
Faizan, investigators allege, played a key role in helping Indian Mujahideen fugitives flee India after a 2008 police operation targeting the group led to the arrest of several second-rung operatives, and the death of top commander Mohammad Atif Amin. In addition, he is alleged to have helped Mohammad Ismail, also known as “Gora Ismail,” route funds from Karachi-based Indian Mujahideen military commander Riyaz Ahmad Shahbandri to operatives in India.
In February, a Delhi District and Sessions Judge issued a warrant against Faizan, after the NIA told it he had been held in Dubai. The warrant, sources said, laid the ground for UAE authorities to initiate proceedings for Faizan’s removal from Sharjah.
Earlier, a special cell of the Delhi Police requested another court to issue a warrant against him in connection with the 2008 serial blasts in the capital. The court declined the request.
Diplomatic sources told The Hindu that the arrest was a sign of growing cooperation with West Asian states — once safe havens for Indian criminals. Saudi Arabia handed over alleged 26/11 perpetrator Zabiuddin Ansari, though he held a Pakistani passport. In 2009, Oman handed over Sarfaraz Nawaz, accused of involvement with the Indian Mujahideen.

Male students at the dorm, which caters for the children and grandchildren of Guardia Civil officers, are instead instructed to quietly pass their clothes to female friends to be washed.
The association that represents Guardia Civil officers is demanding that the rule be changed. “What is being asked of residents is obsolete, unjust, sexist and borderline ridiculous,” Francisco Cecilia, of the Unified Guardia Civil Association told El Mundo. “In today’s world, it makes no sense that male residents would have to secretly pass their clothes to a female or visit a laundromat to do their laundry.” — © Guardian Newspapers Limited, 2014

People-to-people contact can erase suspicion: Anisuzzaman
","Anisuzzaman, who received the Padma Bhushan this year, has expressed the hope that the political leaders of Bangladesh and India would act like “statesmen” in resolving the outstanding problems between the two countries.
The Professor Emeritus of Dhaka University, who is best known for his secular democratic values, however, said it was “unfortunate” that several issues remained unresolved despite “improved” bilateral relations in recent years.
Indian High Commissioner to Bangladesh Pankaj Saran felicitated the professor on Friday on his receiving the Padma Bhushan which was presented by President Pranab Mukherjee on March 31 for his “distinguished service of high order” in the field of Bangla literature and education.
Hoping for better ties between the two neighbours, the 77-year-old professor said people’s representatives of both countries were the ones who would thrash out outstanding problems. The “fear of the unknown” and “suspicion of the unknown,” he observed, were causing a lot of problems between the countries. “If the people of the two countries can come closer and know each other, many of the suspicions may go away,” he remarked.
Prof. Anisuzzaman dedicated the award to “greater bondage” between India and Bangladesh. As a pragmatist, the professor said, relationships had their ups and downs, “so had the relationship between India and Bangladesh.”
His remarks came in the context of the failure to sign the much-talked about Teesta water-sharing treaty and ratification of the land boundary agreement, although Indo-Bangladesh relations saw wide-ranging engagement during the last five years.
The educationist and researcher, who has established himself in the vanguard of the nation’s secular ethos, thanked the Indian government for the award and called upon all to strive for “world citizenship” that Rabindranath Tagore, world poet and common poet of India and Bangladesh, advised.
Mr. Pankaj Saran said the award was “not only for his personal contributions, but also a tribute to the values for which he stands and the great intellectual and literary traditions for which Bangladesh has always been known.”

Moscow to give peace another chance
","Russia hopes to initiate peace talks in coming days between Ukrainian authorities and rebellious eastern regions even as Kiev presses on with its military crackdown on anti-government protesters.
“I think new efforts will be undertaken in the next few days to bring to the negotiating table Kiev’s authorities and representatives of the southeast in order to resolve problems that cause suffering and death in different parts of Ukraine,” said Russia’s Deputy Foreign Minister Grigory Karasin, who looks after the former Soviet states.
The statement came hours after Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and German Foreign Minister Frank Walter Steinmeier discussed the possibility of Ukrainian talks on the phone.
Moscow said the two Ministers agreed “to assist in launching an equal dialogue” between Kiev and eastern rebels “on practical steps” to implement the Geneva accord. The talks are to be mediated by the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).
According to the Russian Foreign Ministry, Mr. Steinmeier “agreed with the need to immediately halt violence and begin implementing the agreements under the Geneva declaration of April 17.”
The Geneva accord called for an end to violence by all sides, disarmament of irregulars, and an “inclusive” constitutional reform Ukraine acceptable to all regions.
However, shortly afterwards, Kiev moved the army and the national guard against the protesters in Ukraine’s Russian-speaking southeast. Ukrainian authorities and protesters gave conflicting reports on Sunday on the situation in the Donetsk Region, which has been the flashpoint of armed confrontation in recent days.
Kiev claimed to have retaken Kramatorsk and a few smaller towns on Saturday while rebels said that overnight they restored control over the towns.
In Odessa hundreds of residents forced their way into a police station and secured the release of a majority of anti-government protesters arrested following deadly clashes with nationalist radicals on Friday in which 46 people died.
“It is outrageous that they arrested anti-fascist protesters and let go the militants who came from Kiev and massacred Odessa residents,” a demonstrator told Russian television.
Ukraine’s Acting Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk, who visited Odessa on Sunday, accused Russia and “pro-Russian separatists” of waging “a real war, a war to destroy Ukraine and its independence.”
Moscow said Kiev was “incapable of setting up dialogue without outside help.”
It is up to the international community “to force the Kiev authorities to stop violence in the southeast,” Deputy Foreign Minister Karasin said.

We will move forward with severe sanctions against Russia: Obama
","The United States has indicated the timeline for imposing new sanctions on Russia: end of May, when Ukraine is to hold presidential elections.
“If in fact we see the disruptions and the destabilisation continuing so severely that it impedes elections on May 25, we will not have a choice but to move forward with additional, more severe sanctions,” U.S. President Barack Obama declared after talks in Washington with German Chancellor Angela Merkel last week.
With Moscow strongly opposed to any elections in Ukraine in the backdrop of Kiev's ongoing military crackdown on anti-government protests in the east, further sanctions appear inevitable.
The first two rounds of Western sanctions have targeted Russian officials and businessmen close to President Vladimir Putin. They had little direct effect on the Russian economy, but spurred an outflow of capital that may total $150 billion in 2014 and increased the cost of borrowing for Russian companies.
According to Professor Alexei Portansky of the Higher School of Economics, Russia’s big companies will feel the pinch later this year, when they face refinancing of their foreign loans to the tune of $103 billion.
Mr. Obama said that the third round of sanctions will penalise selected Russian industries, such as energy, defence and finance, including trade credits.
The U.S. has already introduced restrictions on the export to Russia of high-tech dual-use products and technologies, which currently stands at about $1.5 billion a year.
Experts said the ban will mainly affect Russian research institutions and some high-tech companies, but not the defence industry, which is largely self-sufficient.
The Russian energy sector is unlikely to be targeted by Europe, which heavily depends on Russian supplies. Even Mr Obama admitted that it was “unrealistic” to hope that one could “turn off the tap on all Russian oil and natural gas exports.”
On the day the European Union expanded sanctions against Russian officials last week, Austria’s OMG oil and gas company signed agreement with Russia’s Gazprom to extend South Stream, a natural gas pipeline Russia plans to build across the Black Sea, into Austria.
The threat of sanctions has prompted Moscow to seek greater diversification of its energy exports. When President Vladimir Putin visits Beijing later this month, the two countries are expected to sign a deal on Russian gas supplies to China, which already imports over 15 million tons of Russian oil.
Europe’s business is strongly opposed to sanctions. Last week Germany’s business empires, including BASF, Siemens, Volkswagen, Adidas and Deutsche Bank, issued a warning against escalating sanctions against Russia.
The Kremlin hopes the sanctions will make Russia stronger.
“Thanks to Western sanctions, Russia has been given incentive to reduce dependence from outside and its regional economies will instead be more self-sufficient,” Russia’s Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev told the Parliament a week ago.
After Visa and MasterCard cut services to two Russian banks affected by U.S. sanctions, Mr. Putin approved a plan to create a national payment system within the next six months.
Even Kremlin critics admit that Russia’s resilience to sanctions may be greater the West’s capacity to maintain them.
“Russia has resources to withstand sanctions for at least three-five years,” said Mikhail Khodorkovsky, former oil tycoon. “Europe should first ask itself whether it is prepared to keen penalising Russia over such a long time.”

“I’ve gone through the grief of losing family, so I understand it well,” Ms. Park told relatives. She added, “My heart breaks to think about how you must feel.”
It was her second visit to the families of the ferry victims. She has previously apologised for the government’s inept initial response to the disaster, as families of the missing have repeatedly expressed fear about bodies being swept away.
After visiting the families, Ms. Park boarded a Coastguard vessel and arrived at the site where the ferry sank. Stepping on the barge, Ms. Park encouraged the divers, saying they were “the last hope” for the families.

Obama jokes about Putin, media at correspondents' dinner
","U.S. President Barack Obama poked fun at his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin, Republicans and media elites, and even mocked himself for his administration’s disastrous health care policy rollout at the annual White House Correspondents Association dinner on Sunday.
Mr. Obama, donning the role of comedian-in-chief, poked fun at himself over his signature policy initiative and refereed to the technical glitch experienced by healthcare.gov this year. “In 2008 my slogan was, ‘Yes we can.’ In 2013, it was control+alt+delete.”
Mr. Obama was at his oratorical best as he enthralled over 2,500 audiences, which included celebrities, politicians and American journalists at the WHCA’s 100th anniversary.
First Lady Michelle Obama accompanied him to the annual tradition that has the President mocking others and himself.
The 52-year-old U.S. President then turned to Fox news and said the TV channel would have a tough time in opposing Hillary Clinton, if she runs for 2016 presidential.
“Let’s face it, Fox. You will miss me when I am gone. It will be harder to convince the American people that Hillary was born in Kenya.”
Russian President Vladimir Putin too was at the receiving end of Mr. Obama’s wit, notwithstanding the Ukraine crisis. He cracked jokes about Mr. Putin being headed for a Nobel Peace Prize. “To be fair, they give those to just about anybody these days,” said Mr. Obama, a laureate himself.
He also turned the humour on Republican party saying the opposition brought in experts to learn how to talk to women.
“Both sides are doing whatever it takes to win - a ruthless game. Republicans, this is a true story. Republicans actually brought in a group of consultants to teach their candidates how to speak to women. This is true. And I don’t know if it will work with women, but I understand that America’s teenage boys are signing up to run for the Senate in droves.”
The President, who has completed nearly half of his second innings at the White House, also joked about opposition being busy attempting to repeal “Obamacare”.
“Of course, there is one thing that keeps Republicans busy. They have tried more than 50 times to repeal Obamacare.
Despite that, 8 million people signed up for health care in the first open enrollment which does lead one to ask, how well does Obamacare have to work before you don’t want to repeal it?” he said.
Mr. Obama recalled his days in office and the difficulties he faced last year and also mentioned the presidential election in 2016.
“It is strange to think that I have just two-and-a-half years left in this office. Everywhere I look, there are reminders that I only hold this job temporarily. But it is a long time between now and 2016, and anything can happen. You may have heard the other day Hillary had to dodge a flying shoe at a press conference,” Mr. Obama said as the slide showed Biden holding a shoe. “I love that picture.”
The dinner at the Washington Hilton Hotel has often come at key moments in the U.S. President’s presidency. In 2011, it came a day before Osama bin Laden was killed. Last year, the deadly Boston Marathon happened nearly two weeks before the dinner. This year, the Ukraine crises eclipses the WHCA event.

Gunman, 3 others killed in Arkansas shootings
","A gunman shot six people at a U.S. home, killing a man and a teenager and critically wounding two boys, before fatally shooting a worker at a nearby business, police said.
The suspected gunman was later found dead of a gunshot wound in the driver’s seat of a stopped car, Jonesboro police Sgt. Doug Formon said at a news conference. It was not immediately clear if the gunshot was self-inflicted.
Mr. Formon said a man and a 13-year-old girl were killed on Sunday afternoon inside the home in Arkansas, where it appeared a family was having a party or gathering.
Four other people were injured and were taken to hospitals. Mr. Formon said the children, aged 8 and 10, were transported in critical condition.
Police received a call about the shooting at the home and later responded to a report of a second shooting at a business, where Mr. Forman said the worker was found shot to death.
Mr. Formon said a farmer or passing motorist later called to report a car parked in the middle of a county road. A deputy responded and found the stopped car with the suspected gunman inside.
Mr. Forman said that police did not know of a motive and that the investigation is ongoing.
He declined to identify the victims or the suspect, saying officials wanted to be sure all family members had been notified. He said it was not known if the suspect and victims were related.

Three killed in twin explosions in Kenya
","Three people were killed and scores hurt on Saturday when two explosions rocked the Indian Ocean port city of Mombasa, Kenya’s Interior Ministry said.
All the casualties occurred when a grenade was thrown into a crowd at a bus stop in central Mombasa about 8:15 p.m. (1700 GMT), Mombasa police chief Robert Kitur told dpa by phone. He provided no further details.
The Kenya Red Cross reported 21 people were injured.
A second blast occurred at the Nyali Reef hotel, an upscale resort just north of Mombasa, Kenya’s second-largest city, but no casualties occurred in that blast, Mr. Kitur said.
Authorities have blamed a number of attacks on the Somali radical Islamist group al-Shabaab. It claimed responsibility for a September attack on a Nairobi shopping mall, which killed 67 people.
The U.S. Embassy in Nairobi sent out an emergency message shortly after the blasts urging all U.S. citizens in Mombasa to shelter in place and avoid any unnecessary travel.
Small grenade and gun attacks have occurred regularly on Kenya’s coast ever since the east African nation invaded Somalia to fight the al-Qaeda-aligned al-Shabaab extremists. Police routinely blame al-Shabaab and its sympathizers for the attacks though few people have been charged in court in connection with the blasts.
Saturday’s bombings occurred despite a major police crackdown that has seen thousands of people arrested across the country over the past month. The round-up has been heavily criticised by human rights groups that say it has targeted ethnic Somalis instead of criminals.
Numerous radical Islamist leaders also have been gunned down on the coast in mysterious circumstances, but the violence has not abated.
On April 1, the controversial cleric Abubaker Shariff was killed and his followers have vowed to avenge the death.
Last week a car bomb at a police station in Nairobi killed four people including two police officers.
Kenya’s tourism industry is heavily dependent on visitors, but has taken a major hit due to the widespread insecurity.

Kiev offensive kills dozens
","Ukrainian forces resumed the offensive against anti-government protesters in the country’s east, with dozens reported killed on Monday in fierce fighting near a rebel stronghold in Donetsk region.
Rebel self-defence forces battled advancing government troops on the outskirts of Sloviansk, the flashpoint of armed rebellion in Ukraine’s Russian-speaking southeast.
The Ukrainian army used aircraft and heavy artillery against the rebels, killing “more than 10 militia,” according to Rossiya 24 TV channel. Interfax news agency said at least 20 rebels had been killed.
Government forces lost four servicemen and about 30 were wounded, acting Interior Minister Arsen Avakov said.
Self-defence forces retreated into Sloviansk, and the army also pulled back.
The Ukrainian Defence Ministry said a helicopter had been shot down over Sloviansk on Monday. Kiev admitted to losing two helicopters during the first assault on Sloviansk last week.
In Donetsk, 1,000 volunteers were reported to have signed up to defend the city against Ukrainian forces following a call for mobilisation from the leaders of the self-proclaimed “Donetsk People’s Republic.” Rebels said they will hand out 10,000 firearms captured in the local security service headquarters in Donetsk.
The burning alive of dozens of anti-government protesters in Odessa, after a building was set on fire by Ukrainian neo-Nazi radicals on Friday, has ramped up hostility in eastern Ukraine toward nationalistic western regions of the country.
“We’re ready to fight to the end. If they [ultranationalists] come here they will just slaughter us,” a volunteer told Russian television.
The Interior Ministry announced on Monday that it had deployed in Odessa a new police force, “Kiev-1” battalion composed of “civil activists,” a euphemism for pro-government nationalists.
On Sunday, the neo-Nazis marched through central Odessa in an intimidating display of strength, chanting “glory to Ukraine.”
There were no Ukrainian nationalists among more than 100 activists detained after Friday’s clashes. On Sunday, relatives of the arrested broke into the detention station forcing police to release over 60 activists.
Germany’s Foreign Minister Frank Walter Steinmeier called for a Geneva-2 conference on Ukraine, saying that the April 17 Geneva accord had not been implemented.
“We do need a follow-up conference, as we should finally and fully agree on the diplomatic ways of Ukraine’s crisis regulation,” Mr. Steinmeier told the German broadcaster ARD on Monday.
Russia, for its part, is pushing for talks between Kiev and the protesters in Ukraine’s eastern regions.
One of the reasons Kiev is pressing ahead with its military crackdown is that the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which is due to release the first $3.2 billion out of a $17 billion loan for Ukraine agreed last month, said it could stop the disbursement of the rest of the money if Kiev loses control over its eastern regions.

East Ukraine fighting kills four soldiers, wounds 30
","Ukrainian troops fought pitched gunbattles Monday with a pro-Russia militia occupying an eastern city, and the government sent an elite national guard unit to re-establish control over the southern port city of Odessa.
The twin moves reflected an apparent escalation of efforts to bring both regions back under Kiev’s control. Any possible loss of Odessa in the west and parts of eastern Ukraine could leave the sprawling country landlocked, cut off entirely from the Black Sea. Russia has already annexed a significant part of Ukraine’s Black Sea coast in grabbing back the peninsula of Crimea.
AP reporters heard gunfire and multiple explosions Monday in and around Sloviansk, a city of 125,000 that has become the focus of the armed insurgency against the new interim government in Kiev.
Interior Minister Arsen Avakov said on his agency’s website that pro-Russia forces numbering about 800 were deploying large-calibre weapons and mortars. His agency reported four officers killed and 30 wounded in the fighting.
A pro-Russia militia spokesman in Sloviansk said an unspecified number of people had been killed and wounded in the clashes, including a 20-year-old woman killed by a stray bullet.
Both sides indicated fighting was taking place at several sites around the city. An AP crew saw at least four ambulances rushing injured people to a city hospital, and one militiaman was seen being carried in for medical treatment.
Ukraine is facing its worst crisis in decades as the polarized nation of 46 million tries to decide whether to look toward Europe, as its western regions want to do, or improve ties with Russia, which is favoured by the many Russian-speakers in the east.
The goals of the pro-Russian insurgency are ostensibly geared toward pushing for broader powers of autonomy for the region, but some insurgents do favour separatism.
In the last few weeks, anti-government forces have stormed and seized government buildings and police stations in a dozen eastern Ukrainian cities. Authorities in Kiev who blame Russia for backing the insurgents have up to now been largely powerless to react. Since Russia has kept tens of thousands of troops along Ukraine’s eastern border, Ukraine’s central government fears Russia could try to invade and grab more territory.
Kiev also moved on Monday to restore control over the Black Sea port city of Odessa, where pro-Russian activists vowed to take over government buildings.

>Odessa had remained largely peaceful even as violence erupted across east Ukraine. But 46 people died on Friday after riots broke out there between pro-Russian and pro-Ukrainian groups and a government building was set on fire.
Pro-Russian activists gathered on Monday in Odessa at the funeral of a regional member of parliament, Vyacheslav Markin, who died in that fire and was known for speaking out against the interim government in Kiev. They shouted “Hero! Hero!” and vowed to avenge his death.
“Kiev doesn’t control the situation in the country, Kiev controls only one half of Ukraine,” said 32-year-old Dmitry Sheiko, who was wearing the St. George black-and-orange ribbon, a ubiquitous symbol of the pro-Russia protest movement. “Even in Odessa they can’t maintain order, which means that we will restore order ourselves.”
Riots over the weekend have also brought into question the loyalty of Odessa’s police forces. On Sunday, pro-Russian demonstrators stormed the Odessa police headquarters and freed 67 people who had been detained in the rioting.
The Interior Ministry said in a statement Monday that it was sending an elite national guard unit from Kiev to re-establish control in the city, and said 42 of those arrested during the rioting were being sent to another region for investigation, presumably to prevent local police from releasing more prisoners.
Russia, which the >international community has accused of promoting the unrest, has vociferously condemned Ukraine’s security operations in the east and blamed it for the Odessa fire.

South Africa to vote this week

Nearly 2,000 military personnel will assist police to ensure security during the elections on Wednesday. Officials are helping some South Africans, including the sick and the elderly, to vote early.
Mr. Zuma also said he had been unfairly labelled as corrupt because of a scandal surrounding more than $20 million in state spending on his private home. South Africa’s state watchdog agency had released a report concluding that Mr. Zuma inappropriately benefited from state funding and should pay back some money for alleged security upgrades at the president’s rural Nkandla residence.
The report, Mr. Zuma insisted to journalists in Johannesburg, did not conclude that he had abused government funds, despite growing public dissatisfaction over a series of scandals linked to the president. That feeling was most evident when Mr. Zuma was booed by some in the crowd at a stadium memorial in December for Nelson Mandela, South Africa’s first black president.
“I don’t think it is fair treatment to a citizen,” the South African Press Associated quoted Mr. Zuma as saying of reports that have criticized his conduct.

Strong quake shakes Thailand, Myanmar
","A strong earthquake shook northern Thailand and Myanmar on Monday evening, and some light damage was reported.
People were evacuated from the terminal of the main airport in Chiang Rai, a northern Thai city near the epicenter of the 6.0-magnitude temblor.
Pieces of the building ceiling fell but there was no damage to the runway or flight disruptions, airport General Manager Damrong Klongakara said. No one was hurt at the airport, but Damrong said the terminal and its roof were still being checked for further damage.
Damages were being assessed in Chiang Rai’s Phan district, where ceilings fell in some homes, said Wander Radchompoo, head of the district. She said no casualties have been reported.
Broken windows and cracks in building exteriors and roads were visible in the region.
The head of a Buddha statue fell at the Udomwaree Temple in Chiang Rai, according to monk Phra Pathompong. A residential building at the temple also had exterior cracks and ceiling damage, and nearby residents reported only minor damage in their homes, he said.
People ran down stairs in office buildings in Myanmar’s largest city, Yangon, and severe shaking also was felt in Chiang Mai, Thailand’s second-largest. Window curtains briefly swayed in the Thai capital, Bangkok.
The U.S. Geological Survey said the epicenter was 9 kilometers south of Mae Lao, Thailand, and 27 kilometers southwest of Chiang Rai.
The quake occurred at a relatively shallow depth of 7.4 kilometers. Shallow quakes are generally felt more widely.
Southeast Asia is seismically active and quakes are often felt in surrounding nations. Thailand has several fault lines, though in recent times quakes centered in the country have been less severe than those in other Southeast Asian nations such as Myanmar and Indonesia.
The 9.1-magnitude earthquake off Indonesia’s Sumatra island on Dec. 26, 2004, which triggered an Indian Ocean tsunami, killed more than 8,000 people in Thailand’s coastal areas, among the overall death toll of 240,000.

21 Syrian rebels killed in Aleppo
","Fierce fighting around Syria’s contested northern province of Aleppo killed at least 21 rebels on Monday as rockets slammed into a government-held district in the provincial capital, killing nine people.
The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said that along with the 21 rebels, at least 30 soldiers were killed or wounded in Monday’s clashes in the province.
President Bashar Assad’s forces, backed by Lebanese Hezbollah militants and pro-government militias, have been trying to wrest as much territory in Aleppo from the opposition ahead of the June 3 presidential elections.
In the city of Aleppo, Syria’s largest and the provincial capital, government forces have been relentlessly shelling opposition districts with aircraft and artillery in recent months.
Aleppo has been divided between government - and opposition-held areas since rebels launched an offensive there in mid-2012, capturing whole neighbourhoods and large sections of territory outside the city and along the border with Turkey.
The rebels have been striking back, firing mortars and makeshift rockets into cities and towns under control of Assad’s forces. They have also detonated several car bombs in major cities, including in the capital, Damascus.
The state-run SANA news agency said rockets struck in Aleppo’s residential neighbourhood of Ashrafiyeh overnight, killing nine people and wounding several, mostly women and children.
The Observatory said troops loyal to Assad were battling Islamic rebel groups, including the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, around two rebel-held villages in Aleppo province on Monday.
The clashes, which erupted after Sunday midnight, killed at least 21 rebels, and killed or wounded about 30 Syrian soldiers, said the Observatory, which has documented the 3-year-old conflict based on reports from a network of activists on the ground. Syrian government does not publicize its casualties in the war.
Syria’s conflict, which began with largely peaceful protests in March 2011, has evolved into a civil war with sectarian overtones, pitting predominantly Sunni Muslim rebels against the Assad’ government that is dominated by Alawites, a sect in Shiite Islam. More than 1,50,000 people have been killed and millions have been displaced by the war.
Islamic extremists, including foreign fighters and Syrian rebels who have taken up hard-line al-Qaeda-style ideologies, have an increasingly prominent role in the war, dampening the West’s support for the rebellion to overthrow Mr. Assad. Many Syrians, particularly religious minorities, have also come to doubt the opposition, fearing that Islamic radicals would take over if Mr. Assad is ousted.
Mr. Assad took power after the death of his father, Hafez, in 2000. He has maintained throughout the conflict that his government is facing an uprising, insisting that his army is fighting terrorists that are part of the Western-and Gulf Arab-sponsored plot to destroy Syria.
Over the past year, Assad’s forces have been taking back rebel-held areas throughout Syria with a mix of crippling blockades, deals with rebels and relentless pounding of opposition-held areas. Presenting himself as a defender of united and religiously mixed Syria, Assad has pushed for the June 3 vote to seek a third seven-year term amid fierce fighting.
Despite two other candidates on the ballot, Mr. Assad is >widely expected to win the vote, which opposition activists and Western countries have condemned as a sham. The vote is expected to be held only in government-controlled territory.

Israel honours war dead with sombre Memorial Day
","Sirens have wailed across Israel bringing the country to a standstill on its Memorial Day for fallen soldiers and victims of terrorism.
Nationwide, Israelis stopped what they were doing at 11.00 a.m. on Monday and stood silently for two minutes to honour and remember the dead. Israel says 23,169 have been killed since 1860, when Jews began moving back to the area.
It is one of the most sombre dates on the Israeli calendar. Places of entertainment shut down while radio and TV air documentaries about wars and soldiers killed.
The sad atmosphere ends sharply at sundown when, in jarring contrast, Israelis joyfully take to the streets for Independence Day celebrations.
Sirens also brought the country to a halt last week for Israel’s Holocaust Memorial Day.

Migrant boats bound for Greece sink
","At least two people drowned and about 30 are missing after two boats crammed with illegal immigrants bound for Greece sank in the eastern Aegean Sea before dawn on Monday in the third fatal accident of the sort this year, authorities said.
The vessels foundered about 4 miles north of the island of Samos near the Turkish coast, the Greek coast guard said. It said 36 people were rescued from the sea.
According to survivors, up to 65 people were on the two vessels, the coast guard said.
It said the circumstances of the twin sinking were unclear as weather conditions in the area were not severe.
Coast guard vessels, fishing boats and two search and rescue helicopters were combing the area for more survivors. A cruise ship that participated for several hours in the operation was later cleared to continue its journey.
The nationalities of the migrants were unknown.
Greece is a major entry point for people from poor or war-torn parts of Asia and Africa seeking a better life in the European Union. Fatal accidents are frequent as migrants risk the dangerous sea crossing from Turkey.
Another 21 people have drowned in two accidents since the beginning of the year. Over the weekend Greek coastguards rescued about 250 immigrants from the sea.

WHO sounds alert on polio
","The World Health Organisation (WHO) on Monday said Pakistan, Cameroon, and the Syrian Arab Republic posed the greatest risk of spreading wild poliovirus in 2014 and recommended that these states declare that the interruption of the poliovirus transmission is a national public health emergency.
The recommendations came after members of the WHO’s Emergency Committee met on April 28 and 29. The three countries would have to take steps including ensuring that all residents and long-term visitors (those who stay more than four weeks) receive a dose of Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV) or inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) between 4 weeks and 12 months prior to international travel, a statement from WHO said.
Pakistan reported 93 cases in 2013, most of them from the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) where polio vaccination teams have little access. In 2014, so far 56 cases have been reported, 44 of them from FATA. Also cases of the wild poliovirus in Syria were traced to Pakistan last year.
The WHO also declared the international spread of wild poliovirus a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). The WHO Director-General endorsed the Committee’s advice for ‘states currently exporting wild polioviruses’ and for ‘states infected with wild poliovirus but not currently exporting’ and issued them as Temporary Recommendations under the International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005, to reduce the international spread of wild poliovirus, effective May 5, 2014.
There was increasing evidence that adult travellers contributed to the spread in 2013, WHO said.

Committed to peace process, says Adams
","Released without charge from a >four-day period of custody and interrogation by the Police Service of Northern Ireland, Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president said that his party “remains wedded” to the Northern Ireland peace process, and the policing dispensation that is a part of it.
His assurances that the peace process would not be derailed by his arrest were made along with assertions of his innocence. “This is not 1981, it is not 1972. There can be no going back,” he told a press conference after his release from custody. “The IRA is gone, it’s finished.”
Mr. Adams has always maintained that while he was associated with the Irish Republican Army, he was never its member. “Let me be very clear,” he reportedly told the press conference. “I am innocent of any involvement in any conspiracy to abduct, kill or bury Mrs. McConville,” the woman whose murder in 1972 he is accused of having masterminded.
A suspected informer, the 37-year old mother-of-10 was dragged out of her flat by masked men of the IRA in front of her horrified children, taken across the border and shot dead. One of the 15 “disappeared” in the conflict, her body was discovered buried in a beach in 2003.

End to ‘Troubles’

The 65-year old republican leader’s arrest led to widespread concerns that the peace process — anchored by the Belfast Good Friday Agreement of 1998 — would be undermined. Mr. Adams was the chief architect of the agreement that brought to an end the “Troubles” – the 30-year bloody conflict over the constitutional status of Northern Ireland.
The Sinn Fein — the second largest party in the Northern Ireland Assembly — had warned that if their leader is charged with murder, it would withdraw support to the police, which is a key strut in the agreement.
Mr. Adams’ arrest came after several testimonies by Brenden Hughes and other former associates of Mr. Adams to researchers from Boston College who were documenting the 30-year conflict.
Mr. Adams, who was questioned on the allegations made in the Boston Tapes, has maintained that the testimonies were discredited as they were based on hearsay, and would not stand as evidence in court.
In Northern Ireland, the peace process is still finding its way. In Belfast, for example, walls still separate Catholic and Protestant areas; most schools remain segregated on religious lines; and symbols like flags, insignia, and route-marches are matters of deep contention.
In fact, political differences on how to resolve outstanding peace issues resulted in the Northern Ireland Executive drawing up the Haas Proposals in December 2013. Under these proposals, ex-paramilitaries and former British security service operatives would be given “limited immunity” from prosecution, provided both sides abide by the other terms of the agreement. The British Government has not signed up to the Haas Proposals.

Demand for retribution

If the towering figure who crafted the peace agreement, and who is perceived as a public guarantor of its success, is convicted of murder, it is bound to see the Good Friday Agreement unravel.
At the heart of the peace process lies the difficult task of addressing the legacy of hate and the demand for retributive justice from those who suffered the loss of loved ones in a conflict that took 3,600 lives.
In Northern Ireland, those working the peace process on a day-to-day basis know that the peace process must not involve itself with settling scores of the past as that would only reopen old and unforgiving wounds. The conviction of Mr. Adams would threaten to do just that.

Militants threaten to sell abducted girls
","Nigeria’s Islamic extremist leader threatened in a videotaped statement seen on Monday to sell the more than 200 teenage girls abducted from a school in the remote northeast of the country three weeks ago.

Hour-long video

Abubakar Shekau for the first time also claimed responsibility for the April 15 mass abduction, in a video reviewed by The Associated Press. “I abducted your girls,” said the leader of Boko Haram, which means “Western education is sinful.”
“By Allah, I will sell them in the marketplace,” he said in the hour-long video that starts with fighters lofting automatic rifles and shooting in the air as they chant “Allahu akbar!” or “God is great.”
It was unclear if the video was made before or after unverified reports emerged last week that some of the girls have been forced to marry their abductors and that others were carried into neighbouring Cameroon and Chad.
An intermediary who has said Boko Haram is ready to negotiate ransoms for the girls also said two of the girls have died of snakebite and about 20 are ill. He said Christians among the girls have been forced to convert to Islam.
Nigeria’s police have said more than 300 girls were abducted. Of that number, 276 remain in captivity.
The mass abduction and the military’s failure to rescue the girls and young women have caused outrage with protests in major cities. Protesters accused President Goodluck Jonathan of being insensitive to the girls’ plight.
First lady Patience Jonathan fuelled anger on Monday when a leader of a protest march said she ordered the arrests of two protest leaders, expressed doubts there was any kidnapping and accused the protest leaders of belonging to Boko Haram.
It was unclear what authority Mrs. Jonathan would have to give such orders, since there is no office of first lady in the Nigerian Constitution. The first lady’s office denied there were any arrests.

US, Filipino troops begin large military drill
","More than 5,000 U.S. and Filipino troops began two weeks of military exercises on Monday to prepare to jointly deal with any potential crisis in the Philippines, which is prone to natural disasters and has been locked in a dangerous territorial standoff with China.
U.S. and Philippine military officials said at an >opening ceremony that 3,000 Filipino soldiers and 2,500 American military personnel would take part in the annual “Balikatan,” or shoulder to shoulder, exercises the largest of several military drills the allies stage each year.
American and Philippine officials said the manoeuvres would focus on maritime security and disaster response, but avoided linking the war games with their concern over China, which they have criticized for its increasingly assertive behaviour in disputed South China Sea territories.
The Philippines, the oldest of Washington’s five defence treaty allies in Asia, has turned to the U.S. to modernize its ill-equipped military amid the increasingly tense territorial rifts with China.
Dozens of left-wing activists protested outside the main military camp in the Philippine capital, Manila, where the opening ceremony was held. They said the drills and a recently signed agreement that allows a larger U.S. military presence in the country would violate the Philippine Constitution, which prohibits foreign troops except when their presence is covered by a treaty.
Australia deployed 65 army soldiers and air force personnel to participate in live-fire manoeuvres and charity activities. It also deployed a P3 Orion aircraft for a surveillance exercise with U.S. and Philippine military counterparts, Royal Australian Air Force Wing Commander Nicholas Pratt said.
Australia has signed an agreement with the Philippines that allows its forces to hold military exercises with Filipino troops in the country, the only other such pact Manila has signed aside from the United States.
Philippine Foreign Secretary Albert del Rosario said the exercises would strengthen the countries’ capability to deal with increasing tensions “due to excessive and expansive maritime and territorial claims” and “aggressive patterns of behaviour” that threaten regional peace and stability.
The exercises will be held in military camps in the northern and western Philippines, including in Zambales and Palawan provinces on the edge of the South China Sea. The manoeuvres will include maritime surveillance exercises, live-fire drills, training on handling bombs and “mass casualty response,” a Philippine military statement said.
China, the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia, Taiwan and Vietnam have overlapping claims in potentially oil-and gas-rich areas in the busy South China Sea, with Beijing laying claim to virtually the entire body of water.
The territorial spats between Beijing and Manila have worsened after Chinese government ships effectively gained control of the disputed Scarborough Shoal in 2012 then blockaded the Second Thomas Shoal, where Philippine marines have been based on a grounded navy ship since 1999.
Chinese coast guard ships have twice attempted to block Philippine ships bringing in food and fresh batches of marines to Second Thomas Shoal, increasing tensions. A Philippine military plane dropped food supplies and letters from Filipino supporters to the marines marooned at the Second Thomas Shoal over the weekend.

Experts to re-examine all gathered data on MH370
","An international panel of experts will re-examine all data gathered in the nearly two-month hunt for the missing Malaysia jet to ensure search crews who have been scouring a desolate patch of ocean for the plane have been looking in the right place, officials said on Monday.
Senior officials from Malaysia, Australia and China met in Canberra to hash out the details of the next steps in the search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, which will centre around an expanded patch of seafloor in a remote area of the Indian Ocean off Western Australia. The area became the focus of the hunt after a team of analysts calculated the plane’s likeliest flight path based on satellite and radar data.
Starting Wednesday, that data will be re-analysed and combined with all information gathered thus far in the search, which hasn’t turned up a single piece of debris despite crews scouring more than 4.6 million square kilometres of ocean.
“We’ve got to this stage of the process where it’s very sensible to go back and have a look at all of the data that has been gathered, all of the analysis that has been done and make sure there’s no flaws in it, the assumptions are right, the analysis is right and the deductions and conclusions are right,” Angus Houston, head of the search operation, told reporters in Canberra.
Investigators have been stymied by a lack of hard data since the plane vanished on March 8 during a flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. A weeks-long search for surface debris was called off last week after officials determined any wreckage that may have been floating has likely sunk.
“Unfortunately, all of that effort has found nothing,” Australian Transport Minister Warren Truss said. “We’ve been confident on the basis of the information provided that the search area was the right one, but in practice, that confidence has not been converted into us discovering any trace of the aircraft.”

2 Chinese sailors die in Pacific after boat capsizes
","Two Chinese sailors died and six are believed to be missing after their boat sank in the Pacific Ocean, an official at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base said on Sunday.
Maj. Sarah Schwennesen said that a Venezuelan fishing boat reported finding 11 sailors floating in a raft on Friday afternoon.
She said the Venezuelan crew said four sailors were badly burned. Two later died of their injuries.
Airmen from the 563rd Rescue Group parachuted into the water on Saturday afternoon and used inflatable boats to reach the Venezuelan vessel, which is 1,100 nautical miles west of Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, Maj. Schwennesen said. They treated the injured sailors Saturday and into Sunday morning.
The rescuers treated the sailors, who will be hoisted, along with the U.S. airmen, onto three helicopters on Sunday and flown to Cabo San Lucas. The injured pair will then be taken in a different aircraft to a burn unit in San Diego, accompanied by the airmen giving them care.
The distance required to reach the sailors has been the most challenging, Maj. Schwennesen said. Because of an estimated six-hour flight that included flying over miles of ocean, a refuelling aircraft was dispatched from the Arizona Air National Guard in Phoenix.

Russia, West wrangle over talks format
","Russia and European nations on Tuesday wrangled over the format of Ukrainian peace talks even as Kiev pressed on with armed suppression of anti-government protesters in eastern Ukraine.
The crisis in Ukraine dominated a Council of Europe meeting in Vienna that demonstrated a shift in the stand of Europeans in favour of halting escalating bloodshed in Ukrainian south-eastern regions.
German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier warned that Ukraine was close to war following deadly clashes in Odessa last week in which dozens died.
“The bloody pictures from Odessa have shown us that we are just a few steps away from a military confrontation,” Mr. Steinmeier said in interviews published on Tuesday simultaneously in Europe’s four leading papers.
Germany’s view of the situation in Ukraine was in sharp contrast with the stand taken by the United States, which has strongly supported Kiev’s military crackdown on the protests in the southeast.
“I’m convinced we are struggling against a situation that has taken on a dynamic of its own. There are groups in eastern Ukraine that are not listening to either Kiev ... or Moscow,” the German Foreign Minister said.
Mr. Steinmeier proposed holding another round of four-way Geneva talks between Russia, the U.S., the European Union and Ukraine, who first met in April.
However, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said that any new round of talks in Geneva should include representatives of protesters telling reporters that otherwise the talks “would go round in circles.”
The main task today is to “bring all sides to the negotiating table,” Mr. Lavrov said.
The Russian and German Foreign Ministers met for one-to-one talks later on Tuesday in Vienna.
The Ukrainian Parliament on Tuesday turned down a proposal to hold a referendum on decentralisation of power to the regions. Instead, Kiev plans to conduct a non-binding “survey” on this issue, to coincide with presidential elections scheduled for May 25.
The crisis in Ukraine has sharply escalated in recent days. Interior Minister Arsen Avakov said on Tuesday that four soldiers and about 30 rebels had been killed in fierce fighting near Sloviansk on Monday.
Self-defence forces in Sloviansk confirmed suffering heavy losses. Rebel intelligence reported a large column of Ukrainian tanks and other armoured vehicles moving towards Sloviansk on Tuesday.
Several opposition politicians accused Ukrainian authorities of concealing the true figure of casualties in Friday’s violence in Odessa.
According to official reports, 46 people died in clashes, but Oleg Tsaryov, a presidential candidate, said “no less than 100, and probably far more” had died.

Former BBC presenter admits to sexual assault on minor girl
","Stuart Hall, a popular and long-serving BBC commentator, admitted on Tuesday to the charge of indecently assaulting a girl under the age of 16, but denied 20 other charges of sexual assault.
He is to go on trial for the alleged offence of 15 rapes and five indecent assaults against two minor girls between the years 1976 and 1981.
Mr. Hall is one of several high profile media personalities whose sexual transgressions have recently come to light under the Jimmy Savile effect. Mr. Savile, a radio and television presenter, and celebrated BBC media personality, was discovered after his death to have been a predatory sex offender who raped and otherwise sexually abused hundreds of children during his media career.
Mr. Hall, now 84, was first arrested in 2012 on charges of multiple sexual offences.
Just one week ago, celebrity publicist Max Richards, 71, was sentenced to eight years’ imprisonment for a string of sexual offences against young girls and women whom he had groomed during his professional career.
Mr. Richards’ was the first conviction under Operation Yewtree, the investigation set up in October 2012 by the Metropolitan police into sexual abuse allegations, especially against children, in the wake of the Savile scandal. The case against Mr. Hall however falls outside the Operation Yewtree investigation.
Last month Dave Lee Travis, 68, a former Radio 1 DJ was charged by the police under Operation Yewtree on one count of indecent assault on a young woman. Mr. Travis had been earlier cleared of 12 counts of indecent assault.
In all these cases, the accused used their position as powerful media icons to terrorise their victims into acquiescence. Many of the alleged crimes took place as long ago as in the 1970s.
It is due to the enabling environment for disclosure that the police have created after the Savile scandal, that victims are coming forward to speak out.
More skeletons are expected to tumble out of the cupboard in the course of the Yewtree investigation.
Some on whom suspicion had fallen have subsequently been cleared, like comedian Freddie Starr, 71, who was arrested in 2012 and released on bail. He was recently let off by the Crown Persecution Service that cited insufficient evidence.

Bomb kills local al-Qaeda leader: Syrian activists
","A roadside bombing in Syria killed a local al-Qaeda leader and his wife, activists said on Tuesday, an attack that may ignite a new round of infighting between rebel groups in the war-torn country.
The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said Ali al-Nuaimi of the Nusra Front al-Qaeda’s affiliate in Syria and his wife were killed overnight while travelling in the southern Daraa province.
The bombing took place near the town of Busra al-Sham, according to the Observatory, which described the killing as an “assassination.”
The pro-rebel Sham News Network also reported the incident and its Daraa coordinator, Omar al-Hariri, said it wasn’t immediately clear who killed al-Nuaimi. The Nusra Front did not mention the attack on the social networks it typically uses.
The attack came after Nusra fighters seized a controversial Western-backed Syrian military commander, Ahmad al-Nuaimi last Friday. It is unclear if the two men are related the al-Nuaimi is a large tribe in the area. Also, it wasn’t immediately clear if the two incidents were connected.
The bombing and the abduction risk igniting rebel infighting in the south between more moderate Syrian opposition fighters and the hard-line Nusra Front.
The abducted commander, Ahmad al-Nuaimi, was widely disliked by many rebels who accused him of abandoning his men in battle in the past and fleeing to Jordan.
A radical organization calling itself the “Islamic Courts of the Eastern Areas Daraa” has confirmed it has Ahmad al-Nuaimi and another military commander, saying it would soon air their “confessions.”
Meanwhile, activists said that negotiations were underway to evacuate rebels from opposition-held parts of the embattled central city of Homs, which Syrian government forces have been besieging for over a year.
The activists said on Tuesday that Iranian and Russian representatives have been attending the meetings in Homs. They said they were there because they were negotiating a prisoner exchange as part of the Homs deal that would free at least three Iranians and a Russian who were seized by rebels in the northern province of Aleppo.
Russian and Iranian government officials were not immediately available for comment. The two countries are staunch allies of Syrian President Bashar Assad’s government.
Activists provided AP with a video showing an Iranian woman they claimed was being held captive by the rebels. The video was uploaded on March 8 this year, but it wasn’t clear when the Iranians and the Russian were seized.

11 EU nations set to tax financial transactions
","A group of 11 European Union countries agreed to introduce a financial transaction tax from 2016 onward, Austrian Finance Minister Michael Spindelegger said on Tuesday.
The nations including economic heavyweights Germany, France, Italy and Spain will initially tax only the trading of shares and some derivatives, Mr. Spindelegger told a meeting of the EU’s 28 finance ministers in Brussels.
European officials started pushing for the tax following the 2008-09 financial crisis, to curb speculation and claw back revenues after government bailouts of banks, but failed to muster the required unanimity for an EU-wide solution.
Britain, which is home to the bloc’s biggest financial hub, the City of London, is strongly opposed to the plan, saying it’s a populist measure that will harm the economy and undermine banks’ global competitiveness.
“It’s not a tax on bankers, it’s a tax on job, on investment, on people’s pensions. That’s why the United Kingdom does not want to be a part of it,” U.K. treasury Chief George Osborne said.
Mr. Spindelegger, who played a leading role in the tax negotiations, said the group of 11 will now work to overcome remaining practical hurdles to finalize the legislation by the end of this year.
The levy’s scope won’t be as broad as supporters initially hoped, but the countries hope to reach agreement on a wider scope later on.
The EU estimates a broad levy encompassing trading in most assets could yield 30 billion Euros ($42 billion) in annual tax revenues.
German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble acknowledged it was “a very difficult matter to get a common position” on the tax, but said the current limited proposal is a good starting point to get the financial sector to contribute.
“To tell people that we are not able to find a way, is not a way to deliver,” Mr. Schaeuble insisted.
Britain’s Mr. Osborne, meanwhile, denounced the lack of detail of the current tax proposal and threatened Britain would challenge any financial transaction tax if it were to affect also EU economies not participating.
“If they seek to damage jobs and investment across the rest of Europe, then we are entitled to challenge that,” he insisted.
Spain’s Finance Minister Luis de Guindos sought to reassure the countries not participating, saying the group of 11 is “fully aware of the potential consequences” on lending conditions and the wider economy and will carefully draft its legislation.
The EU’s top court last week dismissed a British challenge to the introduction of the tax as premature since the tax has yet to be established. Britain argued it is illegal under EU law since it would affect even countries who don’t sign up to it.

The comments were a seemingly unequivocal rejection of any political reconciliation with the Brotherhood, which was Egypt’s most powerful political force until Field Marshal el-Sissi removed President Mohamed Morsy, a member of the group, last summer.
Since ousting Mr. Morsy, Field Marshal el-Sissi has been riding an overwhelming media frenzy lauding him as Egypt’s saviour, and his status as the country’s strongest figure all but guarantees him a victory in the May 26-27 election. El-Sissi’s only opponent in the race is leftist politician Hamdeen Sabahi, the third-place finisher in the 2012 election won by Mr. Morsy.
Field Marshal el-Sissi’s comments were a stark signal of his intention to ensure the elimination of the 86-year-old Brotherhood as both a political and ideological force in the country. He is building on an unprecedented popular resentment of the group, after its rise to power in the last three years.
Asked whether the Brotherhood will no longer exist under his presidency, el-Sissi replied, “Yes. Just like that.”
“It’s not me that finished it, the Egyptians have. The problem is not with me,” he said.
The Brotherhood and its Islamist allies won every election following the 2011 ouster of autocrat Hosni Mubarak, dominating the parliament and capturing the presidency under Morsy. The Brotherhood’s electoral strength was largely rooted in a widespread grassroots organization it had built up for decades despite being banned under Mubarak.
But after a year in office, millions joined protests demanding Mr. Morsy’s removal, accusing his Brotherhood of monopolizing power and seeking to change the country’s identity along the lines of Brotherhood ideology prompting el-Sissi’s ouster of Mr. Morsy.
Since then, there’s been no sign of reconciliation between the sides. The Brotherhood and its allies have denounced Mr. Morsy’s removal as a military coup that has wrecked democracy, rejecting the new government and persisting in a campaign of street protests.
Security forces have waged a ferocious crackdown on Mr. Morsy supporters, clashing with protesters. Hundreds have been killed and more than 16,000 members of the Brotherhood and other Islamists have been arrested. The Brotherhood’s leader, Mohammed Badie, has been sentenced to death though the sentence can be appealed and he and Morsy and other senior Brotherhood figures face a string of trials. The government has branded the Brotherhood a terrorist organization. Under the weight of the crackdown, the pro-Morsy protests have waned.
At the same time, Islamic militant groups have stepped up bombings and shootings against police and the military in retaliation for Mr. Morsy’s removal.
In the joint interview with two private Egyptian TV stations CBC and ONTV, Field Marshal el-Sissi directly accused the Brotherhood of being behind the campaign of bombings and shootings. He said the movement “created” Islamic militant groups to use as “covers to fight from behind ... to keep the movement away from any accusations.” He said a senior Brotherhood leader had warned him that if he removed Morsy, extremist fighters from Afghanistan and elsewhere would come to Egypt to fight.
The Brotherhood denies any connection to militants.
“The thought structure of these groups says that we are not true Muslims, and they believed conflict was inevitable because they consider us non-believers,” he said. “It will not work for there to be such thinking again.”
The 59-year-old el-Sissi retired from the military in March with the rank of field marshal to launch his candidacy. The one-hour interview was his first direct address to the public since he declared his intention to run and after the start of the official campaigning on May 2.
A second part of the interview, likely to go into more details about his economic program, is to be aired on Tuesday.
El-Sissi’s candidacy has also raised concerns among some secular activists over a return of the autocracy that reigned in Egypt under Mubarak, who was also a veteran of the military. A number of prominent secular activists have been arrested in recent months, several of them under a draconian new law banning all protests without a police permit.
El-Sissi defended the protest law, saying it was needed to prevent further instability and insisting that police will give permits to those who seek to hold peaceful demonstrations.
“We are talking about a country going to waste. People must realize this and support us. Whoever imagines otherwise, only wants to sabotage Egypt and this won’t be allowed,” he said, losing his temper for the first time during the interview.
“This chaos will bring it down, because of this irresponsible protesting,” he said.
El-Sissi spent a part of the interview discussing his family, explaining that he met his wife as a teenager and promised her marriage when he was admitted to military college. He spoke fondly of her as a major supporter of his decision to run for president. She told him he had no choice, he said, telling him, “We of course love you, but this nation will be lost.”
U.S. trained el-Sissi said the military will not play a role in politics under his presidency and promised to consult with political factions. Asked if he will accept criticism, he responded with a smile, “I will put up with it” but then said he won’t accept “offenses.”
In one Cairo neighborhood, Sayeda Zeinab, el-Sissi supporters organized showings of the interview at local coffeehouses, where dozens gathered to watch. During advertising breaks, they sang and clapped to pro-military anthems.
“After God, I worship him,” 65-year-old Alia el-Sayed Saad said, raising two pictures of el-Sissi. “We are not ignorant, we can differentiate between the wicked and the honest.”
Turnout at the cafes was not high, however and nearby coffe shops with TVs showing a soccer game were packed with larger crowds.
Meanwhile, an Egyptian court has banned officials from the country’s former ruling party under ousted President Hosni Mubarak from running in elections.
The ban comes as Egypt prepares for presidential elections later this month. Former military chief Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi who removed Islamist president and Mubarak’s successor, Mohamed Morsy is poised to win that vote.
The Cairo Court for Urgent Matters on Tuesday ruled that leaders of Mubarak’s National Democratic Party cannot run in any presidential, parliamentary or local city council elections.
The ruling is binding until a higher tribunal issues a final verdict in the matter.
It closes the door, at least for the time being, to Mubarak party officials returning to the political scene.
The NDP was dissolved just months after Mr. Mubarak’s ouster in the 2011 popular uprising.

UN chief in S.Sudan to urge for peace
","U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon is visiting South Sudan to urge both sides involved in the country’s conflict to abide by a peace deal they signed in January, a U.N. spokeswoman said on Tuesday.
Mr. Moon’s visit comes four days after U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry met with South Sudanese President Salva Kiir leading to Mr. Kiir’s announcement that he is ready for talks with the rebel leader, former Vice President Riek Machar.
But government troops over the weekend attacked the rebel—held city of Bentiu, the capital of Unity state and the rebel stronghold of Nasir, in Upper Nile state.
Mr. Moon will call on the participants in South Sudan’s war to implement the >cease-fire agreement they signed on Jan. 23. Neither side has honoured the peace deal.
South Sudan has been rocked by violence since December, when Mr. Kiir accused Mr. Machar of attempting a coup. Thousands of people are believed to have been killed and 1 million people have fled their homes. The violence has taken on an ethnic dimension between Mr. Kiir’s Dinka ethnic group and Mr. Machar’s Nuer tribe leading to fears of genocide.
The U.N. refugee agency said on Tuesday that it is seeing a sharp increase in the number of refugees fleeing South Sudan’s violence to western Ethiopia.
Over the past 72 hours some 11,000 people have crossed into the Ethiopian town of Burubley along Baro River, which divides the two countries, after South Sudan government forces captured a key rebel stronghold of Nasir, said U.N. refugee agency spokesman Adrian Edwards.
Many more refugees are massed on the South Sudanese side of the border, waiting to cross the river on one of the few small ferry boats, Mr. Edwards told reporters on Tuesday in Geneva.

G7 ministers seek alternatives to Russian gas supplies
","Alleviating Europe’s dependence on gas supplies from Russia - a problem exacerbated by the crisis in Ukraine - was the key focus as energy ministers from the Group of Seven (G7) concluded a two-day meeting in Rome.
Seeking alternative gas supplies has been on Europe’s agenda since at least 2006, when Russia and Ukraine first rowed over gas supplies.
The current fear is that escalating tensions with Kiev and Western powers may lead Moscow to again cut off gas deliveries passing through Ukraine on their way to Europe.
“The central issue is how to prevent energy from being used as a weapon in an increasingly interdependent world,” German Economics Minister Sigmar Gabriel, who is representing Berlin in the talks, said.
The United States, Canada, Japan, Britain, France, Germany and Italy resumed G7-format meetings in March, after Russia was expelled from the Group of Eight (G8) forum due to its support for separatists in Ukraine.
In Rome, there was no suggestion that Western allies would agree to further punish Moscow by >applying sanctions to its energy sector.
Russia has warned that it would retaliate. Several European nations are overwhelmingly dependent on Russian gas.
Italy and Germany, which have extensive energy and business ties to Russia, have been among the most cautious on sanctions, while the United States and Britain, which have their own gas resources, are seen as hardliners.
Whereas the US has placed Igor Sechin - chief executive of Russia’s state oil company Rosneft - on a sanctions black list, Rosneft has been welcomed in Italy as a minority shareholder of tyre maker Pirelli, one of the country’s leading industries.
The Rome talks were instead expected to produce a statement which would be submitted for further discussion at a G7 summit in Brussels on June 4-5.
The document was likely to list a series of options to reduce Europe’s reliance on Russian gas supplies, including: improving energy efficiency; exploring the possibility of bringing over to Europe shale gas from North America; and developing pipelines from the Caspian Sea.

Pistorius’s neighbour testifies at murder trial
","A man who lives next to the house where Oscar Pistorius fatally shot his girlfriend testified on Tuesday at the athlete’s murder trial about the night of the killing, saying he heard a man crying loudly and that he called the security of the housing estate for help.
Michael Nhlengethwa was a witness summoned by the Olympian’s defense team, which contends that Pistorius killed Reeva Steenkamp by mistake after believing there was an intruder in his home on Feb. 14, 2013. The prosecution says Pistorius intentionally killed Steenkamp after the couple had an argument.
The differently-abled Olympian runner shot four times through a toilet cubicle door with his 9 mm pistol, hitting Steenkamp in the hip, arm and head.
Security checks at the courthouse where Pistorius is on trial were disrupted on early Tuesday because of what police said was a protest over work conditions by security staff, who left their posts and gathered outside the building. Some people entered the courthouse without having their bags checked, and Pistorius was heard asking whether a security check had been conducted as he entered the courtroom.
Nhlengethwa, who was Pistorius’ next-door neighbour, testified that his wife woke him up after hearing a bang and that he did not hear gunshots. He said he then heard a man crying in a high-pitched voice that indicated he urgently needed help. Mr. Nhlengethwa could not make out most of what the man was saying, though he heard the words- “No, please, please, no.”
The neighbour’s bedroom window was around 25 meters (80 feet) from the balcony doors of Pistorius’ bedroom, closer than neighbours called by prosecutors and who said they heard a woman screaming on the night of the shooting.
The defense was trying to present Mr. Nhlengethwa as a more reliable witness on the events of the night because of how much closer he lived to Pistorius’ villa. A neighbour who testified to hearing a woman’s “blood-curdling” screams on the night lived around 170 meters (560 feet) from Pistorius’ house.
Mr. Nhlengethwa testified that he called estate security to ask them to come to their road.
During the testimony, Pistorius sat on a wooden bench in the courtroom, looking impassively at the witness.
Mr. Nhlengethwa, who said he runs a civil engineering company, earlier described how Pistorius was the first neighbour to welcome him to the gated community when he moved there in late 2009.
“He was basically that friendly neighbour,” Mr. Nhlengethwa said. He said he also met Steenkamp once on the weekend before she was killed by Pistorius, and was struck by the warmth of her personality.
“I don’t think I will ever forget that moment,” he said. “She just opened her arms. She just came and hugged me.”

Chinese national kidnapped in Malaysia
","A Chinese national working at a fish farm in eastern Malaysia was kidnapped by gunmen early Tuesday and believed taken to the southern Philippines, where suspected insurgents are holding another Chinese and a Filipino also seized from Malaysia.
Mohamad Bakri Zinin, Malaysia’s national deputy police chief, said five men clad in military fatigues entered the fish farm before dawn and kidnapped its manager, Yang Zailin, 34.
“However, they managed to escape and were headed to a neighbouring country,” Mr. Bakri said in a statement.
A Philippine security official, who declined to be named as he wasn’t authorized to speak to the media, said Filipino authorities had been notified of the kidnapping. The official said the victim was believed to have been taken to the Mindanao region in the southern Philippines.
China’s Xinhua News Agency said that Beijing had urged Malaysia to speed up efforts to rescue the man.
The spate of kidnappings underline persistent security threats in Malaysia’s Sabah state on Borneo island, a popular tourist destination and dive spot that is a short boat ride from the southern Philippines, where Muslim militants and kidnap gangs have long found safe haven.
Last month, militants from the Abu Sayyaf group seized a 28-year-old Shanghai woman a 40-year-old Filipino hotel receptionist from the Singamata Reef Resort in Sabah and took them by motor boat to their jungle stronghold in the predominantly Muslim province of Sulu, according to Philippine security officials who spoke to AP on April 5.
Last November, suspected Filipino militants shot and killed a Taiwanese tourist and kidnapped his wife from a resort in Sabah. The woman was released a month later in the southern Philippines. Authorities didn’t say whether a ransom was paid, as is usually the case.
Filipino militants are still holding more than a dozen captives, including two European bird watchers who were seized from Tawi-Tawi, the southernmost Philippines province closest to Sabah, in 2012.
The Abu Sayyaf had links to international militant networks, including al-Qaeda, but a U.S.-backed Philippine military crackdown has weakened it considerably in recent years. The group, which is on the U.S. list of terror groups, has about 300 fighters and is now much more focused on ransom kidnappings than global jihad.

Iran-Pakistan to increase cross border cooperation
","A few days before Prime Minister Muhammed Nawaz Sharif’s visit to Iran this weekend, its interior minister arrived in Islamabad to meet his Pakistani counterpart and pave the way for a smooth trip.
There has been some tension over the kidnapping of five Iranian border guards, four of whom were released. Iranian Interior Minister Abdolereza Rehmani Fazli had a protracted meeting with Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan on Tuesday and a number of issues were discussed in a bid to resolve border issues.
Addressing a joint press conference after that, Mr. Chaudhry Nisar said the meeting would help raise relations between the two countries a notch higher and all areas of concern would be addressed including cross border terrorism, smuggling, human and drug trafficking and there would be greater intelligence sharing and coordination between the security forces and armed forces of the two countries.
The two countries have agreed to a special task force or a commission which would be finalised before Mr. Sharif visits Iran. The entire framework would be in place by then. Chaudhry Nisar said that Pakistan had no problems with Iran and the relations of the two countries should be reflective of the demands of the people who want good relations.
Mr. Fazli in turn said he had a good meeting with Mr. Sharif and the interior minister and important issues to promote security and economic cooperation were discussed. He said it was agreed to share intelligence, and have joint committees and visits to the border to carry out surveillance operations against terrorists, money launderers and drug traffickers.
He also suggested a trilateral meeting with the Afghan interior minister to increase the level of cooperation in Balochistan. It was also agreed to set up a hotline between the Frontier Corps on Pakistan’s side and the Border Security Force on the Iran side. A proposal is in the offing to have a hotline for the directors general of military operations of the two countries. However, Mr. Chaudhry Nisar clarified the issue of joint operations as mentioned by Mr. Fazli and said while there would be greater collaboration between the security forces, Pakistan would carry out operations in its own country while Iran would do the same on its side.
Mr. Chaudhry Nisar also said that there is no question of Iran violating Pakistan territory and the kidnapped border guards were not present in Pakistan. When asked about one more guard who was reported to have been killed, he said he would stick to his stand that the guards were not present in Pakistan and the question of the fifth guard doesn’t arise. Mr. Fazli too said Iran has never intended to interfere or violate Pakistan’s territory. The recent issue of the Border guards was resolved with the cooperation of Pakistan after the Iranian President called Mr. Sharif.

Bhagat Singh case worth reinvestigating: Dawn
","The 1928 case against Indian freedom fighter >Bhagat Singh is worth reinvestigating as it will enrich historical accounts with factual detail, a leading Pakistani daily said on Tuesday.
“The trials and mistrials of the freedom fighters are the latter’s medals, a proof of their gallantry and of the oppressive colonial treatment they were subjected to. From that angle, it is difficult to see what additional honours a retrial could confer on these heroes,” Dawn said in an editorial.
“But a reinvestigation would expose the facts and satisfy the urge to recreate a picture as close to reality as possible. It will help to better understand the system as it worked then, and maybe offer comparisons with the practices of today. To that end - the enriching of historical accounts with factual detail - it is worthwhile to revisit the case of Bhagat Singh and other persecuted freedom fighters,” it stated.
A lawyer in Lahore has sought a reopening of the case pertaining to the murder of British police officer John Saunders in 1928, which led to the execution of Bhagat Singh and his comrades Sukhdev and Rajguru, saying that he might be innocent of the charges.
Last week, the police had provided the lawyer with a copy of the FIR registered against the three freedom fighters on Dec 17, 1928, for killing then assistant superintendent of police John P Saunders in Lahore.
“The FIR does not identify those who had attacked the British police officer. This could just mean that the complainants did not know who the assailants were at the time the FIR was lodged, and that the names of the suspects might have been added later,” the editorial stated.
Bhagat Singh, 23, along with Sukhdev and Rajguru were sentenced to death for killing Saunders and the three of them were hanged in Lahore jail on March 23, 1931.
“The Lahore High Court has deemed the availability of the 1928 FIR necessary for considering the reopening of the Bhagat Singh case and has referred the case to the chief justice and a higher bench,” the editorial observed.

Modi may ‘bring India, China closer’, says Chinese scholar
","Narendra Modi’s track record in Gujarat as a “practical businessman” suggested that he would look to improve India’s relations with China if elected, a commentary published on Tuesday in a prominent Chinese newspaper has argued.
“Modi was once a practical businessman. After he got into politics, he established good relations with China. A large number of Chinese enterprises invested in Gujarat, contributing to the economic development of the State. Therefore, ties between China and India may become closer under Modi’s leadership,” said the commentary in the Communist Party–run tabloid Global Times, known for its nationalistic outlook.
The article, authored by Liu Zongyi, a scholar at the Shanghai Institute for International Studies, blamed “Western media and observers” for trying to “foment discord between China and India by hyping up nationalist Modi’s aggressive statements on the border issue between the two countries.”
“In fact,” it countered, “it has been a policy for India to offset the negative effects of China's rise by enhancing strategic cooperation with countries around China. It is unlikely that Modi will change this policy. However, it doesn’t mean he will strengthen the trend.” Chinese scholars have closely followed the on-going elections. Most strategic experts here are of the view that as far as India-China relations were concerned, the outcome might not have a significant impact considering the past record of both UPA and NDA governments in crafting a similar China policy.
Mr. Liu, however, argued that there was “disquiet” in the West about a possible Modi government in New Delhi.
“In its manifesto the BJP promises a multilateral diplomacy and the establishment of “a web of allies” to further India's best national interests, which steers away from a tilt toward the U.S. held by India in diplomacy in the past decades. This has caused worries from the West,” the article said.
“The West has adapted to an India with a weak central government in the past decades,” Mr. Liu said. “It is afraid that a strongman like Russian President Vladimir Putin will make India really strong and build the country into a challenger to the West economically and politically.”

Six injured in third China station knife attack
","A wave of organised knife attacks by groups of armed assailants targeting railway stations has unnerved Chinese authorities, with six people on Tuesday left injured in the latest violence, in the southern metropolis of Guangzhou – the third such attack in two months.
At least one man armed with “long knives”, witnesses said, indiscriminately stabbed passengers at the square in front of Guangzhou railway station at 11.30 a.m. local time on Tuesday morning. Photographs taken by witnesses showed pools of blood at the scene and crowds of shocked bystanders.
There were conflicting reports on how many people were involved in the attack. Initially, State media reports quoted one witness, named Chen, as saying he saw three men armed with knives involved in the rampage.
The Guangzhou public security bureau, or police authority, said in a later statement only one man was involved in the attack. After stabbing at least six people, he was shot by police and later taken to a hospital for treatment. The police authority said his identity was still being established.
Four bystanders, including two women, who were injured were being treated at a nearby military hospital and did not have any life-threatening injuries, officials said.
As of Tuesday evening, officials released few details about the attack. The incident was strikingly similar to last week’s violence targeting a railway station in Urumqi, the provincial capital of the western Muslim-majority Xinjiang region, and the March 1 attack by armed assailants on the railway station in Kunming, in southwestern Yunnan province. At least three people were killed in Urumqi while 29 died in Kunming.
The two earlier attacks, the government said, had been carried out by terrorists linked with separatist groups in Xinjiang, home to the ethnic Turkic Uighurs, which has seen a spate of violent attacks in recent years.
Xinjiang officials said one of the Urumqi attackers, a 39-year-old Uighur named Sedirdin Sawut, had “long been involved in religious extremism”.
The Kunming attack, carried out by at least 8 Uighurs, armed with knives and seemingly trained, had been organised by a group of Uighurs who had earlier sought to travel overseas “for jihad”, officials said.
The Urumqi attack was seen by Chinese security experts as reflecting a stepped up capability – and intent – by groups as it took place on a day when China’s President Xi Jinping was touring Urumqi, despite the tight security in the city. Mr. Xi last week pledged “decisive actions” against terrorist groups to “resolutely suppress their rampant momentum”.

“I would like to deny all allegations I am accused of,” Ms. Yingluck said calmly, seated beside her legal team. “As the Prime Minister, I am entitled to carry out responsibilities I have toward the people ... and for the utmost benefit of the general public.”
The case was lodged by anti-government senators, who won an initial victory in February when another court ruled that the official, Thawil Pliensri, must be restored to his job.
If Ms. Yingluck is found guilty of interfering in state affairs for her personal benefit or that of her political party, she would have to step down as Prime Minister.

Airliner engine failure closes Melbourne airport

For a clear nuclear doctrine
","For India, nuclear deterrence is defensive and a means to secure its sovereignty and security. Its strategy of assured retaliation, combined with “no first use,” provides adequate guarantee for this purpose. The strategy was unveiled concurrently with its 1998 nuclear tests, which ended the determined U.S. bid to prevent India from acquiring nuclear deterrent. Ironically, India’s nuclear weapons tests, together with the rapid expansion of its economy, transformed its global outlook and relations with the U.S. and the world.
The Chinese nuclear weapons test of 1964, on the heels of the 1962 war, had always rankled in Indian minds. K. Subrahmanyam and K.R. Narayanan, at the time in the early years of their public service, advocated a matching Indian response. This did not then have resonance at the top, as India was facing the twin crises of food and finance.
The P-5 states treated non-proliferation as their default foreign and security policy objective, but this was invariably trumped by national interest. India’s restraint and decision not to weaponise its nuclear capacities after the 1974 test were well known. Yet, when Pakistan accelerated its nuclear proliferation, it was not stopped in the wake of the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan, when U.S. President Jimmy Carter designated Pakistan a “frontline” state.
The Chinese transferred nuclear materials and technology to Pakistan, including the weapons design and the means to deliver them — the solid fuel 300-kilometre range M-11 ballistic missiles. In a paper published in 1972, Professor Wayne Wilcox of Colombia University, then working as cultural attaché in the U.S. Embassy in London, perceptively recognised that India’s policy concerning China and Pakistan “is to hedge all bets and cover all contingencies.” India was compelled to acquire nuclear weapons to deter nuclear blackmail in its contiguity.
Unlike Pakistan or Israel, India could not have a “recessed” deterrent or bomb in the basement, given India’s governance practices. Contingent factors delayed India’s nuclear weapons tests, such as the persistent external pressure on India, and arguments by internal agnostics who claimed that such testing would betray India’s long-held principles, diminish its international standing, and reduce future GDP growth rates by up to two per cent annually. In 1995 came the perpetual extension of the Non-Proliferation Treaty, without linking it to the complete elimination of nuclear weapons. The conditions attached to the 1996 Comprehensive Test-Ban Treaty, which could foreclose India’s nuclear weapons option, became the final point of conviction. From then on, the question was not whether to test but when.
For India today, the choice is clear, as it was in 1998: so long as nuclear weapons exist, India’s nuclear deterrence will have to be maintained. Until there is a global compact for creating a nuclear weapon-free world, India will have to persevere with this policy.

What is credible deterrence?

In delivering the message of credible deterrence, all nuclear weapons states, including those that have embraced no first use, face a conundrum. Nuclear weapons are weapons of the last resort, fundamentally different from conventional weapons. War is a traditional tool of statecraft, but the weapon to end all wars cannot be a standard instrument of an ordinary war — it can only be the final recourse for dissuasion. It cannot be chance, for then it will fail to deter. While embracing a declaratory policy to avoid nuclear war, the state concerned must simultaneously demonstrate that it has nuclear war fighting capacity — the resilience to take the pain of a first strike, and both the ability and resolve to inflict massive and intolerable destruction on the attacker.
For improving its punitive capacity, China is seeking a sea-based nuclear deterrent, deploying mobile solid-fuel missiles, and moving missiles below the surface in elaborate tunnels in mountainous terrain, undetectable from space, called the “Underground Great Wall.” The same motivation has led India to similar pursuits. India’s missile force, the weak link in its deterrence, is under rapid repair. Its transformation is enabling the shift toward strategic deterrence. In the past half-dozen years, India has invested in improving the command, control, communications, and intelligence systems and its second strike capacity, including the survival of the decision-making structure. The National Command Authority deserves credit for this. Simultaneously, the sea-based leg of the triad of delivery systems is taking shape — even if at a slower pace than the situation warrants. India might also have to do more to communicate effectively that its deterrent carries credibility.
In popular domestic imagination, India’s assurance of “credible minimum deterrence” is confused with minimum credible deterrence, as if it connotes an arbitrary limitation. The essential prerequisite for nuclear deterrence is as much the sufficiency of the retaliatory capacity as the surety of response. This hinges on the size and nature of the arsenal and delivery systems, their survivability in the event of a pre-emptive attack, and the realisation by a potential adversary that the costs of attack outweigh the gains.
All nuclear weapons states that have robust missile programmes retain their first strike capabilities, since conventional missiles of short and intermediate ranges can be mated equally with nuclear or non-nuclear warheads, and can be used to attack nuclear facilities. At times doubts arise about the “responsible” behaviour of certain states, such as when Chinese President Xi Jinping did not mention China’s no first use doctrine in a defence policy speech delivered in December 2012 to the Second Artillery Corps, or when the Chinese Defence White Paper, released in April 2013, did not contain the standard reiteration of this doctrine, thereby creating doubts about a shift in its nuclear policy.
While India remains watchful, most P-5 states appear to be settling into a more stable deterrence, discounting first strike weapons, despite holding a range of nuclear weaponry and delivery mechanisms. Under the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, the U.S. and USSR had agreed to eliminate their intermediate and shorter range missiles between 500 and 5,500 kilometres. Pakistan alone is going in the other direction.

Myth of flexible response

The U.S. and Russia did contemplate flexible response and limited use of nuclear weapons in specific theatres in the hope of containing damage to their homelands. A graduating use of nuclear weapons is not possible, except in theory books and planning exercises. Envisaging escalatory nuclear weapons exchanges is even more difficult in India’s security context: here, the space and time span between launch and delivery is non-existent. “Controlled” nuclear war between the U.S. and Russia is hard to imagine. Between India and China, or between India and Pakistan, it is impossible.
Admittedly, nuclear weapons can be used for coercion, but up to a point, and with some success only against a non-nuclear state. The experience of Kargil 15 years ago demonstrated how the leaders of the Pakistan Army took the wrong lesson from deterrence. They believed that with the advantage of stealth and shock, they could upset the conventional status-quo, without inviting an effective riposte for fear of a nuclear exchange. This was a serious miscalculation, as they discovered to their cost. Changing India’s defensive nuclear doctrine to complicate their calculus will be irresponsible. India can survive a first strike but Pakistan cannot. What incentive would Pakistan have to consider a second strike if it believed India could attack it first? As for the growing non-nuclear threats to security, India can meet them by augmented conventional preparedness, hardened defences, upgraded equipment and a strong indigenous armament industry.

Toward a more secure India

The foremost threat to Indian security today comes not from its nuclear posture or externally, but from social deprivation and anaemic economic growth. Unshackling its entrepreneurship, accelerating infrastructure development and regenerating growth will make India safer. There is a clear vision in India on what has to be done. The new government should focus on how best and quickly to do it.
As Shyam Saran, Chairman of the National Security Advisory Board, has said, it would be best to put to rest any further speculation of a change in India’s nuclear weapons policy. For a credible deterrent, constancy of doctrine in its core essentials has definite merit. The Bharatiya Janata Party has embraced the national inheritance on no first use. India’s nuclear deterrent can be made more robust, meanwhile, by continuing the work to guarantee the efficacy of its retaliatory strike.

Coastal route under scanner
","Following an alert that certain terrorist elements might find a discreet entry into Tamil Nadu through sea route, the Coastal Security Group has tightened the vigil on the high seas as well as on the shores.
However, the CSG here has a tough task cut out for them as they would have to guard the 110km-long coastal area, stretching from Marakkanam Bridge on the East Coast Road (where the salt pans abound) to Sirkazhi.
The entire distance they would have to cover with a single 5-tonne motorised boat.
Though the CSG here has been provided with three vessels for surveillance — one of the 5-tonne capacity and one of the 4-tonne capacity — two are under repair.
Therefore, the CSG personnel would have to make the routine trip in only one direction at a time — either to the north or to the south. The CSG would have to thus guard the sea 12 nautical miles off the shore, approximately about 21km from the coast.
The CSG personnel are keeping a vigil on not only the entire seafaring fishing community but also on those residing on the sea shore. Besides this, they also monitor the movement of the Sri Lankan refugees from all the camps in both Cuddalore and Villupuram districts.
Inspector (CSG) R. Sekar told The Hindu that he had met the Sri Lankan refugees in all the camps and told them to stay away from those who might come out with an offer to take them on a voyage to foreign countries.
Such offers would mostly come from the surreptitious operators of unauthorised crafts with an ulterior motive.
Mr. Sekar further said that all the fishing boats were being verified for their registration certificates, registration numbers, size, capacity, year of manufacturing and so on.
It was compulsory that all those going for fishing in all sorts of boats should carry with them the identity cards and should produce the same on demand from the CSG or Coast Guard or the Navy personnel.
He also stated that besides bringing all the fishing villages and hamlets under constant surveillance, the possible escape land routes too had been sealed. For instance, the check-posts at Marakkanam, Koonimedu, Bommiayarpalayam (in Villupuram district) and Reddichavadi, Alappakkam, Pudhuchathiram, Vallampadugai, Keerapalayam, Killai and Parangipettai too has been kept in full alert.
The fishing community has been instructed to watch out for the movement of any suspicious persons or vessels, and if they come across any, they are asked to duly report the matter to the CSG for further action, Mr. Sekar added.

What if English loses dominance?
","Being an English-speaking country is a blessing — and a curse. It is a blessing to be native speakers of the language of Shakespeare — and the language of world science and popular culture. The success of UK science is built not just on its excellence but also its English, which since the decline of the Soviet Union has been the only serious global scientific language. The success of UK universities in recruiting international students also owes a great deal to the language.
But it is also a curse. As the incentives to learn other languages decline year by year, the English-speaking countries are increasingly locked into an Anglophone prison. It may be an advantage to travel almost everywhere and be “understood”. But maybe the ability to understand other cultures is declining. The Chinese speak English; not many British speak Mandarin. Maybe there is a wider lesson here: monolingualism inhibits multicultural sensitivity.
This inhibition is expressed in a number of ways. Within the university, the humanities, where such sensitivity is crucial, are hardest hit. STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) subjects may be able to flourish as a monoglot domain (because their language is as much mathematics as English). But that can never be the case with literature, philosophy, history — and even some of the less theoretical social sciences — without a narrowing of perspectives.
In wider society, it is at least possible that the lack of challenge to neo-liberal ideas can be attributed partly to monolingualism. Alternative ideas can only become influential when they are translated into English. Secondly, we are not really talking about English but “Globlish”, a communication tool stripped of most of its cultural resonances. Non-native English speakers can easily become fluent in Globlish. Maybe they can even speak it better because most are not inhibited by faint memories of the King James Bible or Hamlet. For them Globlish is largely a functional language.
The way forward is not just to promote other languages; we also need to learn to celebrate wider cultural differences. — © Guardian Newspapers Limited, 2014

Moscow’s Dhaka ambassador sees ‘polycentric’ order emerging
","Apparently defending China, India and Russia’s support to the present government, Russian Ambassador in Bangladesh Alexander Nikolaev has said they have “enough political wisdom” not to impose anything on any country.
Replying to volleys of questions at a special briefing with the members of the Diplomatic Correspondents Association, Bangladesh on Tuesday, Mr. Nikolaev said Russia does not impose any model on any country.

South Asian bloc

He said Russia wants to see the countries of South Asia, including Bangladesh, emerge as a powerful bloc in what he saw as a new “polycentric” world order.
The order is taking shape, he remarked, and added “It has become clear today that the unilateral world order is in the past.”
Mr. Nikolaev, who served in Kiev earlier, also accused the U.S. of distorting the Ukraine scenario and belittling Russia.
He observed Ukraine was in a deep crisis and assured that Russia would firmly contribute to the de-escalation of the conflict on the basis of the Geneva agreement. However, he added, the U.S. had “the stunning ability to turn everything upside down, to call black white”. The remarks by the Russian ambassador also came marking the 42nd anniversary of Russia’s diplomatic ties with Bangladesh.

Pakistan ready to follow nuclear states in signing NPT
","Pakistan is ready to sign the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), along with five other “have” states. However, not signing it wouldn’t make a difference to the country’s nuclear programme, according to Dr. Ansar Parvez, chairperson, Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC).
Speaking at an international seminar on nuclear non-proliferation organised by the Centre for Pakistan and Gulf Studies (CPGS) and the Konrad Adenauer Stiftung on Tuesday, Dr. Parvez asked, though India’s agreement with the U.S. came with driving force which was commercial, how many plants have been set up in India? He added that you must have a deep relationship with the people with whom you collaborate and they must stick to you in times of need.
Responding to questions, he said that a possible Pakistan-U.S. nuclear deal was more of a foreign office concern but he did not see that coming.
Earlier, there was a heated discussion after Dr. Peter R. Lavoy, former U.S. assistant secretary for defence for Asian and Pacific Security Affairs and Mark Fitzpatrick, author of a new book on Pakistan’s nuclear programme, spoke about the perceptions regarding nuclear safety inPakistan. Speakers also felt Pakistan was facing nuclear apartheid and India would change its stand on no first use of nuclear weapons if a Bharatiya Janata Party government came to power. There was also a feeling that India had refused to engage meaningfully with Pakistan on the nuclear issue among other issues.
Mr. Lavoy said it was the right time for a nuclear deal between the U.S. and Pakistan but it would not be easy since the single most troubling concern in the U.S. was Pakistan’s nuclear weapons. There were also fears that Pakistan may once again resort to using militant or non-state actors for its foreign policy objectives in India and Afghanistan, apart from fears of proliferation of nuclear material.

“Pakistan desires peace and tranquillity in the Middle East and it would maintain its policy of non- interference in the internal affairs of States,” Mr. Sharif said at a meeting of Pakistan envoys to West Asian countries. He said the central emphasis had been on building a “peaceful neighbourhood,” and he had pursued a policy of constructive engagement with all neighbours.
“We are also paying attention to the promotion of our special relationships with countries in the Gulf and Middle East. Recent exchanges at the highest level reflect these endeavours,” he said, according to an official statement.
“We have an equal aspiration to forge closer bilateral ties with all countries in the region. Our efforts to develop bilateral ties with one country are not and will not be at the expense of another. Pakistan remains ready to take two steps to greet a hand extended in friendship,” he pointed out. The main dynamic in South Asia should be cooperation, not confrontation, he said.
He outlined a policy of non-interference in Afghanistan, and support for the peace and reconciliation process in that country. The bilateral relationship, he said, should be marked by enhanced trade and economic cooperation. Since June 2013, Pakistan had reinforced its strategic partnership with China, re-oriented the relationship with the U.S., upgraded ties with the European Union, reached out afresh to Russia, and strengthened linkages with the ASEAN, Africa and Latin America, he said.

Four-point peace plan for Ukraine
","Peace gets a chance in strife-torn Ukraine as >Russia and Europe agreed on a roadmap for ending the standoff between Kiev and rebellious Russian-speaking regions.
Following his meeting with Swiss President Didier Burkhalter in Moscow on Wednesday, Russian President Vladimir Putin called on pro-Russian protesters in Ukraine to postpone a referendum for “state sovereignty” they plan to hold on May 11 in Donetsk and Luhansk regions.
The rescheduling of the referendum is needed “to create the necessary conditions for dialogue,” Mr. Putin said in a statement for the press after his talks with the Swiss President.

‘Halt crackdown’

Another condition is a halt to the military crackdown on anti-government protesters in eastern Ukraine.
“Russia emphatically demands that Kiev’s authorities immediately call off all military and punitive operations in Ukraine’s southeast,” Mr. Putin said.
“The main thing today is to set up direct, full-fledged dialogue between Kiev’s current authorities and representative of Ukraine’s southeast, that would convince [the latter] that their legitimate interests within Ukraine would be guaranteed,” the Russian leader said.
Mr. Burkhalter, who is current head of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), announced a four-point peace “roadmap” for Ukraine, which called for ceasefire, de-escalation of tension, the launching of dialogue and elections in Ukraine.
Mr. Putin made it clear the plan had Russia’s backing.
“Our approaches to ways for resolving this crisis largely concur,” he said about his talks with the Swiss President. The peace plan appears to have also been coordinated with Germany. Kiev’s reaction to the OSCE roadmap was not immediately known, but Ukrainian authorities on Wednesday released “people’s governor of Donetsk” Pavel Gubarev, arrested in March.
Mr. Gubarev and two more activists were exchanged for three Ukrainian security service officers captured by protesters in Sloviansk last month.

Russia pulls back troops from Ukraine border
","Russian President on Wednesday said Russia has pulled back its troops from the Ukrainian border.
Mr. Putin said on Wednesday that the troops have been pulled back to training grounds and locations for “regular exercises,” but didn’t specify whether those locations were in areas near Ukraine.
Earlier, Mr. Putin called for a delay in the referendum on independence for eastern Ukrainian independence, even as government and separatist forces clashed anew.
Mr. Putin made his plea after a meeting with Didier Burkhalter, the Swiss President and current chairman of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation (OSCE). He said the referendum could not go forward until the proper conditions have been established.
Pro-Russian forces in Ukraine have been pressing for the Sunday referendum in the provinces of Luhansk and Donetsk, arguing that they want to be independent from Ukraine and merged with a greater Russia.
To that end, many of their forces have occupied government buildings across the region.
The Ukrainian military has sought to quell the rebellion, sometimes with force and often with little success. The government has admitted it is losing control in the area.
Mr. Putin also called for the end of the anti-terror operations by the government and called for extremist pro-government forces in the region to be disarmed.
He also demanded the release of all political prisoners in the region, while praising the release of the pro-Russian governor of Donetsk, Pavel Gubarev, from Ukrainian custody. Mr. Gubarev was reportedly freed, in exchange for the release of three Ukrainian secret service agents by the separatist groups.
Mr. Burkhalter, who is also Swiss Foreign Minister, was in Moscow to advocate better implementation of the Geneva de-escalation agreement, reached last month between Ukraine, Russia, the United States and the European Union.
Russia has blamed the West and Ukraine for not implementing the agreement, which stipulates the disarmament of all illegal groups and the vacating of occupied buildings throughout Ukraine.
Mr. Burkhalter on Wednesday advocated an action plan, under which the four parties would back the May 25 presidential elections in Ukraine and a parallel referendum on decentralisation. However, the Ukrainian parliament, in a vote Tuesday, rejected a plan for the referendum vote.
In Berlin, Petr Poroshenko, a former Foreign Minister regarded as a lead contender for the Ukrainian presidency, urged the West to impose new sanctions on Russia should the separatists go ahead with the referendum.
“Should Russia support this referendum, we absolutely need a concerted response in the form of a third wave of sanctions,” Mr. Poroshenko said in Berlin.
However, he said that, if he were to become president, he would be open to discussion on any referendum.
He said there was no space at international negotiations about Ukraine’s fate for the separatists, saying Ukraine was not prepared for talks with “terrorists.” “They are, quite simply, terrorists. Some of them are mentally ill,” he said, adding: “We have stuck to all agreements. The separatists, who are supported by Russia, have so far not fulfilled a single one.” Russia has said participation by separatist groups was necessary for any Ukraine conference.
Meanwhile, fighting broke out anew in eastern Ukraine as pro-Russian insurgents from Sloviansk attacked government forces surrounding the rebel-held city.
A rebel representative in Sloviansk told the Russian Interfax news agency that the fighting was concentrated around a television tower in the southern suburb of Andreyevka. “We are taking the checkpoints back under our control,” he said.
There was no immediate information on casualties, nor did the Ukrainian government comment on the reports.
Interior Minister Arsen Avakov, who has been coordinating the operation in the region, said on Monday that the television tower had been retaken and was broadcasting Ukrainian channels.
Separatists, many of them heavily armed, have seized more strategic sites in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions in the past weeks, prompting the Ukrainian government to admit that it has lost control there.
Mr. Avakov claimed that government forces had retaken control of the city of Mariupol. “Mariupol has been completely freed” he said in a statement on his Ministry’s website.
Unconfirmed reports said that at least one pro-Russian activist was killed during the nightly raid on the city administration building.

South Korea lowers survivor count in ferry disaster
","Three weeks after South Korea’s ferry tragedy, the government on Wednesday said it miscounted the number of survivors, a stunning error and the latest of many missteps that have eroded the nation’s confidence in its leaders.
Coast guard chief Kim Suk-kyoon said only 172 people survived the April 16, 2014 sinking of the ferry Sewol not 174, as the government had been saying since April 18.
Mr. Kim said one of the survivors was accidentally listed twice, and he blamed the other mistake on an inaccurate report by a passenger.
Another coast guard officer said the passenger falsely told authorities he had been travelling with someone who had sneaked on board and therefore was not on the ship’s list of passengers. The officer spoke on condition of anonymity because she wasn’t authorised to speak to media on the matter. She said the passenger later told officials he gave wrong information because he had “lost track of things”.
Mr. Kim also said there are two more missing passengers than authorities previously knew about. Both are Chinese nationals.
That change raises the number of people feared dead to 304. So far 269 bodies have been recovered, and divers are searching for 35 more people. More than 80 per cent of the dead are students from a single high school near Seoul who were on a trip to southern Jeju island.
Families of the victims and many other South Koreans have been highly critical of the government’s handling of the rescue effort, and the regulatory failures that may have allowed the disaster to happen.
Shortly after the sinking, officials announced that 368 people were saved, giving scores of families false hope. There is evidence not only that the ship was overloaded with cargo, but that the agency responsible for ensuring passenger safety has incorrect information about how much the ship could safely carry.
The lengthy, difficult underwater search for bodies off South Korea’s southern coast has deepened the anguish of families of missing people, who have been camping out at a nearby port waiting for the news of their loved ones.
Prime Minister Chung Hong-won told a Cabinet Council meeting that officials must work with “resolve to finish searches” by Saturday to help ease the suffering of relatives of missing people. Tidal currents, a frequent obstacle for divers, are forecast to be weak until then.
Mr. Chung has offered to resign amid public anger over the government’s handling of the sinking. President Park Geun-hye has accepted his resignation offer but asked him to stay in his post for the time being as the government was dealing with the aftermath of the sinking.
Searches have been hampered by strong currents, bad weather and floating debris inside the ship. A civilian diver fell unconscious while searching and died on Tuesday, the first fatality among divers mobilized since the sinking.
Mr. Kim, the coast guard chief, said many victims of the sinking crowded together into two cabins far more than had been booked into the rooms. Of the 269 bodies retrieved, he said, 235 were wearing life jackets.
All 15 surviving crew members involved in the ferry’s navigation have been arrested, accused of negligence and failing to protect passengers. Improper stowage and overloading of cargo is suspected as a possible reason the ferry sank, and four employees at the ship’s owner who handled cargo on the Sewol have also been arrested.

Flowers was forced to step down as head of the Co-op Bank in June 2013 after it lost £700 million in the first half of 2013 and a £1.5-billion hole was uncovered in its balance sheet.
He also resigned as deputy chairman of the Co-operative Group, to which the bank belongs. The group prides itself on its ethical values and is one of the largest businesses of its kind in the world.
As Flowers arrived to enter his plea, he called the crowd of waiting photographers and reporters “vultures” and said, “Don’t ask me any questions because I won’t give any answers.” He was first arrested over the drugs charges in November when allegations were published in a national newspaper.
In a video published on the newspaper’s website, Flowers could be seen in his car counting out 300 pounds and giving it to a friend to buy cocaine and crystal meth.
The paper also said he had sent a text to a friend in which he had boasted of “snorting some good stuff” on the day he was to appear before a parliamentary committee examining his performance at the bank. In the end, he was not called until a week later.
After the allegations were published, Flowers was suspended by the Methodist Church, for which he was a minister and which led him to be dubbed the Crystal Methodist. His membership in the Labour party was also suspended.
It emerged as well that he had quit in 2011 as a Labour councillor in the city of Bradford after pornography was found on his computer and that he stepped down as chairman of a drugs charity after allegations were made about his expenses.

Hamas ends ban on West Bank’s Al-Quds newspaper
","Gaza’s Hamas rulers on Wednesday permitted a veteran West Bank newspaper to be distributed in the coastal territory for the first time in six years, taking a new step toward implementing a >reconciliation deal with the rival West Bank government.
The return of the independent Al-Quds daily generated excitement in Gaza City, and all 1,500 copies that were delivered on Wednesday quickly sold out.
“
Al-Quds is back!” shouted Nabil Baker, a 42-year-old newspaper vendor, as he drove his bike through the streets, selling copies.
While devoted readers have followed Al-Quds online, he said there was something different about reading and touching the hard copy. “The readers like Al-Quds more than any other paper. They are yearning to read it again,” he said.
The Palestinian split goes back to 2007 when the Islamic militant group Hamas seized control of Gaza after routing the rival forces of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. Mr. Abbas’ Palestinian Authority, dominated by his Fatah movement, now governs parts of the West Bank.
After repeated attempts at reconciliation, the rival governments signed a unity pact last month calling for the two sides to form a unity government in June 2014, and then hold new elections around year’s end.
Although the split weakened Mr. Abbas’ position in peace talks, Israel has also objected at his recent attempts to reconcile. Israel considers Hamas a terrorist group and says it will not negotiate with any Palestinian government that includes the Islamic group. The latest round of U.S.-brokered peace talks collapsed last month.
On Monday, Mr. Abbas and Hamas leader Khaled Mashaal held a rare meeting in Qatar where they agreed to move forward with the reconciliation deal.
The Fatah-dominated West Bank government has banned Gaza newspapers since Hamas wrested control of Gaza in 2007.
Ihab Ghussein, the Hamas government spokesman, called on Wednesday’s gesture a “new initiative in support of Palestinian reconciliation”. He said Hamas hoped to see similar moves by the West Bank government.
Moustafa Barghouti, a Palestinian official in the West Bank, said the newspaper bans in both Palestinian territories would be lifted soon.
Rafeq Abdel Fatah, a 64-year-old tailor, said it was like a dream to see copies of Al-Quds. “You know the feeling you have when you are familiar with something for 30 years and forced to stop doing it every morning?” he said. “This is the case with my newspaper.”
“I hope all good things come back again, not only the newspaper but everything we missed during the past seven years of division,” he said.

Syrian rebels begin evacuating Homs
","Hundreds of Syrian rebels on Wednesday began evacuating their last bastions in the central city of Homs under a >ceasefire deal struck last week with government forces, opposition activists and the city’s Governor said.
The exit of some 1,200 fighters from rebel strongholds in Homs will mark a de-facto end of the rebellion in the battered city, which was one of the first places to rise up against President Bashar Assad’s rule, earning its nickname as “the capital of the revolution”.
Around mid-morning on Wednesday, dozens of fighters boarded five buses that arrived at the police command on the edge of the rebel-held areas ahead of the evacuation, opposition activists said. Afterward, two of the buses left the city, heading north.
An activist who goes by the name of Abu Yassin al-Homsi said all fighters and any remaining civilians were expected to leave the city during the day, adding that they would be taken a few kilometres north to the rebel held towns of Talbiseh and al-Dar al-Kabira on the northern edge of Homs province a short drive away.
Later, Mr. al-Homsi confirmed later that the first group of fighters that evacuated the city centre “arrived safely” in rebel-held areas north of the province. Each fighter was allowed to carry his rifle and a bag of belongings with him. One rocket propelled grenade launcher and a machinegun were also allowed on each bus, he said.
“We are very sad for what is happening today. We kept urging the international community to lift the siege but there was no response,” Mr. al-Homsi said. “We have lost more than 2,000 martyrs in nearly two years of siege.”
It was a bitter moment for the exhausted rebels, who have been holed up in the historic quarters of Homs where they had pledged to fight till the end. Some fighters had said they would rather die than give up Homs.
Isolated and battered after months of bombardment and blockades that caused widespread hunger, they agreed last Friday to a cease-fire deal that would allow hundreds of fighters to evacuate from 13 neighbourhoods around the city’s historic centre where they had barricaded themselves.
The rebels include hardcore fighters from the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front group and other Islamic factions.
Their exit hands over to Mr. Assad’s forces a strategic but largely destroyed city ahead of presidential elections scheduled to be held on June 3, 2014. Once the evacuation is completed, the government will have control of all but one area of Homs, the rebel-held Waer district just outside the Old City. Some activists said negotiations were underway for a similar deal there.
It quickly came under a series of crushing government offensives, turning into a battleground that left entire blocks and much of its historic quarters in ruins. Thousands of people were killed and almost all its residents fled.
For well over a year, the government forces have been besieging rebels in the string of districts they held in the city centre, around its ancient bazaars. The siege caused severe shortages in food and medicine.
Earlier this year, around 1,400 people, including fighters who surrendered, were evacuated from the city in a U.N.-mediated operation.
Most recently, on April 7, a masked gunman killed a beloved, elderly Dutch priest who lived in a monastery in a Homs rebel-held district after deciding to stay alongside civilians who were unable to leave.
While the agreement represents a demoralising admission of defeat by opposition forces, it can also be seen as a face-saving deal for both sides.
Weakened rebels, for whom Homs’ collapse was only a matter of time, get a safe exit, while the government can save manpower and weapons and claim it was able to retake the last rebel bastions without spilling more blood.
In exchange for their evacuation, activists say opposition fighters will allow aid into two northern pro-government villages, Nubul and Zahra, besieged by the rebels.
Director of the London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, Rami Abdurrahman, said roads to Nubul and Zahra in northern Syrian were opened as the evacuations from Homs started on Wednesday, apparently to allow the flow of aid.
As part of the Homs deal, rebels would also release up to 70 pro-government gunmen and an Iranian woman they hold captive in the northern city of Aleppo, several activists said.
It was not immediately clear whether they had been released.

Imperial Museum offers tantalising menu of war history
","“It was a bold step to attempt to convert buildings in the middle of an English town into an up-to-date hospital for Indians, in which all the different classes among them could live in accordance with their individual customs and as enjoyed by their different religions.”
From A Short History in English, Gurmukhi and Urdu of the Royal Pavilion, Brighton.” Issued by the Corporation of Brighton, published by King, Thorn and Stace, 1915.
When London’s Imperial War Museum opens this July after extensive refurbishment, it will re-tell the story of World War 1 in a newly-curated exhibition and with source material never before displayed.
From tantalising pre-launch titbits on the spirit and content of the exhibition put out by the Museum authorities, it promises to be contemporary and inclusive in its historical approach, and state-of-the-art in display.
The WWI rooms will also shine a new light on the role of armies conscripted from the British colonies in “the war to end all wars.”
The largest non-British component of the British fighting forces, and on which the imperial war machine heavily relied was from India. Nearly 1.5 million soldiers were drafted into the war effort. Of them 74,000 died. These were men who signed up for the promise of Rs. 15 as monthly salary, five rupees as batta and two rupees as field service, plus “free” food and clothes. They had little idea of the inhospitable regions and conditions under which they would have to fight.
“We show that Indian troops take part in critical battles from 1914,” said James Taylor, IWM historian. “Around 70,000 die such a long way from home. But the key value of the Indian Army on is that it takes over campaigns in the Middle East resulting in the Indianisation of campaigns. Mesopotamia is the key example.”
“The war gave India a new sense of national identity, and of course you get Amritsar in 1919, which we will show in the gallery,” he adds.
New facets of the India story in the war are likely to emerge. By this time, the British administration had shed itself of its insensitivities to Indian cultural practices – at least where it mattered to them. For example, in the hospital established at the Royal Pavilion in Brighton with its 724 beds for injured Indian soldiers, the authorities made arrangements for separate wards, kitchens and funeral arrangements for Hindus and Muslims, and different castes.
The main exhibition – into which the strands comprising the colonies will be woven – will tell the story of how and why the war started and its domestic and global impact, as seen through the eyes of those who experienced it on the frontlines and home front. There will be over 1300 war objects on display in 14 thematic areas in the exhibition.
“Visitors can consider some of the big questions and choices, ordinary and extraordinary, that the people of Britain and its former Empire had to face in the first ‘total war’ and discuss the impact the conflict had on the world in which we live today,” said Diane Lees, Director-General of IWM.
The cost of refurbishment was £40 million, but like all public museums in the country, entry is free.

H-1B visa spouses to get work permits soon
","With more than a year lapsing since the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) first proposed to amend immigration law to allow H-4 visa holders, the spouses of those holding H-1B visas, to work under certain conditions, the U.S. federal agency this week announced the formal publication of the new rules, implying that they would enter into force soon, possibly 60-day public comment period.
The ruling is likely to have particular salience to visa holders of Indian citizenship, particularly those working in the IT sector, as India is the country receiving the largest proportion of H-1B visas from the U.S. every year. In 2013, its citizens received 99,705 H-1B visas of a total of 153,223 issued globally, slightly over 65 per cent.
In a statement DHS Deputy Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, said that as part of the administration’s proposals to “attract and retain highly skilled immigrants,” the new rules had been proposed because, “Businesses continue to need these high-skilled workers, and these rules ensure we do not cede the upper hand to other countries competing for the same talent.”
Mr. Mayorkas noted that up to 97,000 H-4 visa holders may be eligible to apply for employment authorisation under this rule within the first year of its entering into force and 30,000 may benefit annually.
On a call with media in Washington, Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker highlighted the transformative role of immigrant entrepreneurs in the U.S. economy. She said, “Many tire of waiting for green cards and leave the country to work for our competition. The fact is we have to do more to retain and attract world-class talent to the U.S. and these regulations put us on a path to do that.”
As the DHS did when the proposals were initially announced in January 2013, it was careful to clarify that the extension of work authorisation to H-4 visas would only apply in the cases of H-1B visa holders, who had begun the process of seeking “lawful permanent residence” in the U.S., in other words a ‘green card’ application. Currently, DHS does not extend employment authorisation to H-4 dependents.
The changes were initially announced in 2013, a few months after The Hindu carried a series of articles (
>‘For Indian women in America, a sea of broken dreams,’ July 29, 2012 and >‘On the H-4, a trail of misery and lonely battles,’ July 30, 2012) that spotlighted the debilitating personal circumstances faced by many H-4s.
These included depression, loss of enthusiasm and self-esteem associated with joblessness and social isolation, in numerous cases leading to mental health issues or familial breakdown.
Reflecting a greater sensitivity to this reality of spouses of H-1B visa holders, the DHS said during its initial announcement of the proposed changes that it, “recognises that the limitation on the period of stay is not the only event that could cause an H-1B worker to leave his or her employment and cause disruption to the employer's business, inclusive of the loss of significant time and money invested in the immigration process... This rule will encourage H-1B skilled workers to not abandon their adjustment application because their H-4 spouse is unable to work.”
The proposed rules granting employment rights to some H-4 visa holders were also “intended to mitigate some of the negative economic effects of limiting H-1B households to one income during lengthy waiting periods in the adjustment of status process,” the DHS noted in 2013.
However, the DHS emphasised applicants seeking to obtain the right to work in the U.S. on this basis should bear in mind that the proposed changes would only impact spouses of H-1B workers, who have been admitted or have extended their stay under the provisions of the American Competitiveness in the Twenty-First Century Act of 2000 or AC21.
Pre-empting criticisms that the new rules may lead to job losses for American citizens, the DHS said, “Allowing certain H-4 spouses the opportunity to work would result in a negligible increase to the overall domestic labour force. The benefits of this rule are retaining highly-skilled persons, who intend to adjust to lawful permanent resident status.”
The latest change in rules come on the back of numerous top U.S. company heads, including Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg lobbying in Washington for the passage of bipartisan immigration reform legislation that would better permit U.S. companies to recruit highly talented foreign citizens.
However, despite the U.S. Senate passing a sweeping comprehensive Immigration Reform Bill in 2013 year, the Republican-led House of Representatives has blocked debates on the floor, ostensibly due to concerns that a ‘path to citizenship’ for the nearly 11.5 million undocumented immigrants could have a potential negative impact on the U.S. economy.
U.S. President Barack Obama now appears to be leaning towards the use of executive actions to take immigration reform forward in a piecemeal format, and this week’s DHS proposals would reflect such change of tack.

Monica Lewinsky: My boss took advantage of me
","Former White House intern Monica Lewinsky has broken her silence on her 1990s affair with then US President Bill Clinton, saying he took advantage of her even though it was a “consensual relationship”.
“I, myself, deeply regret what happened between me and President Clinton. Let me say it again: I. Myself. Deeply. Regret. What. Happened,” Ms. Lewinsky said in an exclusive article she wrote for Vanity Fair magazine.
In the article, Ms. Lewinsky said it is time to stop “tiptoeing around my past and other people’s futures. I am determined to have a different ending to my story.”
“I’ve decided, finally, to stick my head above the parapet so that I can take back my narrative and give a purpose to my past. What this will cost me, I will soon find out,” she said.
Maintaining that her affair with Mr. Clinton was one between two consenting adults, Ms. Lewinsky wrote that it was the public humiliation she suffered in the wake of the scandal that permanently altered the direction of her life, according to Vanity Fair.
“Sure, my boss took advantage of me, but I will always remain firm on this point: it was a consensual relationship,” she said in the article.
“Any ‘abuse’ came in the aftermath, when I was made a scapegoat in order to protect his powerful position...The Clinton administration, the special prosecutor’s minions, the political operatives on both sides of the aisle, and the media were able to brand me. And that brand stuck, in part because it was imbued with power,” she wrote according to the excerpts.
“The buzz in some circles has been that the Clintons must have paid me off; why else would I have refrained from speaking out? I can assure you that nothing could be further from the truth,” Ms. Lewinsky, said.
Ms. Lewinsky said in the article that when the news of her affair with Mr. Clinton broke in 1998, not only was she arguably the most humiliated person in the world, but “thanks to the Drudge Report, I was also possibly the first person whose global humiliation was driven by the Internet.”
Her current goal, she said, “Is to get involved with efforts on behalf of victims of online humiliation and harassment and to start speaking on this topic in public forums.”

Pakistan releases American identified as FBI agent
","Pakistan released an FBI agent on bail on Thursday after three days in custody, officials said, a move that is likely to prevent the situation from escalating into a diplomatic spat.
The American man was detained after airport authorities found him carrying ammunition and three knives on Monday as he was about to board a flight for the Pakistani capital, Islamabad.
The arrest threatened to open a new chapter in troubled relations between Pakistan and the U.S., which have been uneasy allies since the September 11 terror attacks. But the relatively fast release, if confirmed, suggested efforts to defuse any tensions.
A law enforcement official in the U.S. has said the man was an FBI agent and said he was in Pakistan as part of a multi-agency, anti-corruption programme. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the diplomatic sensitivities of the case, said the agent appeared to have made a mistake and didn’t mean to carry bullets aboard the plane.
U.S. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki confirmed the detention on Wednesday and said the U.S. was coordinating with Pakistani authorities to resolve the matter. She did not identify the man.
A Pakistani court directed the man to submit a surety bond of Pakistani Rs. 1 million ($9,800) for his bail, police officer Rao Anwaar said. The American arrived in Karachi on May 1 and was detained after officials found him with the ammunition, knives and electronic devices that were being examined.
Other police officials said investigators were under immense pressure from the Interior Ministry and other government officials to release the American so the report was rushed. They found he had no criminal intention in carrying the bullets during domestic air travel, the officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity in exchange for release the details.
Washington needs Pakistan’s help fighting al-Qaeda and stabilising neighbouring Afghanistan, as NATO uses Pakistani roads to supply its troops. However, relations have strained over a series of incidents. CIA contractor Raymond Davis shot and killed two Pakistani men in Lahore in January 2011. The U.S. unilaterally killed Osama bin Laden in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad in May 2011 and American forces accidentally killed 24 Pakistani troops along the Afghan border the same year. U.S. drones strikes in the country also have angered Pakistanis.

Musharraf trial: Defence to get FIA report, relevant documents
","The special court trying former President General (retd.) Pervez Musharraf for high treason on Thursday allowed an application from the defence to have access to the joint investigation report of the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) and all other relevant documents.
In its order, the court directed the prosecutor to file by May 14, 2014 copies of all statements of all the persons that were recorded during the course of the investigation, whether they were intended to be produced as prosecution witnesses or not, and the gist of evidence of all the witnesses likely to be adduced at the trial, and copies of all documents collected during the course of the investigation which have any nexus with the alleged crime.
The court also said that a copy of the Joint Investigation Report inclusive of any separate note if recorded by any member of the team must also be filed in court. The defence had contended in its arguments that there was a dissenting note by one investigator who had stated that a single person cannot be tried for the offence.
The order said the copies of all such documents shall be delivered to the defence counsel on the same day- May 14. The process of recording evidence of the prosecution witness shall commence on May 22 so that the defence counsel may have a clear seven days to examine the documents and prepare his case, as per law.
The defence in its application, the first of which has been allowed by the special court, had demanded that the names of all the co accused who aided and abetted with the accused in the promulgation of emergency order of November 3, 2007 be supplied and process be issued to them and they be tried jointly. It also demanded the investigation report based on which the case of high treason was filed and said the names of all those who were questioned in the course of the FIA investigation should also be made available in the interests of a fair trial.
The order said the prosecution had neither claimed immunity nor any secrecy with respect to any material that was collected during the investigation. The right to a fair trial is associated with the right of access to justice, the court held. It said that disclosure of all material having nexus with the alleged crime when demanded by the defence becomes a legal obligation and its withholding a breach, while issuing directions to the prosecution to furnish all relevant material.
Defence lawyer Faisal Hussain said it was the constitutional right of the accused to get all the material evidence and the court had agreed with the defence contention.

Pakistan legal fraternity protests killing of human rights lawyer
","Lawyers on Thursday protested the killing of human rights lawyer Rashid Rehman who was shot dead in his office in Multan on Wednesday even as the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) condemned the fatal attack on its Multan Task Force coordinator.
HRCP in a statement said Rehman was a committed rights activist and lawyer and had been associated with HRCP for over 20 years. On April 10, 2014, the HRCP said that it had brought to the attention of the authorities that Rehman was being openly threatened by prosecution lawyers in the Multan District Prison where he was representing a blasphemy accused.
The hearing was being held in the prison due to security concerns. The judge, it was reported, did not take any notice of threats issued to Rehman in his presence, HRCP said. Three persons had addressed Rehman in the judge’s presence and said: “You will not come to court next time because you will not exist anymore.”
HRCP said it was regrettable that no attention was paid to HRCP’s or Rehman’s concerns and nothing was done to apprehend the three persons who had threatened him. It had demanded that the three persons who had threatened Rehman be “proceeded against under the law without delay and effective measures be taken to ensure the defence lawyer’s security”.
The Commission demands that cases be immediately registered against those who had threatened Rashid and his killers be brought to justice. It would be a travesty of justice for the cause of human rights and for Rehman’s family if this plea was also ignored and meaningful action was not taken, the statement said.
Rehman had bravely decided to represent a blasphemy accused in a society where bigots believe that those accused do not have the right of defence and in his death, HRCP has lost a courageous and committed human rights defender, the statement pointed out. The forces of religious extremism, unchecked by the state, may have won a battle but not the war, the statement added.

Protesters reject Putin’s call
","Rebels in eastern Ukraine have refused to postpone a referendum on their regions’ future despite a call from Russia’s President Vladimir Putin.
The coordinating councils of the self-proclaimed People’s Republics of Donetsk and Luhansk unanimously voted on Thursday to go ahead with the vote on Sunday as planned.
“The ongoing military operation by Ukrainian forces and the slaughter of protesters in Odessa have heightened people’s resolve to vote on Sunday,” protesters’ leader Denis Pushilin told reporters in Donetsk.
On Wednesday, Mr. Putin called on anti-government protesters in Ukraine to postpone the referendum in order to facilitate dialogue on autonomy with Kiev. He also urged Ukrainian authorities to call off their “punitive” operation in the east.
Mr. Putin backed a four-point peace plan for Ukraine proposed by Swiss President Didier Burkhalter, who is rotating head of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe. The plan called for ceasefire, de-escalation of tension, the launching of dialogue and elections in Ukraine.
However, Kiev on Thursday vowed to press on with its military crackdown irrespective of whether the referendum is adjourned.
“We must defend the territorial integrity of our country and free the temporary occupied territories [in Crimea],” Acting President Oleksandr Turchynov said, according to his press service.
Kiev’s reaction has hardened the protesters’ stance. “People don’t trust Ukrainian authorities and Kiev’s reaction was inadequate,” said Miroslav Rudenko, a leader of the Donetsk self-defence forces.
The question on the referendum ballot is: “Do you support the act of proclamation of sovereignty for the Donetsk People’s Republic?” In Luhansk, the question is identical.
Organisers said the ambiguous phrasing was intentional to allow them to decide whether to push for independence, greater autonomy within Ukraine or unification with Russia, depending on how things turn out after the vote.
International efforts have done little to reduce tension between Russia and the West over the Ukraine crisis. Mr. Putin on Thursday presided over Russia’s largest yet command and control exercises, which, he said, involved “all branches and services of the armed forces across the entire territory of Russia.”
The drills include two submarine missile launches, cruise missile firing by strategic bombers, and ground-to-air missile tests to repulse a nuclear attack. Russia has staged a series of armed forces drills near the Ukrainian border over the past two months.
NATO on Tuesday launched a record 6,000-strong military exercises in Estonia close to the Russian border, while NATO’s Supreme Allied Commander General Philip Breedlove called for permanent stationing of troops in Eastern Europe in the face of Russia’s “actions and military escalation” in Crimea.
U.S. President Barack Obama on Wednesday announced removing Russia from a list of countries whose exports enjoy preferential treatment. The White House said the move was “particularly appropriate” in the light of Russia’s actions in Ukraine.
At the same time the U.S. government has asked the courts to lift a ban on purchases of Russian missile engines that power U.S. heavy-duty Atlas 5 missiles.

Tech giants oppose plan for two-speed Internet
","Google, Facebook, Twitter and Amazon were signatories to a strongly-worded protest letter attacking a proposal to give big corporations higher-speed Internet access while relegating smaller users to relatively slower speeds of data transfer online.
After Tom Wheeler, Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, put forth a plan last month to allow broadband providers to charge companies a premium for access to their fastest ‘lanes,’ 100 top tech companies wrote that the FCC, “instead of permitting individualised bargaining and discrimination… should protect users and Internet companies… against blocking, discrimination and paid prioritisation…”
A vote on the plan is scheduled for May 15.
Some consider the FCC, which has been under significant pressure since the latest rules were proposed, to be seeking a middle ground between preserving absolute ‘net neutrality,’ the concept that “that no providers of legal Internet content should face discrimination in providing offerings to consumers, and that users should have equal access to see any legal content they choose,” and preventing broadband Internet providers such as Comcast, Verizon Communications Inc. and Time Warner Cable from slowing down certain websites accessed by individual consumers.
This week’s protest letter may only be a first step in a larger grassroots-style protest hinted at in some reports, especially as many of the same companies participated in a large-scale protest in 2012 that knocked out the controversial Stop Online Piracy Act, which was also know as SOPA.
While the companies’ fears may be exacerbated by reports that the two Republican Commissioners of the FCC were “broadly opposed to regulation of Internet traffic,” and were expected to vote against any net-neutrality rules that they consider to be unnecessarily burdensome on Internet providers, they are likely to find support from the Democratic members of the Commission.
One of them, Jessica Rosenworcel, said this week that she has “real concerns” with Mr. Wheeler’s proposal, adding that she felt, “We should delay our consideration of his rules by at least a month…I believe that rushing headlong into a rule-making next week fails to respect the public response to his proposal.”
Another Democratic Commissioner, Mignon Clyburn, said in a blogpost that she was “listening” to the thousands of people who have spoken out on the issue. However, she addedding, “I would have prohibited pay for priority arrangements altogether.”
With speculation mounting that the FCC intended to “gut the open Internet rule,” the tech firms warned in their letter that if the Commission enabled phone and cable Internet service providers to discriminate both technically and financially against Internet companies and to impose new tolls on them, it would “represent a grave threat to the Internet.”
They further urged the FCC to take necessary steps to ensure “certainty to all market participants and keep the costs of regulation low,” pleading that such rules were essential for the very future of the Internet.
Among the other major technology companies signing the letter were Netflix, Microsoft, LinkedIn, Tumbler, Reddit, Yahoo, Ebay, Etsy, Vonage, DropBox, FourSquare and Zynga.

Radical cleric claims he worked secretly for M15
","The trial of the radical Muslim cleric Abu Hamza al-Masri in a New York court on terror charges took a rather unexpected turn on Wednesday, when his lawyers told the court that he secretly worked for M15, Britain’s national intelligence and security agency.
A leading figure on the British Islamist scene, the Egypt-born cleric Abu Hamza, who was known for the hate sermons he would deliver at London’s Finsbury Park mosque, was arrested in 2004 by the U.K. police, convicted of stoking murder and racial hatred, and jailed for seven years in 2006. He was extradited to the United States after a protracted legal battle in 2012.
In the Manhattan federal court where his trial is being held, Abu Hamza said that he had been asked by M15 to “keep the streets of London safe”; in other words his job was to reign in more radical and violent Islamist elements.
Abu Hamza denied all 11 charges against him, which includes the kidnapping of 16 western tourists and the killing of four of them in Yemen in 1998.
Giving his background to the court, he said that he went from running a strip-bar in Soho “on the wrong side of morality” to a convert to Islam. He claimed to have been a member of the Royal Society of Engineers and to have worked at the Royal Military Academy at Sandhurst.
The judge refused to accept as evidence documents from Scotland Yard which his lawyers said would demonstrate how Abu Hamza had cooperated with the police to keep the peace and negotiate for the release of hostages.

Ukraine separatists to go ahead with referendum despite Putin call
","Two eastern Ukrainian provinces will go ahead with a referendum on seceding from the country as planned this weekend despite Russian President Vladimir Putin’s call for a delay, separatist leaders told Russia’s Interfax news agency on Thursday.
“The referendum on May 11 will take place,” said Miroslav Rudenko, a separatist leader of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic.
The secession referendum will let the 3 million residents of the provinces of Luhansk and Donetsk vote on whether they want to stay part of Ukraine. Ukrainians opposed to a split see it as a precursor to an eventual merger with Russia, as happened with Crimea in March.
Separatist leaders said they were merely following popular opinion.
“This is not our decision. This is the decision of the people of the region of Donbas,” Andriy Purgin, using a colloquial name for the region, told the Itar-Tass news agency.
Pro-Russian activists in the Luhansk region also confirmed plans to go ahead with the referendum, saying a citizen’s council had given the go-ahead.
The move comes amid worries that tensions could boil over into violence on Friday. May 9 is the day when Russia and Ukraine traditionally commemorate the defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II.
Some say this year’s festivities could degenerate into violence.
Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk attacked Russia in a statement, referring to the country’s attack against Ukraine in 1941, during World War II. He said Friday’s Victory Day celebrations would be the first since 1945 conducted “under war conditions.” “In light of this foreign aggression and terrorism, the Ukraine values more than ever the immortal heroes who defended peace 69 years ago,” he said, warning against provocations and sabotage on Friday.
The decision to proceed with the referendum drew reprisal from the European Union.
“Such unauthorised local referenda have no democratic legitimacy and can only lead to further escalation,” said Maja Kocijancic, a spokeswoman for E.U. foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton.
The decision to stay the course with the referendums came as Ukrainian officials said military efforts to clear separatist strongholds would continue.
And they both came after a brief window of opportunity seemed to open in which both sides said they could countenance talks to calm the situation, albeit under conditions that would have unlikely been acceptable to each side.
The separatists have been storming government buildings for weeks, prompting the government to send out anti-terrorism units. This has led to clashes and deaths. The government has said it is losing control of the region.
A spat also continued between Russia and the West about whether or not Russian troops massed on Ukraine’s border had been drawn down. U.S. and NATO forces insist that the troops remain in place, which prompted Russian officials to tweet overnight that anyone who couldn’t see the withdrawal had vision problems.
“I have very good vision, but, while we’ve noted Russia’s statement, so far we haven’t seen any — any — indication of troops pulling back,” said NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen.
“If we saw visible signs of a meaningful pullback by Russia troops I’d be the first one to welcome it.” Adding to the worries, Russian military forces on Thursday tested three multi-stage nuclear missiles on its own territory. Russia said the tests were long-planned and conducted under Mr. Putin’s supervision, along with tests of several cruise missiles.
Ms. Kocijancic, Ms. Ashton’s spokeswoman, said the E.U. does not believe claims by Mr. Putin that Russia had no influence on separatists in Ukraine.
“We have always maintained that these pro-Russian separatists have the Russian backing,” Ms. Kocijancic said, adding, “In this respect we... repeat our calls on Russia to exercise influence in that way.” Meanwhile, German Chancellor Angela Merkel also called upon Putin to focus on ways to de-escalate the situation.
“The onus lies upon President Putin to get the pro-Russian forces in the Ukraine to lay down their weapons and call for occupied buildings to be cleared,” she said in comments carried by the Rheinischen Post newspaper.
Work is also under way to extend an E.U. sanctions list, which could for the first time also include entities in Crimea, according to E.U. sources. The decision could be taken at a meeting of E.U. foreign ministers on Monday.
The bloc has so far placed travel bans and asset freezes on 48 individuals for their role in destabilizing Ukraine.
The European Union is now looking at changing its sanctions criteria, which have so far stipulated that entities can only be targeted if they are associated with individuals on the list, an E.U. source said.
This linkage would be lifted in the case of Crimea, she said.

Tomb dating back to 1100 BC found in Egypt
","Archaeologists have found a tomb dating back to around 1100 B.C. south of Cairo, Egypt’s Antiquities Ministry said on Thursday.
Antiquities Minister Mohamed Ibrahim said that the tomb belongs to a guard of the Army archives and royal messenger to foreign countries. Mr. Ibrahim said the Cairo University Faculty of Archaeology’s discovery at Saqqara adds “a chapter to our knowledge about the history of Saqqara”.
Ola el-Egeizy of Cairo University said the tomb contains “very nice inscriptions” of the funerary procession and the afterlife of the deceased.
The tomb was found near another one dating back to the same period belonging to the head of the Army that was discovered in the previous excavation season. That tomb was larger but much of what remains is mud bricks as “most of its stone blocks were stolen and many of them are in museums all over the world,” said Mr. el-Egeizy. Because of the blocks, archaeologists had long known that the tomb existed though it was not uncovered until recently.
Saqqara was the necropolis for the ancient Egyptian city of Memphis and site of the oldest known pyramid in Egypt.
Egypt’s vital tourism industry has suffered in the wake of the 2011 uprising that toppled autocratic leader Hosni Mubarak.

Syrian rebels claim massive Aleppo hotel bombing
","A rebel-claimed bombing on Thursday in the northern Syrian city of Aleppo levelled a hotel near the ancient Citadel that government troops used as a military base, along with several other buildings, activists and militants said.
Syrian state television said the explosion struck a government-held area on the edge of a contested neighbourhood in old part of Aleppo. The television report identified the hotel as the Carlton Citadel hotel.
The attack in Aleppo is a significant blow to President Bashar Assad’s government in the north as his troops prepare to regain control of the central city of Homs following last week’s cease-fire agreement after a fierce, two-year battle with the rebels trying to oust him.
No such agreement appears to be in sight in Aleppo, Syria’s largest city and former commercial hub. The city has been carved up into opposition — and government-held areas since the rebels launched an offensive there in mid-2012, capturing territory along Syria’s northern border with Turkey.
In recent months, government aircraft relentlessly has bombed rebel-held areas of the city and the opposition fighters have hit back, firing mortars into government-held areas. The rebels also have detonated car bombs in residential areas, killing dozens of people.
Thursday’s attack targeted a government-held area on the edge of a contested neighbourhood in an old part of Aleppo. The country’s official news service said terrorists a term the government uses for rebels dug up tunnels under Aleppo ancient district and detonated explosives there.
A local activist group called the Sham News Network also reported the blast, saying that Mr. Assad’s troops were based in the hotel.
The Islamic Front rebel group claimed responsibility for the blast. A statement posted on its official Twitter account Thursday said that its “fighters this morning levelled the Carlton Hotel barracks in Old Aleppo and a number of buildings near it, killing 50 soldiers.” It did not say how it knew how many soldiers died.
The Islamic Front is an alliance of several Islamic groups fighting to topple Mr. Assad. Many of its fighters have joined the Front after breaking away from the Western-backed Syrian Free Army last year.
Another activist group, the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, said Islamic Front fighters planted a huge amount of explosives in a tunnel they dug below the hotel and detonated it remotely.
It said the hotel was completely destroyed in the blast and that there were casualties among the troops.
Meanwhile Thursday, more rebels were expected to leave the central city of Homs as an evacuation of opposition fighters moves into its second day.
Mr. Barazi was seen touring Homs on Lebanon’s Al-Manar TV, which is owned by the Shiite militant group Hezbollah. Hezbollah has been battling rebels in Syria alongside government troops for months.
A reporter with Syrian state TV was seen broadcasting live from an entrance to Homs Old City. Standing near the city’s main square known as the Clock Square, the reporter interviewed a priest who said he hoped people in the city would be safe again.
The Observatory, which has been documenting Syria’s three-year-old conflict through a network of activists on the ground, said that about 250 opposition fighters remain in the old districts of Homs, where they have been holed up under a crippling government siege for more than two years. The Observatory’s head, Rami Abdurrahman, said more than 960 left the city on Wednesday.
The rebels agreed to a ceasefire deal on Friday as part of the evacuation.
An activist in Homs who goes with the name of Beibares Tellawi told The Associated Press that seven buses went into a once-besieged area of Homs on Thursday to take the remaining rebels out of the city.
“The siege of old Homs will be over in a few hours,” Tellawi said via Skype. “We expect that everyone left inside will leave today.”
In exchange for the rebels’ safe departure from Homs, the opposition fighters have released 70 people who had been held by gunmen in various areas, including in Aleppo and in the costal province of Latakia, Mr. Barazi said.

Obama intends to withdraw special trade benefits for Russia
","U.S. President Barack Obama intends to withdraw special privileges granted to Russia because the country is too economically advanced to need preferential treatment reserved for less developed countries, the White House has said.
Mr. Obama notified Congress that he intends to remove Russia from the Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) programme as Moscow is “sufficiently advanced” to warrant any preferential treatment.
Once Russia’s eligibility is withdrawn, which would be effected via a presidential proclamation, U.S. imports of GSP-eligible goods from Russia will be subject to normal, non-preferential rates of duty, Mr. Obama in his notification said.
The purpose of the programme, which allowed $19.9 billion in imports to enter the U.S. duty-free in 2012, is to assist developing countries to use trade to boost their economic development, U.S. Trade Representatives (USTR) Mike Froman said.
“Russia has advanced beyond the level of economic development and competitiveness for GSP eligibility. As such, Russia should no longer qualify to receive GSP benefits,” he said in a statement.
“The President’s decision is consistent with the World Bank’s designation of Russia as a ‘high income country’ as well as actions by the European Union and Canada to remove Russia from similar programmes,” Mr. Froman said.
The U.S.-Russia relations have hit an all-time low since the Cold War following the unrest in Ukraine, which Washington says is being fuelled by Moscow.
The announcement comes on a day when Russian President Vladimir Putin said his country has pulled troops back from the Ukraine border. But the White House was sceptical of the claim.

Head of sunken ferry's owner in South Korea detained
","South Korean prosecutors on Thursday detained the head of the company that owns >the ferry that sank last month over an allegation of cargo overloading.
Authorities believe improper stowage and overloading of cargo are possible reasons the ferry sank on April 16, leaving more than 300 people dead or missing. Four employees at the ferry’s owner Chonghaejin Marine Co. Ltd., who handled cargo on the Sewol, have already been arrested.
Kim Han-sik, president of Chonghaejin, was detained on Thursday ahead of his possible formal arrest on allegations that he was aware that the ferry exceeded its cargo limit but didn’t do anything before it started it trip, according to senior prosecutor Yang Jung-jin.
Mr. Yang said prosecutors are investigating Mr. Kim’s actions before deciding if they will request a court to issue a warrant to formally arrest him.
All 15 surviving crew members involved in the ferry’s navigation have been arrested, accused of negligence and failing to protect passengers.
More than three weeks after the sinking, 269 bodies have been retrieved but 35 others are still listed as missing. South Korea’s Prime Minister said on Wednesday that officials must try to complete the search for the missing by Saturday as tidal currents were forecast to be weak until then.
But no progress has been reported as divers have failed to recover additional bodies since Wednesday afternoon due to high waves and strong winds, government task force spokesman Ko Myung-seok said.
Searches have been hampered by strong currents, bad weather and floating debris inside the ship. A civilian diver fell unconscious while searching and died on Tuesday, the first fatality among divers mobilized since the sinking.
The lengthy, difficult underwater search for bodies off South Korea’s southern coast has deepened the anguish of families of missing people, who have been camping out at a nearby port waiting for the news of their loved ones.
Many South Koreans have been highly critical of the government’s handling of the rescue effort, and the regulatory failures that may have allowed the disaster to happen.
On Wednesday, the government announced it miscounted the number of survivors, the latest in a series of missteps it has made that have eroded the nation’s confidence in its leaders.
Coast guard chief Kim Suk-kyoon said 172 people survived the sinking of the ferry Sewol not 174, as the government had been saying since April 18.
Mr. Kim said one of the survivors was accidentally listed twice, and he blamed the other mistake on an inaccurate report by a passenger.
Mr. Kim said there are two more missing passengers than authorities previously knew about. Both are Chinese nationals.
That change raises the number of people feared dead to 304. More than 80 per cent of them are students from a single high school near Seoul who were on a trip to southern Jeju island.
There is evidence not only that the ship was overloaded with cargo, but that the agency responsible for ensuring passenger safety has incorrect information about how much the ship could safely carry.

Fighting erupts in Ukraine
","Russia on Friday marked the 69th anniversary of victory in World War II with an impressive display of military might in Moscow and Crimea that served to underscore President Vladimir Putin’s triumph in bringing the Black Sea peninsula back into the Russian fold.
In stark contrast to the festive atmosphere in Russia, across the border in Ukraine the mood was grim, with V-Day festivities in Kiev cancelled and fighting erupting again in the strife-riven southeast.
The traditional display of war muscle in Moscow was the largest in 20 years. Eleven thousand troops marched across Red Square in bright and warm spring weather, followed by huge Topol-M intercontinental ballistic missiles and scores of tanks, rocket launchers and military hardware. Rounding off the parade, 69 military aircraft zoomed overhead, one for each year since V-Day.
After overseeing the Moscow parade, Mr. Putin travelled to Crimea to preside over a massive military show in Sevastopol, the headquarters of the Russian Black Sea fleet in Crimea.
It was Mr. Putin’s first trip to Crimea after it split from Ukraine and rejoined Russia two months ago, and the Russian leader made the most of the occasion to emphasise his role in the historic reunification.
In a telling departure from protocol, Mr. Putin personally took the salute from the Russian Black Sea fleet, sailing in a command boat past a line of warships anchored in Sevastopol’s bay before watching a flypast by dozens of aircraft.
Addressing the military in Sevastopol, Mr. Putin hailed Crimea’s reunion with Russia. “I am sure that 2014 will go into the annals of our history as the year when the people living here firmly decided to be together with Russia. Thereby they reaffirmed fidelity to the historical truth and the memory of our ancestors,” Mr. Putin said.
Attending an open-air festive concert in Sevastopol, Mr. Putin was greeted as a hero, with thousands of spectators chanting “Putin,” “Russia” and “Spasibo” (Thank you).
As Russia celebrated, fighting was raging in Mariupol, a city of half-a-million in Ukraine’s Donetsk region, as government forces battled pro-Russia activists and their loyalists among local police for control of the police headquarters. Footage from Mariupol showed tanks rumbling down the city centre towards the blazing police building, crowds trying to block their way and a man lying on the blood-splattered pavement either wounded or killed.
Ukrainian Interior Minister Arsen Avakov said 21 protesters and one Ukrainian security officer had been killed in the fighting in Mariupol.
Russia Today TV channel said its cameraman was wounded in Mariupol.
Protesters claimed to have captured from the military an armoured vehicle in Mariupol and two Grad multiple launchers in Donetsk.
Two rebellious eastern regions, Donetsk and Luhansk, are set to hold local referendums on “state sovereignty” rejecting Mr. Putin’s appeal to postpone the vote.
In Kiev, authorities cancelled a military parade citing the risk of provocations and V-Day was marked by a low-key wreath laying ceremony.

Strong earthquake shakes Mexico's Pacific coast
","A strong earthquake shook the southern Pacific coast of Mexico as well as the capital and several inland states Thursday, sending frightened people into unseasonal torrential rains that were also bearing down on the coast.
The 6.4-magnitude quake in southern Guerrero state was centred about 15 km north of Tecpan de Galeana, according to the U.S. Geological Survey, and was felt about 277 km miles away in Mexico City, where office workers streamed into the streets away from high-rise buildings.
There were no reports of injuries. A 30-meter (yard) section of elevated road collapsed in Tecpan, near the epicenter, closing the federal highway between the resort cities of Acapulco and Zihuatanejo. The road had been damaged in a magnitude-7.2 quake that hit April 18 in roughly the same area and was under repair when it collapsed. The detour road was under water from the rains Thursday.
Tecpan shook ferociously, causing a “wave of panic” and some roofs to cave in, Mayor Crisoforo Otero Heredia said. As the day went on, civil protection workers started hearing of collapsed houses, some in remote areas in the municipality of Tecpan such as the town of La Cienega.
A wall collapsed in Chilpancingo, the capital of Guerrero state, but civil protection crews in Acapulco found no problems except scared citizens who were forced to take refuge in the heavy rain that was hitting the region.
In Mexico City, elegantly dressed businesswoman Carmen Lopez was leaving a downtown office building when the ground began to shake. She dashed across the street to a leafy median as light poles swayed violently above her.
“That was just too scary,” Lopez said as she quickly started dialing her cellphone to alert friends and family.
Behind her, thousands of people poured from neighboring office buildings, following pre-planned evacuation routes to areas considered safe in case of falling glass.
The quake occurred at a depth of 23 km and its epicentre was about 66 km from that of the April 18 quake that shook central and southern Mexico.

Ms. Gao, who is in her seventies and has long been a strong advocate of political reforms, had been detained on charges of leaking “state secrets” to a foreign news website, according to State media. She had been missing since April 24. She had participated in the June 1989 pro-democracy student protests on Tiananmen Square, which were violently suppressed leading to the deaths of several hundred people. Twenty five years later, the event is still sensitive in China. State media said authorities had seized evidence from the Beijing home of Ms. Gao, and added that she had made “confessions”. The Chinese government has often used the vague charge of “state secrets” to detain critics.
Human rights groups have called on the government to release Ms. Gao and other activists who have been detained in recent weeks. Human rights lawyer Pu Zhiqiang, who has taken up a number of sensitive cases, was taken away May 4.

Michelle Obama slams kidnapping of Nigerian girls
","US First Lady Michelle Obama on Saturday criticized the kidnapping of scores of Nigerian schoolgirls as an “unconscionable act” by “grown men attempting to snuff out the aspirations of young girls.”
Taking over the president’s weekly radio and Internet address on the eve of the American holiday for honouring mothers, Ms. Obama said that she and President Barack Obama are “outraged and heartbroken” over the April 15 abduction of the girls from their dormitory.
“In these girls, Barack and I see our own daughters,” Ms. Obama said, referring to Malia, 15, and Sasha, 12. “We see their hopes, their dreams and we can only imagine the anguish their parents are feeling right now.”
What happened in Nigeria is not an isolated incident, she said, but is “a story we see every day as girls around the world risk their lives to pursue their ambitions.”
Ms. Obama mentioned the case of Malala Yousafzai, the Pakistani teenager who survived being shot in the head as she travelled to school in 2012. Malala has become an outspoken advocate for the rights of all girls to get an education, the same message Ms. Obama delivered in her first solo address to the nation.
Ms. Obama noted that more than 65 million girls worldwide do not attend school even though educated women earn more money and have healthier families.
“When more girls attend secondary school, that boosts their country’s entire economy,” she said. “So education is truly a girl’s best chance for a bright future, not just for herself, but for her family and her nation.”
In Saturday’s address, the first lady asked the nation to pray for the Nigerian girls’ safe return.
“This unconscionable act was committed by a terrorist group determined to keep these girls from getting an education grown men attempting to snuff out the aspirations of young girls,” she said. “Let us hold their families in our hearts during this very difficult time, and let us show just a fraction of their courage in fighting to give every girl on this planet the education that is her birthright.”
The Nigerian government’s inability to rescue the girls nearly a month after they were abducted by the Boko Haram organization has sparked worldwide outrage, including protests and a social media campaign. The U.S. and other countries have sent teams of technical experts to assist the Nigerian government’s search effort.
Authorities have said more than 300 girls were abducted from their school in the country’s remote northeast. Fifty-three escaped and 276 remain captive.
President Obama said this week that the U.S. will do everything to help Nigeria find them.

Thousands of Syrians enter Homs after rebels leave
","Men, women and children fanned through the smashed ancient quarters of Homs, some in pickup trucks and bicycles, while most walked on a breezy, sunny day. A youth band banging drums and holding photographs of the Syrian President Bashar Assad marched through the area, adding a celebratory mood for those supporting his government amid the 3-year-old conflict.
The some 2,000 rebels as well as civilians living there were badly weakened by nearly two years of blockade that caused widespread suffering and hardship.
The deal is widely seen as a victory for Mr. Assad weeks ahead of a presidential election that he is expected to win, giving him a mandate to continue his violent crackdown on rebels in the Syrian civil war, which activists say has killed more than 150,000 people.
Residents scavenged what they could from their homes Saturday, mostly clothes, dusty mattresses and some burned gas canisters, carrying them away in plastic bags and trolleys.
“My house was completely destroyed and burnt, but I found some photos,” said Sara Mousa, 49, a resident of the old Hamidiyeh district. “They will remain a memory for me of the beautiful days we had here.”
Some accused rebels of looting their homes. Smaller crowds made the journey Friday.
Others rushed to the area of Bustan al-Diwan, gathering to pray around the grave of an elderly, beloved Dutch priest who was shot to death in April in a rebel-held part of Homs.
Father Francis Van Der Lugt, 75, was a Jesuit, the same order as Pope Francis. His death underscored fears among many of Syria’s Christian and Muslim minorities for the fate of their communities as Islamic extremists gain influence among rebels seeking to topple Assad.
“I came to pray on his grave,” said Rasim Sayrafi, 40. “The father was a secular man who walked with Muslims and Christians, together and equally. I am here to remember that.”

Search for missing ferry passengers put on hold
","Bad weather and the deterioration of internal partitions in a sunken ferry are hampering the search for those still missing in the disaster, South Korean officials said on Saturday.
More than three weeks after the ferry sank, 29 passengers remain missing, with 275 bodies recovered so far, most of them high school students.
Internal partitions in the ferry have become waterlogged and started to bend, said government task force spokesman Ko Myung-seok. Coast guard officials said this can prevent divers from entering different parts of the ferry.
Mr. Ko also said divers were unable to carry out underwater searches Saturday because of bad weather.
Search teams took advantage of improved weather this past week, but later were hampered by strong currents and floating debris inside the ship. A civilian diver fell unconscious while searching and died on Tuesday.
Only 172 people survived the April 16 disaster. Most of the passengers were students from a high school south of Seoul.
All 15 surviving crew members involved in the ferry’s navigation have been arrested on suspicion of negligence and failing to protect passengers. Besides possible freight problems, prosecutors say they are looking into other factors, such as the turn made during the time the ship began listing, ocean currents and modifications made to the ship.
On Friday, Kim Han-sik, head of Chonghaejin Marine Co. Ltd., which owns the sunken ferry, was arrested after investigators raised suspicions that improper stowage and overloading of cargo might have contributed to the accident. Mr. Kim is facing allegations that he was aware that the ferry exceeded its cargo limit but didn’t do anything to stop it from leaving port, according to prosecutors.

Paul VI, who reigned as pontiff from 1963—1978, made landmark progress in improving Catholics’ relationship with other Christians. His papacy is also remembered by his decision, after years of study, to ban contraception for Catholics, in a 1968 encyclical, “Humanae Vitae” (“of human life“).
That teaching was widely disregarded. The issue is among many expected to get scrutiny in a special meeting of bishops called at the Vatican this fall to discuss family life. The beatification ceremony would come at the end of the gathering.
One ‘miracle’ is required for beatification. The Vatican, as is its custom, didn’t give details about the ‘miracle’ which, according to the Holy See’s detailed criteria, must be certified by doctors as having no medical explanation.
Italian media have reported that the ‘miracle’ was that of a baby born healthy in California despite the diagnoses in 2001 of the rupture of the foetal bladder and absence of amniotic liquid. The mother reportedly ignored advice to abort the child and prayed for Paul VI’s intercession at the urging of a nun. The child was born a month prematurely and is now a healthy adolescent, the news reports said.
The 1968 encyclical also reinforced the church’s ban on abortion.
Paul VI disposed of many of the ornate trappings of the papacy, a forerunner of Francis’ disdain for fanciness at the Vatican.
The late pontiff continued John XXIII’s groundbreaking move to modernize the church by shepherding to its conclusion the Second Vatican Council.

Red Cross workers released in Ukraine
","Nine Red Cross workers were released on Saturday by pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine, a day after the eight Ukrainians and one Swiss national were detained, the aid group said.
“Now they will take up their humanitarian work and prepare a medical evaluation,” International Committee of the Red Cross spokesman David Pierre Marquet said.
Their capture in the volatile eastern province of Donetsk occurred as security forces clashed with armed pro-Russian separatists in the port city of Mariupol near the Russian border.
Local authorities said seven people were killed and about 50 injured.
The government in Kiev said security forces killed about 20 pro-Russian militants.
Kiev has sent in forces in a bid to reassert control of the restive east, inflaming the pro-Russian faction. On Saturday, the National Guard withdrew from central Mariupol, which was largely calm.
About 3 million residents of Donetsk and the province of Luhansk have been asked to vote Sunday on whether they want to stay part of Ukraine.
The vote comes after a March referendum organized by pro-Russian authorities in Crimea led to its annexation by Moscow.
That vote has not been recognized by Kiev or internationally.
Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday visited the Crimean port Sevastapol to mark the anniversary of the 1945 Soviet victory over Nazi Germany.
The government in Kiev, NATO and the United States condemned his visit as a provocation.

Philippines to probe diplomat charged with human trafficking
","The Philippines is investigating a Filipino diplomat who has been charged with human trafficking in Canada for allegedly exploiting her nanny, a foreign ministry spokesman said on Saturday.
“The Department of Foreign Affairs takes very seriously any allegations of misconduct of its employees,” spokesman Charles Jose said, adding that it is cooperating with Canadian authorities through the Philippine embassy in Ottawa.
Canadian federal police announced Friday the filing of human-trafficking charges against Buenaflor Cruz, a former cultural officer at the embassy, and her husband, Robert.
Robert Cruz was also charged with threatening bodily harm and mischief.
The charges stemmed from third-party complaints that the couple was exploiting a 26-year-old nanny they brought into Canada legally as a domestic worker.
Police alleged that the couple exploited the woman for financial and material benefits and held her by withholding or destroying her documents from July 2009 to December last year.
The investigation was launched in December when the nanny was also rescued.
Mr. Jose said Buenaflor Cruz has been reassigned to Manila as part of the department’s normal rotation.

North Korea on the verge of another nuclear test
","North Korea issued its latest nuclear threat on Saturday, two days after South Korea’s defence minister said Pyongyang was making final preparations to conduct its fourth nuclear test.
North Korea has “clarified its resolute stand that it would take countermeasures including nuclear test to protect the sovereignty and dignity of the country”, the North’s official Korean Central News Agency reported, citing the ruling party’s Rodong Sinmun newspaper.
The Institute for Science and International Security think tank said in a report on Saturday that satellite imagery from Friday showed ongoing activities at North Korea’s nuclear test site, including movement of possible vehicles, trucks and containers. The think tank said the exact timing of a test was difficult to tell.
On Thursday, South Korean Defence Minister Kim Kwan-jin said that North Korea was making final preparations to conduct its fourth nuclear test. Mr. Kim, however, said it could be a bluff and did not elaborate on what the final step of the North’s preparations would be. Seoul has warned that Pyongyang would face serious consequences if it conducts a nuclear test.
A fourth test would mark another defiant response to U.S.-led international pressure on North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons program. The North conducted nuclear tests in 2006, 2009 and 2013.
Recent months have seen animosities flare up on the Korean Peninsula, with Pyongyang conducting a barrage of rocket and missile tests and resuming fierce rhetoric against Seoul and Washington.
In late March, in a show of defiance to the U.N. Security Council’s denouncing of Pyongyang’s rocket-launching drills, North Korea’s Foreign Ministry said the country was “fully ready for next-stage steps which the enemy can hardly imagine” and that “it would not rule out a new form of nuclear test for bolstering up its nuclear deterrence.”
The two Koreas have been divided along the world’s most heavily armed border since the 1950-53 Korean War ended with an armistice, not a peace treaty.

Sri Lanka seizes ammunition
","Just as Sri Lanka readies to observe ‘Victory Day’ to commemorate the end of its brutal war in 2009, its Navy said it has seized a large stock of pistol ammunition, reportedly belonging to the LTTE, in the country’s Northern Province.
Sri Lankan Navy spokesman, Commander Kosala Warnakulasuriya, said based on intelligence reports, Navy officials on Friday found at least one lakh bullets near Mullaitivu, the largest seizure after the end of the bloody war.
The Navy has found the stock at a time when the Sri Lankan government is voicing concern over the possible revival of the LTTE, a claim bolstered by a U.S. State Department report that said that financial networks supporting the LTTE were active all through 2013.
“In this particular case, we have not established any link between the ammunition found and the possible revival of the LTTE,” army spokesman Ruwan Wanigasuriya told The Hindu.
It is that time of the year when Sri Lanka’s Buddhist majority prepares for Vesak (in India, Buddha Purnima), falling on May 14. Colombo streets are beginning to sport lanterns in light shades, a common sight this time of the year. It is also that time of the year when the Sri Lankan armed forces celebrates its victory in the war it waged against the rebel Tigers.
The Army is preparing for what it calls ‘Victory Day parade’ to be held in Matara, along the island nation’s southern coast. Simultaneously, some sections residing in the country’s primarily Tamil-speaking north pay tributes to civilians who were killed in Mullivaikkal during the final days of the war.
However, teachers and students of Jaffna University recently held a protest to condemn an anonymous notice pasted around their campus that warned of consequences should any such commemoration be observed on campus. The University too, according to a circular issued by its registrar, is to remain closed after the Vesak break, until May 21, something that students and teachers perceive as a deliberate measure to prevent any remembrance.
When contacted by The Hindu, Jaffna security forces commander Udaya Perera said: “We have issued no instruction to the university regarding closure.”

Dr Shakil Afridi’s lawyer backs off from case
","Threats to his life from unidentified persons have resulted in Samiullah Afridi, who played a leading role as a lawyer for Dr Shakil Afridi to back off from the case.
Samiullah Afridi told The Hindu on the phone from Peshawar on Saturday that some days ago a few people had come and threatened him and said they would attach a magnetic bomb to his car if he continued with the case.
Dr Shakil Afridi was sentenced to 33 years in jail for his links with a banned terror group Lashkar i Islam in 2012 though he was suspected of helping the CIA track down Osama Bin Laden in Abbotabad under cover as part of a polio immunization programme in 2011. In March his sentence was commuted by ten years.
Mr. Samiullah has been his lawyer along with a group of others but he said he has been receiving threats since the time he took up the case two years ago. He was planning to file a fresh plea for a re-trial before the FATA tribunal but now it would done by other lawyers.
He said he had fought threats to his life for a long time but there was a deadline set by those who were threatening him and he had to leave the case. “When I took up the defence for Dr Afridi, no one was willing to touch the matter and I persisted despite so many dangers to my life,” he said. Now, he said the situation didn’t permit him to continue with the case. In March the Frontier Crimes Regulation Commissioner Munir Azam in response to demands for a retrial had directed the political agent of Khyber Agency to further adduce evidence in consultation with concerned intelligence agencies and prepare a case against Dr Afridi to be filed in a competent court of law.
The political agent was directed to examine Dr Afridi's involvement in activities against the state in collaboration with foreign intelligence agencies. In a detailed order Mr. Azam said there was ample evidence collected by the Joint Interrogation Team against Dr Afridi regarding his involvement in activities against the state. He said the trial court has not dilated upon these citing reasons of want of jurisdiction and had recommended that the Dr Afridi may be produced before the relevant court for further proceedings under the law.

Burns urges Pakistan to deny militant groups safe haven
","US deputy secretary of state William J Burns on Friday urged Pakistan Prime Minister Muhammed Nawaz Sharif to sustain pressure on militant groups, deny them a safe-haven and prevent cross-border attacks.
In a statement issued by the US state department late last night, Mr. Burns said countering cross-border militancy and shutting down safe havens is critical not only for Pakistan’s long-term peace and prosperity, but also for positive relations between Pakistan and all its neighbours, including Afghanistan.
“We appreciate Pakistan’s efforts to further Afghan-led reconciliation and we remain hopeful that we will conclude a Bilateral Security Agreement later this year that will enable us to continue to train, advise, and assist Afghan forces and go after the remnants of core al-Qaeda. This is deeply in our interest and in the interest of Afghanistan, Pakistan, and the rest of South and Central Asia,” he said.
This is not the first time that the US has asked Pakistan to dismantle safe havens for militants. US secretary of defence Chuck Hagel during a visit to Pakistan last December reviewed shared concerns with the Pakistani leadership regarding the activities of terrorist groups, including the Haqqani network, on Pakistani territory.
During his visit, Mr. Burns met Mr. Sharif, apart from the Finance Minister Ishaq Dar, Interior Minister Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan, Advisor to the Prime Minister for National Security and Foreign Policy Sartaj Aziz, Special Assistant to the Prime Minister Tariq Fatemi, Chief of Army Staff General Raheel Sharif and Foreign Secretary Aizaz Ahmad Chaudhry.
He also stressed that President Obama remains firmly committed to the shared goal of a stable, secure, and prosperous Pakistan. After some difficult years, the relationship between the US and Pakistan is on a positive trajectory, he pointed out, adding that it was a trajectory which the US hoped to not only maintain, but accelerate. He said Prime Minister Sharif and Finance Minister Dar have undertaken courageous economic reforms, and concrete steps to expand regional economic linkages, including with India. “As Pakistan’s partner, we will do our part to be as supportive as we can. We’ve already made a number of strategic investments that have contributed to Pakistan’s economic growth, from funding the construction and rehabilitation of nearly 900 kilometers of roads to nearly $900 million in energy sector assistance which will add 1400 MW to Pakistan’s power grid by the end of 2014,” he said.
He said that militancy continues to threaten Pakistan’s revival. Few countries have paid a heavier price than Pakistan in the fight against extremism. He also said he had the opportunity to emphasize the strong commitment to, and support for, a free and responsible press here in Pakistan and around the world, according to the statement.

Police to file charge sheet against FBI agent by May 19
","A court on Saturday asked the police to submit a formal charge sheet by May 19 against the FBI agent arrested for carrying bullets and a knife at Karachi airport.
Reports said the session’s judge in Karachi granted more time for the police after they made a request. The FBI agent Joel Cox Eugene was arrested by airport security officials for carrying 9 mm calibre bullets, a magazine and a knife. He was to board a flight from Karachi to Islamabad. He was released on a surety of Rs one million on Thursday.
Earlier, the ministry of foreign affairs clarified that he did not enjoy diplomatic immunity. At the weekly briefing on Thursday, spokesperson Ms Tasnim Aslam said that the matter is under investigation and the Karachi police officials have already given some preliminary details. The agent who was remanded to judicial custody was released on bail on Thursday.
Further investigations are ongoing, Ms Aslam said and he was not a diplomat and therefore, had no immunity. “He is here on a short term visit visa and his visa is valid. Since the investigations are still continuing, I would not venture into speculations,” she said. “The US authorities are in contact with us both in Washington and in Islamabad. Consular access was requested and it was granted. That’s where the matter stands at the moment. He was not here under any agreement. He came for temporary duty at the Embassy,” she pointed out.
On the question of whether diplomats are allowed to carry weapons, she said she would have to check with the Protocol Division. “But I don’t think that diplomats are supposed to carry weapons,” she added.

","Close on the heels of the visit of Iran’s interior minister, Prime Minister Muhammed Nawaz Sharif will undertake an official visit to Iran from May 11 to 12 on an invitation from President Hassan Rouhani, according to an official statement on Saturday.
Of late there have been tensions between the two countries on the issue of the kidnapping of the border guards from Iran. Several steps were decided including the setting up of hotlines to smoothen coordination between the security agencies of the two countries during the Iranian interior minister’s visit earlier this week. There is also the issue of the Iran Pakistan gas pipeline which has been stuck due to US sanctions. Pakistan will have to pay a fine of $ 3 million a day if it doesn’t construct its side of the pipeline by December 2014, which has not even started so far even though the design is in place.
Mr. Sharif’s visit will be the first top leadership level visit since the formation of new governments in the two countries. A high-ranking delegation including Adviser to the Prime Minister on National Security and Foreign Affairs, Minister for Finance, Revenue, Economic Affairs, Statistics and Privatization, Minister for Petroleum and Natural Resources, Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Foreign Affairs and Chief Minister, Balochistan, will accompany the Prime Minister.
Mr. Sharif’s engagements in Tehran include a bilateral meeting with President Rouhani and he will also call on Ayatollah Ali Khamenai. The meeting will give the two sides an opportunity to review the entire spectrum of bilateral relations as well as regional and international developments of mutual interest, the statement said.
Special focus will be attached to strengthening economic ties between Pakistan and Iran. In this context, the existing potential of bilateral trade would be reinforced through initiatives aimed at enhancing physical connectivity between the sides. A number of agreements on cooperation in various fields will be signed during the visit.

Sri Lanka to implement U.N. demands except international probe
","President Mahinda Rajapaksa has said Sri Lanka is in the process of implementing all demands made by the sponsors of the UNHRC resolution against it except for allowing an international probe into alleged human rights violations during the last phase of the war with the LTTE.
The assertion was made by the Sri Lankan President during a meeting on Friday with Seiji Kihara, Japan’s Parliamentary Vice Minister for Foreign Affairs.
Mr. Rajapaksa told the Japanese Minister, “Please tell this truth to rest of the world. Except for an international inquiry we are in the process of implementing all other demands made by sponsors of the Resolution.”
The President’s office quoted Mr. Kihara as saying that the UNHRC resolution was unhelpful to Sri Lanka.
“We considered whether the Resolution on Sri Lanka moved in the U.N. Human Rights Council in Geneva would help Sri Lanka. We decided it will not. That is why we abstained when the vote was taken,” Mr. Kihara was quoted as saying.
“We are not ready to accept biased reports prepared by international bodies. We are confident that Sri Lanka is capable of solving its problems one by one. What is needed is to engage the international community,” he said.
Japan along with India was one of the 12 countries which abstained in the UNHRC vote in Geneva in March.
The U.S.-sponsored resolution was adopted with 24 countries voting in favour.
The resolution demanded the setting up of an international investigation into alleged war crimes in Sri Lanka during the last phase of the nearly three decades-long conflict with the LTTE.
Sri Lanka has vowed not to cooperate with the investigation.
Meanwhile, a nationalist organisation demanded that Sri Lanka should not allow the officials of the U.N. Human Rights Commissioner Navi Pillay into the country to carry out the international investigation.
“We ask the government what their stand on this.They must never be allowed into the country,” Dr. Gunadasa Amarasekera of the Nationalist Organisation Collective said.

ANC emerges winner as South Africa completes vote count
","South Africa’s election commission completed a vote count that confirms the ruling African National Congress as the winner but also shows the strengthening of prominent opposition groups, according to results on Saturday. The government said the election and its aftermath had gone smoothly, despite some scattered delays and disruptions, and an outbreak of street violence in a poor area of Johannesburg.
With all 22,000 voting districts counted, the African National Congress had 62.15 per cent of the vote, several per centage points lower than its result in 2009 elections, the election commission said on its website. The main opposition party, the Democratic Alliance, won 22.23 per cent of the vote, an increase of more than 5 per cent from 2009. The Economic Freedom Fighters, a new party that wants to distribute national resources to the poor, won 6.35 per cent.
Voter turnout was 73 per cent of the 25 million South Africans, or half the population, who registered for the national and provincial elections.
In a key race, the ruling party won Gauteng, South Africa’s most populous province and its economic centre, by about 53 per cent, but that was a drop of 10 per cent from its performance in the 2009 vote. The Democratic Alliance came second in Gauteng, which includes Johannesburg, with nearly 31 per cent and the Economic Freedom Fighters won 10 per cent.
Once led by Nelson Mandela, the African National Congress campaigned on a record of promoting democratic freedoms and providing basic services to millions of South Africans since the end of white minority rule in 1994. Its reputation has been tarnished by the 2012 killing of several dozen protesters by police during labour unrest and a scandal involving more than $20 million in state spending on the private home of President Jacob Zuma, but its relatively solid showing reflected the resilience of its nationwide support.
The Democratic Alliance, which has centrist policies and campaigned on a platform of more jobs and curbs on corruption, has expanded its influence beyond its stronghold in the Western Cape, one of South Africa’s nine provinces.
The election was mostly peaceful, but police on Saturday warned the public to stay away from areas of Alexandra, a poor township that is part of Johannesburg, after overnight unrest linked to allegations by opposition groups that vote-rigging had occurred.
About 60 people involved in violent protests have been arrested since Friday, the South African Press Association quoted police as saying.
Protests periodically break out in poor urban areas of South Africa where residents complain that government help is insufficient and they have been marginalised. President Zuma has said he will accelerate the provision of basic services to those who lack them in his new administration.

U.S. divided on prospect of Modi-led India
","A few weeks ago, American cable television viewers had a moment of epiphany when British comedian and host of HBO’s ‘Last Week Tonight’ John Oliver lambasted them for their ignorance of the “biggest election in human history,” going on in India, whose results will be known on May 16.
While Mr. Oliver’s observations may hold true for a large segment of the U.S. media and its viewership, three broad constituencies in America are likely to be tracking the ongoing polls closely -- the Obama administration’s State Department, Trade Representative and Chambers of Commerce; private sector corporations engaged in bilateral trade and investment; and an eclectic constellation of human rights advocacy groups.
With an important component of the U.S.-India relationship at stake for each of these observers, they must all be pondering the same question: if, as numerous polls predict, >Gujarat Chief Minister and BJP leader >Narendra Modi becomes Prime Minister, what will that mean for the bilateral relationship?
For the economic wing of the Obama White House recent months of engagement with India have been bruising. Trade disputes in every sector from pharmaceuticals to solar panels have plagued the dialogue between Washington and New Delhi to the point where private frustrations have given way to public outpourings.
Last month the U.S. Trade Representative came perilously close -- although it ultimately desisted -- to labelling India a ‘priority foreign country’ in its Special 301 report on trading partners deploying discriminatory economic measures in international commerce. To describe the current status quo as one of deep disenchantment would not be an exaggeration.
U.S. businesses have had the wind knocked out of their sails by the stalled progress on the civil nuclear deal, the failed attempt to win a fighter jet contract, and are now fearful of losing market share owing to Indian courts’ backing of compulsory licensing measures.
These constituents are likely to be hoping that the new government that will take charge in New Delhi in the coming weeks will breathe fresh air into trade and investment reform in favour of a more accessible, less bureaucratically-stymied policy environment, attributes that are widely associated with Mr. Modi’s governance in his home state.
With regard to the U.S. State Department and India’s Ministry of External Affairs, some argue that l’affair Khobragade, the diplomatic crisis that engulfed ties between the since last December have led to more “realism” and a “reset” in the relationship.
Yet there is also a continuing sense of disappointment on both sides that the other party is speaking orthogonally -- whether in terms of India’s shock at having a top female diplomat strip-searched by U.S. Marshals or the American diplomatic establishment’s disbelief that security barriers around its Embassy in New Delhi were removed in retaliation -- and it is unclear to Washington whether some of the cultural elements embedded within such misunderstandings will disappear if Mr. Modi takes over.
A lengthy laundry list of politically difficult issues will ensure that certain measure of tension continues in the bilateral engagement, even with a dynamic Mr. Modi at the helm.
The U.S. Congress’ long-delayed passage of comprehensive immigration reform may impose debilitating costs on H-1B visa applicants, the majority being Indian IT majors, and partisan bickering in both the Senate and House of Representatives has led to many members of Congress, wary of mid-term elections in November, digging in their heels.
India has also not seen eye-to-eye with the U.S. in international forums, for example at the United Nations on Syria, Ukraine and Sri Lanka.
This election-year focus on domestic constituencies has also led to unexpected voices leveraging disproportionate influence on Capitol Hill and within the administration, and will affect one of the top issue in U.S.-India ties under Mr. Modi: his revoked visa.
In 2005 Mr. Modi applied for but was denied a “diplomatic visa” under 214(b) of the U.S. Immigration and Nationality Act and his existing tourist/business visa was revoked under Section 212 (a)(2)(g) of the Act.
Under the latter, foreign government officials are considered ineligible for a visa if the State Department views them as “responsible for, or directly carried out, at any time, particularly severe violations of religious freedom.”
Despite many prominent political and corporate leaders, including Chicago businessman Shallabh Kumar who led a delegation of Congressmen to meet Mr. Modi in Gujarat last year, petitioning for a reversal of this decision, no change in policy has happened until now owing in part to persistent counter-lobbying by groups such as the Coalition Against Genocide, the Indian American Muslim Council and the Congress-backed U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom.
These groups continue to be animated by concerns, no doubt exacerbated in recent months by the communal conflagrations in Muzaffarnagar and incendiary comments by Amit Shah and even Mr. Modi on Bengali Muslims as “infiltrators,” that ultra-conservative Hindutva elements, including from the RSS, may influence Mr. Modi’s political outlook when he is in power.
They have accordingly urged that religious freedom be included as a core element of the U.S.-India Strategic Dialogue.
Yet there is little doubt in official or think-tank circles in Washington that only one outcome is possible in this regard: if Mr. Modi becomes Prime Minister, that fact by itself, independent of all allegations of his complicity in human rights violations, will necessarily require the State Department to allow him entry onto U.S. soil.
Last month a Congresssional report confirmed, “If Narendra Modi were to become Prime Minister of India, he would automatically be eligible for an A-1 (diplomatic) visa as head of state, regardless of the purpose of his visit.”
That they may acquire additional justification for this step based on the Indian Supreme Court’s ruling absolving him of complicity in the rioting will assuage some, but not all, voices of protest.

ASEAN meet: leaders to raise concerns about China
","South East Asian leaders will express concerns about Chinese aggression in the South China Sea at their regional summit Sunday, Indonesia’s foreign minister said.
An agreement to include a statement on China’s use of water cannon on Vietnamese vessels was reached at a pre-summit meeting of the foreign ministers of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) in Naypyitaw on Saturday. “We discussed it at length and there was a consensus among ASEAN foreign ministers to issue a statement on the recent developments in the South China Sea,” Marty Natalegawa said. Myanmar will host the ASEAN Summit for the first time since it joined the 10-nation bloc in 1997.
The meetings, held twice a year, end with declarations on regional issues such as economic integration and common security concerns.
The Philippines and Vietnam are lobbying this year for a strong statement from ASEAN against aggression in the South China Sea.
China this week relocated a deep-water drilling rig in waters claimed by Vietnam, and allegedly used water cannon to scatter Vietnamese patrol vessels, injuring six people.
Several countries have territorial disputes with Beijing over sovereignty claims to the sea, petroleum reserves and rights to fishing grounds.
Myanmar, as host this year, will play a crucial role in setting the tone of the final ASEAN statement on China. There were concerns that it might take a conciliatory approach to its giant neighbour, which is also its main foreign investor.
“China is not only the big friend of Myanmar, but China is also the biggest trading partner of most ASEAN countries. So China’s peaceful rise is important for the whole ASEAN region,” said Ye Htut, spokesman for Myanmar President Thein Sein.
But Mr. Natalegawa dismissed fears that the host was predisposed to favour China on the maritime issues.
“I think what was most important to note was how quickly the ASEAN ministers recognized that this development was something that must be responded to with a certain degree of urgency,” he said.
ASEAN has been pushing for a regional agreement with Beijing that includes a commitment to a peaceful solution to their territorial disputes, respect for international law and signing a Code of Conduct in the disputed areas.
It is seen as a test for ASEAN unity, in the face of Beijing’s growing political and economic clout in the region.
China was one of the few countries that stood by Myanmar when it was under military junta rule between 1988 and 2010, and propped it up during years of Western economic sanctions.

Ousted Thailand PM supporters rally in show of force
","Supporters of Thailand’s embattled government began streaming into western Bangkok for a show of force on Saturday that follows Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra’s ouster and a renewed push by demonstrators to install an unelected premier.
The gathering of the pro-government movement took place a day after anti-government protesters who have been campaigning for six months to remove Ms. Yingluck from office ramped up their efforts by laying siege to television stations, surrounding state offices, and demanding lawmakers help them install a non-elected prime minister by Monday.
Jatuporn Prompan, who heads the pro-government Red Shirts staging the rally, said that “as long as the country’s democracy is not safe, we will be here”.
Ms. Yingluck was forced from power in a controversial ruling by the Constitutional Court that emboldened anti-government protesters. They called for a “final push” on Friday to oust the entire Cabinet and set up an unelected “people’s council” they say would implement still-undefined reforms to combat corruption and fight money politics. They oppose polls tentatively scheduled for July, which the current ruling party would likely win.
Police fired tear gas and water cannons on Friday to push back hundreds of protesters who attempted to force their way into the government’s security agency. Six people were reported injured.
The competing rallies were being held several dozen kilometres apart, but still raised concerns about violence. Mr. Jatuporn said “each side should take care of their own supporters” and avoid confrontation.
The Cabinet last week named deputy premier Niwattumrong Boonsongpaisan as acting Prime Minister. But protest leader Suthep Thaugsuban told followers on Friday night that the Senate should select a new premier immediately, since the lower house has been dissolved since December.
“This matter must end by Monday,” Mr. Suthep warned, saying the protesters were ready to take over the offices of the Prime Minister themselves. “If it’s not finished by then, we’ll do it ourselves.”
Mr. Jatuporn warned that if there’s a coup or an unelected Prime Minister is installed, the Red Shirts will “escalate our fight immediately.” The pro-government movement has not said what action it will take, but Mr. Jatuporn said it would be peaceful and they “do not wish to see people killed or hurt along the way”.
The protesters achieved a partial victory on Wednesday when the Constitutional Court ousted Ms. Yingluck, saying she had violated the constitution by transferring a senior civil servant to benefit her politically powerful family. Nine other Cabinet members were also forced from their posts.
Thailand’s long-running political crisis began in 2006 when Ms. Yingluck’s brother, former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, was toppled by a military coup after being accused of corruption, abuse of power and disrespect for King Bhumibol Adulyadej.
Mr. Thaksin, a former telecommunications billionaire, remains highly popular among the rural poor in the north and northeast, and parties controlled by him have won every national election since 2001. The protesters, aligned with the opposition Democrat Party, say they want to remove all traces of his political machine from politics.

U.S. senators against export of natural gas to India, China
","A bi-partisan group of 22 American senators have expressed reservation on the export of natural gas to Asian countries such as India and China, arguing that such a move by Obama Administration would result in an increase in cost for consumers and businesses at home.
“Natural gas prices in Asia are currently three to four times higher than those in the U.S. Integration of U.S. and Asian natural gas markets through U.S. exports could lead to further increases in prices for American consumers and businesses, which may fundamentally reverse many of the economic benefits that have led to the current surge in manufacturing job growth in the U.S.,” the senators said in a letter to Mr. Obama.
They said the “large-scale exports of natural gas to Asia could also jeopardize America’s goal of achieving energy independence, a goal made more achievable by the recent increase in domestic gas production”.
The senators urged Mr. Obama to consider the impacts on American manufacturing and families that rely on natural gas.
In the letter released to the press on Friday, they pointed to the hundreds of thousands of American manufacturing jobs created in the last few years, in part because of low natural gas prices.
“Families and businesses depend on affordable and reliable supplies of natural gas. This winter many parts of the country faced tight supplies of propane and natural gas and families were left to face high energy bills... Taking a longer-term view, the United States has benefited from rising supplies and lower prices for natural gas since 2008.”
“Thanks in part to lower natural gas prices, America’s manufacturing sector has created more than 600,000 jobs since 2010. The Boston Consulting Group concluded that affordable natural gas prices could lead to 5 million more manufacturing jobs by the end of the decade.
“We must ensure that we do not squander what is clearly an American competitive advantage right now for American manufacturers and for the American economy,” they said.
The senators said that the recent approval for export of liquefied natural gas from a sixth export facility has meant that the total approved exports now exceeds the amount of gas currently being used in every single American home and commercial business.
The exports well exceeds the high export scenario referenced by a Department of Energy study in 2012 that indicated prices could increase by up to 54 per cent, the senators said, adding that it would translate into more than $60 billion a year in higher energy costs for American consumers and businesses, they said.

South Sudan leaders reach ceasefire
","South Sudan’s President has reached a ceasefire agreement with a rebel leader, an African regional bloc said on Friday, after a vicious cycle of revenge killings drew international alarm.
The deal means “an immediate cessation of hostilities within 24 hours of the signing” and “unhindered humanitarian access” to all people affected by the months-long conflict, said a statement by the political bloc known as IGAD, which is mediating the conflict.
Ethnically targeted violence in the world’s youngest country broke out in December, killing thousands of people and forcing more than 1.3 million to flee their homes. The U.N. Security Council has expressed “horror” at recent killings of civilians.
U.S. National Security Adviser Susan Rice welcomed the peace agreement in a statement, saying it “holds the promise of bringing the crisis to an end”.
A ceasefire in January between South Sudan President Salva Kiir and rebel leader Riek Machar fell apart within days.
Ms. Rice urged that Mr. Kiir and Mr. Machar follow up on the new peace deal signed in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, by “ending the violence and negotiating in good faith to reach a political agreement”.
Friday’s meeting in Addis Ababa was the first face-to-face encounter between Mr. Kiir and Mr. Machar since the mass violence began, and it came a week after U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry met with Mr. Kiir to urge a revitalization of peace talks.
Mr. Kiir and Mr. Machar have agreed to establish a “transitional government of national unity” that will lead to new elections, the IGAD statement said. The two also agreed to meet again in a month, while IGAD leads talks on the terms of the transition.
“We look forward to the next summit which we hope will further solidify today’s gains,” Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta, who has helped with the talks, said in a statement late on Friday.
The South Sudan deal comes after weeks of growing international concern.
U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said during a visit to South Sudan this week that the country has seen serious human rights violations. A new U.N. report said gross violations of human rights and international humanitarian law have been committed.
Much of the violence has been ethnic in nature and carried out by troops loyal to Mr. Kiir, an ethnic Dinka, and rebels loyal to former Vice-President Mr. Machar, an ethnic Nuer.
International pressure had been growing for at least a brief ceasefire to allow residents to plant their fields, with the U.N. and aid groups warning that if crops aren’t planted this month, the country could face mass hunger or famine. Tens of thousands of civilians already have been taking refuge in U.N. compounds across the country for months.
The Security Council in recent days discussed sanctions, an arms embargo and a referral of the South Sudan situation to the International Criminal Court as ways to apply pressure on the warring sides.
South Sudan is a largely Christian nation that broke off from the Muslim-dominated Sudan after a 2011 referendum. The fighting is an embarrassment to the U.S., which has provided hundreds of millions of dollars in aid and has been its strongest international champion.

Texas city to get life-size statue of Gandhiji
","A life-size bronze statue of Mahatma Gandhi would be installed in Irving in Texas, fulfilling a long-cherished dream of Indian-Americans living in the city. A 7-foot tall and 30-inch wide bronze statue of Gandhiji, cast in Andhra Pradesh, will be installed on a 6-foot tall pedestal.
It will have a granite wall as a backdrop, inscribed with Gandhiji’s memorable words, as well as those from Martin Luther King Jr., Nelson Mandela and Albert Einstein, Barack Obama and others. The ground breaking ceremony last week for the ‘Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Plaza’ in Thomas Jefferson Park was the result of the dedication of numerous Indian-American organizations that have been working for the project.
