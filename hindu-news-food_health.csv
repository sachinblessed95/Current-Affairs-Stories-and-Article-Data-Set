A whiff of Goa in Green Park "," There is nothing quite like nostalgia, as I often say. I felt the magic of old memories one evening a couple of weeks ago when I went to meet two old friends, in a restaurant that I had first visited long years ago. I ate food that I always associate with leisure and fun. The amps belted out the unlikely combination of the Doors and Boney M. All put together, it turned the evening into a memorable one.
Okay, let’s start at the beginning. The friends in question are two great food lovers and chefs — Crescentia Scolt Fernandes and Chrysologus. I met them long years ago when I was going past Meharchand Market one day, and suddenly spotted a restaurant that served Goan food.
On the ground floor was a tent house, and on the first floor was Bernardo’s. I met the two owners, struck a chord, ate a grand meal, and followed them with great interest as they moved from Meharchand to Chittaranjan Park to Gurugram.
I always wanted to visit them again, but Gurugram was much too far for me. Then, recently, they got in touch with me and said that they were collaborating with this happening restaurant called Turquoise Cottage (TC).
I remember TC because many years ago, when restaurants were still opening up in Delhi, it had made a name for itself for its food, music and media nights. The restaurant was in Adchini those days, and is now in Green Park, And every weekend, on Saturdays and Sundays, Crescentia and Chrysologus are there with their special Goan dishes.
They know about my fondness for pork, so there was this delicious smoked Goan sausage dish with pao to begin with. Cres and Chrys make their own sausages (which they also sell), and this was spicy and smoky – and simply superb. One pork dish is never enough, so there was a plate of pork chilli fry, too — strips of succulent pork stir fried with onions, potatoes, chillies and spices. The pork was melt-in-the-mouth soft, with just the right amount of fat dripping from it, and I had a great time mopping up the fat with a bit of the pao, and listening to what they now call retro music. 
You cannot have Goan food and not have seafood. So we had something called Rissois de camarao – which is essentially a Portuguese dish of gujiya-like pastries stuffed with shrimp and other seafood, deep fried. With a casing of flour and bread crumbs and a minced shrimp stuffing, it was a delicious starter. The cammarao recheado was a dish of prawns stuffed with spicy tangy masala made with red chillies and toddy vinegar.
I thought I couldn’t eat another crumb by then, but decided I had to try out something that wasn’t pork or seafood. So we zeroed in on the chicken cafreal, a dish that had surprised me no end during my Goa visits – because I didn’t think I would get wowed by chicken. But the cafreal appeals to me because of the spices and the subtle flavours of coriander. Shallow fried, it allows the meat to trap the juices and the flavours well.
Sweet ending 
I ended the meal with some bebinca – a Goan-Portuguese dish prepared with coconut milk, flour and eggs – and some vanilla ice cream, and thought what a lovely evening it was. I was with old friends who were passionate about food. My kind of music was playing – well, blaring out would be more appropriate – on the terrace where we sat. Cres and Chrys, who were far away from me, had come closer. What else could one ask for?

Heritage in every grain
","Nel Jayaraman, Tamil Nadu State Coordinator of the Save Our Rice Campaign, stood tall, unmindful of the heat, greeting people and keeping an eye on the preparations. The 12th annual Nel Thiruvizha brought together thousands of paddy farmers from around Tamil Nadu and a few from neighbouring states as well. The wedding hall in Thiruthuraipoondi was a sea of colour with farmers in white veshti and shirt with a bright green thundu thrown over their shoulder, and the women in bright saris. Youth volunteers were everywhere — managing logistics, serving food and water and manning the registration desk. 




There were speakers, microphones, cameras, lights and speeches wherever one turned.
People who came early were witness to the rally that began from the centre of Thiruthiraipoondi town. A handsome Kangeyam calf was led out, followed by a bullock cart with vegetables, fruits and other crops, a basket made of straw, plastered with cow dung and filled with paddy seeds alongside a photo of agricultural scientist and environmental activist Nammalwar. The idea was to create awareness about traditional food and seeds. The seeds were brought in and placed reverently in front of the hall, signalling the beginning of the Nel Thiruvizha, organised by the Save Our Rice Campaign and other groups. 
The thiruvizha has become an integral part of the agriculture calendar of Tamil Nadu farmers. It is no longer an event by Save Our Rice alone. It has become a public event with local people from in and around Thiruthuraipoondi and Thiruvaroor participating in large numbers and paddy farmers coming from all corners of the state. 




An enclosure with 12 tonnes of seed was the focal point of the meeting. The thiruvizha is the high point of the year and sharing these seeds is sacrosanct. Jayaraman reeled off facts and figures, “We were ready with 12 tonnes of seeds across 164 traditional paddy varieties. We multiplied large quantities of Karuppu Kauni, Mappilai Samba, Jeeraga Samba, Thuyamalli, Poongar, Kullakar, Kichadi Samba and Kuzhiyadichan. By the end of the second day, approximately 11.5 tonnes of paddy seeds were distributed to 5742 farmers. Farmers also returned around 3.5 tonnes of seeds. This is a system of barter based on honour. We give each farmer two kilos of seed; they bring double the quantity back the next year. Almost 60 per cent do this. Many share the seeds with their neighbours leading to a multiplier effect. Every farmer signs a pledge that he/she will grow the seeds though organic methods.”
Farmers collect paddy varieties and also return varieties that they had taken earlier and multiplied. The event has become an annual meeting point where farmers growing traditional varieties of paddy using organic techniques meet fellow sojourners, share notes, listen to speakers, visit exhibition stalls with seeds, books, food products and agriculture implements. 
Ponnambalam, one of the pillars of the campaign, reminisced, “The first thiruvizha was inaugurated by Nammalwar in 2007. Adirengam village, eight kilometres from Thiruthuraipoondi town, was the venue and the meeting was held in the paddy fields lying idle post-harvest. We welcomed the 147 farmers with seven traditional varieties (Kattuyanam, Kuzhiyadichan, Kudavalai, Panangkattu kudavalai, Poongar, Sigappu kauni, Garudan samba).” 




Usha Kumari, who has led the Save Our Rice Campaign since its inception, remarks, “Seed saving and conservation is an integral part of agriculture. They lost favour with the introduction of high-yielding seeds and commercialisation of seed production as part of the Green Revolution. In the process our wealth of traditional varieties was lost. The thiruvizha is not only a reminder of what we have lost, but also of what we can recapture. The conservation and revival of traditional paddy varieties has become an imperative with climate change causing havoc in agriculture. We have to revive these resilient traditional varieties and introduce them into the fields.”
These farmers and seed conservers are not rich. They battle adversity every day. They are challenged by climate change, lack of water and a market. Yet they have decided to adopt organic paddy cultivation and to conserve traditional varieties. 
They have found that these traditional varieties, which are our heritage, could be their saviours in these uncertain times. In the process, they have become the saviours of these seeds that, if not cultivated season after season, could cease to exist. 
Saving rice 
In December of 2004, 150 activists working on agriculture and environment came together in the small picturesque village of Kumbalangi near Kochi, in Kerala, to discuss the future of paddy farming. Usha Kumari and Sridhar Radhakrishnan, who led the campaign, travelled around meeting people working on seeds, organic farming and farmers and The Save Our Rice Campaign emerged with the objective of conserving rice ecosystems, sustaining rice culture and diversity. In 2006, the Campaign began work in the three paddy-growing states of Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka and then moved to West Bengal as well. Twelve years later, the seed conservation work has been adopted by tens of thousands of paddy farmers in the four states.

More breast cancer patients can skip chemo, says study
","Some 70% of women with early-stage breast cancer and an intermediate risk of cancer recurrence can safely skip chemotherapy after their tumours have been removed, U.S. researchers said on Sunday.
“This is a major finding,” said Dr. Larry Norton, a breast cancer expert at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York, who helped organise the government-funded study more than a decade ago.
“It means that maybe 100,000 women in the U.S. alone do not require chemotherapy,” Mr. Norton said.
The research, presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) meeting in Chicago, studied how to treat women with early-stage breast cancer that responds to hormone therapy.
Women were deemed to have a medium level risk of the cancer coming back based on a 21-gene panel known as Oncotype DX from Genomic Health. The test predicts the likelihood of cancer recurrence within 10 years. Those who score low on the test — from zero to 10 —are already told to skip chemotherapy after their tumours are removed and they receive hormone therapy. Those who score high — 26 to 100 — receive both hormone therapy and chemotherapy.
The study, dubbed TAILORx, was also published in the New England Journal of Medicine. It involved more than 10,000 women with breast cancer that had not spread to nearby lymph nodes and whose tumours respond to hormone therapy and test negative for the HER2 gene. Of those, 6,711 scored in the intermediate range of 11-25, and were randomly assigned hormone therapy alone or hormone therapy plus chemotherapy.
The study found that all women over 50 with this type of breast cancer could skip chemotherapy, a group that represented 85% of the study’s population. In addition, women 50 and younger who scored between zero and 15 could be spared chemotherapy and its toxic side effects.
Some benefits
However, chemotherapy did offer some benefit to women aged 50 and younger who had a cancer recurrence score of 16-25, researchers found. Dr. Steven Shak, chief scientific officer at Genomic Health, said about four in 10 women in the U.S. with early stage breast cancers are not tested for recurrence risk. He expects the study’s results will change that practice.
“This is going to provide the highest level of evidence now for our test being indispensable in clinical practice,” Dr. Shak said.
The company currently provides tests to more than 900,000 patients in more than 90 countries, Dr. Shak said. In the United States, the test costs $4,000 and is covered by Medicare and all major private insurers.

On Parkinson’s trail ","Despite research spread over decades, scientists are yet to figure out the cause for Parkinson’s disease, a neurodegenerative disorder. One thing is clear: the aggregation of a protein called alpha-synuclein plays a key role in development of the disease. The aggregation pathway of this protein is the subject of intense research and studies so far have focussed on protein aggregates, called amyloid fibrils, which form late in the aggregation pathway.
Researchers at the CSIR-Indian Institute of Chemical Biology (CSIR-IICB), Kolkata, have now proposed that alpha-synuclein oligomers that come into the picture early in the aggregation pathway could be responsible for the development of Parkinson’s.
They used two amino acids to conduct their study in live neuroblastoma cells. The first one was glutamate, which happens to assist the formation of amyloid fibrils by facilitating generation of early oligomers. The second one was arginine, which inhibits amyloid fibril formation by inducing a large change in the shape of the native protein.
The study has shown that it is possible to monitor early events of the aggregation pathway when the native protein fluctuates in its monomeric states or when it forms early oligomeric molecules by using a combination of conventional methods and spectroscopy at the single molecule level.
“We have shown that it is possible to monitor and understand the early events in aggregation. It gives us hope that a therapeutic molecule may be possible against early oligomeric molecules,” says Dr. Krishnananda Chattopadhyay, leader of the research team.
“The study establishes that glutamate acts as a facilitator and arginine acts as an inhibitor of the late stage of alpha synuclein aggregation. However, it is not clear if the observed effect is because of other cellular changes due to the addition of these molecules or direct interaction of these molecules with alpha-synuclein. The mechanism of internalisation and interaction of these molecules with alpha-synuclein needs to be better understood. It will also be challenging to understand how one can transform this knowledge for drug development for a complex disease such as Parkinson’s,” says Dr. Samir K. Maji of IIT Bombay, who was not connected with the study.
Other researchers in the study included Sumanta Ghosh and Amrita Kundu of the CSIR-ICB. The research results have been published in the journal, Scientific Reports, and the work was funded by the Department of Science and Technology, Government of India.

In need of a lifeline: India's battle against TB
","The global battle against tuberculosis (TB) will be won or lost in India because most TB patients live there. Last month, we — at the Delhi Network of Positive People (DNP+) — lost a member of our staff, a fierce HIV activist, to TB.
After decades of activism that made HIV treatment accessible, Anita (name changed) died painfully and gradually, on April 30; there was no help forthcoming from the authorities. Her struggle exemplifies the monumental challenges faced by India’s TB community in accessing treatment. India’s TB community loses around 80 patients every day to drug resistant (DR) tuberculosis, a deadlier form of the disease, where the bacteria is resistant to anti-TB drugs.
India released data from the largest national DR-TB survey ever conducted by any country. The survey found that more than 6% of all TB patients in India have multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB). Based on data in the Global Tuberculosis Report 2017, an estimated 147,000 people have MDR-TB in India, accounting for a fourth of the global burden. Out of them, 30,000 patients need immediate access to better drugs and diagnostic facilities.
Anita, a familiar face among HIV activists in Delhi, was diagnosed with DR-TB in September 2016. It took 15 visits, spread over four months, to the All India Institute of Medical Sciences to get the results of the crucial drug-sensitive test that would help determine the most rational regimen to be followed after establishing what drugs she was resistant to. During this period, she was on presumptive treatment which caused her condition to deteriorate. The toxic cocktail of drugs prescribed to her caused persistent nausea, psychosis and depression — known side-effects of the deadly disease. By April this year, this 49-year-old firebrand activist was reduced to 28 kg; rapid weight loss is a hallmark of TB, giving the disease its historic name ‘consumption’ because it eats away at the person.
In HIV, patients who are put on anti-reterovirals start getting better almost immediately. In DR-TB, much like cancer, the drugs are toxic and a significant portion of the treatment is about managing side-effects. In Anita’s case, the drugs caused extreme nausea, which does not allow patients to develop an appetite, cause rapid weight loss and inevitable death. The disease gradually consumed her will to live.
We have been left devastated.
Anita contracted TB because she worked among TB and HIV patients. In 2005, the government rolled out free generic antiretroviral therapy, or ART, for HIV patients, turning a death sentence into a manageable disease. However, a new problem arose that has not been addressed in decades.
ART centres, where people living with HIV are treated, do not strictly implement infection control measures for TB prevention. TB, being the top opportunistic infection among HIV patients, is not incidental to health-care workers like Anita who are constantly exposed to patients with DR-TB. Yet, people who work with DR-TB patients are not offered Isoniazid preventive therapy and N95 (respirator) masks, that reduce the risk. After years of such work, she was diagnosed with pulmonary DR-TB.
According to recent government data and estimates, there are nearly 1.5 lakh patients with DR-TB in India of whom about 20% succumb to the disease. In the past few years, the government has recognised DR-TB as a public health threat and shown the political will to address the epidemic. Yet, as Anita’s story illustrates, there is still a long way to go.
Globally, a number of efforts are now under way to provide regimens containing new classes of TB drugs such as bedaquiline, pretomanid, and delamanid which offer hope to DR-TB patients. Despite some positive developments such as new drugs, screening tools and medicines, we are losing loved ones every day. India’s TB community is grieving. As affected communities, we want to encourage our government to offer health-care workers like Anita, the most effective regimens at the start of their treatment so that they have a greater chance of a cure in the future.

Immunotherapy cures late-stage breast cancer
","A woman with an aggressive form of breast cancer which defied chemotherapy and spread to other organs, was cured with an experimental treatment that triggered her immune system, researchers said on Monday.
The woman has been cancer-free for two years, reported the U.S.-based team, presenting their results as “a new immunotherapy approach” for the treatment of patients with a late-stage form of the disease.
 Other experts not involved in the work hailed it as “exciting”. 
So-called “immunotherapy” has already been shown to work in some people with cancer of the lung, cervix, blood cells (leukaemia), skin (melanoma) and bladder. But an immune breakthrough for bowel, breast and ovary cancer has remained elusive.
 The woman was 49 when she signed up for the clinical trial after several attempts at a cure through conventional treatments had failed, said the study published in Nature Medicine. 
The cancer had spread to various parts of her body, including the liver. A person’s immune system is designed to kill invaders, including rogue, cancerous cells. But it can fail, often because it cannot recognise cancer cells containing the patient’s own DNA.
Immunotherapy trains a patient’s own immune cells to recognise and fight cancer. For the new study, researchers took lymphocytes from a tumour in the woman’s body and scanned them for specific types which reacted to mutant, cancerous cells.
Tweaked in lab
These were reactivated or “switched on” in the lab and injected back, along with a so-called “immune checkpoint inhibitor” — another type of immunotherapy that has shown success in other types of cancer.
This resulted in a “highly personalised” anti-cancer therapy that yielded “complete tumour regression,” the researchers wrote.
In a comment also published by Nature Medicine, expert Laszlo Radvanyi from Canada’s Ontario Institute for Cancer Research said the woman’s response to the treatment was “unprecedented” for such advanced breast cancer. This work showed “we are now at the cusp of a major revolution,” he wrote.

‘I was 19 when I first travelled by myself’
","It was a year after the psychiatrist had decided that I had bipolar disorder. When I asked him about it, he merely wrote out a prescription and rang the bell for the next patient.
After a year of self-imposed house arrest and a dozen half-hearted attempts at ending my life, I was fed up. I couldn’t bear to see my family suffer as well. With the little money I had earned from tuition classes, I booked tickets, left a farewell note and boarded the train to Kolkata with the hope of joining the Missionaries of Charity.
However, no matter how much I pleaded, the sisters gently said that I was just running away. And that I hadn’t received my calling from God. That I should be going back home. But for a week, they provided me shelter, food and lots of love. After much contemplation by the mother’s tomb, I realised it wasn’t really a calling. It was an escape.
Which is what travel is. An escape from the mundaneness of a life filled with weeks of hour-long commutes to the office, mind-numbing meetings, meaningless small talk, and mindless weekend visits to the cinema. An escape that clears up the clutter in your head, gives you time to think, to see, and to bring back belief into a life that’s running out of hope.
Most of my bipolar episodes have been triggered by people telling me how to live my life, what to do, what not to. And very often, ‘That’s impossible. You won’t be able to do it.’ Oh, but how do you explain to them that you won’t know if you haven’t tried?So, when you do travel by yourself, when you share a hotel room with a match-fixer and couch-surf into houses of strangers, when you meet Naxals in the dilapidated estates of Odisha and travel by public transport through Bastar and Dantewada, when you board the unreserved compartment in UP and Bihar, when you trek solo in a new country, when you find yourself at a remote waterfalls with just two other men — both contract killers discussing a recent kill — you know. You know that if you trust the world, it protects you.
Like every other girl, I was taught to fear the world. Clothes weren’t meant to protect me from the weather but from men. Every man was a crook until proven otherwise. Every maid and helper was a thief in disguise. If you did something different, if you called a male friend home or invited the delivery person in and offered him juice — oh what sin. I didn’t understand why people were this way. Why this fear and distrust?
In her book You Can Heal Your Life, Louise Hay writes about the four causes for every illness — guilt, anger, fear and resentment. I have been saying her positive affirmations and realised that love conquers all . I have realised that bipolar disorder is just a term coined to run clinics and sell drugs. To tell us that we suffer from craziness. That if we choose to sing and dance for nothing at all — it is a disorder and the drugs will fix it. At NIMHANS though, a psychiatrist said something that gave me hope. She said that I have been blessed with bipolar. She even said that if I tried really hard, I could someday get off the meds completely.
When I was asked to write this article — it got me thinking about the label that I have been stuck with for the last 10 years. I never hid it because I wanted to break the taboo.
Now, it’s time to get rid of the label. If there’s one thing I have realised, it’s that there is bipolarity in all of us — in varying degrees. So it’s okay if you feel confused and lost. You are not alone.When the blues come knocking, travel. Pack your bags and board the bus to anywhere. Rough it out. Live on ₹500 a day. Share a room with a stranger. Trust the universe. It will keep you safe. Even if harm comes your way, look for the silver lining. There always is one, often much thicker than we make it out to be.
And, if you really want to travel, leave your smartphones behind. Remember, you are smarter than your phone.

Who put ‘malai’ in my tea?
"," The first sip of the tea tastes like basundi. Unbelievable? We think so too and take our second sip. This time, we pay more attention — no, that’s plain old cream with sugar crystals sprinkled on top. But who would’ve thought that a glass of tea would be topped with this? It takes around four sips for us to reach the actual tea at Devi Thaeneer Vidudhi near Begum Street in Triplicane. Around 20% of the glass is filled with their famous malai. At Devi, you order tea, and you get the malai variety. If you want the regular, unadventurous stuff, you have to inform tea ‘master’ M Anand.
The 28-year-old keeps the stove with the milk vessel on through the day. As a result, the milk is thick; Anand dutifully lets the cream that forms sit undisturbed. “So more malai keeps getting formed,” he tells us, ‘cutting’ tea in one swift motion for an auto driver, his regular customer.




Anand has been making tea at the shop for eight years. “Malai tea is my owner’s idea,” he says, adding that he knows only a handful of teashops in the city making this kind. “They are Golden Tea Stall and MAP on Ellis Road,” he explains, “And our other branch at Zam Bazaar.”
Priced at ₹ 8, a glass of tea at Devi is made under a minute. It’s an experience seeing Anand make it: he grabs one of the just washed tea glasses from the counter and rinses the insides with steaming hot water from a kettle. The glass tinkles as he spoons in sugar, followed by thick milk. The decoction comes next, which Anand lets spill into the glass like a tiny waterfall. One gigantic ‘cutting’ later, the tea is served with a topping of gleaming malai and sugar.




The amiable tea ‘master’ could be leaving for his hometown to get married in a year or two. “My family is looking for a suitable bride for me,” he says, smiling into the kettle. “Oru tea, without malai,” a customer walks in and tells him, and Anand grabs his next glass.
Anand makes around 300 cups of tea every day. How many does he have? “Three,” he says, when the auto driver, who’s been listening to our conversation, cuts in: “Five, admit it,” he laughs. Anand grins, saying, “Believe me, I don’t have more than three cups a day.” He doesn’t have the malai tea though. “Too much of malai can cause colds,” he explains.

Defying laws of gravity, 'dondurma' makes its way into Chennai
","When I reach for my ice-cream, it wiggles away like a worm. It sits on the end of a tall ladle held by our server, 25-year old Akash Kashyap, who teasingly flips the cone over and over with a nimble hand. The ice-cream, however, taunts gravity. All we wanted was some Turkish ice-cream. But when the server is Kashyap, you also get dinner and a show.
Turkish ice-cream or dondurma has made its way to Chennai — the second city to serve it after Delhi-NCR — at the newly-opened restaurant BnB Live Grill at OMR Food Street in Navallur and with it, have come the two men partly responsible for bringing it to India: Kashyap and Sonu Kumar.
An ice-cream that doesn’t easily drip or melt; that’s milky thick and chewy instead of soft. The nature of Turkish ice-cream is such that it lends itself to various tricks; ones that the ice-cream vendors of Turkey have perfected over the years. It is this art of ‘trolling’ customers that mesmerised Kashyap and Kumar when they first made their journey to the city of Ankara in Turkey four years ago. “It felt like magic... The vendors had such great sleight of hand, just getting ice-cream was one form of entertainment,” recalls Kashyap. What was supposed to be a short trip turned into a two-year stay, where the duo learned the tricks of ice-cream making and selling from Shahin Uftur. They then convinced him to open shop in Delhi.
The stretchy texture of the ice-cream comes from salep, explains Kashyap. “It is a paste made from orchid flowers,” he says. Both salep and mastic, the aromatic resin that gives it a distinctive flavour are imported from Turkey. The end product is so firm, you could take scoop out an entire bowlful on a ladle — a trick often used to surprise new customers — without any of it falling down; you often need a knife to slice through it.




Kashyap is in his element while serving; dressed in traditional red jacket and a fez. He slyly hands the customer a double cone, and ladles ice-cream on it. Once filled, he slips it out of her hand, leaving her holding just the empty outer cone. He then ups the performance, balancing the ice-cream on four different cones — so quick, the customer doesn’t know where to look. At times, he even puts a cone inside a customer’s pocket.
Sound is another integral part of the ice-cream serving: Kashyap rolls the ladle as if churning butter, hitting against the container to produce quick percussive beats. Hanging on top of the ice-cream containers is a bunch of bells tied together that Kashyap rings as he twirls the ice-cream ladle around. Every so often, he flips the ice-cream over and shrieks, pranking customers into thinking he has dropped it.




Doesn’t the audience ever get tired of his tricks? “We actually do have customers who straight out say ‘No’, when we start performing,” says Kashyap. “So you have to gauge each customer’s temperament before you start pranking them. Sometimes, there are children, even adults, who get scared or put off by our shrieking.” However, the vast majority seems to enjoy it, and that’s what drives the duo. “It is about playing with the customer, there’s a certain masti involved,” says a twinkle-eyed Kashyap. Kumar agrees, “We don’t just serve ice-cream, we serve laughter.”

The chocolate map
"," Bean-to-bar chocolate makers strive to retain the inherent flavours of cacao in their final product, through minimal processing. This is what sets them apart, justifies their charging a premium price, and in turn helps them support cacao farmers by paying a higher price per kilogram. This skill — of retaining the subtle flavours of cacao and unlocking them in a chocolate bar — attracts a lot of attention these days.
It is quite easily possible to lose chocolate’s natural flavour, if the ‘art’ of chocolate-making is not adhered to. So what exactly are these flavours? To understand this, we would have to travel back in time. Mexicans stone-ground their cacao beans to make flavourful ( often fruity) drinks at home. On the arrival of a guest, the lady of the house would freshly roast cacao beans on a pan and deshell them before using a metate (that ammi used to make chutney at home). This was slow-ground and flavours like vanilla, pepper, sugar were added. After 15-20 minutes of grinding, the coarse paste would be mixed with water and served. This process would release all the cocoa butter, but retain the natural fruity flavour. The flavour notes could include red fruits, raisins, citrus. It is believed that cacao and chocolate have more (discovered) flavour notes than wine.
These notes have now been grouped together for better understanding and interpretation, in the recently-introduced flavour-profiling map by the International Institute of Chocolate and Cacao Tasting (IICCT). Wrongly borrowing from wine, coffee and academic fields, the chocolate industry has often used wheels or spider diagrams to describe and market flavour profiles. “A traditional flavour wheel used in wine or coffee is only an infographic. You might as well have a list of flavours. The flavour map actually displays the chemical relationships, as we experience them, between flavours,” explains Alex Rast, a scientist at the School of Computer Science, The University of Manchester. The map combines an interactive list of flavours, placed next to each other by their chemical similarity. Hence, it is both an evaluation tool and a graphical display.
When you go into further detail, flavours of cinnamon, jasmine, honey etc form a part of the herbal/spicy quadrant of the flavour map, while raspberries, cranberries, lychee, melon etc form part of the fruity quadrant. The vegetal quadrant includes grassy notes and the dark sweet quadrant includes flavour notes like raisin, winey, mollasses etc.
 This system has been evolving over several years, with Rast. It is based on research by sensory experts into flavour compounds found in cocoa powder and their aromas. For the chocolate maker, this is an invaluable tool which helps discover more notes in beans from specific origins. It is useful to everyone, from cacao growers to traders, chocolate makers, professional tasters and casual consumers.

We keep going back to these, bringing it back to our customers, adapting it to suit their palate and new trends,” adds Kalra. 
Despite this emphasis on food, when United Coffee House started, food was not its focal point. It was more of a place to meet and chat — an adda of sorts. As Kalra says, “For many, this was a place to walk in on Sundays after listening to the military nand play and watching the fountains at Central Park for a cup of coffee with snacks.” 
Making the right brew
Established in 1942, it was the brain child of Lala Hans Raj Kalra (Akash Kalra’s grandfather), the son of a liquor baron who had a flourishing liquor business in Sialkot in Pakistan. The family moved to Delhi and were based in Chandni Chowk. 
The first foray into hospitality came with the setting up of the Esplanade Restaurant & Bar in 1938-39 to cater to the American GIs who had their barracks at the Red Fort. It proved to be very popular, but since it was meant for the GIs, it wound up with their moving out after the War in the early 40s.




Around that time, Hans Raj Kalra heard of an affluent shopping arcade in Lutyens Delhi called Connaught Place, which had been built in the shape of a horse shoe, for luck. What it lacked was a coffee house. He bought the place and opened United Coffee House. 
In the 40s, the place would be open from 11 am to 8 pm, typically selling street snacks of Old Delhi. Kalra says, “Food then was commercial. No one would eat home food outside, so it was only omelette, chana bhatura, tikka...” 




Post-Independence, the hours extended, and by the 60s it became a full-fledged restaurant. The cuisine initially was a mix of the Old Delhi Kayasth food and Frontier Province Pakistani food. 
The menu expanded, and during their lifetime, the place had served everything from commercial food, bibiyana (homemade) food, Madras club food, Bombay club food, Calcutta club food, Anglo Indian, khansama-cooked memsahib cuisine, to continental food, Asian, Mexican, Lebanese and, of course, Indian. 
Conceived in the British era, it still holds a fondness for the Old Raj cuisine, especially British club food — cheese balls, cutlets, samosas, chops. 
On the menu
 




Kalra says, “We are known for our keema samosa, cheese balls, tomato fish and chicken a la Kiev. These have not been invented by us, but our variation is a huge hit.” There are plenty of other staples — chapli kebabs, Railway mutton curry, dak bungalow chicken curry, chicken Maryland, coq au vin, chicken a la princess. 
Kalra explains, “My grandfather had the acumen to get some of the finest cooks of those times to work for us. With their feedback and my grandfather’s insight, a dish would be perfected after many trials. For example, a chef from Lucknow might add raw mango and bay leaf to a dak bungalow chicken curry, which made the taste entirely different from the usual one.”
To commemorate the 75th year, a new menu was unveiled in May. Classic dishes which had not been on the menu for 20-30 years were revamped.




 Kalra enthusiastically says, “Fuyong, chow chows from Asia, buttermilk burgers were on the list. These dishes are being adjusted to suit today’s palate. So if a baked salmon was served with boiled vegetables, today we would be doing it with braised bok choi.”




What works for UCH is that it still retains the old-world charm of the 1950s — the laid-back era of fine dining, huge chandeliers, unhurried knowledgeable waiters, the attention and care to the patrons with a sense of discreet familiarity.

A meat feast "," Think Ramadan and the first thing that comes to mind is food. Observed by Muslims by fasting from sunrise to sunset, the period most loved by people from other communities is the Iftar, where the fast is broken and the feast begins. What makes this season significant is how it unites people from all religions, backgrounds and languages with one single aspect – food. 




That’s why we’ve chalked out some of the lesser known haunts for Bengaluru’s foodies to embark on a culinary venture and taste some of the treats that can be eaten during this month.
MM Road




Top of the list is always Frazer Town. While the classic hotspot of Mosque Road has lost its shine owing to a ban, except for a few joints extending their doors to host food stalls and the irresistible bheja puff at Albert Bakery, the new food haunt in Frazer Town is the road perpendicular to Mosque Road at the junction of Haji Sir Ismail Sait Mosque – MM Road. Short for Madhavraya Mudaliar Road, what makes this already busy road with its row of restaurants and eateries is the array of food stalls that pop up during Ramadan. From kheema samosas, meat grills and skewers to patthar ghost (meat cooked on a granite slab on top of red hot coals), phaal, sheekh and veal kabab, and the traditional haleem, you can find everything here. Finding place to park may be your only issue, otherwise, this is the place to be if you’re in East Bengaluru.
Shivajinagar Chowk
 


If you can’t find it in Shivajinagar, you can’t find it anywhere else. The main transport hub and commercial shopping area adds one more item on what all you can find here during Ramadan – incredible food. What makes this hotspot even more significant that even if it is 3 am in the morning, you will find food here. Christened the Chowk locally, the area in front of the vintage Russell Market lights up during Ramadan and offers, easily, the best food in town. Almost always packed, take a walk down this road for the tastiest Iftar treats, sweets, soups, savouries and hot tea. A favourite here is the exotic camel meat. Go down from there to the Old Poor House Road junction near Taj Hotel and you will experience the true spirit of the season with crowds milling over food stalls and absolutely no place to walk.
Tilak Nagar




The hustle and bustle of this rather busy locality will not distract you from the aroma of food that fills that air. A drive down Tilak Nagar Main Road is almost impossible without stopping at the range of eateries that line up the roadside, almost threatening to create traffic snarls with the crowds thronging them. The exotic treats here are the roasted ox tongue and quail fry. For the less adventurous, dabble in the kebabs, curries, phirnis and paani kum chai.
Rahamat Nagar, RT Nagar




This one you may miss if you drive by too fast. So the moment you enter RT Nagar, keep your eyes peeled for this street food cuisine hotspot near Jamia Masjid. Head over in the evenings and taste the best grilled meats and yummiest sheek kebabs and samosas. Also look out for the murgh pahadi kebab, a herb-based tender chicken dish that’s available only here.
Koramangala




Going by many names – the popular eat street on Koramangala’s First Cross Road is a foodies paradise. Already packed with way too many restaurants and eateries, the jam-packed road becomes almost impossible to go through on evenings now. Take a stroll and you will go home few pounds heavier as the wafting smell of food is undeniable. Often, you will find Ramadan food blending with other cuisines thanks to the wall-to-wall restaurants flourishing here. A classic example is the chicken nihari – a yummy chicken spicy stew that goes best with fresh idiyappams here.
Other Big hitters




Johnson Market is a major crowd-drawer each year. Try the street behind the mosque if you want to avoid the crowd. Madiwala, Bannerghatta and Yelehanka also have their share of Ramadan treats as well as most other neighbourhoods which have a mosque. If, by now, you’re hungry, head over to your nearest food stall and feast away.

Climbing mountains, spatula in hand
","“Trekkers just smelled the food and walked up to our tent,” says Vineet Bhatia, on a crackled, broken WhatsApp call from somewhere in Nepal’s Himalayan region. His journey, which began on May 24 at Tribhuvan International Airport, Kathmandu, has been a long one. He is now on his way home, after spending June 3, 4 and 5 cooking at Everest Base Camp.
The celebrity chef and his core team of six were at the camp to serve up some hearty soul food as part of a charity initiative with the Heart for India Foundation, to raise money for the girl child and Nepalese earthquake victims. His pop up restaurant has been months in planning, as has his fitness level, says the chef.
“My son and I did quite a bit of cardio regularly for two months, in preparation. But even then, the real experience was completely different: the rocks, the weather...” says the chef, “It’s a very physically challenging trek. At times, we were on a 60° incline.”




However, Bhatia has no regrets. “We didn’t want to chopper our way to the top, unlike other people who have gone and cooked there in the past. We wanted to experience the place, see the beauty, meet people,” he explains. Needless to say, these encounters and experiences had an impact on the chef’s mind, and further made their way to his ladle and pan. One of the things that struck Bhatia, for instance, was how often they had a simple meal of dal bhaat en route. “We were told that the salt level was deliberately kept low, in order to be careful about the heart rates of people onward.”
In contrast was the slew of German bakeries in Namche Bazar, where they stopped for two days to get acclimatised. “The bakeries and their products were very nice, and of course, the high sugar levels were good for burning energy,” he recounts. And then, there were the juniper berries that they found pretty much everywhere along the route. These found their way into the chef’s recipes at the base camp, as did plenty of potatoes, which, as Bhatia puts it, “are found in abundance in high altitudes”. So while the berries helped flavour his masala rice, the potatoes — sweeter than your regular ones — were sliced as finely as possible before being thrown into the pan, and for good reason. “We keep it thin, so it cooks faster. The cooking time is longer up there, because of the temperature and pressure. This despite the fact that water begins to boil faster here, at 80° Celsius.”




That wasn’t the only challenge to Bhatia’s plan of serving up a mix of Indo-Nepalese cuisine. “We had to make do with just one wok, one pressure cooker and one pan,” he says. A separate team of sherpas had reached the camp earlier, in order to deliver the equipment and ingredients. Needless to say, there where limitations in terms of weight. “Carrying flour would have been way too difficult, so we stuck to rice. But we finished the meal with some nice sooji ka halwa, with saffron and gold leaf.” Besides that, there were simple stir-fried vegetables, including locally grown beans, and plenty of what the chef calls ‘Indo-Chinese’ innovations, with Schezuan sauce, garlic and chillies. “We needed to pack a punch,” he says.
But the thrill of clambering over rocks with platefuls of soul food to serve trekkers from around the world in their tents only came at the end of the road. Before that came blizzards, engine failures, and a terrifying take-off on the world’s shortest air strip. There were also new friends made along the way, an encounter with a sherpa who had scaled Everest several times, a chance meeting with a wandering lama (a Tibetan Buddhist spiritual leader), and what Bhatia describes as “the pure white mountains, clean air, clear skies”.

The taste of the Temple Town
"," At 7 a.m. each day, the streets around the Meenakshi Temple bustle with activity. Amidst the cacophony of sounds and colourful sights surrounding the touristy hub of Madurai, it is the unmistakable whiff of ghee dosas and fried vadas that pulls you in. Whether you are a local or a tourist, there is so much to explore around the temple especially for the foodies. Several traditional joints serve their signature recipes and it is not only their tasty food that fills you up. The lofty colourful gopurams of the temple are also a feast for the eyes as you enjoy the food sitting inside these decades-old eateries. 
The inviting aroma on the East Chithirai Street takes you to the 40-year-old restaurant Durga Bhavan, famous for its crispy dosas served with three varieties of chutneys and a thick sambhar made of moong lentils. 
Hunting for the best idlis is not a task in Madurai, because idli is the food that the city swears by. But, for the perfectly round and super-soft idlis, look no beyond the popular Murugan Idli Kadai on Thalavai Agraharam Street. Not to forget that the global food chain had its humble beginnings in the Temple city. The much acclaimed brand of idlis are as fluffy as cotton and so effortlessly melt in the mouth. 




If you want to burn up the calories after a heavy breakfast, take a stroll around the Chithirai Streets before another binge. The shutters of the 110-year-old Nagapattinam Nei Mittai Kadai go up at 10 a.m. but people huddle there long before. Popular for the ghee-dripping halwa and the piquant Urulai Kizhangu masal, the shop is one iconic eatery located right opposite the West Tower. A bite of the blobby halwa served on mantharai leaves coats the palate with sugar and ghee and the best antidote for the sweet indulgence is the Urulai masal. A favourite combination for curd rice, the masal is a hit among spice lovers. People jostle for a parcel of the masal and it gets over in no time.




 If 11 O’ clock is your customary coffee break time, then what better than the traditional filter coffee at the legendary Visalam Coffee Bar on North Chithirai Street. Thick and frothy in consistency, strong and flavoursome, the filter coffee here keeps the town up and running round- the-clock. A recharge with a tumbler of coffee is also not without some quick bites like vadai and bajji. Walk down to the Naveen Bakery at the junction of the East and North Chithirai Street. It is a landmark where people catch up over tea cakes, puffs, vadais, bondas and polis. 
Before your hunger pangs for lunch return, there is enough time for window shopping in the temple area. Tightly placed with the regular shops, you will surely spot the numerous sappadu kadais that dot the area. For instance, the 50-year-old Modern Restaurant on Nethaji Road is known for its typical vegetarian elai sappadu while the Chettinad mess on Thyagi Thayammal Street or Jayavilas Club on East Avani Moola Street are the places for a spicy non-vegetarian lunch. 

 There is scope for post-lunch snacking too with umpteen number of road-side joints serving a wide range of evening snacks. Standing out among them is the 100-year-old Gopu Iyengar Kadai, tucked in a corner on North Chithirai Street that serves signature items like Vellai appam and brinjal bajji from 3 p.m. To 7 p.m. Delhiwala on West Tower Street and Narsingh Sweets on West Avani Moola Street, offer north-Indian snacks like chaats, kachoris and milk sweets. 
After many rounds of mindless eating, if you are still up for it then take a swig of paruthi paal and later the ubiquitous Jigarthanda and wind up your day-long eating expedition and still feel light at the end of it all.

Eat rotis made with heirloom flour, thanks to this start-up
","Have bitcoin? Buy atta. In these yeasty days of e-commerce, rotis are the next frontier. At TWF (The Wheat Flour), which revels in its ‘ground-to-order technology’, Internet-connected, specially-designed, dynamic stone mills grind your wheat only after you have placed an order online.
Not surprisingly, Pranjal Y Kumar and Arjun Rungta, the founders of TWF, are ex-investment bankers and technologists, who enjoy dabbling in crypto-currencies almost as much as they enjoy tracking down delicious wheat. 
Today, their company offers three varieties of unadulterated, unbleached and unprocessed wheat flour. There’s organic Indie flour, Highland flour made with sharbati wheat from the Malwa plateau, and an heirloom flour called Relique, made with a 10,000-year-old wheat strain.
But when they began in 2014, all they were trying to solve was an ‘analytics problem’. Says Kumar, “Both of us are computer engineers and we were trying to create a platform that would allow people to automate their consumer purchases.” They began with atta, since it was a common staple, and launched a store in Delhi.




To each his own
“We noticed different profiles. Some people would buy 10 kilograms every 20 days: usually if it was a family of four or five. Customers from the West or South India would consume that much in 45 days. It began as an anthropological project, then spiralled into something very different.” They were soon stocking 104 varieties of wheat. “Products from Bengaluru, Mumbai... every place we could find. All we wanted was data. We needed to make sure we had all possible options, so that even if customers switched their flour, they still bought from us.”
By 2015, they decided to create high-quality flour themselves, so they set up a small home mill. “It took us 20 minutes to process five kilograms then, which is really slow.” Now, each of their machines can process about 20 kilograms in 20 minutes. In response to requests from a growing band of loyal customers, they began to expand.
Last year, Kumar and Rungta finally launched the company with three varieties of flour. A sample pack with all three, weighing about six pounds, costs ₹799. 




“We never really thought about how expensive it was in relative terms,” says Kumar, discussing why they feel it’s priced just right. “We choose the wheat strain, then the region where we get it from. The Highland variety comes from Madhya Pradesh and Indie from Rajasthan.” Highland is a rain-fed crop, while Indie is sustained by irrigation.
“Highland tends to absorb a lot more moisture, so rotis stay soft for longer. Indie absorbs less, but is certified organic.” Then there’s Relique, which resembles spelt, einkorn and farro in its nutrient profile, and has a gluten structure similar to farro. Kumar says, “This is one of the gifts of the feudal system. Every zamindar had a patch of land where he would grow crops for his own family. Where he wouldn’t spray fertilisers. Our Relique ancient wheat comes from one such feudal region in Karnataka. It took us two years to find it: this strain hasn’t been artificially hybridised or altered in 10,000 years. There are other varieties like this around the country: In South India, there’s khapli. And in the Bundelkhands there’s kathiya wheat. But they have their own peculiarities and flavour profiles. We tested about 13, and then chose the wheat that we felt yields the best-tasting flour.”
Matter of life and shelf




TWF’s strength, however, is an obsession with freshness. Kumar says this also means their products are more nutritious, as they have more fibre. “With commercial flours, bran is separated from the germ to extend shelf life from one month to six or nine months. (The germ that sprouts contains minerals that oxidise very quickly.) A longer shelf life is one of the reasons commercial flours are cheaper.” He recommends consuming wheat not later than four weeks after it is milled. “This is why we grind your order only on the day it is being shipped.” 
Meanwhile, sales are steadily picking up. Kumar says, “After a year of hard work, we broke even last month. We serviced 26 States/Union Territories in April. We believe we have reached a product-market fit with our product range and the next goal is to get into hyper growth phase.”
He says Delhi NCR is their biggest client base, followed by Bengaluru, Mumbai and Pune. And then there are the hardcore fans: “A customer on the West Coast of America asked for 15 kilograms of flour recently. And paid about ₹10,000 just for shipping!”

Why is curd used as a preservative for pickles? "," The rains are fleeting, but the sun is still out, and many homes in the South of the country are soaking plump green chillies in salt and sour curd, before setting them out to dry. After some hours in the sun, the chillies let out their distinctive aroma, redolent of sour buttermilk. By evening, the semi-dried chillies, partly shorn of their colour, are back in the curd, soaking in more flavour. After four or five such outings, the chillies are dried to a crisp, and stored, till the next summer. The almost-beige treats are fried till brown-black, and are said to be the perfect accompaniment to a bowl of curd rice.




The purple and orange fruits of manathakkali (black nightshade), lady’s finger, sundaikkai (Turkey berry) and tender guar (cluster beans) are similarly pickled. The best part? They don’t need much space to dry; you make as little or as much as you want to.
After a dunking in hot oil, they emerge dark and shiny, with a crisp exterior. The curd would have seeped in thoroughly, and the multiple rounds of soaking ensure the chillies are coated with a generous dose of sourness and creaminess. This also helps take off the sharp edge, and remind you of the goodness of summer.
Traditionally, South India and Maharashtra have always used curd as a pickling agent. Each state adds spices to the basic recipe of sour curd and salt. Mumbai-based food writer and consultant Saee Koranne-Khandekar speaks fondly of Kutachi mirchi and tender guar bursting with the flavours of fenugreek, cumin, carom or coriander seeds. Deeply flavourful, they add value to the simplest of meals.
In Madurai, Tamil Nadu, 68-year-old V Srinivasan, of Vasan Stores, has been pickling vegetables using curd since 1969, and supplying them to customers across the country, and sometimes even abroad. “I learnt to pickle from my parents. Curd adds sourness and also preserves vegetables well. You can use maagalikizhangu (sarasaparilla) for more than a year, provided you store it well,” he says. The root comes from the hills and is harvested after a bout of rain; it has a peculiar aroma and is an acquired taste. 
Curd, he says, is also used to make koozh vadagams and perandai vadagams (fritters) and vathals (sun-dried vegetables) using sundaikkai, manathakkali and, occasionally, lotus stem. 




Why is curd used as a preservative? Ask any old-timer, you’ll be told how curd turns sour, and then some more, but never spoils. Today, we know about its probiotic properties, but those days, they probably just went by common sense — something that did not spoil could also preserve. 
Consultant dietician Dharini Krishnan says that curd was used as a pickling agent for choice vegetables and roots, with reason. “Sarasaparilla is a known preservative; when teamed with curd, the goodness is enhanced,” she adds. Sour curd is also curative. “A home remedy for diarrhoea used to be watered-down sour buttermilk, seasoned with salt and asafoetida,” she says. 
Delhi-based nutritional consultant Sangeeta Khanna speaks of the Rajasthan desert berry ker, that is soaked in sour buttermilk before being washed and processed. “This aids in fermentation and preservation. Curd becomes sour and acidic, almost like vinegar. Once you add salt and mustard, it becomes a preservative. The probiotic benefits remain, but it helps break down the vegetables into absorbable nutrients.” 
Back in Chennai, septuagenarian Chithra Viswanathan, a food writer and a repository of traditional recipes, says that traditionally all vathals have been soaked in curd before being sun-dried. As for pickles, many in the South will remember eating mor nellikkai, a pickle made using cooked amla and sour curd. “This was a seasonal thing and lasted a couple of months if you protected it from moisture,” says Viswanathan, who confesses her eternal favourite is sarasaparilla pickle. 
Rupa Balaji, who works in the software industry and lives in Round Rock near Austin, Texas, sources sarasaparilla pickle and vathals from India. “It’s the taste of childhood. Luckily, some courier companies send it across. I’m holding on to the two bottles that I received this month. A dollop on curd rice brings back the taste of home.”

Mahua goes mainstream
"," Long before Manhattans, Cosmos and LITs defined our drinks repertoire, ancient India was known for its extensive, indigenous liquor-making culture. A few centuries ago, we, like the rest of the drinking world, began our affair with alcohol via madhira or wine — the go-to beverage for ancient royalty — made from honey, jaggery or molasses. During the Vedic ages, fermented brews made from rice and cereals, namely kanji and kilala, were a regular order with affluent communities. Commoners and cousins in the South preferred toddy, made from the sap of the palmyra tree, while Northeastern brothers opted for barley, millet or rice-based beers. 
It wasn’t until the British became preoccupied with launching rum distilleries for Army rations, and taxing local spirits like toddy and mahua, that our home-grown drinks were cornered into hooch status. Incredibly, a few olden-style swills silently continued to bloom. Mahua, an indigenous Indian tree, in particular, was nurtured and worshipped by tribal communities under the deep and dry deciduous covers of central Indian forests. 




Seventy years later, India’s most-touted and secretly-consumed Adivasi tipple is set to step out of its illicit, camouflaged abode, straight into the sun-kissed Goan light, thanks to IITian-turned-craft distiller Desmond Nazareth. If you’re a connoisseur of unusual beverages, chances are you’ve already sampled some of Nazareth’s artisanal creations, spanning agave, pure cane, margarita mixes, orange liqueur and blue curaçao.
If not, I recommend you start by trying his latest offerings: DJ Mahua and DJ Mahua Liqueur. “My first mahua encounter dates back to 2001, Gujarat,” reminisces Nazareth, adding that the intrigue and chase of obtaining a bent-out-of-shape, dirty plastic bottle full of cloudy mahua, that smelt of musky cooked rice, only supplemented its allure. In fact, it made it to the very top of his ‘to make’ list when he launched DesmondJi in 2011, but soon decided to shelve it until the time was right. In 2013, Nazareth acquired his first batch of unhygienic-handled mahua flowers from Latur, Maharashtra and began kitchen-scale experiments. “Hygiene, I understood, was the key to delivering an international quality product, but that also meant I needed to oversee the whole process from collection and sorting to producing,” says the 61-year-old, referencing his yearly sourcing trips to Jharkhand and Odisha.
 So while the tribals practise little to no hygiene checks, single-distil and are left with 10% alcohol, which they retail for ₹200, DJ Mahua conducts five levels of hygiene checks, double-distils using pot stills and is left with 40% alcohol, which they will retail for ₹975. 
“This isn’t just a one-way street. I’ve been working with the tribals on sanitation education, which in turn will hopefully have a positive effect on their own distillation,” affirms Nazareth.In the last decade alone, amidst prohibitions, trade and storage restrictions, two states — Assam and Jharkhand — have come out in support of the Gonds’ favoured pick-me-up, to promote local ethnic brews as ‘heritage liquor’. If France has Champagne and Mexico has Tequila, then why should India stop short at Darjeeling tea? Mahua too is just as deserving of GI (Geographical Indication) protection. The former field-to-bottle recently upgraded forest-to-bottle distiller couldn’t agree more. “This year, for the first time ever, many more Indians can participate in the annual, pre-monsoon Mahua Tyohar,” he ends enthusiastically.

A matter of refined tastes "," 


Delhi-based pitmaster Harman Singh and mixology consultant Viju Raj were in Hyderabad for a short while and couldn’t have enough of the city’s diverse flavours. They talked with genuine enthusiasm about their gastronomic discoveries in Old City and the plush Banjara and Jubilee Hills neighbourhoods. The two know their food and drink and were here on business, hand-holding the setting up of Hyderabad’s new gastro lounge, Zephyr.In a nod to Greek god Zephyrus and the connotation of ‘a gentle breeze’, Zephyr has a blue and white Greek theme for its interiors and is styled like a few living rooms seamlessly merging into one another. It’s not a typical bar, both in design and ideology. Viju Raj has been the driving force behind new-age bar concepts in Mumbai and Delhi but he admits that he hasn’t really pushed the envelope elsewhere, like he has with Zephyr.




More and more bars in the country now pride themselves in using locally sourced, natural ingredients in their drinks. Here, restaurateur Vikas Passary takes it a step further and says, “We wanted a cocktail bar that stems from the concept of drinking responsibly. The focus is on the craft than volume.”
A spectrum of cold pressed vegetable and fruit juices are made in-house, so are a range of syrups, sauces and garnishes. At one end of the bar counter are two gas tops on which sauces and syrups are cooked. “Nothing is served from a packet and no preservatives are added,” asserts Passary.
Signature infused gins
Viju Raj and Passary have curated a menu that boasts of cocktails made with cold pressed juices and insist that “the vodka tastes much better” this way. Their signature drinks use a range of infused gins, also done in-house. Think of gins infused with hibiscus and vanilla, saffron and ginger, clove and orange peel, star anise and filter coffee and more. “We source a lot locally to keep flavours intact, and some are handpicked from different regions of the country, like kokum from Goa,” says Raj. The infused gins are ready within 15 to 20 days and the experimentation with new flavours is an ongoing process.


The garnishes tick varied sensory notes. Frozen candied orange slices are enhanced with a hint of cinnamon and organic sugar, there are dehydrated slices of oranges and pineapples (thanks to an in-house dehydrator) and the drinks are served in handmade glassware sourced from Ferozabad. “The serving is more courteous; the second drink would never come in a shot glass but be well presented to go with the living room concept. Everything has to appeal to the five senses,” says Raj. Some of the drinks are served enclosed in smoked pine wood, to enhance the presentation.
A centre community table, borrowed from the Mediterranean lifestyle, encourages visitors to greet share conversations with new people.




The food menu is the deft handiwork of Harman Singh who likes to underplay his role as “the man who cooks”. There’s a method to madness in the pairing of flavours and he, along with Passary, has put together a menu that would offers for the global traveller, the local palette, for those who enjoy heightened or subtle spice notes. From a watermelon-mint gazpacho with a kick of chilli to sago punugulu, dahi ke kebab or three bean salad, there’s plenty to savour — you get to sample Mediterranean, Indian, Thai and much more. Desserts get a whiff of subtle fusion too. Try the mango mascaropone rabdi, it has all the good notes of the mango and the creaminess of the mascaropone without an overpowering sweetness.

With the mushrooming of app-based home delivery services in the city, “eating in” has become the new thing, with many denizens preferring to indulge their taste-buds while enjoying the familiar comforts of their homes or multi-task at work and still not skip that vital energy-boosting meal. Such apps are proving handy not just for gourmets keen to relish their favourite delicacy from a preferred restaurant but also for those looking to tuck into some authentic naadan food prepared by professional home chefs. PinStove, Swapp, Hoppon, Streetbell and Rabbito are some of the popular options available.
As the trend catches on, MetroPlus catches up with some entrepreneurs behind the tech-driven hunger solution in the city.
With over 100 home chefs on its rolls, PinStove has quickly established itself as a trusty conduit to connect customers with verified home chefs at their service. Officially launched in early 2017, the app was brought to life by a core team of four business partners — Baiju Muhammad, Bhagavan Das, Harry Croydon (from the U.K.) and Jayamohan R.S — of an IT company who often met up in London in course of their work.
“Though there’s a multitude of home chefs in the city, the sector used to be quite unorganised. With PinStove, we wanted to bring in more connect and cohesion. We knew that such an app would also remove uncertainties over placement and delivery of orders for chefs as well,” says Aneesh V.K., one of the directors of PinStove, head-quartered in Technopark.
Once a home chef registers himself or herself with PinStove, a team visits the person to “create a personal bond” and assesses the kitchen facilities for certification. The chefs are given the freedom to decide the prices depending on the dish. Despite choosing not to tie up with restaurants, Aneesh says the response from customers for home-cooked food has been rather overwhelming. Ask him what the most sought-after item on the menu is? “Inevitably, pothichoru,” he says. 
For the fast-expanding mobile app Swapp, food delivery is one of the many services on offer. “We believe there are two kinds of hungry customers. First, those who need a bit of help to decide from where they want to eat or what they want to eat. Then there is the second type who knows exactly what food they want and where they want to buy it from, say a specific masala dosa or a specific biriyani from a specific restaurant. Swapp works for the second type, as it is a platform that fosters a direct relationship between a loyal customer and a restaurant,” says Bavani Srinu, who co-founded Swapp with her husband, Ashwin Panicker. 

Once you are connected to a particular restaurant or eatery, the next time you open Swapp, they automatically appear in the “wallet section.” Users can thus keep on adding their personal favourites, in effect creating a list of preferred options. Bavani says Swapp aims to finish the delivery within 30 minutes from the time the food is prepared, depending on the locations, while also employing an “internal” delivery team.

For Hoppon, an e-commerce platform for “hyper-local businesses” currently supported only on Android, the food delivery department is an integral part of its larger business network. Started in January last year, Hoppon now predominantly focusses in and around Technopark, apart from certain “busy” pockets in the city. Though started with tie-ups with restaurants having delivery facility, the company has been utilising its own team for the purpose for the past six months or so, says Suri Amarnath, CEO of ThoughtLine Technologies, which powers Hoppon. Suri plans to expand the network beyond Thirumala in one direction and Pappanancode in another soon.

With rising prices of fuel and the sheer number of orders flooding in every hour, Streetbell, an online shopping market platform, however, prefers to tie up with only those restaurants with a home delivery service. 

“The mechanism of having a small delivery team that has to rush to places may not be always feasible, especially on weekends when orders pile up,” feels Hari Sambudevan, CEO of Streetbell, which takes orders on both its app and website. Streetbell’s app, which was part of the Kerala Start-up Mission, was conceived and brought out by a core team of nine members. It now has tie-ups with over 50 restaurants in the city, with over 14,000 registered customers.
If the four key players in the market have IT-based origin, Rabbito, a stand-alone food delivery app launched earlier this year, took wing after a group of four friends faced a practical dilemma. “We once wanted to order a cake for a friend’s mother. However, we couldn’t find anyone in the locality. We then had to zoom in on a seller located some distance away and had to pay extra for delivery charges. That’s when we realised we could establish such a service ourselves. That’s how the idea came about,” says Anto Joseph C.J., a co-founder of Rabbito, who works with the police department.
When they consulted a software service provider in the city for technical support, it so happened that it had already done a similar model for a U.K.-based firm. “So we could easily formulate an Indianised version and add necessary features to it,” says Anto. With an in-house delivery apparatus, the three-month-old service is open from 11 am till 11 pm.
However, despite the digital ease of placing an order, a lot of manual work goes into the system, and sometimes things may not go according to the plan. “On delivery failures or other glitches, customers can avail themselves of either refund or loyalty points that can be redeemed for another order,” says Aneesh of PinStove. Hari of Streetbell points out that delivery issues can crop up once in a while, but “we cannot categorise a seller right from get-go.”
With an eye on the burgeoning market pie, Zomato, an online restaurant search and food delivery platform that was started in India and now has presence in over 20 countries, is taking baby steps in the city.
Restaurants and home chefs seem to embrace this symbiotic model of food delivery as it helps cut down transportation charges and tide over practical hurdles.
So, next time pangs of hunger gnaw your tummy and its either scorching hot or raining cats and dogs outside, just sate your appetite with a simple swipe of your finger.

In search of peas and manga
","With all the juicy ripe mango varieties that make their way to our home, this year there were generous amounts of killimukku manga too from my sister-in-law’s farm. No matter how old one is, this variety brings out the child in any mango-obsessed person. I love to buy killimukku off the roadside vendor especially when the manga is cut to resemble an open flower and is coated from the tip all the way to the end in salt and red chilli powder. And if the manga has a tinge of yellow in it, it means there will also be a bit of sweetness that makes the otherwise tart treat even more delicious. 
However too much of killimukku manga and chilli can spell disaster, so what else can one make with it? 
But of course, the thenga manga pattani sundal !
A few decades ago before street food became so fashionable, we would rush out of our homes on hearing the ‘thenga manga pattani sundal man’. He came promptly at 4 pm around the Race Course circle, and if memory serves me right he was an elderly person always in a white dhoti and shirt. He had a rectangular tin in which the tasty sundal lay and on the sides were paper cones to hold that sundal when we bought it off him. I so regret not asking that thatha his name, because he stopped coming and we did not know where to find him. But in those happy days when he still showed up, he would dip the steel ladle deep into the hollow of the tin as we waited patiently. 
The cones made from old newspapers were filled to the brim and then folded over for us to carry back home without spilling. By the time we crossed the road and opened our individual parcels, the paper would be soggy but heavily infused with the aroma of this unique evening snack.
It is also healthy 
This humble dish ticks all the right boxes. It is gluten free, vegan, high protein, sugar-free, low-carb, etc. It’s a snack that is so typical of Tamil Nadu that Wild Planet Resort makes a mention of it as a must-try when visiting this part of the country. It’s also popular as ‘beach sundal’ on Marina beach, Chennai. 
I love the traditional way of making this sundal, without the modern additions of carrots, tomatoes, and so on. The pattani  used is always the dried white pea which needs to be soaked overnight or at least for eight hours before cooking. The manga is either cubed or grated according to preference but do choose a variety that isn’t too sour. The coconut is ground along with green chillies and ginger.
 A light tempering of mustard seeds and curry leaves in a fragrant oil of choice is followed by adding the ground coconut, chillies and ginger, and finally the cooked peas. Add salt, toss well and take off the fire. Add the raw mango bits and mix well. And just to complete the perfect snack, finish off with a squeeze of lime and you are good to go.

Where to brunch in Las Vegas ","I am gambling with a fistful of cash, a martini and a Momofuku pork bun. The pork bun is the only winner. The malevolent slot machine spitefully chews dollars, celebrating my losses with self-satisfied beeps. In my rage against the machine I knock over most of my martini. The pork bun, though, straight from Chef David Chang’s little hipster haven Momofuku in trendy Cosmopolitan casino is delicious.
Over five days in Las Vegas, I quickly learn that dining out is infinitely more rewarding than shaking my fist at the roulette table. I am not alone. Sin City has been steadily changing its brand. Now it is a shiny entertainment capital, offering visitors a galaxy of stars to choose from — from artists like Gwen Stefani, Lady Gaga and Calvin Harris to culinary legends such as Joël Robuchon, Nobu Matsuhisa and Wolfgang Puck. Not to mention the TV celebrity chefs: Gordon Ramsay, Guy Fieri, Bobby Flay and Giada de Laurentiis.
Given the pool of talent, Vegas offers an endlessly evolving culinary landscape. With so many options, where do you brunch? Here’s our pick.




At The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas, Level 2, The Chelsea Tower
Cost: $28 (Mon-Thurs), $36 (Fri-Sun)
Let us stick with tradition and begin with a bombastic, extravagant, over-the-top, typically Vegas style buffet. Except, this is a gourmet version. No clunky chafing dishes, reheated spuds and wilted bacon here. Modern and spacious, the Wicked Spoon buffet is vast and inventive. Which could explain why customers patiently wait in long queues to get in.
Styled like a trendy global food hall, the focus is on creative presentation. Most dishes are served in small, individually plated portions. I try dinky bowls of steamy mac and cheese. Then pause to admire the carving stations, and nod hello to an assembly line of chefs who systematically set out little baskets of freshly fried chicken, steamy dim sum and Korean-style kalbi beef ribs. The buttery bone marrow is a favourite here, as are the skilfully made scrambled eggs, which are sunshine yellow and impressively creamy.
Dessert is a Willy Wonka fantasy featuring imaginatively styled puddings, cake and gelato. I am so overwhelmed by the choices I circle it three times, and end up eating a coconut cookie!




At 3595 Las Vegas Blvd S, The Cromwell
Cost: $55 for the tasting menu
Emmy Award-winning celebrity chef Giada De Laurentiis’ smile is as bright as her sunshine-flooded restaurant. Brunch begins with cheery mimosas, but you can posh it up with Veuve Clicquot if you prefer. Set in elegant Cromwell hotel, this is possibly one of the best restaurant views in Vegas: the Bellagio Fountains, theatrical Caesars Palace and all the drama of the strip.
Giada’s around, chatting with guests, posing for fan selfies and signing cookbooks. Between it all, she explains her style — simple Italian home cooking. However, while easy recipes may have made her a star on the Food Network, Vegas’ steak and Champagne audience is more demanding. Hence her food for the restaurant has been carefully tweaked while leaving its easy, breezy core intact. The antipasto, for instance, features ricotta crostini, prosciutto and sweet baby peppers, as well as a powerfully fragrant truffle burrata.
I eye Giada’s fluffy polenta waffles served with sunny side-up eggs, pancetta and maple syrup, then settle on a crisp Romaine salad, dewy with citrus vinaigrette followed by pesto-puddled cavatelli, tossed with roasted mushrooms. And a lobster hash. The vibe is stylish but artfully casual, like a Woody Allen rom com: all perfect lighting, bursts of laughter and beautiful people. To Rome with love, and a lemon ricotta cookie.




At Wynn Las Vegas, 3131 S Las Vegas Blvd
Cost: Approximately $60 (a la carte for two)
This is where I collide with Popeye. I have spent 20 minutes wandering around Wynn’s labyrinth, art-studded corridors, hopelessly lost and desperately in need of a Bloody Mary. Like any good intrepid explorer (well, as intrepid as you can be with GoogleMaps, plush carpeting and shimmering chandeliers) I study my surroundings. The Popeye sculpture, which weighs about 2,000 pounds was reportedly purchased at auction by Steve Wynn for $28 million.
Then there are the flowers. Designer Preston Bailey has used tens of thousands of them to create a carousel in the lobby, complete with its 10 horses, Pegasus and a unicorn.
So not surprisingly, when I finally find Jardin, it is like walking into a movie set, strung with dramatic floral installations. The main dining area is bright with sunlight, making it feel more like a conservatory than a restaurant. I sit by the quietly elegant poolside in the midst of meticulously manicured greenery.
The food is “approachable American”, basically comfort food that has undergone a makeover to emerge lighter, fresher and a lot more stylish. There is a strong focus on seasonal ingredients. I try lobster Benedict served with sautéed spinach, tomato hollandaise and hash browns. There’s buttermilk-soaked, fried chicken set on thick French toast. As well as brown butter crepes topped with Chantilly cream, caramelised banana and Nutella. And yes, a rolling Bloody Mary cart.




At Park MGM, 3770, South Las Vegas Boulevard
Cost: Approximately $60 (a la carte for two)
After a $550-million revamp, the legendary Monte Carlo has become MGM Grand. From flashy casino chic to European elegance, this restaurant is typically ‘new’ Vegas. We sit outside soaking in the ‘South of France’ vibe in a garden dappled with sunlight.
Over multiple cups of darkly aromatic Columbian coffee, Marc Guastella, VP Food and beverage at Park MGM, says they wanted to take the café concept and give it a twist. “It has multiple facets depending on the season, so we can activate the space,” Guastella says, adding that they are deliberately moving away from the typical hustle of neon-lit Vegas.
We eat warm doughnuts served with whipped cream and tart lemon butter followed by sesame bagels topped with smoked salmon. There is French toast streaked with sticky maple syrup and a garden scramble of organic eggs with mushrooms, spinach and gooey Gruyère cheese.
There is more to come. NoMad will open next this year, marking the Vegas debut of Chef Daniel Humm of Eleven Madison Park, currently hailed as one of the world’s best restaurants. Italian chain Eataly will launch. And Korean American Chef Roy Choi, celebrated for his “food that isn’t fancy” style and Korean taco truck, Kogi, will open a Koreatown-inspired concept.




At The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas, Level 2, The Boulevard Tower
Cost: Sandwiches between $7 and $14
When you wake up with bleary, mascara-smudged eyes and last night’s lipstick, be like the hipsters. Just whip on sunglasses, call for a limo (try Bell, which sent us sleek SUVs with friendly chauffeurs and an impressive list of A-lister Hollywood clients) and pick up breakfast from Eggslut.
In the setting of over-the-top Vegas, Eggslut has chosen a small format setting with a short menu. And been extremely successful (they can serve up to 1,500 people every day). This is more of a takeaway counter than a restaurant, ideal when you want to crawl back into bed with a warm brioche and cold brew coffee. Be prepared to wait in line, probably along with a dozen excited, frantically-Instagramming millennials.
A spokesperson from Eggslut calls their short menu “simple, but effective,” stating that when they opened they wanted to offer a product that was missing from the market. The menu, launched by Chef Alvin Cailan, who built his reputation on decadently oozy egg sandwiches served out of a food truck, stays true to its roots. Try the Fairfax, a cage-free soft scrambled eggs and chives, cheddar cheese, caramelised onions and sriracha mayo in a warm brioche bun. On your way out, do not forget to grab a dark chocolate chip cookie, topped with grey salt. It’s baked fresh every morning and sells out quickly.

Snap, crackle and pop
","If you do not know how to eat a churro, a big instruction on the wall at the Churro 99 which reads ‘Snap, crackle and pop’ will guide you.
A new den for the foodies in the city, Churro 99 claims to be ‘better than a boyfriend’. Located in Siripuram, the brightly lit and vibrantly coloured place is hard to miss. A step inside and you are in the company of loud Hindi Bollywood music and a combination of yellow and green walls. 
Introducing churro to the city, the café serves the delicately made sweet sticks with dips like caramel, blueberry, strawberry, nutella and chocolate fudge. However, for those who prefer the deep-fried dough pastry to be crispy, thin and a little less on sweetness, the café wouldn’t be the right place.
The highlight of the place is the live ice cream roll counter. The loud music and conversations on the tables are occasionally interrupted by the sounds of two metal ice cream spatulas clattering together. 
After a journey of being beaten and flattened on a steel plate, the ice creams arrive at our table — Alphanso treat and extreme dark devil.
While the Alphanso treat wasn’t much of a treat to the taste buds, the extreme dark devil worked its charm. Bitterness of dark chocolate layered with nutella and topped with white choco chips made the rolls a heavenly combination.
For those who cannot handle the overdose of sweetness, the café also has options for you. From burgers and wraps to momos, the café definitely knows how to spice it up. Chicken wings, chicken lollipop and chicken popcorn are the most preferred spicy starters. 
“Earlier when we started off, waffles were the most sold on the menu but over the time people have been preferring momos, especially chicken peri peri momos and mix veg momos,” says K Sunil Kumar, owner of the café.
The café has recently registered itself on Uber Eats and has its whole menu on the app.

The Great Breakfast Buffet Migration
","If you haven’t been to the Masai Mara to witness the so-called Great Migration, fret not.
I’ll let you in on a far more feral and dramatic migration right in our midst. And compared to the wildlife I speak of – that too within touching distance – the wildebeest is about as exotic as a neighbourhood squirrel.
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to The Great Complimentary Breakfast Migration, featuring the buffetbeest (Gutgreedus indica).
Habitat
The buffetbeest can be sighted at any hotel/resort offering a complimentary breakfast buffet.
The coats
The male can be identified by his posterior cleavage. Observers will be treated to UHD views of furry male patootie crannies peeking-a-boo from ill-fitting track pants or shorts more than once during the course of their visit. A distended gut — navel fluff, and all — displayed ever so teasingly in the chasm between a stained tee one size too small and saggy pants, is a regular bonus. The male also sports a stubble, eye-bags, and lets off the subtle odour of yesterday’s garlic naan mixed with the morning’s cigarette.
Females (sighted in their best attire the previous night, perfect hairdos and makeup, preening for their selfies) assert their independence during the feed, and display their equality to their rear-baring spouses via their as-is-where-is dress code. Makeup is minimal. Just a bit of leftover toothpaste on the chin, accessorised with a forgotten plastic comb in the remains of the previous night’s elaborate bouffant. The expression: grrrrrr, don’t judge me, I live with this nasty furball, I need downtime.
The snot-nosed cubs can be seen in various states of undress, weeping, screaming, and head-butting anyone in their way right in the crotch.
Locomotion
The buffetbeest has a peculiar gait. The waddle says ‘leisurely’. But the keen eye and twitchy nose say ‘alert’. Most buffetbeests also wield a smartphone. To update their status on Insta with food pics. Or scream into with, say, elaborate details about the previous day’s bowel movement.
Feed one
The average buffetbeest starts with a large pile of life-affirming fruit. Because fruit is healthy, you see. So healthy that it can be followed by a four-egg cheese-bacon omelette topped with a chicken’s head, accompanied by six slices of French toast dipped in honey. With no consequences. A tempting bowl of sugary breakfast cereal soaked in watery milk sits on the side, just in case. After all, the buffetbeest knows famine could be round the corner.
Soon after this ‘western’ start, an overwhelming wave of nationalism sweeps over the buffetbeest, brought on by the aroma from the puri/batura counter.
Watering hole
Letting out a growl, the buffetbeest heads towards the fluffy, golden-brown balloons of wheaten joy, pushing a sluggish, but equally greedy, elder from the herd out of the way, when, hark — the colourful juice section catches his thirsty eye.
Passion fruit, watermelon and mango. Hmmmm? The buffetbeest scratches himself, thinking. Maybe one small glass each to rehydrate, and make up for the eight whiskies of last night? And it is fruit, after all. And fruit, as the buffetbeest knows, is healthy.
Feed two
Three steaming puri-cum-baturas with a tiny mountain of yellow potato hits the spot. The passion fruit juice tastes dispassionate, but the watermelon does the trick. Abandoning the mango seems like a good idea because, over the din of the herd’s gnashing teeth, the buffetbeest hears his cub say ‘bonda’.
Feed three
Or maybe the fresh sausages that have come in should be the way to go? Well, who said you can’t pair bondas with sausage? ‘Try the pancakes, jaanu,’ purrs the mate. ‘They are to die for.’ Indeed. But not if preceded by that ripe hill banana within picking distance.
After all, the doctor said fruit is healthy.

Sugar and Spice: It is the sweetest thing
","Annie Koshy spreads a thick layer of her home-made Java Plum jam on a piece of toast and proffers it to me. “This is our latest flavour. I hope you like it”, she says. Annie founded Sugar and Spice with her daughter Sapna Koshy in October 2017 and now sells seven flavours of jams, marmalades, preserves and fruit butters. I admire the bright purple jam on the crisp toast before biting into it. It is sweet with a fresh flavour of ripe jamuns. 
While Annie makes the products, Sapna markets them. “My father passed away last year and my mother had a hard time coping with the loss. I wanted to engage her in something to help her move on. She used to make banana jam when I was a child so I asked her to make some for me. She did and it was an instant hit with my friends,” recalls Sapna. Soon, they started to receive more orders and requests for other flavours.




About the products Sapna says that they experiment and scour the net for recipes. Now their menu boasts of flavours such as Banana Rum, Orange Cinnamon, Pineapple Ginger, Strawberry, Apple Cinnamon, Mango Jalapeno and Java Plum.
They agree that not all experiments went right.“One of our customers wanted a bottle of Pineapple Ginger jam with palm sugar as a substitute to white sugar. The jam turned was a dirty brown and tasted weird. We had no other choice but to dispose it”, says Sapna. She says that the combination of two different flavours (sweet and spice) in most of their products makes them popular. 




They make their products in small batches on order and buy their raw materials from local stores. It is two days of work to make a batch. The first day is for cleaning and cutting the fruits and the second is for preparation and packaging. Annie says that it takes her up to six hours to get the required consistency. She uses 250 ml glass bottles for packaging and they are sterilised before being filled. “Orange Cinnamon Marmalade is the most difficult to make. The white inner lining of the fruit peel has to be scraped off before cutting it into fine pieces. Even though it is hard to make, that is our favourite”, smiles Annie.
She makes Banana Rum fruit butter with Palayankodan bananas sourced from her farm in Kerala. “It gives a rich reddish-brown colour to the fruit butter. It goes well as a spread over your toast or with roti. There are a number of possibilities for our products. Apple Cinnamon can go as a filling for pies while Java Plum can either be used as a spread or be made into juice by mixing it with water. Mango Jalapeno tastes best as a dip for your chips, as a salad dressing or even as a marinade for meat,” explains Annie. 
“Our products contain no added colours, artificial preservatives, flavours or thickening agents. The only preservatives that go into our products are sugar and lime”, Sapna claims. Her products have a shelf life of three months if refrigerated and 10 days if not. 




On request they also customise their products using sugar substitutes. “It is for people with diabetes and these jams must be consumed within three days of it’s making.”
The mother and daughter are also working on a range of non-vegetarian pickles that they will introduce soon. Says Sapna, “We will soon do a quality and nutrition assessment test for our products and are in the process of setting up a Sugar and Spice website and will also launch the products online.”

A bottle costs ₹200-₹ 350 depending on the flavour.

The labour of our fruits
","Not sparing the rod — in a manner of speaking — does seem to have worked. When they were wee and eating solids, I gave the poor unsuspecting creatures whatever seasonal vegetable was to hand. When the elder was a few months old, I would make her khichri with grated vegetables in it and remember the odd combination of orange English carrots and deep green capsicum. Her delicate little fingers would pick out and eat the vegetable shreds not because she enjoyed eating them but because the colours were attractive. As for enjoying any food, that was rare. I’d distract her with a rattle-cum-whistle and quickly shovel in a spoonful of whatever was on her plate and she’d spit it out with some force just as quickly, spraying my neck with little grains of semolina or rice or whatever was the plât du jour.
The smaller one was easy to feed, apart from the troubles in getting my hand to his mouth fast enough. In the time it took to fashion a morsel and lift it to his open, waiting mouth, he, trembling with lust, would strain against my restraining arm and lunge at the plate. Of course this happened with watery chicken curry and soft phulkas. My mother taught me how to make it in the tiny pressure cooker that had been bought for his sister, by sautéing a large piece of chicken and half a potato with a little turmeric and then cooking it till the first whistle. I know it sounds disgusting but he loved it.
In favour of veg
When it came to the veggies… there wasn’t any lust but they had no option. By the time they grew a little and started eating whatever we ate, my bossiness was well established. They could eat meat — or chicken or fish or whatever — if they ate their vegetables. And second helpings were also defined: as large a helping of greens as of meat. They protested, especially the younger one, but I was mean. And now, a couple of decades later, it appears to have worked. 
I had a weekend visit from my son, who was home after months, been fed biryani and was asked what he wanted the next day, Assamese pork curry, Hamida’s Yakhni Pathan or what. His first response was “golden brown chicken curry”. Then he asked whether cauliflower was in season. It isn’t, but as we all know, everything is available 30/12, so I decided to make an exception. He cancelled the chicken and asked for gobi aloo and yellow moong masoor ki dal.
Amazing, but I should no longer be surprised. For years now, whatever the menu, he’s wanted salad and vegetables as well. He eats them first, to get them out of the way and be able to concentrate on the rest. But cancelling chicken in favour of veggies…! 
Can we have spinach?
My daughter has always — ever since she had the choice — liked her vegetables. When she’s due home, she starts texting with questions: What will I get for lunch when I land? Please can we have spinach? Or tori? And baingan? I remember writing about this, after a long trip: when I asked them what they wanted for their first meal back home, she said “A Large Salad, please”. And now that she’s cooking, she’s learning to play with spices, and loves putting together colourful, balanced meals of whole grains and vegetables. The boy doesn’t cook, but eats things he didn’t love as a child but was forced to: yoghurt, fruit and salad.




This theme, of trying to inculcate healthy eating habits in children, popped up strongly in my mind in the last few weeks because I had my lovely teenage niece visit. Just home from boarding school, she’s easygoing and pleasant, happy to read and chat and hug and wake up and shower at a proper hour, unlike my children… but her eating habits are very different. She will not touch a vegetable, cooked or raw. Kakri had just appeared, green and tender, dripping with juice, but she wouldn’t have it. Watermelon so sweet that I suspect foul play, is cut and served on the table. No. Mangoes? No. A mitigating factor is her love of milk and yoghurt, eggs and toast. 
But all she wants at mealtimes — or in between — is dosa, paratha, the pav of pav bhaji (no bhaji), cheese toast, Bikaneri bhujia and pizza. Bhindi, peas, cauliflower, spinach, lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, any variety of gourds, pumpkin? No, no, no. Now her mother and I are devising a plan to change the regime. Unfortunately, one can’t tempt her with something new, saying “Try it — you might like it”. She won’t try it. Her mother resorts to “hiding” vegetables in dal and kneads them into roti dough. I clearly remember the years of effort, day in and day out, getting the little monsters to eat healthy. I’d say it was worth it. This recipe by Yotam Ottolenghi looks obvious, but I’ve only recently tried it. And I know that they’ll now eat this with a smile.
SPICED CHICKPEA WITH FRESH VEGETABLE SALAD
Serves 4
½ cup dried chickpeas, kabuli chana
2 small cucumbers
2 large tomatoes
1 small red onion, peeled
6 small red radishes, or half a large white one
1 red pepper, seeds and pith removed
2 tbsp coriander leaves and stems, roughly chopped
1 tbsp flat-leaf parsley, picked and roughly chopped
½ cup olive oil
Grated zest of 2 lemons, plus 3 tbsp lemon juice
2 tbsp sherry vinegar (or malt vinegar)
1 clove garlic, crushed
1 tsp sugar
Salt and black pepper
½ tsp ground green cardamom seeds
1 tsp ground cumin
2 tbsp yoghurt (optional)
Soak the chickpeas overnight in a large bowl of cold water. Next day, drain, place in a pressure cooker, add a cup of water and salt, and cook on high heat till full steam is built up (one whistle); lower heat and cook for another 20 minutes. When pressure in cooker naturally reduces, open, take out chickpeas, and drain. 
Cut the cucumber, tomato, onion, radish and pepper into 1cm dice, and mix with the coriander and parsley. In a jar or sealable container, put half the olive oil with the lemon juice and zest, vinegar, garlic and sugar, shake and season to taste. Pour the dressing over the salad and toss lightly. Mix the cardamom, cumin and a quarter-teaspoon of salt, and spread on a plate. 
Toss the cooked chickpeas in the spice mixture in batches, to coat well. Heat the remaining oil in a frying pan and over medium heat, lightly fry the chickpeas for two to three minutes, gently shaking the pan so they cook evenly and don’t stick. Keep warm. In a shallow salad bowl, place the salad vegetables in a large circle with a slight indent in the middle, and spoon the warm chickpeas in the centre. Drizzle some yoghurt on top if you prefer the salad to be a bit more creamy.

A hearty experience at Diggin
","It was a bright and sunny day and we had a lunch date with a dear friend and a much loved niece. We had to decide where we were going to eat. The friend is adventurous about food but her daughter – the afore-mentioned much loved niece, henceforth to be referred to as MLN – is not. We know she likes pasta and vegetables, so we suggested that we meet at Diggin in the Santushti Complex.
Alert readers will recall that I’d had a great meal some years ago at Diggin in Anand Lok. I loved the place not just for its food but for the funky and cheerful décor. It was humming with joy and was brightly lit.
The new Diggin at Santushti is equally charming. There is an open air sitting area and the restaurant indoors is nice and cosy. You get a warm feeling in Diggin and I suppose that has something to do with the smiling and helpful staff and the very happy bistro-like interiors.
I looked at the menu and found that it had many of the dishes that the old Diggin is known for. I remember I was really happy with my first meal there – which was an all-pork affair.
A leopard doesn’t change its spots and a pork lover sticks to what he loves – in one word, pork. I found what I wanted the moment I opened the menu – an all pork sandwich (₹455). My wife asked for a ham and cheese sandwich (₹425), the friend ordered a pan-seared river sole (₹565) and the MLN wanted fettuccini pesto (415).




Generous helping
The helpings were huge, and the food was delicious. My sandwich was superb, packed as it was with bacon, ham and pork sausages. It came with fries and a side salad. I had a bite from the ham-and-Swiss cheese sandwich, too, and found it cheesy-gooey and filled with ham. The friend enjoyed the fish, which came in a tangy lime sauce with a green salad on the side. And the MLN loved her pine nut-filled pasta so much that she was uncharacteristically quiet while she ate.
We ended the meal with a smooth and chocolaty tiramisu that we shared, and cups of hot cappuccino. We would have liked to have dawdled over our coffee but people were queuing up. We had booked a table in advance and would advise everybody to do so, too.
Diggin has some special dishes of the day, which are mentioned on a blackboard outside the restaurant. I think they had some grilled rosemary chicken the day we were there.
The salad section has quite a few dishes that actually make you want to go off entrées. They have, for instance, a smoked salmon salad, a citrus chicken salad and an artichoke, baby corn and fennel salad. The vegetarian pizza section has toppings of artichoke and mushroom; goat cheese and grilled vegetables and there’s something called a farmer’s fresh veg pizza. But I know what I want – it’s called porky pizza, and consists of mozzarella cheese, pepperoni, ham, bacon and salami.
But that will be after a while. Right now I have to tend to a heart that has been misbehaving and arteries that don’t want to forget the rich food I had been eating all these years. But one day, soon, I shall say oink to the porky pizza.

Overcoming the blues
","Reports of designer and businesswoman Kate Spade’s suicide and struggle with depression have transformed her from a symbol of polished prep to a blunt reminder that suffering affects all types. A few days later we woke up to the news that another beloved figure, Anthony Bourdain, had taken his life.
These two tragedies have inspired hundreds to tweet some version of the same message: Mental illness is nothing to be ashamed of.
Extending a hand
But deep in the comment threads, some have also been debating a more uncomfortable question: What do you do when a friend is depressed for such a long time that you’ve started to feel that that nothing you can do will make a difference, and your empathy reserves are tapped out? There are no easy answers. But here are some tips from experts.
Don’t underestimate the power of showing up: You may not feel that your presence is wanted. But just being by the side of someone who is depressed, and reminding her that she is special to you, is important to ensuring that she does not feel alone, says Dr. Norman Rosenthal, a clinical professor of psychiatry at Georgetown University School of Medicine, U.S.
If she acknowledges she’s depressed, that’s a good sign, says Dr. Rosenthal. He recalled the story of a patient who stopped feeling suicidal after telling people he was close to how he was feeling.
“When you shine the light on the shame, it gets better,” Dr. Rosenthal says.
Don’t try to cheer him up or offer advice: Your brother has an enviable job and two lovely children. He’s still ridiculously handsome even though he hasn’t gone to the gym for six months. It’s tempting to want to remind him of all these good things.
Not only is that unlikely to boost his mood, it could backfire by reinforcing his sense that you just don’t get it, says Megan Devine, a psychotherapist and the author of It’s O.K. That You’re Not O.K.
“Your job as a support person is not to cheer people up. It’s to acknowledge that it sucks right now, and their pain exists,” she says.
Instead of upbeat rebuttals about why it’s not so bad, she recommends trying something like, “It sounds like life is really overwhelming for you right now.”
If you want to say something positive, focus on highlighting what he means to you, Dr. Rosenthal advises. And though offering suggestions for how to improve his life will be tempting, simply listening is better.
It’s O.K. to ask if she is having suicidal thoughts: Lots of people struggle with depression without ever considering suicide. But depression is often a factor.
Although you may worry that asking, “Are you thinking about killing yourself?” will insult someone you’re trying to help — or worse, encourage her to go in that direction — experts say the opposite is true.
“It’s important to know you can’t trigger suicidal thinking just by asking about it,” says Allen Doederlein, the executive vice president of external affairs at the Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance. If the answer is yes, it’s crucial that you calmly ask when and how; it’s much easier to help prevent a friend from hurting herself if you know the specifics.
Take any mention of death seriously: Even when a person with depression casually mentions death or suicide, it’s important to ask follow-up questions. If the answers don’t leave you feeling confident that a depressed person is safe, experts advise involving a professional as soon as possible. If this person is seeing a psychiatrist or therapist, get him or her on the phone.
If that’s not an option, have the person you’re worried about call a suicide prevention line or take her to the hospital emergency room; say aloud that this is what one does when a loved one’s life is in danger.
In some cases, calling a helpline may be the best option. If you do, ask for a crisis intervention team, Mr. Doederlein urges.
But remember that interactions with law enforcement can vary wildly, depending on race and socio-economic background. In cases where you’re concerned that calling police could put a person in danger, try to come up with an alternate plan in advance.
Make getting to that first appointment as easy as possible: You alone cannot fix this problem, no matter how patient and loving you are. A severely depressed friend needs professional assistance from a psychologist, psychiatrist, social worker or another medical professional.
Yeah, you know. You’ve told your boyfriend this, but it’s been months — or maybe even years — and he still has not set anything up.
“You can’t control someone else’s recovery,” says Kimberly Williams, president and chief executive of the Mental Health Association of New York City. But you can try to make getting to that first appointment as easy as possible.
That might mean sitting next to your friend as he calls to make the appointment, finding counselling that he can afford, or even going with him that first time, if you’re comfortable with it.
What if you’re not sure whether you should start with a therapist or a psychiatrist, or whether you’ve found the perfect person? Ask around for recommendations, and know that one practitioner may ultimately lead to another.
But don’t overthink it. The key initially is just getting a professional involved so you are not the only person managing this situation. (That said, if that first appointment seems really unhelpful, trust your instincts and find someone else.)
Take care of yourself and set boundaries: When the thoughtful and kind people we’ve loved for years are depressed, they may also become uncharacteristically mean and self-centred. It’s exhausting, painful and hard to know how to respond when they pick fights or send nasty texts.
“You don’t have to attend every argument you are invited to,” Ms. Devine says.
Still, just because someone is depressed is not a reason to let their abusive behaviour slide. Set clear boundaries with straightforward language such as, “It sounds like you’re in a lot of pain right now. But you can’t call me names.”
Similarly you may find that your friend’s demands on your time are starting to sabotage other relationships or your job. You’re not going to be able to help if you’re not in a good place yourself.
It’s O.K. not to be available 24x7, but try to be explicit about when you can and cannot help. One way to do this, Ms. Devine advises, is to say: “I know you’ve been really struggling a lot, and I really want to be here for you. There are times that I physically can’t do that.”
Come up with a contingency plan and kindly push her to stick with it. Coming up with a consistent schedule for when you’ll see each other every week can be helpful to you both.
Remember, people do recover from depression
It can be hard when you’re in the middle of the storm with a depressed friend to remember that there was a time before, and hopefully an after, this miserable state. But it’s essential to remind yourself — and the person you’re trying to help — that people do emerge from depression. Because they do.
I have seen it. Every single one of the experts quoted here has seen it, too. But it will take patience and time. NY TIMES

Fair and healthy
","Enhancing access to health care is becoming a central component of India’s welfare policy. Central and State governments have now developed a variety of schemes such as better primary health care, health insurance, free or subsidised drugs and mass screening for chronic diseases. However, out-of-pocket health expenditures still remain high. Reasons for this are a widespread preference for ‘quality’ health care provided by the private sector, and the perception that they treat patients with respect in a ‘respectable’ manner. In government settings, either one — or sometimes both — is/are missing. Health care is usually seen as a market failure, and in India, it has, first and foremost, been a government failure. The government has neither provided sufficient care nor the resources to meet the public requirement for health care.
Our life expectancy in 2016 (59 years) was still one year behind what China’s was in 1990. India continues to be a world leader in all levels of premature mortality, with one of the highest levels of out-of-pocket health expenditure and performs poorly on a variety of other health indices.
To counter their failures and be seen as siding with the public, the Central and certain State governments have been expanding the scope of private health-care pricing. It is not as if the private sector is a knight in shining armour. Some argue that the private health sector has connived to keep the public health sector in bad shape so that its own market flourishes. However, given the scale of the government’s failure in health care, either from the perspective of provisioning or financing it, this argument can hardly be true.
Situating the private sector
The private sector emerged and flourished in the first place due to government failure in provisioning health care. As the government has been unable to tackle the issue of financing care, it has tried to shift the blame for high out-of-pocket health expenditures on the private sector. It was able to do so because various segments of the private health sector (doctors, hospitals, pharma and medical equipment companies and diagnostic centres) have colluded in propagating unethical practices to take undue advantage of people in some of their most personal and difficult times, providing an opportunity to the political class to politicise the issue and emerge as guardians in their own right.
However, politicisation is not the solution and will only worsen the already precarious state of health care. Whatever be the evils of the private sector, it has enhanced access to quality care, and by virtue of that, contributed to enhanced productivity and quality of life. Using the instrument of pricing alone to solve the issue of access to quality health care will not work. Government allocation to health care has to increase substantially along with public provisioning of care where the private sector is, and will continue to be, missing. The private sector, on its part, needs to operate rationally and ethically, vis-à-vis pricing as well as in the provisioning of care in neglected areas.
Where the onus lies
The need for regulation of health-care pricing will remain even if the government enhances its allocations. Given the level of demand, no amount of allocation will be sufficient for health care and resources will always be limited. One sustainable way out is for the private sector to self-introspect vis-à-vis pricing and discuss the determinants and challenges of pricing with the government. The government should have a visionary approach. For example, it could revise tariffs and taxes levied on various arms of the private health sector provided it is willing to engage in rational and ethical pricing at its own end. At the end of the day, both sides should think about how best they can improve the health of the citizens.

A new ally in the cancer fight
","In a first, researchers from India will study the proteins and genes of cancer tumours simultaneously. The aim of the merger between the two promising sciences (proteomics and genomics) is to derive new medications as well as offer personalised cancer therapies.
Last month, India became the 12th country to join the International Cancer Proteogenome Consortium (ICPC) of the National Cancer Institute (NCI), U.S. It is a forum for collaboration among the world’s leading cancer and proteogenomic research centres. In the Indian team, the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IITB) is to study proteomics and the Tata Memorial Hospital (TMH), Mumbai, India’s premier cancer institute, is to study the genomics of three cancers, breast, head and neck, and cervix. As a pilot project, the researchers will be studying 100 samples from each of these cancers.
A first for India
“This is for the first time that proteomics and genomics of the cancer tumours will be looked at by taking the same samples. There are a few such projects in the world but none in India so far,” says Dr. Sanjeeva Shrivastava, Associate Professor, and group leader of the proteomics laboratory, IITB. “The data analysis and interpretation are going to be challenging but worth the effort,” he says.
The field of genomics involves studying all the possible genes in the system or the organism and also analysing their mutations. Through an intricate process, DNA, which is the storehouse of genetic instructions, makes proteins. Tweaking this manufacture can mean influencing the kind of protein products, and consequently, vital molecules for life.
“This is the reason why drug makers target proteins to look at inhibitors or therapeutics. Studying proteins is extremely challenging and any findings therefore become extremely relevant in terms of novel and better treatments,” says Dr. Shrivastava. While there are an estimated 20,000 genes, there are many more proteins. “Proteins are in the millions and thus complicated to study. We don’t have any accurate estimates as they further get modified,” he explains.
According to the NCI, previous studies have shown that genomic changes are not always present at the protein level. This suggests that the additional level of proteomic analysis can lead to an enhanced understanding of tumour resistance and/or toxicity to therapy and can one day offer the ability to predict treatment response by examining drug response or toxicity. The website says: “As a result, the ICPC teams believe that integrating genomic and proteomic data together can provide more information and insight into cancer’s development and growth.”
According to Dr. Shrivastava, given the small sample size in the pilot phase, they will look for answers for extremely focussed questions. “For example, breast cancers have many subtypes. So we may consider looking at one particular subtype like ‘triple negative’. Within them, we will look at the response to a particular therapy,” he says.
Peek at the future
The five-year project will attempt to carry out the pilot phase with funds from the institutes. Eventually, it will look at funds from government and philanthropic organisations. While it will take years for results, Dr. Shrivastava is optimistic and ambitious. “Can we have a robust technology that can help us get protein reports in 24 hours, just like blood reports? Can we offer quick treatment protocols that are unique and personalised instead of simply offering standard chemotherapy for all? This is what we are looking at eventually.”
A study published this month in The New England Journal of Medicine says that 70% of early-stage breast cancer patients who would normally be candidates for chemotherapy based on their clinical features actually do not need the treatment. The study claims that women could skip toxic chemotherapy cycles and only take a drug that blocks the hormone oestrogen. The findings, based on gene tests carried out on tumour samples, are most likely to cause an overhaul of cancer treatment worldwide.
Dr. Sudeep Gupta, medical oncologist, TMH, says that essentially there are two methods of inquiring into tumours — genomics and proteomics. “Till now, there has been no handshake between the two. This new project is looking at an integrated approach by getting researchers in both fields together. This will definitely open new targets in terms of cancer treatment,” he says.

For a Lebanese Ramadan "," The Saidon (south Lebanon) based Chef Ahmed Ammouri, is back in Bengaluru, a city where he has quite a fan following from his stint at the Taj West End. He will be heading the month-long Lebanese food festival that is being held at Shangri La.
He has worked with royalty and dignitaries such as Najib Mikati (The Prime Minister of Lebanon), the King of Morocco, Sultan of Muscat and Prince of Saudi Arabia. At Bengaluru, Chef Ammouri presents a buffet of traditional Lebanese delicacies.
The festival’s special menu will feature a variety of 15 salads or cold mezze and freshly grilled meats. Quintessential signatures including dips and salads like fattoush (levantine bread salad made with toasted Arabic flat bread), mutabbal (a grilled eggplant and tahini dip), and the famous chickpea hummus start the guests off. Dishes like bazella (a hearty, spiced stew), shawarma, mulukhiyah chicken (leafy green stew), Lebanese lamb chops, moussaka (an eggplant and/or potato based dish with minced meat), and batate harra (spiced potatoes) make up the main course. Speciality desserts like Basboosa (semolina cake soaked in syrup) and baklava (layered filo pastry stuffed with nuts and coated with syrup) complete the meal. Bringing a close on the age-old battle of the origin of baklava, chef Ammouri says “It is originally from Lebanon, but everyone makes his own version of baklava”.




Being one of the first Lebanese chefs to move to India, the chef introduced his customers to dishes beyond hummus and shawarma. He presented new flavours through dishes such as tabbouleh (green salad with parsley and tomatoes), and baba ghanoush (an eggplant dip), and his all-time favourite muhammara (a roasted red pepper and walnut spread), widening the scope for Lebanese cuisine in India. 
“Now Lebanese food culture has grown and everyone knows about it, but there are few occasions where I have to add spices to cater to the Indian palette,” he adds. 
The difference, he explains, is that even though both cuisines use a variety of spices, Indian food has more spice. He enjoys experimenting with new spices and dishes as a way of expanding his skill set and menu. He says “people know more about different cuisines and are more adventurous with food now. I have lived in India for eight years and Lebanese food has become popular over time.”
According to the chef, Lebanese food is light and healthy and is cooked with lots of olive oil, nuts, and spices including anise, sumac, cinnamon, cardamom, sweet spice and seven spice (the Lebanese version of garam masala). Unlike in the Gulf where rice is a staple, the Lebanese prefer bread. Baking and grilling are the central cooking methods, few dishes involve frying. “Lamb and beef are the main meats, and we consume a lot of these red meats,” says the chef. “The meats are not the same and at times you don’t get the exact ingredients like tahini here, so it becomes a challenge for me to bring out the exact flavours.” 




By combining local produce with imported spices he aims at presenting the most authentic Lebanese flavours. “When I was 16 or 17 and studying, I lived alone and had to cook for myself. I learned a little from my mom and that is when I started to enjoy cooking,” says the award-winning chef. Keeping in tune with his birth and heritage the chef choose to specialise in Lebanese food and trained professionally in Cyprus.
In the beginning of his career, he cooked in Cyprus for the Syrian embassy, where he worked as a chef for the ambassador for 12 years. Then he moved to India, where he worked at Taj Mahal Mumbai in 2001 after which he was relocated to the Taj West End Bangalore in 2005.
After spending eight years in India he moved back to his home country and started Bayte Baytak, a restaurant that served local cuisine. Following the closure of his restaurant, the chef visited Chennai in 2015 for The Raintree Food Festival that went on for 17 days. This is his latest visit since the food festival in Chennai. After completing his visit to Bengaluru, he heads back to Lebanon to prepare for his next promotion in Istanbul and for the opening of his new restaurant named Dar–Almer or King’s House.

Bright Raj on bringing flavours of West Africa in the Deccan
"," Donning a black tank top and a vibrant yellow skirt, Thangasurabi ‘Bright’ Raj hurries around her spacious apartment in Banjara Hills which she shares with a friend. The skirt, she says, sports a Dashiki print, also known as the Angelina print; the textile’s rich history dates back to the 19th Century in West Africa, and the fabric is now popularised by street-style. But it’s not Bright’s fashion that’s the focus here, it’s the smell of peppers and roast chicken wafting through the flat.
The 35 year-old, whose mother is from Madurai and father is from Lagos, is fluent in Tamil. She’s lived in the country for most of her life having travelled to Nepal and Singapore and other parts of south east Asia frequently. Bright studied Fashion Design and Information Technology at NIFT Chennai, and went on to complete her Masters in English Literature, and then worked as a content writer for seven years. 
 ‘Plantain is a staple food as well as tapioca roots and colocasia — these are the bases. We have fuffu which is one such dish derived from this,’ says Bright
Bright has prepared maafe, a traditional peanut soup which originated from Mali. On top of the orange soup are a few golden plantain chips and roasted chicken wings. She places the bowl before us and asks us to dig in while she speaks of her love for cooking, “My mother was a working mother, so she didn’t have much time to cook. That’s when I would dabble with cooking and when I moved to Bangalore, I worked at a food website for three and a half years. That’s when I was exposed to countless foods and recipes with which to experiment. Plus living in Singapore, I got a real taste for south east Asian cuisine given I was living with a Chinese family. So my culinary experience has been building up.” Last year, Bright moved to Hyderabad in December, then she decided to pursue food as a professional pursuit fully after quitting her job in April. 
Bright’s cooking studio, Sinfully Delicious, currently hosts Thai and Italian culinary classes. “After quitting my job in April, I was finalising what would be in each curriculum, planning out my budget and other logistics. In the city there are a lot of established cooking classes which primarily offer baking and Indian dishes mostly, but not a lot of other cuisines, and definitely not of the West African variety. I wanted to give something unique where potential students can go home and feel like they have actually learned something very new. I want to open up their minds to these new flavours.” Bright points out that her classes are pocket-friendly and a lot more homely for those who truly enjoy cooking for people. 
On the West African route




According to Bright, many of similarities lie between Indian and West African cuisines. “We use ingredients such as cumin, turmeric, cardamom — but they are obviously used differently. During the colonial times, Europeans took with them a lot of the local plants and ingredients and cultivated them along their exploratory routes. As Indians, we love okra, but okra comes from West Africa and is one of the most readily-available ingredients here. In West Africa, the most important ingredients are onions, tomatoes and peppers.” 
“Plantain is a staple food as well as tapioca roots and colocasia — these are the bases. We have fuffu which is one such dish derived from this,” she observes, “But across West Africa, the cooking itself is so mosaical; with the resources available and the differing climates. What I have learned is there are still similarities such as kasava, yam, potatoes — basically tubers. And of course, you have lots of vegetables. In Niger, you have thick rainforests and a river delta where fresh fruits and vegetables are used commonly. For meats, you have guinea fowl and other indigenous poultry, too.” 
The continual cross-overs in ingredients throughout history is a valuable bi-product and Bright is ready to dole out such nuggets of information throughout her classes. The course also features touches of Cameroon with its Ndolé or bitter leaf casserole, the country’s ultimate surf ‘n’ turf indulgence. Kenkey, the staple answer to sourdough dumplings, is also on the course. In terms of ingredients, Bright has ensured that she is not teaching anything that doesn’t comprise of difficult-to-acquire ingredients, adding that the more culturally specific ingredients can be bought off Amazon in an instant. 
If the home-chef could use just five words to describe the array of cuisines in West Africa, she instantly says, “Warm, comforting, diverse, tasty, and simple. At the end of the day, cooking brings people together; good food can actually stop wars!”
Bright Raj’s West African cooking classes commence June 19 and run until July 28. Check her Facebook page ‘Sinfully Delicious Cooking Studio’ for more information. Call 9242775552 for more information.

Indian Medical Association launches awareness drive on sexual health
"," The Indian Medical Association (IMA) has launched a nationwide movement to eradicate the social taboo associated with sexual health.
Dr. Ravi Wankhedkar, the IMA national president, stressed the importance of the initiative and said that sex still being a taboo, doctors across India needed to break all the barriers and clinical inertias.
This is the first-of-its-kind initiative launched by the IMA for over three-and-a-half lakh doctors to motivate them to dispel the taboo associated with this subject.
Education must be imparted at school to dispel the taboo associated with this subject. Increasing awareness among schools and colleges by various means will also be a part of this agenda.
The plan of action of this initiative is to hold pan-India educational programmes and also adopt schools and colleges to educate one and all -- students, teachers and parents -- by holding lectures, seminars, symposia, conferences and dialogues.
Plans are also afoot to hold fellowship course and national conferences. 
“IMA also proposed a plan of action to increase the awareness amongst the medical fraternity to change their mindset and attitude towards the taboo subject of sexual health, Dr Wankhedkar said.
As a pilot project, a 12-month fellowship programme in clinical sexology has also been started for doctors who are MD and above and proposes to start similar courses for MBBS doctors with at least five years of experience.

Palette of plant healers
","Plants such as tulsi or hibiscus have been part of Indian gardens, even if the garden is relegated to a pot on the balcony, for centuries now. Just that over the decades, many other plants, which would have otherwise been staples have disappeared in urban homes and are gradually making a comeback.
Most such plants have potent medicinal value – doddapatre (Indian Borage/ ajwain leaf), adusoge (Adathoda vasica/Vasa/Malabar nut) or mehendi (henna/Lawsonia inermis), for example, which our grandmothers had efficiently worked into their families’ lifestyles. Some of these plants, including Aloe Vera, Bhoomi amla, Brahmi, Bhringaraja, Basale soppu, Hibiscus, Shatavari, Shankapushpi, Tulsi and Baje can be grown in pots at home while others such as Pomegranate, Moringa or the Ashoka mara need more space, as they grow into trees. Plants such as Bilva, for instance, are not easy to grow at home and can be procured in shops that sell native medicine or produce.
On the occasion of World Environment Day, The Green Path and Om Sri Sairam Deeksha Training Centre organised a workshop on the ‘role of medicinal plants in primary healthcare – home remedies’ at The Green Path Organic State premises in Malleswaram.
The workshop was conducted by Dr MJ Prabhu, an Ayurvedic doctor and medicinal plants consultant with the Karnataka State Medicinal Plants Authority as well as Dr Pushpa, Asian facilitator, FAO (on Traditional Herbal Food in Healing Systems). Guests at the event were Ashish Kumar Ballal, Former India hockey captain, Olympian and Arjuna awardee; EP Nivedita, Principal Accountant General (A & E), Karnataka; and Dr Latha TS, PRO, KSRTC and Chairperson, Public Relation Council of India, Bangalore.
“It is possible to handle certain recurring or bothersome medical conditions through medicinal plants, if one knows to use them,” said Dr Prabhu beginning his session. “There are remedies for a range of conditions from acidity to indigestion, gastro-intestinal issues, diabetes, jaundice, UTI, menstrual problems, or joint pains, in medicinal plants.” 
Medicinal plants and their benefits according to Dr Prabhu
Amritaballi /Giloy /Tinospora cordifolia: While the leaves of this herbaceous vine are nutritious, the potency in this plant lies in its stem. The stem is ready to be used when mature and flaky. The mature stem can be cut into pieces and used to make a reduced concoction with water. It is useful in handling acidity and gastro-intestinal issues as well as skin diseases. It can be consumed with buttermilk in order to heal the early stages of piles. It is also a haemostatic and can be used to control excess bleeding during menstrual cycles. Its value is enhanced when combined with dry ginger powder, black pepper powder or long pepper. 
Adusoge/Vasa /Adathoda vasica /Malabar nut:
 The leaves of this plant are known to cure asthma. Powdered Adusoge leaves can be combined with dry ginger powder, haritaki powder, and honey for the same. Green tea, made from dry Adusoge leaves help heal thyroid as well as tonsillitis and related conditions. They can be used to make home-made cough syrups. An extract of steamed Adusoge leaves can be combined with sugar candy, for dry cough and honey, black pepper and ginger, for wet cough. 
Madhunashini/Gurmar/Gymnema Sylvestre: 
This climber is known to be a potent medicine for diabetes. The leaves of this plant (five to seven leaves) can be chewed and swallowed with a glass of water. Powdered leaves of Madhunashini can be mixed with warm water and consumed an hour before food to battle constipation. They help combat malnutrition and are known to improve intestinal absorption and handle indigestion.
Ashwagandha/Withania somnifera:
 The roots of the Ashwagandha are known to have several benefits. A paste made from Ashwagandha leaves can be consumed with honey to aid weight-loss. The roots of the plant are known to have anti-aging properties and are known to induce sleep. Three to five grams of powdered Ashwagandha root combined with milk, when consumed at bedtime, can be beneficial for joint pains. 
Alale Kayi/Haritaki/Terminalia chebula: 
This plant, unlike the other plants mentioned above, is not meant to be a potted plant and can’t be typically grown in a home garden. However, the product is available in most native or indigenous medicine stores. It is one of the three constituents of Triphala. It is known to help heal gangrene as well as scars, when combined with ghee and honey. It is known to ease bowel movement while also arresting conditions such as IBS and amoebiasis. It is known to arrest bleeding gums when used as a tooth powder in combination with salt and clove powder. Gargling a concoction of Haritaki can heal tonsillitis and mouth ulcers.

‘Surgery in a pill’ may help treat diabetes: study ","Scientists have developed a less invasive and effective treatment for reversing type 2 diabetes, one that can offer the same benefits as surgery.
In a study published in the journal Nature Materials, researchers administered an oral agent in rats to deliver a substance that could temporarily coat the intestine to prevent nutrient contact with the lining in the proximal bowel and avoid post-meal spikes in blood sugar.
“We envision a pill that a patient can take before a meal that transiently coats the gut to replicate the effects of surgery,” said Jeff Karp from Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH) in the US. “Over the last several years, we have been working with our surgical colleagues on this idea and have developed a material that meets an important clinical need.”
Over the last decade, bariatric surgeons have made strides in performing weight loss surgery that not only reverses obesity but can also reverse type 2 diabetes in patients with both conditions. Despite dramatic improvements in quality of life and diabetes remission, the number of patients who pursue surgery remains relatively low, researchers said.
They searched for a starting material that would have just the right properties to adhere to the small intestine and then dissolve within a matter of hours. The researchers selected a substance known as sucralfate, an approved drug in the US that is used in the treatment of gastrointestinal ulcers. The team further engineered the substance into a novel material that can coat the lining of the intestine without requiring activation by gastric acid.
The engineered compound, referred to as LuCI (Luminal Coating of the Intestine), can be made into a dry powdered form that can be encapsulated as a pill.
“What we have developed here is essentially, ‘surgery in a pill,’” said Yuhan Lee, a materials scientist in the BWH. “We have used a bioengineering approach to formulate a pill that has good adhesion properties and can attach nicely to the gut in a preclinical model. And after a couple of hours, its effects dissipate.”
The team found that once in the intestine of rats, LuCI can coat the gut, forming a thin barrier that alters nutrient contact and lowers blood glucose response after a meal. After a meal, blood sugar levels rise and can stay elevated over time. However, one hour after LuCI was administered to the rats, the response to glucose was lowered by 47 per cent. The team found that this response was temporary, and after three hours, the effect essentially disappeared.
The team is now testing the effect of short- and long-term use of LuCI in diabetic and obese rodent models. They also plan to advance some of their pilot studies showing that LuCI can be used to deliver drugs, including proteins directly to the gastrointestinal tract.

Sunshine on a plate
"," The last time we climbed the staircase inside Grandmama’s Café in Juhu, we found good Goan meat at the end. The now shuttered Porto & Poie, with its azulejo tiles and black and white photographs, won us over with its simple, comforting Goan food and innovative cocktails. Today, climbing the staircase leads us to another Goan place, this time helmed by a couple — Lloyd and Nerissa Braganza — who are as passionate about cooking Goan food as we are about eating it.
Branching out
The interiors haven’t changed much, with the exception of a few embellishments. The photographs on the wall are from Lloyd’s family. There are still plates on the ceiling and the upholstery is the same but the walls are covered in artwork showcasing life in Goa, the colourful caricatures reminding us of the great Mario Miranda and his take on local life. House of Lloyd started off in the Braganzas’ garden in Candolim, where it soon became known for its grilled food. 
Now, this House has made its way to Mumbai where it hopes to introduce the city to authentic Goan food. “No, we don’t serve vegetarian sorpotel here though we have been asked,” says Nerissa, with a smile. There’s no fish vindaloo either. 
Instead, the menu is replete with Goan Catholic food, some of which has been inspired by the Portuguese. There are beef croquettes (packed with meat and crumb fried), rissois, tongue roast and a fiery pork vindaloo, and kismoor. One bite of the gravy soaked Anant Gadho’s Ros Omelette (₹400) and it felt like we were standing outside a stall at the Margao bus stand, chomping down on that filling midnight treat. The omelette – fluffy and stacked with onions and green chillies — was sandwiched between two halves of a chicken gravy soaked poee making for a messy starter. The Agassaim Sausage Chilli Fry (₹400) won us over with its spicy aroma; the sausage cooked with heaps of onions and potatoes to be mopped up with even more poee.
Spiced just right
There was poee (₹60) with everything and we weren’t complaining, starved as we are for a taste of that versatile, pita-like bread. We used it to mop up the Mutton Xacuti (₹550) starring tender pieces of meat engulfed in dry roasted spices and heavy on the coconut, and the Goan Fish Curry (₹500), which had filets of bhetki swimming in a bright orange curry redolent with kokum and tirphal. We aren’t too fond of a fish curry that has boneless fish but luckily, there was other food to distract us from this oversight. Kokum (or sola as the Goans call it) also made its way into a tangy cocktail, Amsol Twist (₹600) and the lightly seasoned Sungta Solache (₹700), prawns cooked in light stew-like gravy. 
As the meal progressed, so did the spice quotient. Our favourite was Nerissa’s Prawns Balchao (₹650), that vinegar and masala-laden prawn pickle. Meant to be eaten as a side dish or a pickle, Nerissa and Lloyd spoke about people often confusing it for a gravy dish. “They expect fresh prawns and this tangy curry but that’s not a proper balchao. We salt and dry our prawns before making the balchao so that they last longer,” says Lloyd. 
Family production
All the masalas used at House of Lloyd are made in-house, using ingredients sourced from Goa. The sorpotel on the menu comes from their home kitchen — his mother Celia cooks it and that’s why the dish is named after her. Poees come in every week, which means it gets a bit dry by the time it reaches the table. In their bid to stay true to Goan food, the couple hasn’t strayed too much on the fusion route. They do have a few experimental vegetarian dishes, which take inspiration from Hindu Goan cuisine. Our pick is the Kelfool Melgor (₹450), a dry dish was a flavourful and crunchy mixture of banana blossom cooked with gherkins, black gram and a dash of coconut.
Dessert here, are Nerissa’s domain. The star was Tender Coconut Souffle (₹350), a dessert made with condensed milk, gelatin, sugar, coconut water and chunks of tender coconut. It’s a soft, creamy but light. The sawdust pudding, Serradurra (₹350), was equally delicious, made with real biscuit crumbs and whipped cream. Her famous Bread Pudding (₹350) reminded us of a Christmas cake — studded as it was with rum and Cointreau soaked dried fruits. The specialty of the restaurant may be the grilled food (which is only available in the evening) but we will return for the desserts.
House of Lloyd, like its predecessor, is expensive. But, the food is good and the D’Souzas are extremely passionate about showcasing real Goan food.

From the bazaars of Hyderabad
","A whiff of spices invites me to Nizam’s Khana, the Hyderabadi food festival at Fairfield by Marriott. Waiters are clad in white kurta-pyjama and traditional prayer caps on their heads. A live counter at a side serves fish, chicken and beef kebabs. I settle down to a glass of Hyderabadi lassi to start that somehow reminds me of the flavour of sweet paan. G. Somu, the head chef tells me why. “I have added a twist to the drink by adding gulkand in it that is used in meetha fan, an integral part of Hyderabadi cuisine.” He recommends I try Haleem. Garnished with caramelised onion and mint leaves on top, it is gooey and has a strong flavour of lamb meat and ghee. “Muslims in Hyderabad usually break their Ramadan fasting with haleem. It is rich in proteins and has almonds, pistachio, cashew, oats, ghee, broken wheat,lamb meat and chana dal as it’s ingredients. It takes nearly 12 hours to make haleem in the traditional way. Even the bones of the lamb have to melt into the meat during this process,” explains the chef who lets me into a secret that he has a technique up his sleeve that cuts down on time of preparation. 




I savour the tender chicken pieces that are in the Murg Badami Shorba. I like its mildly spiced flavour. The beef kabab is perfectly grilled and the pudina chutney is a perfect companion to it. I am served some small sized puris, which I learn are Lukmi - crisp on the outside and stuffed with spinach and corn. I spoon up the tangy Lagaan ka Murg with the sheermal, a flat, slightly sweet bread. There is saffron in the sheermal and it is often eaten with Haleem too, I am informed. 
I am expecting a spicy biriyani but I am pleasantly surprised when I eat the Kacche Gosht Ka Biriyani. I taste a hint of cinnamon and am regaled with a story about its origins by the chef as I dig in. “Long ago in Hyderabad, during a battle, soldiers found they were running out of rations. Their chef was instructed to come up with a dish that could be eaten by itself without any side dish. He suggested a rice dish made with spices and was both healthy and delicious. This was the Biriyani.” Chef Somu says the Kacche Gosht Ka Biriyani took him two years to master. “The meat used is not cooked before marination, hence its name. And there are less known ingredients such as Khus Ki Jad and Pan Ki Jad that are also added to give it its unique flavour,” he says.
The Kubani ka Meetha is the perfect finale with its apricots, rabdi, slivers of cashew and badam. It is delicious and I can’t leave for home without a second helping.

The dabba from home "," Now that the summer vacations have come to an end and the new school year has commenced, it’s time for families to get back to regular school routine and the one of what to pack for lunch. 
When we were growing up our school lunches were a reflection of the kind of food we ate at home and most often we would barter our tiffin with others. A puli saadham for example would be exchanged for a pongal, a payasam, an aloo subzi and so on. 
Somewhere along the way that changed and the packed lunches got fancier but less nutritious so much so that schools are now stepping in to provide nutrition as they see fit. Parents are being urged to send simple, wholesome meals in the right quantities. Some schools are even suggesting weekly meal schedules to help parents.
Why is it this hard to get children to eat simple foods? My father-in-law shared an early childhood memory with us. One day, he refused his idli breakfast and wanted something else. No one berated or reproached him, they just removed his plate from the table and he was free to go. He still remembers the hunger pangs and by the time the noon meal came along, he was ready to eat anything that was served to him! He says he never complained about food thereafter. I sometimes think that a little hunger is good for children. It won’t hurt them. The privileged kids, especially those who live in an urban environment, are plied with an endless supply of food and probably have never felt a hunger pang.
Often love for one’s young is equated with feeding them. Many people hinted that I was a heartless mother just because my children ate a breakfast of either ragi porridge, idli or a nendhram porridge from the age of one till they were almost three. Meal times were kept simple. Lunch consisted of simple poriyal, keerai , paruppu and curd which continues to this day. It is a diet my husband and I were brought up on. And I believe that is why my kids eat vazhaithandu, bitter gourd or sundakkai without a fuss. 
My kids do love their sushi rolls and thin crust pizzas but it’s very clear that those are treats and will always remain so. It’s heartening to see my older teen refuse a heavy meal out because she has already made plans to dine out with friends the following day. Balance is of utmost importance and it can only be achieved by following a daily diet of the kind of food you are born into. It’s claimed that the Indian DNA not only recognises local cuisine but also helps improve the body’s metabolic rate of digestion, absorption and assimilation.
My mom always quoted her elders saying that when children are given high calorific or rich foods, it will lead to mandham (a slump in the digestive organs) and I’ve witnessed that so many times when parents complain about children being listless and not feeling hungry. When children are active and eat the right foods the body demands food by ‘feeling hungry’. So feed that hunger with the right food. You might face some resistance initially to junk being replaced by real food in the lunch boxes, but trust me, your child will thank you in the years to come.
Did you know?
Tempering ingredients like mustard seeds, urad dhal and curry leaves are vital because they add small daily doses of protein, iron and fibre to the diet
Semi polished or un polished rice grains are highly nutritious and make flavoured rice dishes
Dals, lemon, pulses are easy to cook and replenish vital nutrients
Curd and buttermilk are essential pro-biotics which promote gut bacteria
Sauces and condiments are high in preservatives, refined sugar and salt and are best avoided during the week
Childhood obesity is best tackled by offering fresh, seasonal and simple and tasty meals

Opening up to vegan friendliness "," A colleague was meeting a ‘contact’ of his for extra updates on the socio-political front. He decided to do most of the meeting at a coffee shop close to his home. “But I am vegan. I don’t drink black coffee and the other coffees are made with milk,” said the guest. The barista was hell bent upon making his new guest try the coffee at their cafe. So, he went out, got a pack of soy milk and presented a cuppa that brought a smile to his face. The meeting ended and my colleague’s contact pleased with the coffee of his choice too decided work out of the cafe for the day.
Veganism is a comparatively new dining option for many. With restaurants only listing veg, non-veg and Jain food preferences, vegan eaters didn’t stand a chance to dine out without making their hosts worry. Every restaurant might not have a dedicated vegan section as of now, but like this cafe owner, most eateries are ready to custom-make vegan dishes for vegan eaters.
Reason? “It is about respecting one’s dining habits. Vegan eating habits is no more a rarity. So we have to cater to their preferences. Customising food according to one’s choice of ingredients is the least our chefs can do to see a happy customer,” says Jomy Abraham, Operations manager at Marriott Hotels.




What if I say I want a vegan cake or vegan dessert?Cchef Ratheesh of Marriott’s Momo Café says, “Give me a heads up and we can have the guests licking their fingers.”
While some cuisines are remarkably vegan-friendly it is practically difficult to think about vegan options in some south-east Asian cuisines. Most vegans vouch middle-eastern cuisine for most vegan-friendly. Have they not heard about shawarma and lamb roasts? “Avoid the meat, then everything else is mostly animal product free and nutritious,” says a vegan eater.
In Hyderabad there are a handful of eateries that cater to only vegan eaters. These eateries clearly indicate that vegan food is interesting and the choices are not limited. Cafes like Terrasen and Smart Alec are making a strong statement by offering a vegan-only menu. The response is immense and the popularity is going beyond vegan eaters.
Is it possible to be vegan and eating Indian? “Absolutely. Including millets is a good idea. But again millets are tricky. 
It takes a while for some people to get used to eating millet-based food. Vegan is a way of eating that is free from any animal product,” explains Madhu Reddy.
Vegan way of eating is new to Hyderabad hence it requires extra care while making fancy food. If you thought vegan food is void of cakes and shakes, then try the selection of cakes at Terassen. 
They just don’t stop there, their shakes are a hit with most of the patrons irrespective of whether one is vegan or not and their raw jackfruit sandwich can give the ordinary chicken sandwich some serious food complex when it comes to taste.
Being vegan-friendly motivates restaurants to work on their menu and ingredients. Chefs are working on war footing in order to make vegan food more visible on the table. If food like beetroot hummus and turmeric cappuccino are featured on the menu, curiosity will drive non-vegans to expand their palates too. 
Is it really difficult for a chef to dish out vegan food? “Absolutely not. These days most ingredients are easily available. Honestly a wholesome vegan meal can be rustled up at any home with the basic everyday ingredients. If your everyday food doesn’t revolve around meat and animal products, it is hardly a challenge,” says chef Chalapti Rao of Simply South. 
But he says he is not sure if he can make a pure south Indian filter coffee vegan style though.

Come, tell me how you feast
"," Picture these. 
A few generations ago, Garhwali families would break down entire carcasses from a hunt, for consumption. Then eventually, cuts of meat began to be commercially available, and what was once a regular feature on menus, gradually disappeared from mainstream family tables.
Traditionally, in Kerala, all temple prasadams were coconut-heavy. In Karnataka, sugarcane and jaggery would dominate. If you go further South, you will find rice-based prasadam. Whatever people grew there, based on climatic conditions, was first offered to the temple and then fed to the people. It was a happy ecosystem.




And then there is the food of the Kayasth community: a perfect example of a syncretism, with its Hindu, Muslim and British colonial elements, yet not a cuisine commercially found. 
These are not titbits of information that you will come by with some casual reading. But this may change soon, thanks to a growing band of home chefs and food experts, working on pop-ups across the country to spread word of the food of their people and enlighten us about the bountiful heritage that is Indian food .
“I began to research Garhwali cuisine of Uttarakhand, as a new Gujarati bride married into a Garhwali family, completely enamoured by the food of my new family,” says Rushina Munshaw Ghildiyal, author, food historian and owner, A Perfect Bite Consulting and APB Cook Studio, Mumbai. 
Here, there and everywhere




“My pop-ups were limited to two a year, because my access to ingredients was based on my visits to the Garhwal region,” adds Ghildiyal. “I did small pop-ups at my studio and then did the Garhwali sojourn with the JW Marriott Mussoorie, where we worked together to create a Garhwali menu, and invited food personalities from across the country on a four-day sojourn. I do pop-ups on Garhwali and Kutchi Bhatia of Gujarat now, every two-three months and have even done one on Shravan food. My approach is more to keep different cuisines alive rather than just the one.”
Anoothi Vishal, a Delhi-based author, columnist and curator best known for her over 40 pop-ups of Kayasth Khatirdari, feels it’s all about the narrative. 
“You see the mixing of cultural influences — Hindu, Mughal courtly and British colonial as well — in Kayasth food. So it becomes a part of a larger narrative when I do the pop-ups,” she says. Vishal’s pop-ups are in multiple formats — from small intimate meals where she does all the cooking, to working with larger brands curating tables for 20-25. Vishal stresses that the key is to offer guests a complete experience. “Food is important, but is only one part of it. We’ve always served wine or cocktails with our meals, and there is always one engaging activity for people to interact. I also always talk about food history. So it becomes like an arty salon. In fact, at one of my pop-ups at a resort in the depths of Chattarpur, I had my music teacher come in and sing different holis in various ragas. We served holi food and people travelled for more than an hour to get to the place!” Taking his guests through an experience — the thought process of putting a dish on the table and its back story — is something that Rakesh Raghunathan, a food heirloom curator based in Chennai, likes to do as well. With over 10 varied pop-ups to his credit, Raghunathan focusses on thematic menus that make up the South Indian culinary fabric.
Time and place




“I did a pop-up we called the Pilgrim’s Palate with a premium hotel recently. This was about food from temples and temple towns across South India, and was a vegetarian festival with no garlic and no onion. The idea was to get people to understand the history behind a temple recipe and the reason why certain ingredients are used or not, in them. For example — you will never find dishes with tur dal, chillies or asafoetida, as these are not native to us. Temple recipes are all region-inspired.”
Raghunathan also has stories to share on the cultural relevance of dishes in his menus. For example, kootan choru, a rice-based dish made in Tirunelveli, is made during the harvest season, when people from all over the area bring in various ingredients, cook it and then eat it as a community. 
This love for the rustic, perhaps, is what Ummi Abdulla, a food consultant based in Kozhikode and the doyenne of Mapilla cuisine, credits for the surge in interest in the food of the Malabar region. 




With dozens of pop-ups across premium hotels to her credit, Abdulla says, “People read reviews of my pop-ups and I see a larger number come in to try the food each time I do one. They are interested in understanding more of its history and how it is made. Dishes like pathiri, a rice pancake, or the Thalassery biryani use minimal ingredients but have the most flavour. People are always curious to know about the origin, cooking techniques and ingredients.”
“People love it when we say our Assamese cooking is more ingredient-based than spice-based,” says Kashmiri Nath, a Guwahati-based food consultant, recipe developer, blogger, home chef and baker. Nath has worked on several Assamese pop-ups across the country, and finds that people now have open minds towards cuisines they are unfamiliar with. 
Ghildiyal sums up such food pop-up experiences saying that the wealth of Indian food and cooking is in the kitchens of our homes, it’s in the hands of our women and men, who have been cooking that food for years. You may be a Masterchef, but you will not be able to replicate something that a home chef has made. And it is through these pop-ups that cuisines we have grown up with are kept alive.

Sitanadi's hotel Srisathyanarayana USP is its 'neer dose'
","Driving from Mangaluru towards Shimoga after the Southwest monsoon sets in is a joy difficult to describe. The entire route has been washed clean by the first spell of rains, and there’s greenery everywhere. It is not without reason that Agumbe is called the Cherrapunji of the South; it rains or drizzles almost through the year. Roll down the windows and take in the sights and sounds of acres of pristine Agumbe rainforest. Less than two kilometres before you begin the ascent to the view point, is a place where many a devotee of food worships.
Soon after crossing the lovely village of Sitanadi, on the left, is Hotel Srisathyanarayana, which can seat about 40. It takes time to spot the board: the calling card being cars and motorbikes parked in front. Behind the hotel flows Sitanadi river, known for its rafting facilities. Monkeys play hide-and-seek in the vast network of trees and friendly dogs wait for a morsel from a generous guest.




Since July 1975, when H Subraya Shenoy started the eatery in the midst of heavy rains, the hotel has been quietly charming visitors with its USP — neer dose, a lacey rice crepe, served with a watery but delicious chutney and Konkani-style sambar. Of course, it serves idli (₹28 for three), idli-uddina vade (₹32) and golibajje (₹20 for 6), avalakki mosaru (₹25), spiced beaten rice served with sugar and curd, and Mangalore buns (₹28 for two), but the neer dose (₹25 for three) wins hands down.
Travellers’ favourite
I first read about the restaurant in a blog where a group of bikers raved about its neer dose. Since then, it’s a regular stop during the four-hour drive to Shimoga.
There was a time when the senior Shenoy saw sales of just ₹75 a day; today, the hotel draws about 300 people on an average every day, and some more during the weekend. Anil Shenoy, who runs it now with help from his wife Amrutha, children Advith and Adithi, and mother Vijayalakshmi, has retained most of the dishes his father began the eatery with. What’s gone out is poori-sagu, regular dose and afternoon meals.




There was a time when this was one of the very few hotels on this stretch. Anil remembers merchants placing orders in advance and knocking on the door at 2 am to eat something before hitting the road again, carrying vegetables to places far away.
The hotel opens its doors at 7.30 am and closes by 9.30 pm. If the food gets over, the family quickly fries up some jackfruit happala and serves it with coffee or tea. On an average, they grind about nine kilograms of rice every day for the dose alone, and, make chutney one coconut at a time. “This place is also humid. You can’t grind in bulk and wonder whether it is fresh or not. Our guests are mostly travellers, and so we prefer grinding small batches, frequently, to ensure the well-being of those who eat here,” says Anil. The sambar is a non-spicy affair, just the kind you make at home. If you get lucky, are hungry and there’s nothing left on the menu, Amrutha sometimes serves you the family’s breakfast. We got to sample pundi (steamed balls of broken rice) served with sprouts gassi.
Backyard treasures
The coconut primarily comes from the garden behind the spacious home, as do the jackfruits they soak in brine or process into papads. The hotel has a section where it sells traditional Malnad and Mangalore delicacies, such as papads made of beaten rice, banana stem or bitter gourd.




Anil permits us entry into the kitchen, and it is a trip back in time. The smoky walls speak of the thousands of breakfasts and lunches cooked here. Many of the vessels still being used have been handed down by the senior Shenoy and his ancestors. As we walk in, a vat of oil sizzles with the air-like golibajje that Amrutha has just spooned in. It emerges a minute later, golden and crisp on the outside.
And then, it is time for evening tiffin. The clock shows 6.45 pm, and all those who stayed back at Agumbe, for the sunset view of the panoramic valley, head down for a snack before taking the highway home.
Amrutha and her mother-in-law send out plate after plate of golibajje, as Adithi serves chutney by the spoonful. In between, a batch of buns, crisp on the outside and sweet and spongy inside, is ordered.
Soon, the parked cars drive out and new ones find their spots. All for a taste of food that’s healthy, and local.
In this weekly column, we take a peek at some of the country’s most iconic restaurants.

A crispy frisbee of a dosa "," What the laddu is to Tirupati, the ‘Azhagarkoil dosa’ is to Madurai. The crsipy fried dosa that is the prasadam of the Perumal temple is something unique and not found elsewhere. And it's also not everyday that one can travel 20 kms across the city to eat the much acclaimed dosa.
But there's one place in town where dosas similar in taste, texture and flavour of the Azhagar temple prasadam are available. It comes from the antique house of 70-year-old T V Viswanathan. The address is 112, Kamarajar Salai, adjacent to the Sourashtra High School. On the wooden door outside hangs an obscure hand-written board saying 'Azhagarkoil dosas' and it has been the only advertisement for over 35 years now, ever since Viswanathan began dishing out his trademark dosas from a small corner of his house. Residents of the area know him and his speciality too well. 
“I worked at the temple kitchen as a storekeeper for two years in the 70's and learnt making dosas from the head cook. I used to watch him prepare the batter carefully and fry dosas on a panchaloha pan every day. The dosa is the evening neivedhyam and popular among devotees and tourists alike,” says Viswanathan. “Once I tried making the dosa at home and everyone in the family was delighted with the result. That's when I started it as a small business. Slowly, the name and fame of my dosas spread in the city and I developed a band of dedicated customers. The taste of the dosas I make speak of my skills as indicated by the growing number of customers over the years.”

The Azhagarkoil dosa is more like a large vadai, with a crispy coat and a soft core. Golden brown in colour, glistening with ghee/oil and the size of a frisbee, it requires no accompaniments like chutney or sambhar. A single dosa can be eaten by two or three people, as it's heavy and filling. “The key is the proportion of raw rice and urad dal in the batter. The samba variety of rice is only traditionally used and hence the dosas are also called 'Samba dosai'. We continue to hand-pound the rice in ural, to achieve the taste. Coarsely ground urad dal is added and mixed to the rice batter and left to ferment for a couple of hours. 
Tempered pepper, cumin, dry ginger, asofoetida and salt is added later. If the consistency is too watery, the dosas may not come out perfectly,” explains Viswanathan, as he pours a bowlful of batter into a pan of hot oil. Within minutes, the dosas spring up like big vadais and once the edges turn crispy brown, he flips the discs for another round of frying. Unlike regular dosas, the delicacy is not cooked on a tawa but in a flat-bottomed pan. “I have been using the same silver kinnam for measurement to get it right every single time. Each dosa weighs around 250 grams and I can make 16 dosas from 1.5 Kilograms of rice.”
“The dosas served in the temple are fried in pure ghee but I use a mix of oil and ghee to make it affordable at Rs.25. I also offer a smaller variant for Rs.15 and Rs.10 for parties and evening meetings,” says Viswanathan. 
“The dosas can stay fresh for a day if packed properly. I let them cool down before wrapping them in papers to be parcelled. Some of my customers carry the dosas to Chennai, Bangalore and other cities.” The place is open 10 am to 8 pm.

Baking goals of homebakers
"," 
 Although Swathy S. Soman and Ann Vijo are no football buffs, they are down with ‘football fever’. Both Swathy and Ann have launched a range of football-themed cupcakes in connection with the ongoing FIFA World Cup. While Swathy plans to introduce cupcakes topped with the logos of various teams participating in the World Cup, jerseys of individual players, each team’s flags and the like this weekend, Ann has already delivered two football-themed cakes and is expecting a fresh set of orders. 




 It was a recent order of cupcakes Swathy received that sprouted the seed of idea of introducing such cupcakes. “A customer ordered cupcakes for her son’s birthday. As her son is a Chelsea (football club) fan, she wanted me to make cupcakes based around that theme.” And so with the help of fondant and edible print sheets, Swathy created Chelsea-inspired toppers for the cupcakes. “There was the Chelsea jersey, a football on a football ground, the Chelsea team logo... as toppers,” she says. 
Although you can choose your favourite flavour, red velvet is Swathy’s speciality. While there will be a few boxes of cupcakes available for sale over the weekend, Swathy says the cupcakes will be prepared on order during the rest of the World Cup period. Swathy can be reached on her Facebook page, Red Velvet Bakers.




 A homebaker, Ann is known amongst her customers for her customised theme cakes. “I love challenges and making themed cakes fits the bill.” So, when a customer sent her a picture of a round black-and-white chequered cake shaped like a football, she decided to go a step further. “While surfing the Internet one day, I saw a dome-shaped cake and have been itching to make one. When my customer told me the cake was for her husband, who is a die-hard football fan, I decided to make the dome-shaped cake and turn it into a football-themed cake.”
The cake with vanilla and chocolate as a base and whipped cream and chocolate ganache topping was a success.
Once she posted the picture of the cake on her Facebook page, Ann’s Patisserie, Ann received another order, from a daughter who wanted to pick up a cake for her father, who is fan of the Argentinian team. The customer wanted a similar cake but with the colours of the Argentinian team’s jersey — blue and white. 




“From birthdays to get-togethers to pre- or post- match parties, football themed cakes and cupcakes seem to be a hit with the public, especially with Malayalis, who are fond of the game,” says Ann.

No lillies at Lilypool but plenty of good food "," Thomas and Ancy Pottenkulam called Dubai home for over three decades with Thomas sailing the seas as a captain in Merchant Navy and Ancy running a bed and breakfast. But now they have dropped anchor in Agrahara Samakulam, about 25 kms from Coimbatore and opened the doors to their lovely home in the form of a weekend pop-up restaurant in a farm.
The dropped pin in google maps guided us through the country roads outside Coimbatore and reached Lilypool in about 45 minutes. We were warmly greeted by Thomas and led into the beautiful courtyard of their family home. For the Sunday lunch, our group consisted of a dozen adults and four kids. We had the courtyard and an air-conditioned dining room all to ourselves while Ancy and her daughter, Maya who was visiting from China, kept busy in the kitchen preparing our lunch.




As we settled down into a comfortable couch and a quaint wooden swing, piping hot and crispy Bread Bombs with a cheese filling were served with a creamy and tangy sauce. A set menu is served to the guests at Lilypool which can be tweaked based on our preference over the phone while making a reservation. We had asked for a non-Indian meal and were looking forward to tasting our way through Ancy’s culinary creations.
As we did not see a Lily pond in the vicinity and were curious to know more, we asked Ancy about the significance of the name. “I am an ardent fan of Maharani Gayatri Devi and the home she moved into after Rambagh Palace was called Lily Pool and I wanted to name my home the same,” was her reply. Soon after came a couple of more appetisers – crispy homemade Pita Bread served with a creamy Hummus and Pork in Garlic sauce. We had to hold back as we knew an elaborate lunch was waiting for us.
The dishes were laid out buffet-style in the dining room, and we started. The Prawn Salad that was served as individual portions in glasses was refreshing and light. There were two more salads – a juicy one with mangoes and pomegranate and a crunchy one with apples and cucumber. “I source all my ingredients locally and do not use any frozen products. The meat and vegetables are bought from multiple locations in Coimbatore from the best possible vendors even if it means that I have to drive from one end of town to the other,” said Ancy. 
 The Chicken Khowseuy with all its interesting little toppings was a favourite among the diners that afternoon. The Mutton Moussaka and Garlic Butter Fish were equally delicious. Some of us sat around the dining table while the spill over crowd found seats in the courtyard under a canvas canopy.
After a short pause, we were served Chocolate Fondue with fruits and an Apple Crumble with Vanilla Icecream for dessert. 
Many of us dream of Sundays in a farm with our family and friends. Lilypool offers just that with a very relaxed ambience and an indulgent spread that is hard to duplicate at home. With her roots in Kerala, Ancy is also adept at cooking Syrian Christian and Nair community specialities. This is enough reason for me and my family to head back there again.

Bond over bikes and coffee
"," Just at the K.K.Nagar arch where the Melur Main Road enters Madurai city, you cannot miss the large transparent window façade of Café TN59 now. It stands out for its name and the signboard flashing the district code distinguishes itself from the clutter of established vegetarian and hardcore non-veg eateries on the road facing the District Court building.




Barely a fortnight old, the café has rapidly carved a niche as the only place for short eats and beverages in the area. “It is okay if people eat at nearby places and chill out here with our desserts and shakes,” says M.Iniyaa, a foodie who veered into fashion designing and worked as a banker. “Years of varied experiences are now helping me to run the cafe,” she says, visibly happy with the walk-ins.
The café was accidental and set up in a jiffy, she says. She actually came to check the property for running a ‘bed and breakfast’ and found this platform to be ideal for a chic café. And when 60 orders came off smoothly in the first seven days, Iniyaa knew she would be able to make a mark. Customers doubled in the second week and now the 25-seater goes mostly houseful. 




The menu is quite affordable to enable everybody to enjoy. From among the 133 items categorised under juices, drifts and shakes, fruit-tails, veg and non-veg starters and short eats, one can happily find something of choice too. You can order up a steaming cuppa coffee or replenish with fresh, seasonal juices and a pastry or a brownie, indulge in pizza, sandwich or burger, nuggets and cutlets or any usual café item you can think of.




Guhan K who is the consultant from Erode helped Iniyaa to quickly put together the appealing and cost effective menu that is filled with fancy and funny names and also make the items look beautiful and instagram-worthy pictures!.
“We want to convert it into a thematic destination for bikers, racers, cyclists and those with a passion for driving around,” he says. “We want people and travellers to come here and share their experiences, inspire others and perhaps plan weekend rides randomly.”




He is confident fitness freaks and riders will soon have their voices heard here. As they come by and start imparting information on easy and difficult destinations, pit stops, adventure trails and tips and guidance on how to go about it, more people with similar interests will show up. A big noticeboard and social media page are in the pipeline waiting to be launched within this month to give the new café an even newer look and profile.
And of course all the exciting conversations will happen over the hot and cold beverages and the food available. The menu is not extraordinary but the young entrepreneurs have given a twist to the regular items. To suit the city’s climate, a major part of the menu is filled with summer coolers robust in flavour.

I tried two -- the refreshing elani-nongu (tender coconut and palm) drink and the delightful ‘mango murder’. It came as mango shake in a bowl with a scoop of mango ice cream dipped in it and sprinkled with fresh mango cut into small pieces. Both cost Rs.80 each.
All items are priced between Rs.30 and Rs.160 and new combos are introduced every week. Iniyaa says the kitkat and oreo milkshakes keep the children happy, the young school and college goers indulge in the rich dates and nuts shake named “Fly Emirates” or the dudes and teenz shakes and turbo chargers that are thick, rich and creamy. The health conscious prefer a simple bowl of fresh fruits with naturally flavoured ice creams. Labelled as melting mountains, the ice creams have a dash of green chilly, beeda, pazhapalam, fig, pineapple, guava and more. The hot drinks and soups are called Lava.
There is a colourful variety of fresh fruit-tails offering combinations with pomegranate, watermelon and lime called Healthy Ride, apple, carrot and ginger called Revitaliser, kiwi, pineapple, watermelon and lemon called From Doctor’s Desk or the mambazha magic with mango, strawberry and apple and many more. Iniyaa assures no artificial syrups are used in making the fruit-based drinks.
The veg or non-veg platter with three pieces each of five different items can turn into a light meal too. For example, the non-veg platter has chicken nuggets/popcorn/fingers, fish fry and crab lollypop costing Rs.160.
The café is neat and remains open all days from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m.

Sour power: The sourdough bread revolution
","Unfortunately, Sourdough Hotel’s clients don’t have access to TripAdvisor. So we’ll never really know what they thought about the food, water or massages. Nevertheless, they thrive. So if you need boarding for your bread, head to Stockholm. For 300 Swedish krona a week (roughly ₹2,300), this hotel set in the city’s hip SoFo district keeps sourdough thriving while owners go on holiday — because heaven forbid it dies of neglect while you sun yourself in Ibiza.
Rolling your eyes? Well, hold on to your toast: this is just the beginning. Home cooks, food nerds and artisan bread-makers are switching loyalties: brown bread is too pedestrian, muffins too predictable and brioche too pretentious. If you’re looking for bread with personality, sourdough is the way to go.




Consisting of flour, water and live micro-organisms, this fermented bread is made the old-fashioned way, without any help from commercial yeast. Which could explain why, in an age that values provenance, tradition and technique, this style of bread is making a comeback. Loyalists vouch for its taste and overall goodness, stating that once you taste sourdough you cannot eat other breads. Either way, it’s time you learn about it, if you don’t intend to get elbow-deep in flour, for sourdough is the reigning topic at every trendy baker’s table today.
Mystery and origins
The bread dates back to ancient Egypt, if scriptures and cave paintings are to be believed. The technique lost steam and almost dropped off the radar in the Middle Ages, only to be revived in the early 1800s. With the invention of commercial yeast, sourdough almost became obsolete.
Author of Theory of Bakery and Patisserie and a chef specialising in Indian cuisine, Parvinder S Bali, connects bread-making with the cultivation of wheat. “The origins of the first bread are unknown, but wheat has been cultivated for more than 5,000 years. Leavening of the bread must have been purely accidental, as the previous day’s dough would have been left over. The wonderful fermented smell would have urged the baker to bake it. Khameeri roti is a good example.”




Sujit Sumitran, popularly known as ‘the bread whisperer’, is a name synonymous with sourdough in India. Based in Goa, where he spends hours every week baking artisanal bread, he also travels across the country to conduct workshops. He says, “Poi, the quintessential Goan bread, used to be made with natural yeast once upon a time, and like all modern commercial practices, it was quickly replaced by commercial yeast. Based on what I’ve heard from old-timers, the pois of today — and I’ve eaten many — are just a shade of what they really should be. For starters, they’re quick-rise breads, and in most cases, the dough is pure refined flour with just a different shape and some bran dusted on.”
“I think there is a global renaissance of sorts happening on the artisanal front, a move away from soul-less, mass-produced products,” comments Sumitran. “This, to my mind, is largely fuelled by the realisation that speed and convenience come at a price. Consequently, conscious folks are adopting ‘slow’ as a lifestyle change, and food is definitely up there on their radar.
So what are the magic ingredients? “To make your own sourdough bread you need a starter,” says Arundati Rao, Hyderabad-based home baker, popular for her baking classes.
Science behind the art




“A starter is nothing but a blend of water and flour left to ferment in room temperature for a couple of days. This requires daily care by way of feeding with flour and water. Bacteria keeps growing in the dough and it acts like yeast. A portion of starter dough can be used to make a new loaf of bread. Maintaining the shelf life of your sourdough is pretty much a food science and an art; it varies around the world due to climatic conditions.” Rao further breaks it down like a simple science class, “When flour and water are left to ferment, it supports wild yeast and lactobacilli which is easily available in the atmosphere. On being fed properly and kept alive, it acts as yeast, which makes baking possible without factory-made dry yeast.”
The fact that this bread is healthier than conventional bread is not the only reason it’s getting so popular. This renaissance has much to do with social media, especially Instagram. Right now, #sourdough throws up 13,38979 posts.
Wild yeast can be fussy and finicky: it needs cooler temperatures, acidic environments, and works much more slowly. Then why not opt for something easier? “There is a lot of data available these days that indicate that many of the modern lifestyle diseases are food and wellness induced,” says Sumitran. He adds, “Fermented food has been around in India for thousands of years, and sourdough bread is just one manifestation of it. What is available as bread today, mostly works on the paradigm of more output (volume) with less time, while sourdough is about more output (wellness) with enough time.”
 
As I foraged the Internet for an Indian counterpart of sourdough, I found Bijay Thapa, a Delhi-based wedding cake maker and baker. Thapa brought up his days as a Masterchef India participant. “I bemoaned the lack of baking culture in India to my friend Kalpana Talpade. She surprised me with the details of the Pathare Prabhu community, that started a yeast culture using milk, channa dal and potatoes. They bake a bread with it called parvi pav or pathare pav. From her description, I could say the home-grown pav has to be the Indian answer to the English sourdough,” he says. 




Parvi pav is fluffy and soft, with a muffin-like texture. It is best relished with spicy mutton curry, and according to Kalpana Talpade, “Vegetarians love to eat it with aamras.” The starter for the pavis made with channa dal, unpeeled potato, milk and water. Talpade says, “I like to heat my milk and water together for optimal fermentation. On a warm day fermentation should happen within 12 to 15 hours. The fermented liquid is used to leaven the bread batter and made into parvi pav. Weather and climate play a big role in the process.”
The community migrated from Rajasthan and Gujarat many years ago, settling in Mumbai. “It helped them mingle with the British and be influenced by their food habits. This could explain the strong baking culture.”
 
You will need one steel tumbler with a narrow opening and a bigger steel vessel with lid. 
Ingredients
2 fistfuls of chana dal, not washed or soaked
1 potato, washed and cut into pieces with peel left on.
1/3 spoon of eating soda
One cup of milk
One cup of water
Method
Mix water and milk and bring it to a boil. Put the diced potato and chana dal in the tumbler and pour the hot milk and water into the mixture. Close the tumbler with a steel cover or vessel make it air-tight.
Then, place the tumbler with the contents onto another bigger vessel and close the lid. Then place it in a warm and secluded place. Avoid opening it to check, leaving it undisturbed.
It takes over night for the yeast to form. After keeping it aside for 12 to 14 hours, the next day a froth will form on the mouth of the smaller vessel. Use the froth, water and milk contents to knead your dough for the bread.
Note: Strain off the chana dal and potato pieces.
This recipe is ideal to make pathare prabhu pav, but with 3 cups of flour.

Amritsari delights
","Dipped in oodles of ghee and butter,Amritsari cuisine never fails to delight. Hotel Grand Bay presents flavours of Amritsar at its restaurant The Welcomecafe Oceanic.
At the end of a particularly hot and sultry day as I step into the hotel’s café, a glassful of chilled makhani lassi welcomes me. Be warned, this traditional Amritsari cuisine is not for weight-watchers as I realise the moment I take a sip. The other options include pudina sherbet and wood apple sherbet. 
The hotel’s executive chef Sridhar Kare and his team have curated a buffet menu that comes straight from the kitchens of Amritsar. 
The flavourful gosht adraki shorba, clear soup served with chunks of meat, is just right to work up my appetite. On the chef’s recommendation, I try the kasturi murgh tikka. 
The well marinated meat is tender. It has a hint of kasturi methi, with a bit of pineapple juice lending it a slightly tangy taste. 
One of the main specialities of the feast was the maa ki  dal with a layer of butter on top. 
Made with lentils, red kidney beans, cream and butter, this dish is rich and has a flavourful taste.The creamy dal is best relished with stuffed kulche and paratha from the live counters. Next to come in the main course is the rahra gosht, thick, rich gravy made of mutton and keema and pairs well with butter naan. 
The deep fried macchhi Amritsari isn’t for people who prefer the fish without the maida coating. 
 To cater to the local palate, the chef has introduced a special biryani called bhatti murg biryani. “Punjab is not known for biryanis. But I have tried to bring about some improvisation with a biryani using tandoori chicken,” says Kare. 
For dessert, I taste the mango rabri, which was a sure winner for its mild sweetness and small pieces of juicy mangoes. 
The moong dal halwa, phirni, garjar ka halwa and stuffed Kesari pista gulab jamun jostle for brownie points too.

Anthony Bourdain, one last time
","In the past two weeks, two public figures from the era of my New York City youth committed suicide. Kate Spade and Anthony Bourdain, certainly not mentioned in the same breath when they were alive, were inexorably linked in death. Kate Spade’s handbags were all the rage when I was a 20-something New Yorker in the 1990s. Although I never quite got the aesthetic nor the appeal, many of my contemporaries did, and Kate became a sensation. Just as we were processing her passing came news of Bourdain’s. The Internet imploded. People were genuinely affected and, unlike Karl Lagerfeld, who famously never thinks of the past, I couldn’t help but feel nostalgic for a time long gone.
In 1996, I moved from Manhattan’s meatpacking district — back when it really was just that, with rivulets of blood running down the streets and grim, grey, nondescript buildings dotting the neighbourhood — to no-man’s land on 28th street on the East side. This new neighbourhood was insipid and drab (but the rents were cheap). One block away was Curry Hill, populated by small, greasy desi restaurants and some dosa joints that were frequented by South Asian taxi drivers, Jews seeking kosher food and students on a budget. On another block was arguably NYC’s most famous Thai restaurant, Jaya Thai, which was adored by Indians because of its insane spice levels.
Where was a young girl supposed to go to unwind with a pal in the ’hood, at the end of a long workday? There was nothing in the area. I constantly escaped to cooler places downtown. And then I discovered Les Halles. A French bistro on Park Avenue South, just two blocks from my apartment. It featured a butcher shop, it was madly dark, and its waiters were sullen. The menu, in quintessential French fashion, was totally overloaded with items like foie gras, steak and pork, which wasn’t ideal for my vegetarian self. But it had charm, a je ne sais quoi. It felt like Paris in New York.
So 411 Park Avenue is where I parked myself on many a night. Les Halles became my go-to joint. It helped that it served superb pommes frites (so much chicer than saying French fries). And since I was in my early 20s, I could eat all the frites in the world. The chef was a guy called Anthony Bourdain. He would sometimes appear from the kitchen and walk around. My friend and I didn’t pay him much attention, engrossed as we were in our own lives and worlds. I wish we had. I wish I hadn’t been so oblivious and had struck up a conversation.
Later, I read The New Yorker piece that shot him to fame and was angry at his outspoken contempt of vegetarians. In it, he described us thus: “Vegetarians, and their Hezbollah-like splinter-faction, the vegans, are a persistent irritant to any chef worth a damn. To me, life without veal stock, pork fat, sausage, organ meat, demi-glace, or even stinky cheese is a life not worth living. Vegetarians are the enemy of everything good and decent in the human spirit, an affront to all I stand for, the pure enjoyment of food.”
I thought to myself that this guy obviously had no idea about the rich vegetarian culinary tradition of India nor, for that matter, of the Buddhist cuisine found across Asia. I was one of those “irritants” at Les Halles about whom he said: “I’ll rummage around for something to feed them, for a ‘vegetarian plate’... fourteen dollars for a few slices of grilled eggplant and zucchini suits my food cost fine.”
Eventually, I stopped going to Les Halles. I didn’t read his bestseller, Kitchen Confidential, because what was the point of reading a guy who was going to berate my ilk? But later, I started watching his show. It was a revelation. He had redeemed himself in my eyes by calling out a man who should’ve been made accountable for his actions and never was. That man was Henry Kissinger and this is what Bourdain wrote about him in his 2001 book, A Cook’s Tour: “Once you’ve been to Cambodia, you’ll never stop wanting to beat Henry Kissinger to death with your bare hands. You will never again be able to open a newspaper and read about that treacherous, prevaricating, murderous scumbag sitting down for a nice chat with Charlie Rose or attending some black-tie affair for a new glossy magazine without choking. Witness what Henry did in Cambodia — the fruits of his genius for statesmanship — and you will never understand why he’s not sitting in the dock at The Hague next to Milošević.” After that, I loved Anthony Bourdain. He will be missed.
This fortnightly column tracks the indulgent pursuits of the one-percenters.

Loretta’s Shakes & Screams in Chennai: the burger that was
","In the bevy of cafés in the city, any new enterprise must scream itself hoarse and ensure there’s meat in its matter. Joining the din is Loretta’s Shakes & Screams, in Anna Nagar.
While there are plans to expand the menu at some point, right now, it’s mostly the expected bits, with the odd exception. The restaurant recommends their cheesy fries, and one would imagine a combination of cheese and fries would be tough to get wrong. But the fries are just smeared with cheese and topped off with oregano. Treating French fries like a pizza base may not be the best idea. They end up soggy in no time and are a pinch too salty — a recurring theme across some dishes, we find. It’s a fairly generous serving, though, and will keep two comfortably occupied.
The Chicken or The Egg is a must-have, though. This is an egg wrapped in a chicken patty, deep-fried in cornflour, with a squeeze of mayonnaise. The minced meat jacket is crispy and flavourful, with just the right amounts of spice and zip to it, and the hard-boiled egg is… well, a hard-boiled egg. As the egg and patty come apart, it does get messy, but that’s nothing that a handful of tissues can’t fix.
Texas chicken wings are an interesting take on an overdone starter. While they’re the go-to fare of sweet and spicy wing, brushed with a honey sauce, it’s the texture that really works wonders. The skin is crunchy, almost to the point of crackling; the meat is tender, cooked perfectly, and the honey just pounds a symphony of flavour into this riff.
Entrées are mostly a pick between varieties of burgers and sandwiches, not all of which necessarily work. The Something Fishy burger, for instance. A crispy basa fillet rests between two buns, quite unsure of its place there. The fillet is slightly undercooked, and oilier than necessary. I’ve never been sure of fish in a burger and this isn’t assuaging the sceptic in me.
The Paneer Twister burger, too, is a confused bit on what should have been a simple act. Instead of a paneer patty, it has a minced paneer paste as the lowest in a stack with nachos and lettuce above it. While nachos add some bite to an otherwise sludgy consistency, it plays havoc with the flavours and can’t be reconciled with paneer, sadly. Moreover, the paneer base is bitter and unattractive.
The 4 Loaf Chicken Club Sandwich pretty much has it in the name. There’s one slice too many here, and it really makes for quite a mouthful. And we’re not quite sure why, but despite the restaurant’s claims of using unsalted butter, the sandwich tastes overtly salty.
A Focaccian Fill then, comes as a pleasant surprise. Focaccia, topped with dried herbs, and a delectable centre of sun-dried tomatoes, zucchini, olives, bathed in pesto sauce and mayonnaise, makes for quite an effervescent combination. But this, too, is a smidge too salty.




The thickshakes, milkshakes and ice-creams are also mostly of the standard variety. Nothing’s quite offensive, but not much will really make you sit up and take notice of Loretta’s. Try the mud apple ice-cream, though. There aren’t too many flavours quite as pleasantly curious as cold chikoo.
So, does Loretta’s Shakes & Screams stand out from the crowd? Not quite. A few of their dishes are delicious and may be worth a second visit, but there’s little here to make you a regular. We found ourselves waiting abnormally long whiles between courses — often as long as 40 minutes. This, on a Tuesday evening with a scant crowd.
Someone steal the chef’s salt shaker, fast.

‘London Bubble Co’ makes its entrance in Chennai
"," Subtle shades of pink and white in a striped fashion, reminiscent of English-styled creameries — or more appropriately, toy stores — greet one at the Mumbai-based London Bubble Co’s maiden Chennai branch outlet. ‘Next Level, Desserts!’, says the board, in an evident effort to channel a local flavour to an otherwise predominantly North Indian venture.
The cute little joint was filled with teenagers eager to see how different this new ‘waffle place’ would be. Cut to the corner table, where a surprised bunch of friends — young enough to be in school — debate why the waffles look as though they are inflated. It’s because they’re bubble waffles. 
“I feel that Chennai doesn’t have the kind of varieties that are usually seen in Pune or Mumbai. I hear this from my friends here all the time. That’s why I decided to open my flagship branch in Chennai,” says Veeral Bafna, one of the proprietors/owners and the in-charge of the Tamil Nadu franchise. 




Bafna also adds that the location was chosen because of its proximity to schools. Inside , contrasting colours and random quotes drenched in sexual innuendos scream at you (it’s difficult not to notice), while a panel of white light bubbles overhead offer a thematic touch. For no discernible reason, the quotes chosen are attributed to personalities like Isaac Newton for instance. This waters the theme down quite a bit, even as the proprietors inform us that the contrasting colours were meant to invoke the feel of ‘old-school’ London restaurants, while keeping the interiors youth-centric.
Bafna’s debut venture boasts of an exciting menu, all laden with sugar bubbles — Bubble waffle wraps, waffwiches, iced bubble chais, pocket waffles, bubble milkshakes, to name a few. The Peach Bubble Ice Tea, among other, have a generous amount of thin-lined sugar bubbles in them, which immediately pop in your mouth to leave a hint of sweetness. In some drinks, these bubbles are filled with fruit syrup to enhance the flavour — a noticeable twist to an otherwise light drink.
One of their best-sellers, the Black Jack, is a filling brownie-flavoured waffle, served in half or full portions, along with charcoal ice cream, and topped with colourful sprinkles, chocolate shavings and chocolate sticks. It’s filling enough to make you skip a meal, with mushy insides that blend effortlessly with the gooey ice cream accompanying it: a messy affair indeed! This rich mix of flavours, accompanied by the sheer size of it, is overwhelming. While Black Jack is one of the best-sellers of the brand, Roche Rust and Nutella Pockets compete for second spot: moist and rendered even more irresistible when paired with a scoop of Nutella. 
These vegetarian waffles are accompanied by gelato ice creams, which, owners claim, are specially prepared for the brand.
London Bubble Company is located at 46, Barnaby Road, Kilpauk.

What is cold brew coffee? Sleepy Owl gives answers
"," What does an investment banker — and a self-proclaimed “hardcore coffee lover” — do, when his occasional visits home from New York leave him craving for the kick and flavour of artisanal brew that he’s grown accustomed to at the Big Apple? 
He begins brewing his own coffee. 
This, pretty much, is what Ajai Thandi’s story boils down to. Co-founded with friends Ashwajeet Singh and Arman Sood, his cold brew outfit Sleepy Owl coffee has been creating ripples for quite a while now, most recently for having raised a seed fund of ₹3.26 crores ($500,000) this April. 
But for all their innovations and ingenuity, it’s only now that the two-year-old startup has managed to design a product that enables them to set their sights beyond the confines of New Delhi. 
Explains Thandi over the phone, “Our original product — a 1.5-litre brew pack — weighed too much to make shipping feasible. Hence, we have come up with a smaller pack, called the Lil Brew, which is only 600 ml. With this, we can look at other markets.” 




So what exactly is cold brew coffee? It’s basically ground coffee beans steeped in room temperature water, instead of being exposed to heat the way it would in a regular brewing process. It takes at least 12 hours for the taste and flavour to percolate through, says Thandi, after which it is brewed — again in cold water — for a further 30 minutes. The result is a black coffee concoction — for lack of a better word — that can be taken as ready-to-drink, or experimented with as per your taste. 
It took the trio about eight months of experimentation to get their first product just right, adds Thandi. “We source our coffee from Chikmagalur,” he adds, “What you get is made from freshly ground, 100% arabica.” That Sleepy Owl has managed to take the middle man out of the picture and sources directly from coffee growers is a source of pride for the three. 
What’s the difference? According to Thandi, everything, from aroma to flavour to the end product, if mixed with milk. “Whenever I came back, I would be dissatisfied with the coffee here,” says Thandi, insisting that this was not for lack of appreciation of quality. “I think there is a huge gap between the coffee producers and the kind of coffee that is produced here,” he adds, leaving it unsaid that the three of them are hoping to bridge just that.

How to make the perfect espresso martini ","The bartending industry is, as always, throwing both serious and fun together: the Delhi chapter of the Ultimate Bartender Championship 2018, held on the 12th of this month at Studio XO Bar, in South Extension, saw 55 of the city’s most talented bartenders battle it out for a win. Bartending may not be a profession you tell your folks you’re hankering after in class 12, but it’s definitely one that’s drawing serious attention for those in the F&B industry.
“As a profession, it has become as important as that of a chef in a restaurant. Slowly, the trend of bartender-driven bars from London and Paris is trickling into India too. It’s a very good time to be in the industry,” said Pankaj Balachandran, the India Brand Ambassador for Monkey Shoulder that has brought the bartender championship to India for its second season (worldwide it’s in the fourth year). As a malt, Monkey Shoulder is a Scotch whisky blended from three speyside single malts, and is perfect for cocktails.
Over the course of the day, competitors were tested on “skills that pay bills” such as ingredient knowledge, budgeting, mixing, nosing, and speed. Rounds included a quiz, the Mixiodic Table (a play on the more conventional Periodic Table), and the final Speed Challenge. This last test, refereed by last year’s national winner Paramveer Singh, required the six finalists to prepare a melange of eight cocktails, including an Espresso Martini and a Monkey Splash, in under five minutes. After a high-pressure round, the contest’s host, Balachandran, announced that the city’s bartenders had performed exceedingly well and achieved commendable total scores. Unfortunately, unlike Mumbai and Pune, Delhi lacked female participation.
Tanka Gurung, who works at Perch Wine and Coffee Bar, in Vasant Vihar, emerged as the winner of the Delhi round with seven out of eight correct drinks, a clean bar, and the best time record. “Now my focus is on the finals. This is the most interesting competition that I have participated in through my career because we are tested on everything we do behind the bar on a daily basis,” he said. He, along with three other finalists, Chirag Pal, Vineet Kumar, and Ankur Kashyap, will compete in the India Grand Finale to be held in New Delhi on 28th June. 
The finale will see the top contestants from Hyderabad, Bengaluru, Chandigarh, Goa, Mumbai, Gurgaon, Pune, Kolkata, and Delhi battle for a customised 500 CC motorcycle and a coveted place in one of the bar industry’s most prestigious global event, the Athens Bar Show, with an all-expenses-paid trip. 
Exploring global trends
 
“This competition gives us the chance to explore global trends and implement them in India. My aim is to take Indian bartending to the next level so we can compete with countries like USA and UK. It’s not easy. I belong to a pure non-alcoholic, vegetarian family. We do 12-13 hour shifts without enough money or recognition. But things are definitely getting better,” Pal said.
The Indian bartending industry is reaching an exciting stage of broadened scope, more innovation, and greater appreciation for the art that it is. Contests like this will hopefully break stereotypes, establishing this as a career that goes beyond flair bartending. 
“You cannot be the ultimate bartender if all you know is how to throw a bottle in the air. You need a number of different skills. The idea of this contest is to train and groom youngsters,” Balachandran said, of the competition with an average age of 25.

Quinoa upma on-board to Zurich
","While the Indian media contingent dug into the pan-seared seabass and roast lamb leg, Wolfgang Will slowly ate his khandvi and beetroot tikki. As a vegetarian, Will is happy to be in India, because people here get vegetarianism: “With it divergent spices and ingredients, India offers such a vast culinary variety, that I find myself in heaven here!” We’re at the launch of Swiss International Air Lines’ new in-flight menu that caters to their Mumbai-Zurich, Delhi-Zurich sectors, and he’s leading the programme, as Senior Director, South Asia Lufthansa Group.




Taste matters
Since Indians now form about half their customers, the airline felt the need to relook at the menu to make it better palatable to local tastes. Some market research later, the company realised a few things: that Indians preferred a local breakfast – most picked dosa; that they loved locally-sourced ingredients when it came to desi dishes; and that fusion wasn’t seen as fancy. What surprised them (and us): that many Westerners living in India also preferred local food.
So they went ahead and made sure they sourced the best ingredients locally, added Indian favourites and introduced a few tweaks to cater to health-seekers, while offering Western staples. First-class passengers get a range, from Roast Lamb Leg Forestier, Pan Seared Seabass and Matar Badam Ki Tikiki with Olive Kofta (with the accompaniments) for mains. Business-class travellers can enjoy khandvi on a bed of fruit salsa on a banana leaf as a starter (you’ll get Parma ham too), and beetroot halwa for dessert (along with several others). Economy gets Mysore Masala Dosa and Carrot Green Peas Upma. There’s alsoquinoa kheer, quinoa upma, and beetroot tikki (only for business of course), all catered by the Oberoi Flight Services.
Will’s favourites? They’re not on the menu: the south Indian thali and lassi.

Health is wealth!
","So what does one eat when one has been asked to go off oil and red meat? Apparently quite a lot, as I have learnt over the last few weeks.
Friends have been dropping by, all carrying baked and roasted namkeen and biscuits. One friend got us a delicious roasted chicken, about which I shall write later, and two other friends came with a hamper of yummy food from Noshi.
Noshi is a delivery outlet of the Yum Yum Cha group and serves sushi, Thai and other Asian delights. They have a wide array of dimsums, soups (pho, tom yum), sushi and sashimi, curries (red, green) and meals in a bowl (rice or noodles with your favoured flavours — spicy garlic, basil and chilli and three-pepper — with your choice of toppings.
I like sushi, but asked for steamed dimsums instead. They brought us various kinds – with edamame and truffle, chicken and chestnut, chicken and chilli oil, basil chicken, prawn cheung fun (with chillies, soy sauce and garlic) and prawn har gao, which consisted of prawns, dill leaves and asparagus. Then there was a lemongrass tofu dish, sliced garlic chicken and Thai lemon fish with basmati rice.
Wholesome meal
This was, obviously, the best meal I’d had after my stint in the hospital (where the food was so bad that it encouraged me to get well soon and get discharged at the earliest). The food from Noshi was light, yet delicious. I did not have the sauces or the prawn (high in cholesterol, alas), but really enjoyed some of the dimsums and the main dishes.
The chicken and chestnut dimsum had just the right crunchy and soft texture that I wanted, and the basil chicken had a nice flavour. I loved my Thai steamed fish, which had a mild lemony sauce, and I thought the lemongrass tofu was excellent. I didn’t much like the edamame and truffle dimsum for I didn’t get the flavour of truffle in it. But I must say it looked good!




I later found out that most of the dimsums are for ₹345 or so for a plate of four, as are the sushis (of various kinds such as tuna nigiri, unagi nigiri, salmon nigiri, spicy salmon, crab salad, cucumber blossom and enoki and truffle) for three or four rolls. The curries or wok stacks are for ₹485. Zomato says a meal for two costs ₹1000.
I loved the food from Noshi. It was light, yet delicious and flavourful. And like all of owner Varun Tuli’s creations, it looks beautiful. My only problem — and this I heard another day when some other Noshi-loving friends came over — is the packaging. It is beautifully packed, but there is too much packaging. The dimsums, for instance, came in small boxes, with smaller boxes of the sauce or the oil, and these were than all placed in a large and beautiful cardboard container. Now that I am a man who believes in safeguarding nature (and health), I thought there was no need for the carton, however elegant.
Noshi, which is in GK 1, delivers to a radius of 10 km from there, but has plans to deliver in Gurugram soon.
I am off sugar (well, mostly off, I should say) but if you order from Noshi, do have some of their mochi ice cream. Like most things Japanese it is beautiful – and healthy.
Readers are going to get to hear more on healthy food from me. After all, health is wealth, as Baba WhatsApp says.

Dakshin revamped: Amalgam of the South
"," Stepping into Dakshin, the familiar palatial décor, is like being transported to a time of monarchs and endless riches. The entrance is adorned with the traditional vilakku (lamp) and the urli filled with flower petals floating in water, and the walls dotted with south Indian artefacts. What’s not so familiar is the menu, renewed with flavours of south India with which we may not be so familiar.


Hyderabad-born chef Praveen Anand who works in Chennai’s ITC Grand Chola spearheaded the menu overhaul, bringing with him his forever expanding knowledge of south Indian cuisine — he is after all the creator of Dakshin. He sits before us with a relaxed confidence, humbleness and swagger as he regales us with tales of palates past and beyond. He’s something of an academic with his evolving curiosity and love for history — and this passion has fuelled a new menu. The various hues and textures of the pan-Indian dishes set contrastingly against the copper hues of the plate is worth a couple of photos for the cloud. The menu now features 40 vegetarian dishes and 27 non-vegetarian of which 28 are new dishes specially revived from history.
A small bowl of — take a breath — chinna vengaya patchai milagai mandi is perfect with some rice. I personally love Madras small onions and this dish has just the right amount with other fanciful ingredients like butterbeans and jumbo chillies. Karnataka brings to the fore ananas mensakai, a pineapple curry sporting a vibrant orange tinge, brought to life with byadgi chilli and coconut. 
For the non-vegetarians, Telangana’s kodi gajaala will ring a bell with its rich marinade of green chillies and onion which is quite appetising and will have you beckoning for more with a happy smile. Fish lovers will have a ball with the Kerala’s meen pollichathu, a spicy seasonal fish fillet lovingly wrapped in a banana leaf. And let’s not forget the uragai mamsam, a pickle-inspired mutton curry teeming with tomato and vinegar; while the meat is succulent, the spiciness really takes the cake and I found myself smacking my lips and licking my fingers a little too loudly for such a fancy place. And what is all of this without a delicate wisp of an appam with which to shovel all of this into your mouth?
Overwhelmed? The trick is to start off gently with the adais, banana-flavoured dosais and kuzhipaniyarams, all served with in-house chutneys. Then rest a bit, talk a little... maybe wander around ITC Kakatiya for a bit before really gearing up for the generous servings of the main course.
And of course, the desserts. Fragrant and delicious, these dishes are a home away from home. A warm serving of aadikumayam halwa and a cooling one of kadal patchee will send you home with the dreamiest of food comas.

Vitamin D armour for cancer
"," 
Higher levels of vitamin D are associated with decreasing risk of breast cancer, says a study led by researchers at University of California San Diego School of Medicine, U.S. The scientists pooled data from two randomised clinical trials with 3,325 combined participants and a prospective study involving 1,713 participants to examine the association between risk of female breast cancer and a broad range of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D —25(OH)D — concentrations, which was chosen as the marker because it is the main form of vitamin D in the blood.
Researchers identified the minimum healthy level of 25(OH)D in blood plasma to be 60 nanograms per millilitre, substantially higher than the previous medically recommended standard of 20 ng/ml.
“We found that participants with blood levels of 25(OH)D that were above 60 ng/ml had one-fifth the risk of breast cancer compared to those with less than 20 ng/ml,” said principal investigator and co-author Cedric F. Garland, DrPH, adjunct professor in the UC San Diego Department of Family Medicine and Public Health, in a press statement. The risk of cancer appeared to decline with greater levels of serum vitamin D.
Dr. Garland, who has previously studied connections between serum vitamin D levels and several types of cancer, said the study builds upon previous epidemiological research linking vitamin D deficiency to a higher risk of breast cancer. Epidemiological studies analyse the distribution and determinants of health and disease, but it has been argued that they do not necessarily prove cause-and-effect.
“This study was limited to postmenopausal breast cancer. Further research is needed on whether high 25(OH)D levels might prevent premenopausal breast cancer,” he said. As the population was also mainly white women, further research is needed on other ethnic groups.
Long-time advocate
Dr. Garland and others have advocated the health benefits of vitamin D for many years. In 1980, he and his late brother, Frank C. Garland, also an epidemiologist, published an influential paper that posited vitamin D (produced by the body through exposure to sunshine) and calcium (which vitamin D helps the body absorb) together reduced the risk of colon cancer. The Garlands and colleagues subsequently found favourable associations of markers of vitamin D with breast, lung and bladder cancers, multiple myeloma and adult leukaemia.
To reach 25(OH)D levels of 60 ng/ml would generally require dietary supplements of 4,000 to 6,000 international units (IU) per day, less with the addition of moderate daily sun exposure wearing very minimal clothing (approximately 10-15 minutes per day outdoors at noon), Dr. Garland said. The success of oral supplementation should be determined using a blood test, preferably during winter months, he added.
According to the National Academy of Medicine, U.S., the current recommended average daily amount of vitamin D3 is 400 IU for children up to one year; 600 IU for ages one to 70 years (including pregnant or breastfeeding women); and 800 IU for persons over the age of 70.
Blood serum levels exceeding 125 ng/ml have been linked to adverse side-effects, such as nausea, constipation, weight loss, heart rhythm problems and kidney damage.

Handling a threat "," 
The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare is in the process of finalising an Accelerated Plan for Elimination of Lymphatic Filariasis (APELF). Lymphatic Filariasis (LF), a mosquito-borne parasitic disease, has been endemic in India since antiquity. In 1955, the government launched the National Filaria Control Programme to eliminate LF. Of the 256 endemic districts in the country where it is endemic, 99 have successfully tackled filariasis. However, till 2016, 8.7 million cases of LF were reported in India, with 29.4 million recorded as suffering from disability associated with the disease. In addition, 650 million people across 256 districts in 21 States and Union Territories still face a risk. Therefore, India needs to up its game if it is to meet the global LF elimination target of 2020. 
India’s mass drug administration (MDA) strategy has been successful in consistently reaching more than 80% of the population under risk. However, there are still a number of challenges in more than half the number of LF endemic districts in the country despite observing a regimen that involves distributing at least 10 rounds of the two drugs (Diethylcarbamazine citrate and Albendazole, or DA). 
Sri Lanka — which was certified by the World Health Organisation (WHO) as having eliminated LF as a public health problem in 2016 — has shown that coverage and compliance of services during the MDA campaign is boosted if there is strong commitment to the social and communication sciences, including substantial investments in evidence-based social-mobilisation campaigns. A rapid scale-up of MDA that has focus on coverage and compliance is essential to decrease the number of rounds required to attain LF elimination. In future rounds of MDA, high community demand and compliance will be the critical indicators of success.
The WHO’s recent recommendation of adopting the triple drug therapy or IDA (a combination of Ivermectin along with Diethylcarbamazine citrate and Albendazole) has shown encouraging results in clinical trials across the globe and in India. IDA has the potential to rapidly shorten the number of rounds of MDA required in the community, which can be particularly promising for high-burden countries such as India where compliance to treatment has been a challenge.
Like any other vector-borne disease, management of the environment is an important aspect of prevention. While the use of insecticide-treated bed nets or larval control to check the breeding of vectors or mosquitoes that spread the disease can be valuable tools, an integrated approach could be particularly beneficial. Collaborating across government departments to build cross-linkages with other national programmes such as the Swachh Bharat Mission or malaria prevention efforts could help rein in disease transmission.
The presence of high levels of infection and clinical cases even after several rounds of effective MDA is referred to as persistent foci. These hot spots need to be looked into from the point of operational issues and parasite genetic variations. The re-emergence of infection in non-endemic areas due to migration of people from areas with ongoing transmission needs to be tackled. For example, in Surat city (Gujarat), a high microfilaria rate was noticed in the north zone of the city where the migrant population influx is high.
Elimination efforts do not end with achieving the desired results in MDA. The most traumatic impact of the disease is the suffering caused by the full-blown manifestation of filariasis in those who are infected. Morbidity management and disability prevention (MMDP) of lymphedema and hydrocele must assume greater importance so that the quality of life of affected individuals can be improved. Roping in the Indian Medical Association, which has a vast network of private practitioners, to help support awareness drives and participate in MMDP activities in endemic districts has the potential to rapidly increase access to services to those who still cannot access the public health system. It will be important to adopt innovative strategies that can be scaled up for India to create history and achieve another milestone by eliminating LF.

Scandi Sense diet: a handful of health
"," Danish-born Suzy Wengel’s diet has been hailed as the ‘simplest diet in the world’, for a reason. It takes the stress away from measuring portion sizes and carefully calibrating macronutrients, by employing the ‘handful method’, to plan out your three main meals.
She calls each of these meals, a meal box. A single meal box ideally consists of 4 handfuls of food — 1 of protein, 1 of starch/fruit, 2 of vegetables — with 1-3 tablespoons of fat and a bit of dairy. “Your portion size is controlled by your hand,” says Wengel over a Skype call. This automatically means that someone who has a smaller hand (and needs less calories) eats less than a larger person.




It takes a little time to figure out, she admits: “You have to keep full for 5-6 hours,” but once you do, it becomes a great tool to control portions wherever you are and whatever you eat. If you’re eating a burger, for instance, you can swap the French fries for a salad, reduce the bread to create a perfect meal box. Vegetarians or vegans can eat beans, soy and pulses instead of that handful of meat. If you’d like a glass of wine occasionally, simply drop the handful of starch from your meal box and eat just the protein and vegetable component. And if only ice cream will do, “you can simply fill your meal box with that, and go back to the handful system the next time you eat,” says Wengel.
A Scandi Sense success story
Suzy Wengel walks the talks: she herself lost around 40 kilos in 10 months, following a calorie-controlled, structured eating plan. “After 17 years of yo-yo dieting, I was sick and tired of my situation,” says Wengel, who weighed nearly 100 kilos when she started, soon after the birth of her second child. “I knew I had to do something good for myself. I had children and had to raise them right.”




She had tried every fad diet in the world and knew, “I couldn’t go back to one of those because they don’t work in the long run.” Instead, she decided to do it the old-fashioned way, researching intensely to find a lifestyle that would work for her. 
“Research says that only 5% of people who lose weight keep it off. What they do is very boring; they change their habits and keep that going.” The only way to do that sustainably was, “to adapt everything to the life they are living,” adds Wengel, who did exactly that to lose her weight.
The diet she adapted to lose weight back then evolved into the Scandi Sense Diet. “I realised there was a pattern in my meals. So I took my hand and placed it over my plate and realised that it contained one handful of starch, two of vegetables, one of protein and 1-3 tablespoons of fat. Also, sometimes I have dairy and sometimes I don’t,” she says.
Box it up
A visit to Ikea added another dimension to this way of eating, “They have these boxes and I saw those and told myself, ‘this is my meal box’,” says Wengel, who went on to do a course in nutrition to deepen her understanding of the subject. “I wanted to help other people, which is why I educated myself,” she says, adding that there are now around 65 nutritionists in Denmark using the Scandi Sense Diet with their clients.She went on to write a book — the latest edition of which was released in October last year — and uses social media extensively to drive home her message. “It is a relatively new idea and my big job is trying to communicate it around the world,” she says, pointing out that the meal-box concept is a great mental tool for people with overeating issues.




“A mechanical structured way of eating, over time, allows your body to intuitively know when it is hungry and when it is full. That is what happened to me.”
The nicest thing about the diet is its versatility. You can follow the principles whether you are on IF (intermittent fasting), vegetarian, LCHF (low carb, high fat); you can eat out with your friends on it; you can follow it on a holiday or during the festive season; eat food from all around the world on it.
“It is a multi-system plan,” agrees Wengel. “You just need to get your handfuls right. Weight loss is only induced by a deficit of calories and this tool will help you with that.”

Yoga on wheels
","In the wee hours of the day, a group of nine differently-abled people, including seven wheelchair-bound boys and two hearing-impaired girls, visit Jagriti Park in Delhi, to practise yoga. Having gone to school and performing Indian classical dance for more than 17 years together, the group decided to form We Are One a year ago. This trust reaches out to other people by teaching dance and yoga to anyone with a disability, whether it is autism or speech impairment. “We try to encourage people with disability to go beyond their limits. Our aim is to break stereotypes and to promote inclusion in society,” says Gulshan Kumar, the lead choreographer of the group.They’ve picked up yoga on their own, while dance was a part of daily life in Amar Jyoti School that they went to. The group has had to combat more than just disability though. They have also been able to leave behind them the shadow of harassment and exploitation from a past mentor. “Togetherness has given us enough strength to start afresh and our love for dance and yoga has made us who we are today,” says Husnain, the founder.

How yoga can help during your peri-menopause phase
","This year, the focus of yoga day is women and menopause, and it really is a time we could do with some help to relieve symptoms that range widely from irregular menstruation and painful periods to irritability and insomnia.
Seetkari Pranayama (cooling breath)
Sit in a comfortable cross-legged position, with the spine straight. Soften the facial muscles and relax the shoulders. 
Gently clench the lower and upper teeth together and separate the lips as much as you can. It should feel comfortable. Keep the jaw relaxed and the teeth exposed to air.
Inhale from between the gaps in the teeth and focus on the hissing sound of the breathe as it moves in. Close the mouth. Exhale from both the nostrils.
Repeat, breathing the same way for 20 to 30 breaths and then relax and breathe naturally.
Repeat for two to three rounds. Then relax.
Benefits
 The most common symptom of peri-menopause is hot flushes, due to hormonal fluctuations. This cooling pranayama that naturally lowers body temperature, reduces hot flushes. It’s also good for summer. It should ideally be practised regularly, sometimes thrice a day. Whenever you feel the hot flush coming on, control it with this pranayama.
Prasarita Padottanasana (wide-leg forward fold)
Separate the legs 4 feet apart, point the toes slightly inwards, both hands on the waist. Tuck the tail bone towards the floor.
Inhale; raise the chest up. Exhale; extend forward and raise the hips up towards the sky.
Place the palms on the floor or on a block.
Place a bolster between the legs, and rest the head on it.
Pull the knees caps up and press the outer and inner ankles towards the ground. Bend the knees if the hamstring feels tight. Staying in the pose will gradually release tension and then you can straighten the legs.
Hold the pose breathing deeply for 60 seconds. and then release by lift the torso back up. To repeat one more time
Benefits
 The anxiety, irritability and lack of sleep will be aided by this, as bending forward helps in reducing external distractions and stimuli. It can soothe the mind and reduce the effects of stress.
Vipareeta Karani (legs up the wall)
Sit facing the wall, with the hips a few inches away from it.
Lie down and raise the legs up on the wall. Make sure that the lower back is touching the floor and if it is not then place a bolster under the hips.
Keep the arms a few inches away from the body and open the palms towards the ceiling.
Relax the entire body and stay in this pose for a few minutes.
To release the pose, bend the knees and drop them down towards the right and then sit up.
Benefits
It increases circulation in the entire body, releasing stress and tension from the body, resulting in a calm mind. If you suffer from insomnia, this asana can help, as it grounds the body's energy and releases excess anxiety. When down against wall it becomes a restorative postures, and this then induces a deep state of rest.
Seema Sondhi discovered yoga when she suffered three lumbar slipped discs and was advised complete bed rest. Over the last 18 years, she has trained and been certified from the International Sivananda Yoga Vedanta Centre and Matthew Sweeney. She has also written six books on the subject

How World Yoga Day will make us a better nation
"," First it was basmati, then it was yoga. Foreigners are constantly stealing from us. World Yoga Day is our way of reclaiming our heritage, and in schools across the nation, it’s compulsory. It’s also very entertaining. On this day, every year, our TV screens are filled with images of Nitin Gadkari, Amit Shah and Arun Jaitley, trying to do the padmasana. This is a move in the right direction. If anyone needs to do some yoga, it’s them. They promised us a Government of heavyweights, and there is no doubt that they have delivered. Kilo for kilo, this has to be the single heaviest cabinet that India has ever had. Not that the others were pixies, but this group is clearly in a higher weight class. Whenever a minister goes missing for a few days, I worry that his colleagues may have eaten him. It’s always a relief when he reappears. 
When they go to dine with Dalits, specially reinforced tables are brought in to bear the load of the buffet. Each and every one of them has, at some point, been photographed with a plate of puris. It’s an ongoing process. They’re expanding in front of our eyes. Personally, I blame the ghee. Ghee is rich. Ghee is wholesome. Ghee is a blessing. Ghee clarifies and purifies the soul. Our legendary wrestlers drank it like Coca Cola. But they also juggled enormous implements for several hours every day. In the absence of such activity, nothing adds substance to a man like ghee. This is what has happened to our cabinet.
Doing a bit of yoga, even if it requires assistants, is the least that they can do. It also reflects very positively on the fundamental integrity of The Hindu, which started this health feature when the cabinet was at the height of its power. At a time when the entire socio-political milieu was pointing towards ghee, and the air was filled with cries of ‘Have one more aloo paratha!’, this paper launched a supplement that promotes healthy eating and exercise. Despite all the evidence of a direct correlation between deep-fried food and material success, proved beyond doubt by our leaders, and the rapid outburst of paneer, they have refused to compromise on their principles. Inspired by their example, we should support World Yoga Day. We must encourage our elected representatives to spend this day fanning out across the country and demonstrating asanas to their subjects. If they continue to do so, sincerely and well, then one day, quite soon, we will have lighter, nimbler ministers, quickly leaping to our service whenever we need them. 
The writer’s most recent novel, Murder With Bengali Characteristics, contains no paneer.

Who is afraid of red rice?
","“Try it,” I urge my friend, who is sceptical of making idlis with red rice. She is of the school that believes that rice leads to weight gain and causes diabetes. I send her some ponmani red rice and ask her to make idlis. “Three is to one, if you are using a mixer; four is to one if it is a grinder,” I advise. 




She grumbles a bit saying no one at home likes it and that the grain is too bold and it takes too long to cook... the list of complaints is interminable. But she makes the idlis and I have a convert.
She is not alone in her misconceptions about rice. Many people think rice is the fount of lifestyle diseases. But it is not. The culprit is not the rice, but the kind we eat. We polish it and strip it of its bran and process it so much that most of its minerals and vitamins are lost. 
Red rice had sort of disappeared from my table too. It made its second appearance into my life in my mid 30s. As a young child, I ate red rice grown by my great-grandmother. She sent us freshly milled rice once every two months. 
Once I moved out of Kerala, red rice became a memory and polished slender-grained white rice the norm. But when I began re-examining my food choices, I decided to bring red rice back. As part of the Save Our Rice Campaign, I learnt that most of the South Indian traditional varieties are red rice varieties. 
Since the revival of paddy seed work began in the Cauvery Delta region in Tamil Nadu, farmer families have reintroduced red rice into their own diet. While they began eating red rice as it was easily available to them, today these farmer families are well aware of the health benefits and cooking properties of the kattuyanam, sigappu kauni or kullakar grains and recommend it to visitors too.
“What pretty pink rice!,” exclaimed a little girl to whom I served some red rice and she promptly polished off her plate. The red-coloured kernel is due to the presence of anthocyanins and bran. Even when fully polished, the grain have a reddish tinge, and unpolished grains look like shiny maroon pebbles. 
Traditionally in Kerala, hand-pounded raw red rice (called onakkal-ari, meaning dried rice) is offered to temples. This is then cooked and served to the devotees. Many have this as part of their main midday meal. 
Flakes (aval) made from red rice retains almost all the bran. Full-bran red rice can be turned into red rice flour to be used in dishes like idiyappam, kolukattai, modakam, adai, kinnathappam and various snacks. The broken red rice is great for kanji (one of the tastiest dishes in my lexicon); nothing to match it with a dash of pickle. 
I have found innovative food bloggers also making rice cakes and puddings with red rice. I am waiting to cook a red rice risotto. We take pride in our ability to try foreign cuisines and be adventurous. So why be afraid of red rice?




My name is Red!
Tradtional red rice is grown widely in Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Karnataka (Sigappu kauni, Kattuyanam, Mappilai samba, Kuruva, Thondi and Thavalakannan are a few of them)
Red rice, minimally processed, has more micro nutrients and B complex vitamins than the polished rice
Ayurvedic physicians in ancient times used these varieties as medicine and for therapies
Rice is polished to increase its shelf life, but its nutrition is largely lost in the proccess
Parboiled red rice keeps longer, gives better recovery rate during paddy milling, retains more nutrition, is firmer, less sticky and more digestible but takes longer to cook
Medicinal red rice varieties are consumed unpolished to get maximum benefit
The more bran there is in the rice, the lower is its glycemic index (compared to its polished counterpart)
We also tend to eat less of red rice
What is parboiled rice?
When paddy is parboiled and dried and then milled, the resultant rice is called par boiled rice. This is a combination of the words partial and boiled. The process involves soaking the grain and cooking the paddy within the husk. It is then sun-dried to remove the moisture. It also leads to the transfer of nutrients in the bran to the rice kernel. The parboiling leads to the starches within the grain becoming gelatinised and hardened and the rice attains a translucent appearance. It also makes the cooked rice firmer and results in grains being distinct and separate

In a pickle ","Parul Bhatt was probably the only person in Chennai who was upset when it drizzled recently. “I had just placed all my pickles on the terrace to dry,” she says, adding, “March to June is my favourite season as I get the best quality mangoes then and can make many batches.”
Bhatt launched her traditional Gujarati pickles three years ago. “I grew up in Ahmedabad and came to Chennai after marriage. My mom would send me a variety of Gujarati pickles, as we Gujaratis are passionate about our pickles. After some years I started pickling, having learnt all the tricks and nuances from my mom.”
 
Four years ago, Bhatt began bottling chunda, methia keri and gor keri pickles and distributing it to friends. Based on their feedback, she modified the recipes and by the next year, she was selling her pickles under the brand Parul’s Magic.
Having lived in Chennai, Bhatt says she has developed a taste for vadu manga of Tamil Nadu and aavakai of Andhra. “But for me and many from my community, traditional Gujarati pickles are a must have. I decided to sell my pickles as there were not many options in the city,”




Chunda, a sweet, spicy and slightly sour pickle, is her best seller, courtesey handpicked mangoes from Andhra that are grated, sun dried and allowed to ferment naturally. Another popular one is the sweet and sour methia keri, a mango pickle wherein fenugreek is powdered with mustard and coriander seeds, and to which chilli powder is added. Gor keri pickle, yet another mango jaggery combination, tastes better when it is allowed to mature for a few months.
Once Bhatt standardised her Gujarati pickles, she started experimenting with other vegetables. She uses tamarind and tomato paste for pickling capsicum. She also attempted a Punjabi pickle with channa methi and mango. “Recently I made ginger and garlic pickle, with a hint of mango. Some of my customers told me that they used this pickle to marinate paneer, vegetables and meat,” says Bhatt.




“When it comes to pickling, I always go by seasonal vegetables. I make carrot and cauliflower pickles during September to December. Similarly, I source green chilli from Bhavnagar in Gujarat during November and December. For amla, the best time is from November to January. Needless to say, April to June is when you get best quality mangoes,” Bhatt says.

A little bit of everything from Odisha "," The confident and triumphant look on chef Amit Dash’s face makes a diner eager and look forward to a satisfying Odia meal. The Odia food fest at Feast — the all day-dining restaurant at Sheraton is not a wishy-washy amalgam of dishes for a food fest. When Amit Dash decided to take up the project, he knew he was going to go all out to make diners taste more than chena podo, jhal muri and dolma.




Being an Odia, Amit didn’t rely or restrict the menu to his knowledge on the cuisine. He is aware of the richness of the cuisine and also about its vastness. “I wanted to go beyond everyday food. I’m aware there’s more to the cuisine than what is spoken about. I was determined to bring it to the menu as much I could and also learn about it in the process,” he says.
Amit was also pleasantly surprised to see the manner in which everything from utensils, spices to chopping of the meats and other ingredients varied as he travelled from one region to another in Odisha. He agrees he was one happy chef on a work visit. “I didn’t feel I was working while travelling across Odisha sampling food. Everyday was a new experience and new taste,” elaborates Amit.




He travelled from Baleshwar in the north east region of Odisha, even though he grew up in Samabalpur, the western belt of the state. He also went around Bhubaneshawar, Puri, Cuttack, Karapur and Mankangiri to discover and learn more.
“Karapur and Sambalpur regions have predominantly tribal food. Food here is mostly made with indigenous ingredients. Dishes like mondo pura, bamboo chicken, ans so on,” he explains as he decides to offer some Pakhal bhaat with a mini buffet for the sides to go with the bowl of fermented rice. Fish fry, shrimp fry, alu makha, shaak bhaja (green leaf stir fry), karela bhaja (bitter gourd fry), bogori achar (Indian jujube pickle), tomato chutney to name a few. The most common everyday side for pakhal bhaat is bhojja and saggo (anything fried and stir fired leafy vegetables). 




If that wasn’t enough for food coma, Amit brought in muri-manghso. The name of the dish almost made me laugh. Muri-ghanto is heard of, what could muri-mangsho be? “Jhaal muri with mutton,” he explains. The dish, a signature item from the Baleshwar region is an absolute stunner and is best enjoyed by itself.
Dishes like these are more common to those regions in Odisha and vary from dishes made in cities like Bhubaneshwar and Puri. “The cuisine of places like Bhubaneshwar and Puri are a result of the settlers’ influence. So kosha mangso etc are common here. The most spoken food about this region is the chenna pora,” explains Amit.
The fest benefits from the extensive travel and research by the chef; every dish is made the way it should be. The only five star touch apart from the fact that it is prepared in a five star kitchen is that the meat is boneless.
Luckily the crabs for the kakda jhol (crab curry) is prepared with the shell on. Owing to the fact that the crabs are sourced from the Chilka region, the meat obtained upon cracking the hard shells is absolutely sweet. The mild gravy in which it is prepared further enhances the taste of the crabs.

Masala chai chocolate, anyone? "," Despite the sweltering summer, Janani Kannan is thankful for having on an extra layer in the form of her apron, along with a pair of gloves, hygiene cap and socks. It’s 16° Celsius inside her kitchen. “That’s the temperature I require when I am making my chocolates,” says Kannan, adding, “But given the soaring mercury levels here, it’s sometimes hard to maintain the temperature.”
The founder of chocolate brand Zitter has stacked her working area with large packets of couverture, and sits surrounded by around 70 moulds in 25 different designs. She’s filling the paisley-shaped ones with mango and chilli-flavoured pralines, while the petal-shaped mould is used only for chakkara pongal chocolate, one of her most popular creations. Bite into it and you get the refreshing taste of edible camphor. She’s secretive about what goes into making it, and only reveals, “The recipe includes everything that goes into sweet pongal, except dal and rice.”




She gives an Indian twist to pralines, enrobed chocolates and truffles, with flavours likemasala chai, sheer korma, gajar halwa, lassi, kulfi and paan. Then there are other varieties like lychee rose, salted caramel, salt and cranberry, peanut butter, coffee, passion fruit...40 flavours on the whole.
“I have a diploma in French Patisserie from Cordon Bleu in Kuala Lumpur. I also stayed in Singapore for a while and worked at a pastry store there. When I returned to India last year and took part in a few pop ups, I noticed people are crazy about any flavours they see on MasterChef. They enjoy new flavours. I knew I could create them: it helps that I have access to ingredients as my friends get them for me every time they travel,” says the 31-year-old, who started Zitter in April this year. 
The double door refrigerator occupying one end of the room holds fruit purees, boxes of experimental flavours and 35 trays, each holding 24 pieces of chocolate: all made by her. “Right from ideating and executing to hand or spray-painting them, I prefer doing it myself. When I hire someone I’ll make sure they are well-trained,” she laughs. 
Almost every night by 10 pm, after her little daughter is asleep, Kannan comes into her workspace and makes chocolates till about 4.30 am. “During the day the temperature is too hot for chocolates to be made,” she says.
Kannan plans to introduce her chakka pradhaman chocolates on Onam. Ever heard of chocolate bars in potato chip, matcha or pretzel flavour? Well, expect that next, followed by a Japanese line with yuzu, rasperry and wasabi and sakura and black sesame. 




A former dessert addict, Kannan says that ever since she started Zitter she’s gotten over her love for all things sweet. “I can’t even taste my own chocolates.” And that’s why it’s great to be her friend and family, as they get to try out and give feedback. “Of late, everything comes out well and my friends are disappointed that they aren’t getting to reject flavours, as that’s something they take great joy in,” she laughs. 
(Zitter chocolates can be ordered on Facebook and Instagram. They are available in boxes of five, 12, 18 and 24 and are priced at ₹350, ₹750, ₹1,100 and ₹1,500.)

‘Beauty is everyone’s concern’
","It is usual to find film stars, sport personalities and politicians surrounded by fans and followers. One did not expect such response for Shahnaz Husain, one of the pioneers of herbal beauty care movement in the country. From the moment she steps into Fire, the multi-cuisine restaurant of The Park for a luncheon interaction, men and women of all age groups douse my cynical mind with their requests for selfies and autographs with the doyenne of cosmetic industry. 
Perceiving my surprise, Shahnaz says, “This is the goodwill that I have earned thanks to my profession. For me, money was never primary. It was to help people look good without adverse effects. I’m always keen to help people including strangers whenever I observe a skin or hair problem. I try to suggest what is good for them. Recently, I noticed the girl doing my cardiogram at the doctor’s clinic had a bad case of skin pigmentation. I advised what was best for her.” 
Chef Abhishek Basu has specially curated organic seasonal menu for the guest. Shahnaz remarks, “Being conscious about my diet, I am glad about this menu.”
Carving her own niche
Considering that Shahnaz comes from a family of legal luminaries — her grandfather Samiullah Beg served as the Chief Justice of Hyderabad High Court, father Nasirullah Beg was the CJ of Allahabad High Court and uncle Mirza Hameedullah Beg was the CJI — many find it surprising that she decided on cosmetic business as a career. “My father wished me become the Chief Justice of the International Court of Justice in Hague while I teased him that my limited schooling was not enough for that. Having been married at 15 and becoming a mother at 16, I wondered what to do with my life. Not keen on interior decoration or fashion, I decided to opt for cosmetic therapy and cosmetology.”
What she decided, she did with style, studying in eight countries and getting trained in globally reputed institutions like Helena Rubinstein, Swarzkopf, Christine Valmy, Lancome and Lean. “Having dropped out of school, I was hungry for knowledge , till they said, there is nothing else to teach,” she quips. Remarkably, Shahnaz paid the fees for these institutions on her own by writing articles on beauty for magazines and weeklies.
Shahnaz took a major decision when after learning Western techniques and methods she decided to create herbal products based on Ayurveda. She says it happened because of a chance incident. “At Rubinstein, my classmate Catherine used to come with a very beautiful woman whom she made wait outside. Unable to control my curiosity, I found out that the lady was her mother. A well known model, she had gone blind by using a famous eye make-up while advertising for the product. I was completely stunned and wondered that if a cosmetic product led to loss of sight, there is something wrong with the beauty business. Pondering over it, I decided to tap India’s more than 3000-year-old Ayurvedic heritage to find alternatives for the chemicals used in beauty products.” After returning to India, she employed several ayurveda practitioners for the job. “You would be surprised to know that for each formulation we discovered 20 alternatives. Such is the richness of this ancient science.”
Meanwhile, the chef fills the table with healthy options. There is sol kadhi, bael pathar ka sharbat and bhutte ka kees taco. Each finds favour with Shahnaz. “This is the strength of natural ingredients. It not only lends taste and flavour but also provides required nutrients.” As we finish the main course of Thanjavur manga curry, mangodi ki subzi and munsiari rajma masala is served. Shahnaz remarks, “The sheer colour, aroma and presentation makes the dishes so tempting. I will try a little of each.” 
As we enjoy the delicacies, Shahnaz observes that while most people think that creams, lotions and treatment makes one look good, it is essentially our food intake that plays a major part. “If possible, people should go vegan, otherwise they must eat lots of fresh fruits and vegetables; go high on protein and less on carbohydrates; eat dal and rice after removing the water. These are the mantras for healthy skin and hair.” One couldn’t help observe the hotel staff, listening in rapt attention as did other guests around us.
Strict diet 
On being asked if she herself practices what she preaches, Shahnaz says. “I follow my diet rigorously. Breakfast is oats, papaya and green tea. Lunch is usually fruit juice, brown bread, cheese and vegetables while dinner is one roti with subzi.” It must be tough to resist the temptation. “Yes it is,” she admits candidly. “I do have cheat days when I eat Hyderabadi biryani, korma, roast potatoes, kakori kababs, sheer mal and kheer.” Her favourite cuisine is of course South Indian. “Being light and healthy, I prefer idli and dosa with sambar. I learnt this from Vyjayanthimala, who told me that a doctor had advised her to eat these when she wanted to be fit for a particular film.” Likewise, she prefers Chinese cuisine, particularly chicken chowmein, Peking duck and sweet corn soup. “Bahut light hota hai!”
Amazingly dealing with chemicals and their formulations, Shahnaz does not lead from the front in kitchen. “I never had a chance to learn since we always had a cook at home. Once venturing to make rice, I was so confused about the quantity of water and the time required to boil it, that I ended up adding milk and sugar to make kheer,” she quips. 
As the doyenne emphasises the need for proper diet for healthy body and mind, one wonders what beauty means to her. “Beauty is what a woman exudes from inside. There are essentially two aspects to it. A woman needs to be intelligent besides being attractive. One without the other never works. Secondly, neither the skin nor hair colour is important, it is the quality that counts.” Then what about this fanatic longing about fairness? “That is really unfortunate. I know several women having underwent chemically induced treatment to look fair. That never helps as the side effects are terrible. We too are entreated by parents to make their daughters fair to help them get a suitable match. All this pains me.” The cosmetic industry too fuels this fascination as evident from ads. “Instead of changing public perception, they are promoting it. Skin colour does not decide the character or nature of a person or how he or she will be as a life partner,” remarks Shahnaz.
Instead of this obsession for fairness, Shahnaz suggests one should take care of oneself. “Looking good is feeling good. People in general and women in particular must take out ‘me time’ to take care of themselves. This need not necessarily mean visiting salons or parlours.” Stating that beauty consciousness is no longer confined to the upper crust of the society, she narrates some interesting anecdotes. “I once met a woman selling Rajasthani cushions in Connaught Place. She recognised me and eagerly shared that she uses one of my products which she picks up in bulk during her visits to Delhi. Likewise, a guard once asked me what cream to buy for his wife. Beauty is everyone’s concern,” she sums up.

Comfort food for meat lovers "," Rarely does one come across a place that constantly garners praise. But Food Beez on Bypass Road is grabbing much attention. Some positive reviews on the social media drove me to this small place with an unpretentious vibe. 
I happened to walk in as the first customer of the day on a weekend and the young boy serving at the table was happy to explain the restaurant’s USP. He pulled out a special grilled chicken menu and suggested the different flavors of hot garlic, pepper, glazed butter and butter chicken masala. “Our restaurant serves the common grilled chicken with robust flavours,” he assured.
I ended up ordering that one dish most customers swear by — the signature mutton biryani. It tasted different with subtle flavours and spices unlike what is usually available elsewhere in the city. Here only cardamom, cinnamon and cloves go into the making of the home-style biryani. The portion was adequate and taste of melt-in-the-mouth mutton pieces lingered on. What also set it apart is that the dish was cooked in chekku ennai (cold-pressed oil) instead of refined oil or ghee. In fact, the oil is used for all preparations at Food Beez.
“The idea is to help people distinguish every flavour and also feel light after a meal,” sais M Muthukumar, one of the three partners who set up this 28-seater inside a closed TASMAC shop. “Our first challenge was to make the place brighter, family-friendly, and appealing.”

Next, the core values were set — of not using artificial colours and seasonings, frozen meat, and the maida in the kitchen. 
Gradually as more people walked in, I noticed how fast the service was. I was now tempted to try the butter glazed grilled chicken with wheat naan. It was delicious. 
The well thought out menu had make-to-order gravies, chef’s sea food specials like the prawn thokku, egg manchurian and poriyal, masala omelette, and karandi egg Chettinadu and more, though the eatery’s forte is mutton preparations.
Muthukumar said he and his two friends — Gopalakrishnan and Benito — as engineering students in Madurai often travelled in and around the city and nearby districts to try various dishes. And it was their dream to set up a restaurant selling their own tried-and-tested and improvised healthy recipes. While his friends continue to be in IT jobs, Muthukumar gave up his to focus on the restaurant. “They keep sending their inputs and suggestions.”
Feedback from customers has been encouraging too. The main course was as good as the starters and desserts and each item is competitively priced between ₹20 (for the drinks/omelettes) to ₹180 for the mutton biryani. There were some surprises too like the seasonal Mughal biryani and the Kolkata white chicken, available only on weekends.

Let’s talk vadais
","  Vadais need no introduction, for they can safely be called the numero uno evening indulgence across Tamil Nadu. And Madurai surely loves its vadais that come in a variety of shapes, sizes, textures and flavours. From the spongy medhuvadai to the hard-to-crack thattu vadai, there’s no dearth of options. 




Come evening time, vadai kadais spring up across the city’s roadsides. The shops serve up some of the best vadais ever. Among the varieties served, there’s something unique called thavala vadai and it’s not just the name that intrigues. With a crunchy outer coating and a spongy core, thavala vadai is a typical Chettinad snack and its popularity has spilled over to the rest of Southern Tamil Nadu.
In Madurai, there are only a few select shops where you can get the delicacy. At the 100-year-old Gopu Iyengar Tiffin Home on North Chitrai Street, head cook S Jayaraj has been dishing out batches of vadais every evening for decades. What does ‘thavala’ mean, we ask Jayaraj, as many wonder if it has something to do with frog (thavalai is the Tamil word for the reptile).
“Thavala also refers to a type of vessel. Also called thavi by some, it is flat at the bottom and is commonly used to make this type of vadai. It retains the heat so that the snack is evenly cooked and is crispy,” he explains. “The snack has to be fried under medium heat. One should know when to drop the batter in oil.”




The thavala vadai consists oftoor dal, moong dal, Bengal gram dal, parboiled rice, raw rice, coconut gratings, dry red chilli, mustard and asafoetida. It tastes similar to another south Indian delicacy, the adai dosa; thavala vadai’s speciality though, is its overtly spicy taste, that the dry red chillies lend.
It is a widely prepared at Chettinad weddings. “The thavala vadai can also be prepared by incorporating yellow peas,” says KN Visalakshi, who has been making the snack for more than two decades.
In Madurai, the price of a vadai ranges from ₹10 to 15. The mix of dals in equal proportions is the key to getting the vadai it right. Also, since the batter dal and rice mixture is coarsely ground, the vadai takes a long time to cook. “In the past, copper or brass vessels were used for the purpose,” says Jayaraj. 
Recipe 
Ingredients: 
100gm toor dal
100gm Bengal
100gm moong dal
50gm urad dal
100gm parboiled rice
20gm raw rice
 4 dry red chillies 
 Salt
Oil for deep frying
50gm grated coconut
1/2 tsp asafoetida powder 
1/2 tsp mustard seeds
 1 tbsp finely chopped curry leaves 
 1 Onion (finely chopped)
 Method:
Soak the dal and rice separately in water for four hours along with dry red chillies. Drain out the water and grind coarsely along with salt, asafoetida. Add the grated coconut, onion, curry leaves and seasoned mustard seeds to the batter. Mix well. Pinch some batter and flatten over the palm and deep fry in hot oil.

A Maha meal at Mahamudra "," Mahamudra, the three-month-old restaurant in the city has nothing to do with the Sanskrit meaning. Apart from being a vegetarian place, the eatery— a part of Isha Life in Hyderabad, isn’t trying to force spirituality down your throat. Once here, the beauty and the calmness of the place and its interiors are sure to do all the magic by itself. This, even before one begins to sip their chia-based welcome drink.




To know more, I met Meena, fondly called ‘Meena akka’ — the mastermind behind every detail — right from the kitchen to the flowers adorning the table. Having tried and been blown over by the veg thali by the warm tones of Mahamudra’s interiors, I was curious to know what more is there to talk about. When dining at a vegetarian place I usually push a few things away from my plate. The rasam, sambar, curd rice is something I always return to avoid food wastage. But here, the swirling aromas of various dishes which pleased my senses made me eagerly look forward to the order. I overlooked the delay in service assuming it is the management’s way to make us practice patience.




Mahamudra has been one of the most recommended places by many food-lovers (all of them being hardcore non-vegetarian eaters) and each of them said, “the food is different.”
To be honest, I had some presumptions — ‘is it all boiled bland food,’ ‘will they serve raw food,’ ‘is it all about millets,’ and upon hearing these, Meena laughed, asking, “What do you think about it now?”




“The restaurant celebrates south-Indian home cooking. The menu is put together with the help of fellow Isha members. Every dish we serve here is probably being cooked in someone’s kitchen now,” she adds, as she offers vadas made of banana flower with some fresh homemade chutney.
As I bit into the crisp vadas my prejudices further started going bust one bite at a time. Meena clarifies, “Since this is a restaurant, we might be different, but we do not serve diet food unless one requests for it.”
Mahamudra is the second eatery Isha Life has opened in 10 years — the first being in Chennai. No matter what one eats, it is a must to try the thali here just for the signature accompaniments. The black sticky rice kheer and the curd rice is enough to win your heart.


Apart from the thalis, the menu also serves a variety of dosas for lunch. In the evening, the menu changes and ‘tiffin’ items like medu vada, kozhukattai, ulundhu paniyaram, parappu kozhukattai, vazhaipu cutlet take over.
In the main course, the starters and the soups are as homely as one can imagine them to be. Thakkali (tomato), methi and kollu (horse gram) soups are a few to try. Kanjee lovers, do try them here and for those whom a good dosa is a reason to celebrate, it is worth trying it here too.
My suggestion? Go for the tables with short wooden chairs. The wrought iron chairs are tall, stiff and uncomfortable enough to spoil your whole meal experience.

Mommy knows best
"," When Sharmila Ribeiro decided to cut back on work-related travels to focus on her and her family’s health and diet, she was just looking out for her pack. Today, she sees that decision as a positive trigger point, that soon snowballed into her book Everyday Love: A Mother’s Guide to Healthy Cooking for Kids winning the Family Cookbook category at the Gourmand World Cookbook Awards Conference, 2018 in China.
Back in India after the ceremony, Ribeiro is gushing, and not just about the award. “I had written this book primarily for parents. But kids these days are cooking a lot, and many of them are using my recipes, which is wonderful,” she says over phone.

So what is it that sets this book apart? It’s very raison d’etre has been spoken and written about quite a bit, for a publication that is barely six months old, but the author explains it again. “I quit my travels five years ago, and started de-junking my kitchen. All the stuff that you buy — from muesli and peanut butter to things we need for our traditional meals — we started making at home. The health benefits were huge,” she says. The shift in lifestyle wasn’t easy, and Ribeiro took her time with it. She soon began documenting her attempts, because it occurred to her that this cause wasn’t hers alone. “All mothers and all schools struggle with this: how to pack a lunch that is healthy, and that kids will be willing to eat,” she points out. Thus began a long series of testing, tasting and even photography sessions, all with the aim of making these recipes publishable and more accessible.
Ribeiro also insists that this shift in lifestyle isn’t just for families. Single, working people can adopt these just as well, “All it takes is prepping. If you prep on the weekends and plan ahead, it really helps with healthy eating.” The book is a testament to the growing market there is for slow, healthy food options. It is also a testament to the fact that not all self-published books are necessarily below par. Ribeiro says she never approached a publisher with her work; self-publishing was her go-to choice for a reason. “I have a nephew who is a photographer. With him, I could play with the design and bring out the book the way I wanted. The look of the book was very important to me: it had to be appealing.” 
So Ribeiro and her team handled everything from layout to printing. “The book was off the press on November 9, 2017, and the deadline for entries for the contest was November 15,” she says. The team had to dispatch a copy fresh off the press, though the book was formally released only in December 2017. The effort, though, was clearly worth it.

Time to give local fish varieties a shot! "," Whether it is the Malayalis’ beloved karimeen, the Konkani love affair with pomfret, or the Bengali hilsa obsession, communities along the coast are avid consumers of fish. 
Traditional fish-eating homes usually cook a variety of fish, but you only find a handful of varieties in restaurants. In Mumbai, for instance, even the popular seafood haunts mostly carry the Famous Five: pomfret, rawas (rohu/rui), surmai (seer fish/king mackerel), bombil (estuarian lizard fish), and bangda (mackerel).




There are two reasons why some fish are popular. They are prized for their flavour, but more importantly, it is their bone structure that makes them a preferred choice. They invariably fillet easily, or when fried whole, the meat can be picked apart easily with hands. Larger fish, like seer fish, when cut against the backbone, give perfect steak-cut pieces for pan-frying with masala, or gently cooking in a curry.




The sad reality is that due to unseasonal and over fishing, the prices of popular fish in demand have skyrocketed, while equally delicious, cheaper varietals are sadly ignored. More importantly, fish stock populations have taken a devastating hit, as has the delicate ecosystem of our coasts. In Mumbai’s fish markets, we spotted several fish that were not only in-season, but also a surprising find. We found three varieties of tuna, including large quantities of the prized yellowfin in Sassoon Docks. Also easily spotted were Indian halibut, wolf herring, sea catfish, mahi-mahi, croaker, grouper, pink emperor, and sole, among others. Being home cooks, it seemed daunting to work with unfamiliar fish. But as long as fish is fresh — which, when sourced from local markets it invariably is — most varieties are forgiving to cook. Here are some suggestions:
Thin-spine sea catfish
East coast: Soldier catfish (June to February)
West coast: Thin-spine sea catfish (August to January). Don’t let the whiskers fool you; this flavour-packed fish is easy to work with. 
Fun fact: The most eaten (and unfortunately tasteless) fish in India today — basa — hails from farms in Vietnam’s Mekong delta and is a catfish. 




But our coasts are home to a variety of others, like the thin-spine sea catfish. It has a strong flavour, in the way salmon or surmai does, but it is its own beast. Filleting is interesting, as the blade needs to manoeuvre around the bulbous ribcage all the way to the rock-hard collarbone. Oily and firm, it works beautifully in braises and curries, grills, tandoors, or simply pan-seared. This distinctive fish forms a wonderful counterpoint in the mustardy Bengali preparation magur maacher jhol. The famous Vietnamese dish cà kho tô of catfish braised in fish sauce caramel is a grand way to highlight it. 
Curing it in gin lends a pleasant and aromatic balance that we think is an easy yet elevated take on this fish. 
Mandeli/Anchovies
Best to consume: September to February




There are plenty of Indian recipes for cooking schooling fish like anchovies and sardines, from pickles to fried fish, and even in curries. Fillets of anchovies develop an intense savouriness when dry-salted and stored in oil, making them a great ingredient to have in your pantry for a variety of preparations. Consider adding some to the mirepoix while making a bolognese. Whole fillets on buttered toast, with a squeeze of lime, makes for a delicious breakfast, or starter plate. The Italians crush some in their intense Puttanesca sauce. Oh, and no Caesar salad is complete without anchovies in the dressing. The best use of it, however, is to mash some with garlic in the celebrated Piedmontese dish bagna càuda, where the sweet, stewed garlic finds equilibrium with the umami-rich anchovies.
Mahi-Mahi
Best to consume: November to February
Also known as dolphin fish, these large surface-dwellers usually follow boats and jump in and out of the water, much like dolphins. They are fast growers and are not overfished on our coasts, making them a more sustainable choice. 
With a firm flesh and mild flavour, these fish can be customised in a variety of ways, like curries and fries. Filleted portions are perfect for the pan. Sear in oil, with skin on, and remove once fish is cooked and skin is crispy. Add some butter, Thai fish sauce and bird’s eye chillies to the hot pan to pick up all the bits. Once off the heat, whisk in some lime juice and pour the hot emulsion over crispy-skinned fillet.

Chef David Chang opens up on the trauma of cooking "," Chef David Chang’s first public response to the death of his mentor Anthony Bourdain was a black box on Instagram. It was accompanied by the lyrics from American musician Will Oldham’s ‘I See a Darkness’. “Well, I hope that someday, buddy / We have peace in our lives... And pull the smiles inside...”
His second response was an incisive and searingly honest podcast about his own struggles with depression. Chang is bright, popular and incredibly successful. The 40-year-old restaurateur, author and TV personality is best known for founding Momofuku, a spunky New York noodle bar in 2004, which rapidly grew into a group of restaurants all over the world. He hosts the popular Netflix original series Ugly Delicious, has won countless awards for his food, and has recently launched a media company, Majordomo Media, under which he hosts a podcast, The David Chang Show.
So when he went public about his constant battle with depression on his podcast, it triggered a growing wave of responses from writers, chefs and regular people, comforted by the fact that they were not alone. The half-an-hour podcast titled ‘Mental Health and Holding on to Hope’ begins with Chang apologising in advance to listeners who may find it “too dark or self-indulgent” and saying it “doesn’t feel appropriate to talk about anything but Tony Bourdain... Maybe the best way to honour Tony is to talk about my own struggles. I taped this by myself on a recorder two days after I found out that Tony died...”




Chang continues, “The fact of the matter is we all need help. Even those of us that think that everything is going great. It’s so hard to ask for help. More specifically, it’s really hard to find that help.” He talks about how expensive a good psychiatrist can be, adding that he has been seeing one since 2003, “Everyday... It has been the most regular and the longest relationship I have ever been in.” He adds, “The one thing I’ve ever spent money on — most people would consider me a cheap ass because I don’t really spend money on anything except food — I always spent as much money as I had or could afford on mental health.”
 A bad yelp review just makes me so sad. It makes me so angry 
While it is commonly known that kitchens are high-stress, Chang opens up about the trauma of cooking. “There’s a lot of cooks that have PTSD (Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder). Because that’s how stressful cooking was... Or at least the cooking I experienced.”
He says it took him years to get help, even when he knew he needed it. “In the past, particularly in an Asian household, the idea that you could get help for this was insane... I needed to see a professional because I was in despair. And I had had bouts of despair ever since high school. But I was just told to suck it up...” He adds, “I could never understand why. If I wasn’t gloomy, I was overly happy. Or I was gloomy and I was sad and I was depressed, but there was only smiles on the outside.”
He describes depression “like fighting some kind of invasive artificial intelligence of my psyche... It is constantly observing and getting data on how I am trying to beat this thing... And after a 15-plus-year battle with it, it is an incredibly complex organism. That is smarter than I am half the time...” He continues, “Sometimes I don’t even realise that I am in a state of depression because I don’t even recognise it. It has gotten so clever (at) morphing. It is evolving... I have to fight that every day.”
Sheer resilience




Momofuku was his way of fighting back. “2004 was about getting a restaurant open... A trick of mine is to set sometimes unrealistic goals for myself... before I go down a road of darkness.” He admits that opening a restaurant is one of the “most stressful, most difficult, high-failure things you can do,” but says work helped him battle depression. “Even when I had days (when it was) hard getting out of bed — it was like training for a marathon. It was just something you had to do. And when everything else didn’t make sense and my rational mind was not really working for me... I knew there was a purpose and I had get to work.”
In the podcast, Chang also opened up about his “huge issues with self-confidence. Approval. Self-love. I had a neurosis that I was not smart. That I was incredibly stupid. My paranoia was real. In retrospect, none of that was necessarily true. It’s hard to make sense of it all when you are in it.” He admits that therapy isn’t easy either. “I had some very expensive sessions when I would say nothing.” However, as Momofuku started to do well, he decided to pay for more sessions with his psychiatrist.
“I remember thinking: What’s the point of having money if I’m going to be dead anyway.” Discussing how he struggles with “imposter syndrome,” he talks of how he became so dependent on reviews for validation that he never really enjoyed success. “Work should never give you meaning... while I can tell you this right now, I still seek meaning through approval,” he admits, adding that he’s trying to find balance. “A bad yelp review just makes me so sad. It makes me so angry. I try not to read them any more...” The podcast concludes with Chang urging people to get help, “My heart goes out to anyone that has experienced anything similar. And I know it sounds a cliché, but you are not alone. You are not.”

On the Dessert Trail: Around the World in 80 Desserts
"," What happens when a chef, restaurateur, and cookbook author has a sweet tooth? “I set out On the Dessert Trail: Around the World in 80 Desserts,” laughs Monish Gujral, the custodian of the Moti Mahal brand. On the Dessert Trail: Around the World in 80 Desserts also happens to be the title of Gujral’s fourth book, which recently won the Best Pastry and Desserts Book Award at the 2017 Gourmand World Cookbook Awards, an awards collective created by Édouard Cointreau.
Growing up surrounded by good food, Gujral was an integral part of many food stories and discussions by default. “This developed my interest in food beyond eating. I was interested in knowing all the aspects of food, which got me actively involved in the business and industry. I had a sweet tooth naturally, so my weakness led me to quiz chefs about desserts I ate and relished during my travels.”




Gujral is the managing director of Moti Mahal Deluxe Management Services, and is credited for the trail-blazing turn-around of Moti Mahal — a transformation from a humble joint to an iconic restaurant, and eventually into a mammoth franchise business. “As I multiplied my business and opened outlets and also signed franchise partners, I had more and more access to international chefs, their recipes and ingredients. My love for desserts started taking a wave, and even before I realised, I had tried about 80 to 85 desserts in my own kitchen,” recollects Gujral.
As a traveller, chef and cookbook author, Gujral wanted to draw the attention of people to classic desserts and the stories behind them. His research threw light on the fact that while there were many recipe books on desserts, there wasn’t anything that listed many classics in one, woven into a story. Gujral is proud that his book has recipes from places like Algeria, Brazil, Poland and Lebanon, apart from the usual sweet suspects.
“Did you know that there was a cold war between France and Britain on the invention of the crème brûlée?” asks Gujral, who’s curated close to 80 international dessert recipes. “Or that the torte, a dessert from Austria, was also the subject of a long trademark battle between creator Eduard Sacher and the Demel bakery, where he worked? Me neither. All these nuggets of information form a part of the recipes I chose. I spent close to two years talking to chefs to learn beyond what was easily available. These anecdotes accompany the recipes of the desserts. I wanted everyone who reads the book to read beyond ingredients, method and bake- or no-bake desserts.”

Expect a smorgasbord of flavours at Ikea India
"," The Swedes take their ‘Fika break’ or ‘work break’ seriously. There’s at least one Fika break each day, and it’s more than grabbing a coffee and a short eat. It’s a culture that’s deeply ingrained. Employees are encouraged to take that break, move away from their workstations and meet people over a beverage and baked goodies. 
Ikea, headquartered in Almhult, Sweden, celebrates this culture. To call their Fika break area a dining hall or a canteen would be doing it injustice. 
It’s an all-welcoming, spacious section of the office, that speaks of the Scandinavian love for white interiors, with several low-hung lamps adding warmth to the long tables. The signs of change, skewed towards healthier offerings, are visible at the cafeteria in the Almhult Ikea store, and the sprawling restaurant inside Ikea Museum in Smaland village. 
Almhult is often referred to as Ikea town, since it’s here that Ikea’s founder Ingvar Kamprad established the first store in 1958. Almhult municipality has a population of 17,000, and most inhabitants are directly or indirectly employed by the company.




The town houses the Ikea of Sweden offices, test lab, hotel, an Ikea store and a museum.
The Fika breaks were an opportunity to introduce the world media — that had gathered in Almhult for Democratic Design Days 2018 — to several Swedish specials. Quite a few of these, it was heartwarming to know, will make their way to the 1,000-seater Ikea bistro set to open in July in Hyderabad, abutting the first store. This will be the company’s largest bistro in the world, and serve a mix of Swedish and Indian cuisine. 
Less sugar please
There was plenty of good coffee, tea and flavoured drinks to go around during the Fika break. In sync with the global shift towards consuming less sugar, Ikea doesn’t serve sugar-laden aerated drinks and instead offers Nordic fruit waters, with 50% less sugar. 
The lingonberry-flavoured fruit water is a must-try. Lingonberries are partly-tart, partly-sweet and the fruit water has mild notes of the berries. The bistro will also have raspberry, lemon and pear-flavoured waters. 
Swedes have a sweet tooth and love their cinnamon buns, cookies and chocolate balls. Too much sugar? Only if you eat them all at one go. 
The cinnamon buns, a Swedish special, has butter and cinnamon-laced sugar rolled into the swirls of pastry puff. The hint of cinnamon works delicately on the palate. 
These buns will be served in an in-house bakery in Hyderabad’s Ikea bistro, alongside fresh breads, dinner rolls, croissants, chocolate cakes, mango cakes and cheesecakes. Want more? Try their fresh fruit salad and gulab jamun.  Four years of research in different cities in India has helped the company understand the local palate and include a sizeable Indian vegetarian selection, while also staying true to its Scandinavian origin.
Swedish meatballs and hot dogs top the list of iconic specials and are available in most Ikea cafeterias in the world. Now, veggie balls and veggie dogs also feature prominently on the menu. Ikea will steer clear of beef and pork for India, and bring in chicken, salmon and vegetarian variants of the meatballs. The platter of veggie balls, with stir-fried wholegrain rice and vegetables, looks deceptively small, but packs in the right amount of carbs, proteins and healthy fats for a wholesome meal.




Bite-sized helpings of the salmon balls served at a session in Almhult turned out to be a welcome surprise. The balls make use of the often-discarded portions of the salmon head and neck. It’s an exercise towards reducing food wastage, and the firm aims to cut wastage in its cafeterias by 50% by 2020.
This will be a priority in India as well, asserts Henrik Osterstrom, Country Manager-India, Ikea Food, “We are concerned that no food waste should go to landfills. We will have a system in place to measure the daily waste and try to minimise this over time. We will compost organic waste, send it back to farmers, so that it can be used to grow plants, thereby closing the food loop.”
Back to greens
Vegetarian inclusions in the menu is Ikea’s nod to the growing interest in plant-based food. At the design summit, a soy-based soft ice swirl was introduced. The texture is creamy with only a subtle flavour of soy. Dried berries and nuts are used for toppings. 




The company is also toying with fruit-based and oat-based ice creams. Its popular vanilla-flavoured yoghurt ice cream will be available in India and more flavours will be added later.
Four years of research in different cities in India has helped the company understand the local palate and include a sizeable Indian vegetarian selection, while also staying true to its Scandinavian origin and global appeal. 
Osterstrom calls it “the Swedish feel and Indian appeal. There will be a variety of starters, salads and desserts, and the Indian menu will include samosas, dal makhani and biryani,” he emphasises. 
Ikea is tight-lipped about its local food partners at this point. The company has its own kitchens for its cafeterias across the globe and Hyderabad will be no exception. The bistro is eager to serve carnivores, vegetarians, vegans and flexitarians.

Singaporean style meets Indian ingenuity ","Fresh but familiar, global but local, Ek Bar is Defence Colony’s neighbourhood cocktail bar that offers carefully-curated cocktails and small plates with a distinctly Indian flavour in a cosy yet stylish setting. Having recently refurbished their space and revamped their menu, the team has injected their ‘Proud To Be Indian’ philosophy into every little detail of this one-of-a-kind bar.
Ek Bar invites you to lean back put your feet up, and relax in its comfortable corners after a hard day’s work; alternatively, you can sit at the buzzing bar, “the best seat in the house”, and watch the bartenders do their magic. The chic minimalist décor of dark wood panelling, deep colours, and soft candle light is complemented by little traces of India in the old-world pre-independence lamps, peacock cushions, and the eye-catching ‘wall of Indian hats’. 
With the FIFA World Cup on in the background, a smoking room labelled ‘Dhumrapaan’, uniquely Indian products casually lying around in the bathrooms, and an extremely warm and friendly team, Ek Bar feels like home.
Chef Manu Chandra’s food menu is inspired by the nation’s regional diversity and its ingredients are locally-sourced. Ek Bar ke Us Paar (clever name!) is their version of the famous Ram Ladoo Chaat from Lajpat Nagar across the road. The Pork Belly Skewers, with a glaze made of ‘ghar ka churan’, and the Baked Malai Mushroom, served with masala kulcha, are scrumptious dishes that have ‘comfort’ written all over them. But the Beef Chilli Ularthiyathu served with Malabar paratha takes the cake- it’s the beauty of Kerala captured in one mouthful! Ek Bar’s experimental menu seeks to bring back India’s lost recipes and Chef Aabhas Mehrotra promises it will remain dynamic.
Similarly, the unconventional cocktails, put together by mixologist Nitin Tewari, fuse nostalgic local flavours and classic combinations for a merry mix that pleases the taste buds and lightens the spirit. While the Coorg Colada infuses Coorg coffee (and banana chips!) in the traditional Pina Colada, the Commissioner Sahab is a brandy-based drink accented by hookah smoke. The Beeda Tonic uses ‘paan ka patta’ to make an authentically Indian gin cocktail. And for those who get bored easily, the Es-sense is a simple vodka drink served with three different scents in perfume bottles; just spray for a new flavour each time!




Pop-up event
“We want to promote a cocktail-drinking culture in the country. Mixology is complicated, it’s chemistry. Elsewhere in the world, people go out for a drink and food is incidental. It’s the opposite here and we want to change that,” says Shaaz Mehmood, Co-Partner at Ek Bar. In that endeavour, Ek Bar is bringing a team from 28 HongKong Street, Singapore, ranked number 25 in the World’s 50 Best Bars 2017 list, to Delhi for a pop-up event. The team, consisting of Co-Bar Captain Lukas Kaufmann and Sous Chef Richie Tam, will take over the bar and restaurant on 21st and 22nd June from 7 pm onwards. 
With an exclusive cocktail menu inspired by the ‘Golden Age’ of cocktails (from the 1860s to Prohibition) as well as legendary bar snacks, including their famous Mac n Cheese balls, on offer, the two evenings promise an exciting change from your regular week-night. “We’re going in with open minds and we’re really excited to be able to share and learn during our time here. Without a doubt, we will deliver our unique brand of hospitality during the takeover so that our guests in Delhi can have a taste of the authentic 28HKS experience,” say Charmaine Thio and Lukas Kaufmann, Co-Bar Captains of 28 HongKong Street.

Focus seafood
"," Most restaurateurs would baulk at opening a seafood eatery during Mumbai’s monsoon, but clearly Zorawar Kalra is not one of them. When asked about the launch of his fine dine — Rivers to Oceans (R2O) — during the rains, when fresh seafood is harder to come by, Kalra expresses confidence in a supply chain that delivers imported substitutes. And for those who are keen to sample vegetarian offerings, there are always mushrooms to fall back on. If you visit Kalra’s stable of restaurants, you’ll realise there are favourite ingredients that he keeps revisiting, whether it’s the Indian gucchi at Masala Library or the Italian truffle that can be found at Pa Pa Ya.
R2O has replaced the space formerly occupied by TGI Fridays at Palladium — and while the emphasis is on seafood, there are courses that showcase mushrooms in a way that not many eateries do. The restaurant features a cold dining room (Kalra attributes it to the produce being served at chilled temperatures even once plated), and what the promoters claim is the country’s first champagne and caviar bar. Sure, there’s a lot of marble used inside, and the interiors are done up by Masafumi Sanada who runs the Tokyo-based M-Style, Inc, but Kalra is clear he wants the focus to be on the food. For those looking for a quieter setting, R2O has three private dining rooms, each of which vary in size, with the largest accommodating up to 10 people. The rooms are arrayed around the edges of the eatery, while the bar is what is the showcase of the main dining room. Kalra proudly declares that the total space is equally split between the kitchen and the dining room, a rarity in a city where astronomical rents force restaurants to design cramped kitchens in favour of revenue earning seats. 

Tasting the menu
 When we visited, we sampled a salty spoonful of black lumpfish caviar, that accompanied our briny Gujarat oyster. “In a lot of the courses, we’ve let the ingredients do the talking, though obviously technique is there in a lot of them,” says Kalra about the tasting menu I’m working my way through. 
For those unfamiliar with the flavours of the sea, the oyster is served alongside a lemon, green apple mignonette and umame-rich soy, giving you a range of options to slurp away at.
Fish are the inspiration for a smattering of artworks that can be found on the walls, though we have a feeling that diners will be more interested in the display of fresh catch at the entrance which includes salmon from Norway, scampi from Andhra Pradesh, Alaskan cod and more. In an era when restaurants are increasingly touting the use of local ingredients, it will worthwhile to see whether Kalra's focus on globally-sourced seafood will draw diners. 
R2O’s kitchen has been helmed by chef Varun Kinger, who’s working under the group chef Saurabh Udinia. Kinger has been allowed to develop the menu, but Kalra emphasises that he wanted the kitchen team to show restraint, and allow the seafood to shine. Behind the scenes, the Josper grill (imported from Europe) is something that Kalra is quick to show off, and he plans to have a part of the menu dedicated to Japanese-style robata grilled mains. Plans include an extensive a la carte, a tasting menu (paired with either wine or champagne) and finally a raw sampler. There are plenty of vegetarian options as well, ranging from reconstructed bell pepper and corn quesadilla to green garlic risotto with aubergine fritters.

Food spectrum
 The menu encompasses everything from traditional preparations, like crab and leek soup to the eatery’s take on street food, like white fish steamed in banana leaves to modernist fare like scampi tartare with puffed amaranth, mandarin dressing and delicately shaved pickled cucumbers. Unfortunately, the kitchen’s ideas don’t always translate effectively enough — like the salad Niçoise, which features crystalised tuna (think icy pink crystals) topped with purple potato mash, tomato and jaggery dust, edamame beans, eggs and tomato vinaigrette. While the dish may display a thrilling use of technique, its strong flavour base entirely overpowers other ingredients. A dish that worked splendidly is a sinus-clearing Malabar soft shell crab curry that you’ll want to order again and again. 
Under sommelier Pratik Angre, the champagnes on offer are on offer with glassware that ranges from the traditional flute, to the once popular coupe. Moet and Chandon, G.H. Mumm, Louis Roederer Brut Premier and Bollinger Brut Special Cuvee were the four champagnes that were paired with our 14-course tasting. The bar will also include a range of spirits, some of which are in keeping with the eatery’s emphasis on seafood – for instance, there will be cocktails with nori-infused vodka.
Rivers to Oceans, launches June 25 at Palladium, Lower Parel; open from noon to 3 p.m. and 7 p.m. to 1.30 a.m; A meal for two is priced at ₹3,500 (without alcohol) and ₹4,500 (with alcohol); 49735025.

Omelette for days
","While scouting places for a quick bite during office lunch break, I stumbled upon The Egg Stop and Mexican Chicken Poppers in Seethammadhara. It’s one of the few places in this residential area with spacious indoors and air conditioning. I entered with just an expectation of a decent meal in the AC, but by the time I had walked out of the restaurant I had already recommended the omelette café to friends in the city. The Egg Stop and Mexican Chicken Poppers have different menus but they share the roof and kitchen. The Egg Stop, a Kerala-based franchise has branches in India, UAE, Malaysia and Dubai.The Mexican Chicken Poppers, an exclusive to the Indian market, is an add-on to The Egg Stop. 
Like most fast food restaurants, orders are taken at the counter. But unlike them, here one has to wait for at least 15 minutes and sometimes even half and hour, depending on what you have ordered. Nevertheless, it’s worth the wait. The Egg Stop offers 150 different varieties of omelettes. In the Visakhapatnam franchise, it has about 15 different omelettes in the menu, which keep changing depending on the response of the customers. All omelettes are made of three to four eggs and served with a huge slice of bread. I tried the Indo–Mexican omelette, three sunny side up omelettes placed over an omelet with Mexican sauce base, followed by a fluffy Jamaican cheesy omelette. This omelette was made after beating egg whites with milk and placing stripes of cheese slices on top. They also have meat-based omelettes like the shredded chicken omelette and kebab omelette. The health-conscious folks will enjoy the distinct taste of fresh chicken in former over the frozen meat in the latter.
After four omelettes, I was thirsty. So I ordered an egg soda, one of the trademark egg-based drinks. It was basically a mint mojito blended with egg white. The egg white’s taste doesn’t stand out, so go for the egg soda without any second thoughts, unless you don’t want extra proteins. The Egg Stop has rice meals as well. I had the Japanese omurice, which is tomato rice wrapped inside an omelette crepe. I found it to be a perfect meal for lunch. All rice-based dishes have ample quantity. And their presentation will make you share an update on social media. Chikkam Sandeep, manager, The Egg Stop, said, “We had to increase the rice quantity as per the customers’ expectation. Luckily, we can tweak the menu as per the feedback.” Mexican Chicken Poppers’s menu isn’t innovative but gets points for not using frozen meat (except for nuggets, fish and seekh kabab). I tried the chicken stick, chipotle chicken salad and chipotle dynamite chicken. And if there was a competition, the eggs definitely came first. Currently, the menu has seasonal mango pulp drink, made by blending fresh mango with little milk and no sugar. It’s the closest thing to aam raas in the city. You can also find French toast and egg salads on the menu. The chocolate French toast is a must-have, but don’t expect chocolate to ooze like in choco-lava cake.

Chef Bhakti Arora on playing the diner’s advocate
"," Contrasting with her tiny frame and her elfin features, chef Bhakti Arora sports a pair of flowing leopard-print trousers as well as purple and blue streaks in her hair — a quirky ensemble for someone huge in Indian cuisine. But that’s exactly what she likes, she says as she sits down, adding, “I love breaking barriers and stereotypes!”
Hyderabadis watched the 33 year-old in season four of MasterChef India (where she came up as second runner-up) and the city has long been eager to take a page from her book. 
Much to her delight, her first session of her Wednesdays With Chef Bhakti at The Culinary Lounge featured the king of fruit and was aptly themed ‘Mango magic.’ Dishes that made the menu included mango pani puri, Caribbean mango curry and Thai dual-mango fried rice. Recalling the session, she smiles and comments, “The main thought behind the workshop was the universal love for mango. Now, the first intention with such a fruit is to make a dessert, a cheesecake, or a custard... typically sweet dishes. We do also see them used to make aamras with puri or parathas, and the raw variety is used for cooking. So I wanted to change the way people looked at the ripe mango. So in the workshop, when the students saw me adding onion and garlic, they said ‘eewww!’ But when they smelled the aroma during cooking, they changed their minds.” And so further barriers were broken, just as she intended. 
But she broke her own barriers, as she confides that not everything goes as planned, “I didn’t tell anyone this, but I didn’t try anything at home before the workshop. I didn’t have a lot of time and when I made the recipe list, I had done it based on my understanding of flavours. So next I’m at the workshop, crossing my fingers thinking ‘God, save me’ while confidently doling out these instructions and demos. But it came out very well. There was also a curry powder in one recipe, which was supposed to be the main flavouring agent, and we later found out we couldn’t source it. So I used pav bhaji masala instead and that came out better than the original recipe! I was open about that though and I showed the students that improvisation done wisely helps.” 
Related content
Her own curiosity helped the students relate to her and be emboldened to try new things. She designed the course in such a way that sourcing ingredients is beyond easy; in fact, it’s all available there already! After all, why underestimate the value of the ingredients and dishes in their own kitchen? So the next workshops planned will be hosting favourite and timeless ingredients in all our kitchens, but used innovatively. Another theme will orient around high tea but in the Indian sense.
Health on her plates
As well as playing mentor, chef Bhakti will be engendering the making of meals that go without harmful additives, preservatives, artificial colourants and overwhelming cholesterol — all while keeping the food hearty and comforting. Chef Bhakti’s nose wrinkles at the mention of margarine, stating, “I’m all about being healthy at heart, and my way of cooking reflects that. When it comes to making sweet things, I really cannot condone the mass use of margarine. A cookie with margarine from, say Karachi Bakery, may taste good, — and no offence to those who make them, that’s their right — but a cookie made with butter tastes far better and is better for your health than margarine any day. I’m not one to turn cookies away entirely, as we all have cravings, but we should be aware of its ingredients. So my workshops can be a way of getting information and showing how we can benefit from knowing more.”

Kudos, chef Massimo
"," Osteria Francescana in Modena has just been declared the world’s best restaurant.
The annual San Pellegrino World’s 50 Best Restaurants, unveiled in Bilbao this week, moved legendary Italian chef Massimo Bottura’s restaurant’s back to No 1 (it topped the list in 2016 as well, before moving to No 2 in 2017), displacing last year’s winner, Daniel Humm’s Eleven Madison Park. Besides his iconic restaurant, Chef Massimo founded the non-profit association Food for Soul in 2016, to take on the challenge of food waste.
Which is why I was determined to find a way to work with him. Following short stints at various hotels in India since I was in Class X, and later as part of my Culinary Arts degree, I made up my mind to stage at Osteria Francescana (a stage is an unpaid internship when you work in a chef’s kitchen to learn new techniques). It took nearly a year’s perseverance of studying, working on my skills and applications. I am not sure what worked, but I finally managed to bag a place at the most coveted kitchen in the world.




I spent the summer of 2017 with Osteria Francescana, learning from Chef Massimo. His style is clean and minimal: his philosophy, to make every dish taste better than your grandmother’s cooking. He understands how to respect the past, even while appreciating the present. At the first chance I got, I asked him the secret to his success. He said, ‘I wake up and then go to bed. And in between I do what I love to do.”
A peek at the pinnacle
Osteria Francescana has 12 tables, which can accommodate 28 to 30 people. There is just one service for lunch and one for dinner. (The 10-course tasting menu is €250, almost ₹20,000 per head.) Reservations are done online and guests wait for up to six months for a place at the table.
At Osteria, everyone is an equal, everyone is family. I worked alongside cooks and kitchen staff from Canada, Mexico, Italy, Japan and Bangladesh. And we all participated when it was time to clean up. 
I worked at the prep kitchen and quickly learnt that no dish on the menu is easy. There are a lot of components to each, hence the dedicated prep kitchen located right across the street. I was put in all the sections, and taught all the dishes on the menu, including Chef Massimo’s celebrated dessert ‘Oops I dropped the lemon tart’, fresh miniature tortellini and his famous ‘Caesar salad in bloom’.
The prep kitchen made the staff meal: pizza on Fridays and pasta everyday. We always had great music playing in the kitchen, from pop to metal to classical Italian, it changed depending on who was in charge of the playlist. On my day, I made them listen to Hindi music: Guru Randhawa’s ‘Tenu suit, suit karda’ (they loved it!). We played soccer on the street between the main kitchen and the prep kitchen in our spare time. It was especially fun when Chef Massimo joined in: he loves playing soccer. Chef taught us that it is important to work at a place that makes you happy. That helps you absorb everything like a sponge. He’s a genius when he gets down to cooking. Like everyone else on the team, he is in the kitchen at 9.30 am. He likes pin-drop silence when plating a dish; and is like an artist when experimenting with a new menu.
The bigger picture
Massimo says chefs have a responsibility not only to the paying guests, but also to the communities to help improve the food systems for everyone, through education and through action.




“I have a curious mind and I have always been a restless child. I have matured but I will never really grow up,” I remember him telling me, when I asked him for advice for a budding chef. He taught me never to be fearful of ideas. He said it’s okay to be confused when you are thinking of choosing a cuisine or marrying ingredients.
Chef Massimo always says that chefs need to live the everyday routine without getting lost in it. 
“That’s the sign of a good chef,” he shared, “Don’t forget to put in your best; your knives should be sharpened at any given time; respect your chef uniform, travel to learn, read, be humble and remember who you are and where you come from, have a sportsman spirit, never forget to help others when you can, and last but not least, be a citizen of the world.”

In Sweden, beer was brewed since Iron Age
","Malt was produced for beer brewing as early as the Iron Age in Sweden, say scientists who have found possible evidence indicating a large-scale production of beer, possibly for feasting and trade in the region.
Archaeologists have found carbonised germinated grains in Uppakra in southern Sweden. “We found carbonised malt in an area with low-temperature ovens located in a separate part of the settlement. The findings are from the 400-600s, making them one of the earliest evidence of beer brewing in Sweden,” said Mikael Larsson, from Lund University in Sweden.
Archaeologists have long known that beer was an important product in ancient societies in many parts of the world. Through legal documents and images, it has been found, for example, that beer was produced in Mesopotamia as early as 4,000 BCE. However, as written sources in the Nordic region are absent prior to the Middle Ages , knowledge of earlier beer production is dependent on botanical evidence.

The beginning of a great chef’s food journey
","Let’s not think of a depressed Anthony Bourdain. Instead, let us see him as a happy boy who had just had his first oyster.
The family had gone out to sea with Monsieur Saint-Jour, a fisherman, on an oyster boat. Young Tony, all of nine, was hungry. Monsieur Saint-Jour asked if any of them would care to try out an oyster.
“My parents hesitated. I doubt they’d realized they might have actually to eat one of the raw, slimy things we were currently floating over. My little brother recoiled in horror. But I, in the proudest moment of my young life, stood up smartly, grinning with defiance, and volunteered to be the first,” he writes in Kitchen Confidential: Adventures in the Culinary Underbelly.
He took the raw oyster in his hand, tilted the shell back into his mouth as instructed by the now beaming Monsieur Saint-Jour, and with one bite and a slurp, wolfed it down. “It tasted of seawater… of brine and flesh… and somehow… of the future,” he says.
Spoon fed
We now know of the end, but that then was the beginning of a great chef’s food journey. Bourdain, who took his life on June 8, knew as a fourth-grader that there was no turning back: “The genie was out of the bottle. My life as a cook, and as a chef, had begun”.
This passage propelled me to re-read a book called How I Learned To Cook, edited by Kimberly Witherspoon and Peter Meehan. I went back to the piece about Ferran Adrià, the man known the world-over for experiments in molecular gastronomy.
“I was not one of those children, who at the age of six or seven, discovers an enthusiasm for baking cookies. I did not watch, ablaze with curiosity, as my grandmother stirred the family broth,” he says. 
All that he wanted to do was play football and party. It was to collect money to go to Ibiza — which he saw as a mega party place — that he began working as a dishwasher in a restaurant. He went from one restaurant to the other, fed the men in the Spanish Navy and headed the admiral’s kitchen — all by chance. In 1984, he joined the kitchen staff at El Bulli — and went on to become one of its owners.
Sushi story
I like the story of Masaharu Morimoto, who introduced sushi to the world. On the day the father got paid, he took the family out for sushi, he writes.
“While we were at dinner, my parents were relaxed, even enjoyed themselves,” he says. They would resume their fights the morning after, but they were a happy family at the restaurant.
“Is it any wonder that I thought becoming a sushi chef was a noble and worthwhile pursuit,” he asks.
Let’s also recall the story of Heston Blumenthal, of the iconic The Fat Duck. For him, it all began with a meal in L’Oustau de Baumanière restaurant in France.
“I had never seen anything like this before,” he writes. There were perfectly-appointed tables with immaculate linen, silver, china and crystal. The family sat outside as the scent of lavender wafted in.
Young Heston ate red mullet fillets sauced with a light vinaigrette and paired with tomatoes, basil and green beans; meat and kidneys from a baby lamb baked in puffed pastry; gratin of potatoes and aubergines. “There was something about the experience, something so fantastic yet so tangible, that I knew this was what I wanted to do,” he says.
And, indeed, they all did what they wanted to do. As in ‘Author, author’, it’s time we coined a new phrase — ‘Chef, chef!’
The writer likes reading and writing about food as much as he does cooking and eating it. Well, almost.

All for shingara rasa! "," What is it about the samosa that makes my newly repaired heart go a-flutter? I have come to the conclusion that it is my favourite snack among all teatime munchies. I like crumbed cutlets and chops, like any other honest man, and will not say no to some soft dhokla or crisp aloo tikki. But give me a good samosa, and I am at peace with the world.
I like Chittaranjan Park for that very reason. What do you get when you have a residential area brimming over with Bengalis? You get sweet shops. And what do you get in Bengali sweet shops? Bengali shingaras.
New discovery
 


I had asked some friends who live in CR Park if there was any new place that I needed to visit. Try out Tarashankar, I was told. The sweets were good and the shingara was excellent, they said.
So I sent my trusted emissary to C R Park to pick up some sweets and shingaras. For those who came in late, shingaras are Bengali samosas, but have a vastly different taste. I used to go to Annapurna opposite Aurobindo Market for their Bengali samosas once, and really liked eating them with the dry green chutney that they served. But I thought I had to try out Tarashankar’s fare.
The shop is in Market number 4 (Shop no. 13; phone numbers: 011-41601514, 9899572994 and 9810921669). This is a small shopping area near the Kali Mandir. C R Park has a well-known caterer called Shankar (who sets up some great food stalls during the Pujas). Tarashankar is his baby, run by his son.
The friends were right: the sweets and shingaras were truly good. The sweets, mostly prepared with chhaina, were fresh and of various kinds. They have the usual fare (rasogullah, gulab jamun, kancha gollah, kheer kadam) as well as some interesting sandesh varieties such as chocolate sandesh, orange sandesh and kalakand. They have malai chop, orange malai chop and gujiya as well. The sweets are for ₹10-20.
Lasting taste
But the shingara stole my heart. I have to stay away from fried stuff, so I had just a small bite of the crispy casing, which was rather nice. The potato stuffing was excellent. The potatoes were cubed and had been sautéed with some basic masalas, coconut chunks and peanuts. I liked it so much that the next morning I de-constructed one of the samosas, left the casing, heated the potato and ate it with some soft and fluffy chappatis. And with a tall glass of frothy lassi, what a breakfast that was.
The samosas are fried in a huge kadhai in front of the shop. In the evenings, they also fry vegetable chops, another teatime snack that I really enjoy. A Bengali vegetable chop has a filling of grated beetroot, tempered with a few spices and cooked with grated coconut and crushed peanuts. This is then crumbed and fried. Both the samosas and the chops are for ₹10 a piece.
C R Park has several sweet shops, and people will have their favourites. One of them, I am told, sells one of my favourite sweets – shor bhaja. That is a fried sweet which I will have to stay away from – for the time-being. So meanwhile, I shall have my orange sandesh and samosa stuffing – with or without a chappati. Bihar may not have its Laloo, but my samosa will have its Bengali aloo.

Overcoming the divide "," 
On the eve of Independence, the founding principles of health care for India were established through the Bhore Committee. Here, health care was envisaged as comprehensive, universal and free at the point of delivery, based on a government-led service, and to be paid from tax-funded revenues. These policies, which were adopted from the National Health Service (NHS), a major social reform in the U.K. following the Second World War, have stood the test of time and remain a source of pride for the U.K. But for India, it is an embarrassment that this health model has declined because of chaotic, mismanaged, unregulated and discriminatory policies and the priorities of successive governments.
 
This has created a second system (supposedly more efficient) in the form of the urban private sector, which is responsible for most health care in India. The private sector over-medicalises: over-promises, over-investigates, over-treats and overcharges to meet management targets, creating needless fear and paranoia. There has been a paradigm shift from a ‘service’ to a fee-for-service model of health care. Medicine has changed from ‘doctor-patient-treatment’ to ‘customer-provider-delivery’. All this disorganisation has led to a trust deficit between patient and doctor.
The decline of a universal, social health system has led to the cost of treatment becoming astronomical. Health care in India is changing from a conservative, clinical, affordable, accountable, patient-centric British model to a more investigative, aggressive, expensive, commercial and insurance-driven American system, without the safety mechanisms of either. India still faces many communicable diseases (malaria, dengue and tuberculosis) which require a robust public health system. Along with non-communicable diseases (diabetes, heart disease and cancer) also on the rise, this is a double burden.
This mismatch is further compounded with only 4% of GDP allocated to health. India has one of the highest (86%) out-of-pocket (private) expenditures on health care in the world. With little or no health insurance, this leads to approximately 40 million people falling below the poverty line every year. Let’s draw an analogy with the organised, Western health system (public and private care), taking the example of any international university. There are two kinds of fees — one for national students and usually a slightly higher one for international students, which is akin to treatment costs in a hospital where there are higher private fees. At the end of the course, all students are awarded the same degree much like patients who get the same level of care in a public or private hospital in the West. Private care in the West exists to streamline routine services and possibly reduce waiting times. 
In an ideal world we would want an egalitarian health-care model. However, misuse of private health care at the patient’s expense leads to a breakdown of the whole model. Compare it to transport, where there are buses and taxis, representing public and private health care, respectively. The drivers are akin to doctors. Someone decides to pay a bit more and take a taxi, creating room for more people on the bus. It sounds reasonable. But if more people take taxis than buses (it is like private health care overtaking public health care), then all the roads will become clogged, the bus services will not be looked after, and the whole infrastructure will be destabilisesd. A doctor too decides to pay more attention to private care as it is more rewarding. Everyone is under the perception that private care is better .Then people can only hope to either take a taxi or walk. A balance between the two health systems is required, where there is no compromise made on the quality of care delivered.
This random and shambolic state of health care in India has made the expectations of the patients and relatives, unrealistic and unreasonable. This has created hype, fear, paranoia, a false sense of security and is responsible for breaking the ‘sacred patient- doctor’ relationship. Expensive treatments and interventions with marginal benefits should be realistically considered to treat frail, futile, terminal patients and relatives should be explained the outcomes. It is for the society to decide the ceiling of treatment. We need to strengthen our public health-care system based on the pillars of trust, accountability and efficiency. A balance needs to be made between public and private health care. This balance will only be restored by the mutual respect and belief between a doctor and patient.

New clue to Huntington’s disease
"," 
A study by researchers at the Department of Genetics, Delhi University, South Campus, has shown that it is possible to restrict the progression of Huntington’s disease by increasing insulin signalling in the brain’s neuronal cells. 
The study, which was conducted in fruit flies (Drosophila), found that increasing the level of insulin signalling enriches the cellular pool of proteins that are essential for cellular functioning and survival. This in turn restores the cellular transcription machinery, which typically collapses due to the disease, and thus stops the disease from progressing.
Dr. Surajit Sarkar, who led the study, said “The study was a follow up to investigations which had revealed that the insulin signalling pathway, which is a critical controller of cellular metabolism and energy homeostasis, was severely compromised in Huntington’s and other polyglutamine disorders like SCA3.”
Still without a cure
There is no treatment or cure for Huntington’s at present. Afflicted individuals lose their ability to walk, talk, think and reason. This disease begins between ages 30 and 45, and every individual with the gene for the disease will eventually develop the disease. It is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder, which means that even if one parent carries the defective Huntington’s gene, their offspring has a 50:50 chance of inheriting the disease.
When experiments were conducted to check whether it would help if the level of insulin signalling was increased by up-regulating the insulin receptor in the disease affected neuronal cells, researchers found that it worked.
They then tried to unravel the molecular mechanism. They found that improving the insulin signalling pathway resulted in a significant reduction in the cellular level of neurotoxic protein aggregates or inclusion bodies, with a remarkable decrease in the neuronal cell death. 
“It appears that enhanced level of insulin signalling rejuvenates the neuronal cells which are otherwise stressed during disease condition. Our findings strongly suggest that anti-diabetic drugs could be efficiently utilised to restrict the pathogenesis of polyglutamine disorders,” the study says.
Commenting on the work, Dr. Krishnananda Chattopadhyay, Head of the Structural Biology and Bioinformatics Division at the Indian Institute of Chemical Biology, Kolkata, who was not involved in the study, said, “The study has immense potential application. Subsequent investigations by including higher organisms and anti-diabetic drugs would provide a novel approach to combat the devastating human polyglutamine disorders.” 
The study by Dr. Sarkar and Dr. Kritika Raj has been published in the journal, Molecular Neurobiology. The work was supported by research grants from the Department of Biotechnology. — India Science Wire

From ‘Mudakathan’ juice to ‘sukku malli’ rolls, this Chennai eatery is popularising traditional Tamil food ","J Suresh was contemplating quitting his well-paying IT job to get involved with something more meaningful when he came across ‘Uzhavan Unavagam’. The initiative, started in 2011 by inspiring IAS officer U Sagayam in Madurai, popularised traditional millet based food of Tamil Nadu via the farmers.
An ardent admirer of organic farming scientist G Nammalvar, Suresh had attended workshops conducted by the crusader. Once he began to do ground work and research, he decided to launch a catering business in Chennai. “I decided to use only millets,” he says, adding that he felt it would be an effective way to popularise them. “So, in 2014, I launched ‘Thirukural Unavagam’ in Virugambakkam, Chennai. But, I could not sustain it beyond two months.”




Undeterred, he decided to set up shop on the city’s outskirts, and opened a two-table restaurant at Karayanchavadi, catering predominantly to industrial workers in the vicinity. He was joined by Karthikeyan E, thanks to the happenstance of himcatering Karthikeyan’s wedding. “I was keen on serving millet-based traditional food in my wedding and Suresh pitched in,” says Karthikeyan, adding, “Since then we’ve been travelling together.”
 
Together, they did extensive research local food, determined to find a way to make it appealing to millenial customers. And by 2016 September, they had launched a restaurant in Adyar, banking on its proximity to the IT corridor and the success of pure vegetarian restaurants in the locality.
From a humble beginning with 12 recipes, today they serve close to 45 different dishes, many of which are innovative. “Standard menus don’t work here and therefore we constantly innovate,” says Suresh, adding “Tricolour puris and sukku malli rolls appeal to younger customers. I have even developed pani puri with ragi,served with mudakathan juice. However, the most popular items on our menu are the two traditional set meals: Tholkappiar and Nammalvar Thaali.”
The restaurant also serves millet chapatis stuffed with traditional herbs and vegetables. “Our recipes are built on three things: millets, herbs and heritage rice varieties of Tamil Nadu. Our vision is to build our unique cuisine as an elite brand,” says Suresh, adding that they refuse to compromise on these parameters. “In fact, we do not serve what customers like, but what is good for them,” he adds firmly.
Karthikeyan says most of their customers are “the health conscious population,” adding that includes a lot of younger customers. He says, “We plan to laun



“We are economically stable, thanks to the increased awareness on food safety among the public,” says Karthikeyan, adding that he finally has time to read books, mostly on nature, farming and business. He has enrolled for Masters in Psychology. The next step? “We plan to start farming, as our heart lies there.”
On the menu
--> Vegetarian omelettes, which are thin pancakes made by grinding together sprouted moong with green chillies.
--> The Tholkappiar Virundhu includes 18 traditional dishes, served with heritage rice for just ₹148.
--> The Nammalvar Virundhu replaces rice with millets and has 20 items, for ₹158.
--> End your meal with herbal tea, made with thipili, adhimadhuram, dry ginger, pepper, thulasi, mint and karupatti.

Samrat Reddy has a ‘Drunken Monkey’
"," Samrat Reddy is yet to get his profile photos shot as founder and managing director of Hyderabad-based Drunken Monkey. The product and expansion plans have kept him so busy that the need for a photoshoot never occurred to him. And we’ll have you know, Samrat is just as cool and quirky as the packaging of his famous drinks.
An outdoor sports junkie and the owner of the very popular smoothie company, Drunken Monkey, Samrat is usually very methodical with his life and work unless he is on a holiday or is on a Sunday binge at home relishing his mom’s garelu and Andhra mutton curry. Also no matter where he is, “I have to be in Hyderabad for my corporate team cricket practise,” he adds. 




Samrat has worn many caps all under which he has nurtured different dreams. Choosing to take one step at a time, after acquiring an engineering degree, he worked in Australia for a while before heading off to Scotland to do an MBA. He love for smoothie is a result of his is habit of staying away from caffeine. “During my stay in Australia and UK, I observed that the sheer number of places or cafes offering coffee are far greater than the outlets which serve smoothies. It was in Scotland when I actually thought of setting up a smoothie business. I felt if given a chance to experience smoothies, a huge number of people would incorporate them into their lifestyle as it is a healthier. I was very clear from the beginning about what I eventually wanted to do. I had my plans chalked out, but didn’t impose any deadline for myself. The reason: I didnt want to rush to meet a deadline; I totally believe that haste makes waste. Also I am not the one to sit and wait for things to happen. While my dream of a smoothie place was incubating, I worked to gain more knowledge of the market and to manage a team. I worked for a while to manage our family steel production. That was a lot of learning,” says Samrat.
His learnings included being involved in a variety of businesses including a 3D animation and visualisation firm, which was way ahead of what was happening in India in terms of design and visual representation. He has also managed his family’s steel plant for over 4 years, after which he was a part of an oil drilling company in the US, also a Water Treatment Plant in Cameroon.
All this while, he equipped himself with another knowledge about smoothies and the equipment that would be required for it. His travels took care of most of his learning. “Smoothies in India are a sorry mix of cream, artificial flavours, topped with sugar. Whereas I wanted something absolutely pure. Through my travels, I understood what makes smoothies abroad so unique and satisfying. Almost like a meal,”adds Samrat.
He also decided to let it grow like a baby; one step at a time, “I wanted a slow and steady growth. I wasn't ready to push it before it was able to crawl or walk. That is why I chose not to take family money. That would have made me answerable and works against a deadline for the company to flourish,” smiles Samrat as he orders himself a detox drink.
After letting it grow organically in Hyderabad, Samrat has extended his business to Bengaluru, Mumbai, Pune and a few other cities.

Chai is still chai, but with AI
"," Chai Point fans would be delighted to know that the tea retail chain recently-launched its 100th store in India. Located in Indiranagar, the store is loaded with tech, high on design and of course, has more tea, accompanied by a new tea-centric menu.
“Apart from the fact that this is our 100th store, this is also kind of a 2.0 Chai Point entry from a design philosophy standpoint,” says its co-founder and CEO Amuleek Singh Bijral.
“We are an omni-channel platform and the store is one of them. The design philosophy is of warmth, authenticity and progressiveness. Those are the characteristics we want to show.”
Progressiveness, explains Bijral, also includes environmental responsibility. “That means brands that are ‘green’, which is why you will find a lot of those elements in our store. We have selected indoor plants, we are showcasing our ‘Garden to Glass’ programme where we select tea and coffee gardens on a monthly basis to bring single origin teas for our customers. This is important also because customers want to know where their tea is coming from.”
The chain is also continuing its eco-friendly philosophy with its bagasse plates, corn-starch based cutlery, and wooden stirrers, though Bijral acknowledges, they are not yet 100 per cent plastic-free.
“We track this efficiently in our supply-chain. We are also particular about waste-segregation at the store level. We are looking for innovative ways of waste management. Some of the waste we generate is valuable, such as used tea leaves, coffee powder and lemon rinds. We are looking for partners with high supply chain and logistical capability to pass it onto organic farming plants or farms.”
Among the highlights in the new 1,200 sq ft store, which includes al-fresco seating and wood furniture with white exposed brick walls, is their tech-heavy AI-based facial recognition feature that is located at the billing counter.
“The facial recognition feature will engage customers on our loyalty programme. We want to reduce the friction for customers, of identifying themselves as they walk into the store. With this feature, there will be no need for customers to give their numbers each time.”
Along with the feature, they are also launching a new rewards programme, that has more product-centric benefits rather than cashback or financial incentives.
The feature, which will soon be launched in phases across Chai Point stores, is integrated into their core technology platform Shark, which runs all their retail channels including their Android-based BoxC dispensers.
“It is important for an omni-channel brand that is into delivery, dispensing and stores, to have a common technological backbone. That is why we are aggressively investing in this, it is part of our philosophy. And our customers expect it,” Bijral explains.
“If the brand has to be relevant and remain close to customers, even if the product category, chai, is 3,000 years old, you have to take this up. And that is what we are doing.”
At the same time, Bijral reassures, the chain still maintains its focus on its product, chai.
“This time, we are introducing three more variants of chai, including lemongrass, Sulemani and cold brew ice chais.”
The menu now offers new interpretations of Indian classics such as Nawabi Chicken Croissant or Mathri with three beans masala - an Indian take on Mexican nachos. It also includes desi snacks such as Rajdhani cutlets and Tutti Frutti Bun Maska.

For the love of feathered friends
","Amongst several thick books on accounting and finance one can spot a book or two about birds and bonsai gardening in Vikram Penmetsa’s office. A chartered accountant by profession, Penmetsa’s heart lies in birdwatching. 
Even amidst lush green leaves or thick bushes, Penmetsa can easily sense the presence of a bird. This is a gift that one acquired after many years of experience. “I can spot birds at a considerable distance, even when no one else can see them. There have been many instances when I have pulled over while driving to find a bird. Even at the speed of a moving car, I can easily spot a bird,” he laughs. 
He explains that birdwatching is a hobby that demands a lot of patience. “All it takes is a pair of binoculars, a field guide and lots of patience to enjoy birdwatching,” he says.
 Apart from birds, it also teaches enthusiasts about nature, habitat, landscape and biodiveristy. “Initially, it requires patience as amateurs know little about birds and it takes a lot of time for them to recognise each one. So going along with people who are experienced would help them learn and make it a better experience,” he says.
The spotting and recognition of a bird usually depends on the four major factors — size of the bird, size of the beak, shape of the beak and colour of the feathers. “The size of the bird is compared to that of the crow because everyone has seen a crow and hence it makes comparison easy,” he says. 
However, Penmetsa did not acquire this expertise in a matter of days. It has taken him 18 years and innumerable trips to the fields, hills and water bodies to see the birds and study their habitat. 
“I started birdwatching from 2000 when I became a member of Birdwatchers Society of Andhra Pradesh (BSAP) in Hyderabad. When I moved back to Visakhapatnam, I wanted to continue with the hobby. Through social media, I tried to connect with more people and eventually formed Vizag Birdwatchers Society,” he says. 
Nestled among the Eastern Ghats, Visakhapatnam is blessed with a rich biodiversity making it a hub for birds and a delight for the birdwatchers. Today, Vizag Birdwatchers Society has roughly 500 members who gather and set out for birdwatching at least once a month. “The best time for birdwatching is during the winters. Most of the Himalayan birds migrate down South to avoid the harsh winters. So October to January would be an ideal time for birdwatching,” he says. 
Some of the birds that frequently visit the region are Great crested grebe, Tufted duck, Pochards and Mallards. “Three years ago, we had the opportunity to see a thick-billed Green pigeon which has not been spotted in this region before,” he says.
Birdwatcher’s paradise
For those who are interested in picking up this hobby, Penmetsa has a list of places to begin. Meghadri Gedda Reservoir, Araku Valley, Thatipudi Reservoir, Kambalkonda Wildlife Sanctuary and Thotlakonda are the must-go places for birdwatchers in the city. Apart from birdwatching, the chartered accountant also conducts bird census in Visakhapatnam and Vizianagaram areas. 
“The data collected from this census is first given to BSAP which is then passed to Bombay Natural History Society before it is sent to Singapore and Netherlands where the world database for birds is made,” he says.

When Imtiaz Qureshi saved the day...
","Many years ago, in the holy month of Muharram, a frantic-looking Begum Akhtar comes running to Lucknow’s Krishna Hotel in the middle of the day looking desperately for a young cook. The cook’s mentor hasn’t turned up and all the food preparations for the Majlis have gone for a toss. Her only hope now lies with the young protégé who gets summoned as Krishna’s staff and management are at their feet as a gesture of respect for the famous Akhtari Bai of Faizabad. Begum narrates her predicament to the young cook who assures her that he would do his level best to prepare the meal on time. And he lives up to his promise. Begum is elated to see the grand meal prepared just as per her wishes. She blesses the young man, praying for a bright future for him. This was the first of many feasts that the young cook would prepare for the legendary ghazal queen.
Fast forward to the present day, an ebullient Imtiaz Qureshi, now in his eighties, is sitting on a sofa in a Delhi hotel with a radiant smile on his cherubic face as he recounts how pleased Begum Akhtar was when he delivered the meal for the Majlis as per the promise. He rejoices with humility how her blessings and prayers for him have fortunately come true. “Whatever I have achieved in my life is because of the blessings of my elders,” affirms Qureshi. 
The first chef to be conferred a Padma Shri for his contribution to the culinary arts, Imtiaz Qureshi has been instrumental in the creation of the famous Bukhara brand as well as the revival of the Dum Pukht tradition in India. But, perhaps, nothing can beat his contribution to the preservation of the gastronomic taste that we associate with the mouthwatering Kakori kababs, which, as opposed to the traditional seekh kababs, tend to have a glossy exterior and a much finer texture that allows them to melt almost instantly in the mouth. He, however, attributes it to the former chairman of ITC Limited, Ajit Haskar. 




Secret recipes 
“The tradition of Kakori kababs had all but phased out with the nawabs of Lucknow. For over a hundred years no one knew the secret recipe outside of certain well-known households of Lucknow. In those days my forefathers would prepare them for the rich households on special occasions. There were no shops where the kababs could be sold. But, those people were addicted to the taste of the kababs and so it meant good business for my ancestors. The leftovers after making the kababs were enough to serve the family for a couple of weeks. Also, the money made from the kababs provided for the family’s other expenditures. It was a system that in a way was self-sustainable but it was dying a slow death.” 
So, the actual credit for revival of Kakori kababs, he continues, goes to Ajit Haskar who personally brought him to ITC. “Credit must be given where it is due. It was his vision to revive the authentic Awadhi cuisine. He wanted me to put a food line-up in place in the tradition of the walima — the wedding banquet that follows Islamic weddings. He had a big heart and was fully aware of the labour and sacrifice that would go into preparing such a line of cuisine. The cuisine went on to cement ITC’s reputation in the culinary world,” explains Qureshi. 
Change of image
After joining the ITC group in the 1970s, Qureshi came in contact with another doyen of the Indian culinary circuit, Jiggs Kalra, who played an important role in establishing Qureshi as the face of ITC. One of India’s foremost food columnist and author, Kalra was appointed by ITC, which was still seen as a cigarette brand back then, to help market the brand better so that it could compete with the might of the Taj Group of Hotels. “I met Jiggs Kalra at a time when there weren’t many journalists around who wrote about food and had considerable knowledge about different cuisines. The only restaurants that ITC had at the time were Mayur and Bukhara. Kalra interviewed me and the interview created a lot of buzz. It paved the way for our subsequent interactions on food and beverages that culminated in a book that Kalra wrote. While the book did create some differences between us, there is no denying that his penmanship was remarkable and I can only praise him for what he did for me,” reveals Qureshi. 
After ITC hired Qureshi, he received an even better offer from the Taj Group of Hotels which too wanted him dearly. “I got summoned by the chairman of the Taj at the time. He was surrounded by the area general managers who had come from Bombay. He made it obvious that they were quite keen on hiring me. He was willing to pay a salary that was considerably higher than what ITC was offering in addition to other perks. While, out of courtesy, I did ask him to give me some time to consider the proposal, the truth is that I never really considered his offer. Now, had I been greedy, I could have easily renegotiated things with ITC, but, believe me, I didn’t even make a mention about the offer. The only complain that I have today is that when I wanted to resign, the company didn’t let me go. They kept on reiterating that I was ITC’s face. But after I was awarded the Padma Shri, the company suddenly decided to relieve me of my services,” says Qureshi. 
Chef Qureshi has served several official banquets including dinners hosted by the prime ministers as well as the presidents of India including Jawaharlal Nehru, Zakir Hussain, Indira Gandhi, and Atal Bihari Vajpayee. He has also served the likes of Queen Elizabeth II, Bill Clinton, and Tony Blair. “At a very young age, I got an opportunity to prepare food for Queen Elizabeth II. In those days I used to cook food for NCC Cadets stationed in the outskirts of Lucknow. When the Queen came to India, the cadets were invited by Jawaharlal Nehru to greet her. I travelled along with the cadets but when the prime minister learnt that a team of cooks has come from Lucknow he insisted that we served the queen as she was fond of the Indian food. We prepared everything ranging from Kakori kababs to biryani to whatnot,” recollects Qureshi. 
Special vegetarian meal
But it is not merely his non-vegetarian preparations that have given Qureshi his unparalleled reputation as a chef. At the height of the 1962 Sino-Indian War while working at the Krishna Hotel in Lucknow, Qureshi was presented with the challenge of single-handedly preparing all-vegetarian food at the residence of the then Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, Chandra Bhanu Gupta. “I was invited by C.B. Gupta to prepare a vegetarian menu for Jawaharlal Nehru who was to be accompanied by Zakir Hussain, Lal Bahadur Shastri and Indira Gandhi. I was given ten days for the same. I improvised to use an assortment of carefully chosen vegetables for the preparations in place of meat. While everyone enjoyed the food, it was Zakir Sahab who loved it the most,” rejoices Qureshi. 
Pizza with kababs
Having successfully put the Mughlai cuisine on the world’s food map, Qureshi’s attention is now fixed on inventing new ways to Indianise foreign food. “There are palatable ways in which we can indigenise even the burger and the pizza to an extent that even the respective natives would be surprised to see it. Just imagine pizzas stuffed with mouthwatering kababs. What I am trying to say is that we can easily make it happen.” 
Chef Qureshi has also incorporated changes so that the health conscious people don’t have to compromise on their gourmet ways. “In order to make the preparations healthy, we try and remove all the animal fat and replace it with desi ghee, butter, or, even better, vegetable oils, thereby cutting down on the calories.” 
Ever since his retirement from ITC, Chef Qureshi has been busy setting up new menus for various hotels and restaurants across the country. Over the years, Qureshi has mentored several young chefs and till date he continues to play an active role in keeping the great Indian culinary tradition alive. Next, he would be seen as the chief guest at the India Foodex Culinary Challenge in Bangalore that marks the tenth anniversary of India Foodex—the largest Food Business show in the country—to be held alongside Hotels, Restaurants and Catering (HRC) Expo 2018 from 31st Aug - 2nd Sep ‘18 where Chef Qureshi will also be presented with a lifetime achievement award for his immense contribution in making cooking a modern art form.

All you need to know about growing pumpkin in your kitchen garden ","Pumpkins come in unique shapes, sizes and hues and have diverse flavours. They are a rich source of Vitamin A, potassium and fibre. Unlike vining gourds and cucumbers, they do not require a trellis or stakes for support. As the fruits are large and heavy, the plants are allowed to spread on the ground. Ideally grown on the edge of a garden bed where it receives adequate sunlight, they can also be grown in large troughs or grow bags. As with most plants, they thrive in loose, well-drained soil and under direct sunlight which allows the fruit to ripen evenly. Most kitchen gardens have a few pumpkin vines growing with companion crops, or even on a compost heap. Though they are considered monsoon crops, pumpkins can be grown throughout the year — successive planting will provide a steady supply of fruits. Look for local varieties like amir or new hybrids like arka suryamukhi, ambili, suvarna and sooraj in succession for a wide range of flavours and textures.
Soil: Pumpkins and other cucurbits grow best in neutral or slightly acidic soil. Choose a sunny location with well-drained soil. Add neem cake or neem solution to the soil a week before planting. Mix organic matter, wood ash and well-rotted manure into the soil. Pumpkins grow best when sown on a raised soil base with a depressed ring below to keep it moist but well-drained. The mound should be about 8-12 inches high and around 2 feet circumference at the base. This can also be done on a long raised ridge with the same proportions.
Sow: Soak the seeds in warm water for a day to promote germination. The seeds can be started in a nursery and shifted later, but for best results sow directly in prepared beds. If they are to be planted on flat ground, keep a distance of 3 feet for the vines to spread out. For raised soil, flatten the top of the heap and press the seeds an inch deep — 3 seeds per mound or 3 feet apart if it is on a ridge. For terrace gardens, use large deep troughs with at least 1.5 feet depth and sow 2 seeds in each.
Moon Phase: Pumpkins, like all cucurbits, are best sown after the second quarter, as the moonlight increases and the gravitational pull decreases.




Companion Plants: Corn, radish. Marigold and nasturtium grown alongside will deter pests. In turn, the leafy foliage of the cucurbits deters weed growth, which is a boon for its companion plants.
Care: Once the seeds have sprouted, restrict weed growth around the seedlings with an organic mulch of leaves or grass cuttings. Remove weak seedlings at this stage. As the long vines supply nutrition to the plants, they should be well-maintained by trimming dead leaves and weak side vines. Watering is best done in the evening, preferably by drip tubes which supply water directly to the roots; excess water on the leaves can cause powdery mildew. Deep drenching once a week is sufficient to keep the soil and plant moist. Protect against aphids, ants and other pests by spraying with a neem solution; peppermint solution is another insect repellent which can be sprayed once a week. Look for squash bugs under the leaves and remove them by hand. The plants should be nourished weekly with compost tea or diluted panchagavya. Once the flowers appear, sprinkle wood ash around the plant on alternate weeks to supply potash.
Pumpkins produce male and female flowers on the same plant and are naturally pollinated by insects. Often, nature doesn’t comply and the plant will produce malformed fruit. To ensure this, pollination can be done manually. Identify the flowers — the female flower has a small fruit at the base and the male is distinguishable by its absence. Rub the male flower over the female flower to transfer pollen. This will increase chances of healthy well-proportioned vegetables.
Harvest: Most pumpkin varieties can be harvested after three months, when the fruit has ripened on the vine.
Saving Seeds: Save enough seeds from the ‘best-of-the crop’ for the next season. Let the pumpkin ripen on the vine and leave to soften further. Remove the seeds and leave to dry completely in direct sun. Mix with ash and store in an airtight container.

Irani cafes make a millenial comeback
","It is a busy day at the café, bearers flit between tables balancing trays of tea cups and saucers of bun-maska. Waiters, meanwhile, scribble orders in a jiffy — poro, akuri, French toast, keema pav, rasta sandwich, mawa cake. The place is abuzz with a steady drone of guests; the air is fragrant with the aroma of fresh food. This scene might look like it is straight out of an Irani café in South Mumbai, except it is happening in the heart of Punjabi Delhi.
The situation is similar at Irani Café, Pune, Café Regal, Jamshedpur, The Bawa, Pune, and Kayani & Co, Mumbai. On the verge of extinction until a few years ago, the Irani café culture is making a comeback, and its effect can be seen everywhere. The only difference? In the new scheme of things, the Irani café culture comes together with Parsi food traditions to create an electric combination, which is winning over patrons across demographics. Looking at their popularity, it is hard to tell that these cafés and their recipes were dying until just a few years ago.
“The credit for revival of the Irani café culture and Parsi food goes entirely to SodaBottleOpenerWala; they came at a time when the Irani cafés were dying but the interest in regional cuisines was growing,” Vernika Awal, an award-winning food blogger and journalist from Mumbai, tells us over the phone. “Thanks to them, the cafés have had a new lease of life,” she goes on to add.
Movers and shakers
Since opening its first outlet in Gurugram, a few years ago, SodaBottleOpenerWala continues to lead the way for smaller Parsi and Irani establishments around the country. The place not only helped people open up to quirky décor, aluminium plates, and cutting chai glasses, but also to experimenting with new flavours, textures and combinations. “At SodaBottleOpenerWala, we pay a tribute to the dying legacy of a Bombay Irani café, bringing with it typical Parsi cuisine and some Irani specialities too,” chef and manager Anahita Dhondy, who manages the Gurugram, Delhi, and Bengaluru outlets, tells us. “The food we serve is a mix of recipes from Iran, Persia, Goa and Mumbai,” she adds.
“Parsis are known for eating meat for breakfast. The practice began with having the leftover meat dishes with pav in the morning and soon became a tradition. Then there are the eggs, which no Parsi can do without.” 
“We have our own bakery, so we can ensure the pav, cakes, kharis, and buns that accompany our food are completely authentic,” informs Dhondy.




Authenticity is at the heart of the new wave of Irani cafés across cities. Most of them are set up like a typical Irani café in Mumbai with checkered floors, large mirrors, fuss-free furniture, and high ceilings. “Functionality was the only thing on the café owner’s mind back then. The mirrors were put up to keep an eye on the staff and customers, the floor was made of sturdy kota and kadappa stone, so that it did not get damaged easily, high ceilings ensured the place stayed cool. They were just being economical and practical,” Mokhtar Yaveri, who runs Irani Café in Pune, explains the logic behind the design. “Today, of course, it is more about décor,” he adds.
Mokhtar comes from an Irani family and has brought back not only the authentic vibe to his café, but also the real Irani food. So you have brun maska, keema pav, bun maska, and the special Irani chai, whose recipe remains a family secret. “There is a sense of nostalgia attached to Irani cafés, especially in Mumbai and Pune. A majority of my customers are senior citizens, who used to frequent Irani cafés as kids, and are elated to find a place like this in an upmarket neighbourhood; of course, there are youngsters too, fascinated by the ambience and food,” adds Mokhtar.
Jamshedpur calling
Nostalgia is what brought Varun Gazder back to Jamshedpur to set up his café — Café Regal — in a hundred-year-old building. The town, home to a sizeable population of Parsis, never had the Irani café culture, but there was always an intimate circle of Parsi food aficionados, which had started to die. So Varun quit his job at Taj Mahal Palace Hotel, Mumbai, to set up Café Regal in an abandoned cinema hall in a Parsi bastion. “Whenever I ate Parsi food outside of my home, I felt something was amiss. It did not have that aroma or flavour. So I decided to bring out my family recipes to my café,” he tells us.




Not only did Gazder clear up the second floor of a decrepit theatre to set up Café Regal (named after the cinema), but he also recreated the Parsi bhonu from his family recipe. The special Sunday lunch takes between four and five hours to prepare and remains very popular with the patrons — both Parsis and non-Parsis. 
“I’ve been lucky because the people have really taken to the food here. We get youngsters and seniors in equal numbers and my Sunday lunch is completely booked by Friday evening,” says Gazder cheerfully. His vision is to slowly and steadily introduce more Irani and Parsi specialities, while maintaining the authenticity and quality of the place.
But not everyone seems to be happy with the trend. Some feel that the new-age adaptation of Irani cafés is taking away the authenticity of the recipes.
“They feel the mawa cake at the newer places is not as good as the ones at Kayani, or the akuri is too dry,” reveals Awal, who also hosts many Irani food-walks. “But for now, it is just great that we have an entire breed of young people working to revive a dying tradition.” We cannot help but agree.

How India is becoming the perfect culinary tourism destination ","India is tough to package. Especially when it comes to food. Break it down State-wise for a broad introduction. Delve into regions within the State, different communities that inhabit these regions and interpretations of local dishes that change every 100 kilometres; and you have a complex, dynamic menu that makes the thrill of discovery, for even the most non-experimental diner, intense.
It’s an ideal setting for food tourism, a genre that is burgeoning as people travel the world inspired by culinary shows, world’s top-restaurant lists, influencers and Instagram. It helps that India’s culinary ambassadors, like Gaggan Anand, Manish Mehrotra and Vikas Khanna, are packaging regional flavours innovatively, resulting in Indian food breaking free from the greasy butter chicken and fiery roghan josh stereotype. Kolkata-born and Bangkok-based chef Gaggan’s restaurant ranked number five on the recently announced ‘World’s 50 Best Restaurants’ list in Bilbao, Spain.




And while India has always been a fixture on the route of writers and travel show hosts, over the past few years, celebrities like Gordon Ramsay, Gary Mehigan, David Rocco, Andrew Zimmern and, of course, the late Anthony Bourdain, began to explore, and celebrate, different facets of the rapidly-changing country, instead of simply hunting for colourful histories and trademark exotica.
On foot
Kaveri Sinhji, Cultural Anthropologist and Historian, Founder, Culture Rings, based in Bengaluru, has been conducting food walks for international tourists for almost a decade now. She says, “About 90% of the people writing in for a booking say that they do not want spicy — spicy meaning chilli hot here. They love our cooking with spices though. They love cinnamon and cardamom and appreciate the various benefits that come from these spices, but chilli hot is not something they want.” She adds that international visitors are extremely worried about things like the Delhi Belly, and some even ask for guarantees on not falling sick. “So I tell them that I can’t give them a guarantee — just like they cannot give me one for their country. If you go to Bangkok, you eat on the street, you are not used to the water — and it is the water that can make you sick.”




“Most Indian diplomats will tell you that there are some brilliant Indian restaurants abroad,” says Shiv Shankar Mukherjee, India’s former High Commissioner to the UK, “However, there are also several Pakistani and Bangladeshi-owned Indian restaurants, and it is these that define Indian food for thousands of international diners. The onus then should ideally be to promote the right concept of Indian food.”
Image makeover
These perceptions are changing, thanks to restaurants like Gymkhana in London (modelled after Indian gymkhana clubs), which got a Michelin in 2014. Or The Cinnamon Club, set in the former Westminster Library, and serving modern Indian food.
Of course, given the build-up, once tourists land in India, they first want to hit the streets for those promised samosas. Street food tends to raise questions on quality, hygiene and provenance of ingredients. Aiming to change that is Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI), which has undertaken numerous projects towards ensuring food safety across sectors. Project Clean Street Food, launched in 2016, aims to train 20,000 roadside vendors in Delhi on health and hygiene, in phase one. Pawan Agarwal, CEO, FSSAI, says, “In consideration is also a campaign on recognising responsible places to eat at. This will be for restaurants as well as packaged food. Metrics to evaluate quality of produce used, hygiene, reduced food wastage etc, are being developed, and those displaying sincere efforts will be recognised, making it easier for visitors to make smart choices.”




As a food tour organiser, Sinhji believes that clear communication is also important. She emphasises to her clients that if you are not sensible, you can get sick. This is why her tours include home-dining experiences. The way India packages food is as important, says AD Singh, Managing Director, Olive Bar & Kitchen. “Look at the work done by Karen Anand with Dishoom in London,” Singh says. “ Indian food in a café format was an eye-opener to a majority of non-Indians who dined there.”
“The marketing of India as a culinary destination lies in the answer of how to brand Indian cuisine,” says Sunil Alagh, Founder, SKA Advisors, and TV commentator. “We should work towards an ideal that reads — Have you tasted food at all if you have not eaten in India?”

The resurgence of cognac, a once stuffy drink
"," When Bureau National Interprofessionnel du Cognac’s suggestion of a minimum of 10 years’ ageing for cognacs came into effect, Christophe Valtaud was unfazed. 
“Since 1715, the House of Martell has always crafted the finest cognacs with passion and generosity,” says the cellar master via email, “Martell Cordon Bleu and Martell XO are no exceptions. This new regulation doesn’t affect Martell XO cognacs in any way, as they are already blended with 10YO and above eaux-de-vie.”
Having said that, Valtaud does acknowledge a steady demographic shift in the customer base of this high-end brandy variant. 
“The days of the cliché cognac drinkers are long gone. It is no more reserved to cigar smokers curling up next to a roaring fire while casually swirling a snifter of the amber-coloured liquor. The Indian discerning consumer has started to experiment with their taste buds, and is now trying new drinks beyond the regular beers and whiskies.”
The change, he adds, is a global one, as younger and younger folk are gravitating towards it. Needless to say, the drinkers are causing a shift in drinking style as well. 
“It can be mixed with quality mixers, such as soda or traditional lemonade, to make a long drink, or used to make a cocktail,” points out the cellar master, not particularly disturbed by this reclamation of what was originally a gentleman’s drink with a somewhat stuffy image. “There is a younger audience that does not mind having Martell VS & VSOP with cocktails or on the rocks, while a more mature drinker savours his Martell XO neat.”
“We have seen a clear trend shift in Cognac drinking patterns, and the social drinking patterns in general in India and across the world,” he says, “Globally, we find that consumers are becoming much more knowledgeable about cognac and this trend is being followed by the well-travelled Indian drinker as well.”
How to begin
If Valtaud is to be believed, Cognac manufacturers like Martell are embracing this shift, and are more than happy to aid young experimenters. In fact, he has a slew of suggestions ready.
“The best way to introduce cognac to a novice drinker would be to start with an accessible cognac tasting of three different cognacs — Martell Noblige, Cordon Bleu and Martell XO — leading your guests from the lighter to the more intense tasting cognacs,” he begins.
“Of course, mixology is also a very good way to introduce cognac to youngsters, through exciting cocktails or long drinks, mixing cognac with tonic, ginger ale or green tea for example.” 
“At Martell of course, we prefer our Cognac is tasted in a way that reveals all its authenticity and complexity. But the true richness of our House is the mingling of cultures, and we understand, respect and valorise the diversity of ways to enjoy our cognac.”

Add a dash of tamarind petals
"," When you walk under tamarind trees during this time of year, the ground beneath your feet will be dusted with yellow. The first flowers of the tamarind trees have begun to put in an appearance and can be spotted in small sprigs tucked between the bright green leaves. A month ago, we had tried out a few recipes at home using the tender tamarind leaves. The recipe was later shared on a blog, and the comments that followed were a wonderful exchange on the edible parts of the tamarind tree. I must confess that until then, I had never heard of tamarind flowers being palatable or even edible at all. 
The tamarind picking season comes to an end by the last week of March. Any leftover fruit dries and falls off the branches by April, and shortly thereafter, the new leaves begin to unfurl. The first flowers that appear get blown away by the winds and form a thin floral carpet by the roadside. Naturally, these do not stay on the tree long enough to mature into fruit, and hence it’s the best time to cook with them. 
The flowers on the topmost branches are hard to reach, so those on the lower ones make it to the kitchen. These tamarind blossoms are small and have an exotic shape, somewhat like petite orchids. There are five petals, two of which are of a pale lemon colour, with the rest in different shades of orange. The buds are brighter and have a rosy tinge at the tip. 




I scoured the Internet and found two recipes that seemed worth trying: a tamarind flower chutney and a rasam. The chutney recipe uses nallennai to sauté a few tablespoons each of urad dal, thuvar dal, along with half a cup of tamarind flowers, dried red chillies, freshly grated coconut and a pinch of asafoetida. The flowers mimic the sour flavour of the fruit, but on a far milder note; it’s fresher and lighter on the taste buds. We also tried roasting the same ingredients together to get it dry enough to powder. Once it cooled, it was pulsed along with a dash of pink Himalayan crystal salt into a coarse powder. The texture was for eating it mixed in rice, like paruppu podi. The sour note came through, in perfect contrast to the gritty nature of the roasted lentils and the spice from dried chillies. 
I also used this podi in the rasam, instead of the usual powder I use. The dry masala accentuated the taste of the fresh tamarind flowers that were dunked into the boiling liquid right at the end. So this was actually the same ingredient, but used in two ways. 
It was delicious, and we were surprised at finding it as enjoyable as we would our own, traditional tamarind rasam.

Mumbai's Bhagat Tarachand: an edge to the veg
"," Every morning at 9 am, traders who head to the wholesale market at Mumbai’s Zaveri Bazaar, congregate at B Bhagat Tarachand, for breakfast.
Aloo paratha with dahi and lassi is their staple, which the staff lovingly serves. This has been the pattern for several decades now. Synonymous with wholesome vegetarian Sindhi and Punjabi food, the restaurant serves meals throughout the day — both thalis and a la carte.
Today, Prakash Chawla, grandson of founder Bhagat Tarachand Chawla, is at the helm and is assisted by his nephews, Hitesh and Rahul, who make up the fourth generation.
The journey




“The restaurant is named after my grandfather, who was a kind and generous man and loved to feed people. He thus earned himself the title ‘Bhagat’ which, in Sindhi, means kind-hearted. The legacy, which began in the 1890s in Karachi, was carried forward by his three sons — my father Khemchand and two uncles, Radhumal and Gopalchand, and today, by my brothers and their families,” says Prakash.
After Partition, at loose ends upon arriving in Mumbai, Tarachand’s three sons, decided to start Bhagat Tarachand restaurant as a tribute to their father and to keep his passion for food alive.




“Over the years, we have grown and the business has expanded, so the family has branched out and there are several outlets all over Mumbai, including smaller ones in the malls. However, this one at Zaveri Bazaar is the oldest one of all. The core philosophy of serving fresh and affordable vegetarian food is something we strictly adhere to even today at each outlet,” informs Prakash with pride.
The evolution




What began as a small eatery on the ground floor with 30 seats, is a three-storied restaurant with a seating capacity of 200 today.
While the ground floor caters to those who want a quick bite or the thalis and do not mind sharing tables when busy, the first and second floors are more spacious and are for leisurely family meals, including an AC section.
Two vegetables, one dal, chappatis and lassi was all that the fixed menu offered for several decades, and yet, had a plethora of loyal patrons. “It is our food quality and hygiene which attracted customers then and does even now,” Prakash affirms.
The first menu variations were brought about as late as 1978 when Prakash joined his father. “Initially, changes were resisted, but when I could justify the difference they were making to the business, my father was immensely proud of me,” he recalls.
Tandoori rotis, parathas, naans, more vegetables and desserts were some of the items added to the menu post 1978. “The menu grew as per the demands of our guests and we gladly added Punjabi items to the otherwise Sindhi menu too,” he informs us. 
More and more




Happy to introduce changes as they grew, modernisation was accepted with grace. Initially, the kitchen was primitive and the food was cooked on charcoal. Sensing the need to expedite the pace in the kitchen in order to cater to larger volumes, modern equipment was introduced. But the food is still cooked in brass and copper vessels.
Uniforms were introduced for the staff to give a better look, refrigeration was done in the kitchen and a menu card was printed. “Earlier, in my father’s time, the menu was hand-written on a black board,” he reveals.
The seating in the restaurant was basic and sans frills. “People merely came here for a hearty and cheap meal. But when families started to throng this place, we were compelled to start an AC section too,” he adds.
“Changes may have been brought about to keep up with the times, but we have never compromised on the quality and freshness of our food. The same raw materials that are used in the restaurant are the ones used at home too,” Prakash states with candour. 
Quality is of utmost importance to them, and so, no food sitting at kitchen counters for hours is acceptable at Bhagat Tarachand. “Food is cooked thrice daily to ensure freshness for our patrons,” he avers.
Dal fry, tawa rotis, papad churi, paneer bhurjee, rabdi, moong dal halwa, chaas or Kutchi beer, are the signature dishes which reign supreme on the menu even today, although the menu has expanded. While most of the recipes have remained unchanged, a streak of innovation to cater to the evolving palates of diners, is not something they are averse to. 
Looking ahead




With the fourth generation stepping in, Prakash is relieved and ready to pass on the baton. “I have enjoyed my innings, but it is their time now. I am always around to guide them, but they have a free hand to run it their way,” he states. He is, in fact, looking forward to his son Vishal, currently in the US, joining the business.
Dining apps and platforms seem to be necessary today, so it is being done. However, B Bhagat Tarachand still does not feel the need to advertise. “We have the goodwill and blessings of our loyal patrons who spread the word,” Prakash sums up.

Guess who’s serving us breakfast?
","How does Sunday Breakfast at a stranger’s home sound to you? Peculiar? But B Shanjay, founder of At 641 community, promises that it will be fun. He has recently launched an initiative that he calls Sunday Breakfast at Surprise House. “The participants will not be given any prior information about the host. We will assemble at Saibaba Colony and travel together to the destination.” Shanjay hopes this will lead to people learning more about different cultures, cuisine and people. “I believe that no meal is complete without a good conversation and that is what I offer.”
Shanjay grew up in a village in Udumalaipettai where the Sunday breakfast was given a lot of importance. It involved the joint effort of all the family members and fresh produce from their farm. He says most people these days prefer a brunch on Sundays and hopes his initiative will encourage more people to enjoy a hot home-cooked breakfasts. 




So, every alternate Sunday, Shanjay and his guests set off. There is a brief introduction of the participants who number no more than 15. “Home makers don’t usually cook and serve such large quantities of food,” he explains. 
There have already been two editions of Sunday Breakfast at a Surprise House so far. “The first was in a house of a Chettinad family in Saibaba Colony. VP Ramanathan and Meyyammai Ramanathan had a big garden and we discussed plants and gardening over a breakfast of idli, vada, ragi dosa, rose cooler, sambar, chutney and fruits. Along with food we also got a peep into Chettinadu culture.” The Ramanathans enjoyed the meal too and said it was a chance to interact young guests and learn more about their lifestyle. 
Sumethraa Sreenivasan (21) decided to sign up for this outing when she learnt of Surprise House on Instagram. “Initially I was sceptical but I am glad I signed up, as I made new friends . We even had a magic show by one participant.” 
Shanjay is planning community dinners as well. “Each family will be assigned either a starter, main course or dessert. I will also introduce non-vegetarian options for Sunday Breakfast at Surprise House,” he promises.

What must go in your child’s lunch box
"," 
Processed junk food has been steadily filling the lunch boxes of many school children in Kerala. Although nutritionists and paediatricians have been warning parents about the ill effects of processed food and why it should not become a habit, indulgent or harried parents reach for that carton or packet as it saves time on manic weekdays. 
Dr. Anita Suresh, general practitioner working at SUT Royale Preventive Clinic, says fast food creates unhealthy obese adults who fall easy prey to diabetes and hypertension. “Most processed food are high in calories with little nutritive value. Fast food is often cooked in oil that is reheated, which can irritate the stomach of children. It can be carcinogenic too. Moreover, the kids might become addicted to artificial flavours,” she explains. 
Although canteens are common in many schools, hot-sellers are fast food such as parathas, burgers and samosas. Not much thought is given to the idea of a balanced diet. While most government schools serve mid-day meals, which are supposed to be cooked according to a chart prepared by dieticians, only one or two in the private sector have a food plan for students.
Trivandrum International School is one of those rare schools in Thiruvananthapuram that makes it a point to serve a balanced diet for the children. “All students eat in the cafeteria. We follow a calorie count for each meal and ensure our meals are healthy with a mix of salads/fruits and proteins, with carbohydrates. Teachers educate children on healthy meals and we have a chef on the rolls of the school management. As such, the principal, teachers and the management take a close look at what is being served for lunch,” says Rupa Sen, Principal of the school. Even short eats are made of wholesome wheat and there are no fried eats. “Variety in choice of food items, methods of preparations, choices of colour, texture, and flavour, makes food appetising and satisfying. A combination of carbohydrates, proteins and fat will give long-lasting energy at breakfast which will help children to concentrate on studies and activities,” say adds.

L'école Chempaka, on the other hand, believes in educating parents and children on the importance of a nutritious diet.
“So, we insist on an orientation course for new parents. There is a chart that shows healthy snacks and we advise parents to send cooked food for both snacks and lunch. Our teachers monitor the lunch boxes of our students in the kindergarten and junior classes and see to it that the students are not eating junk food. We have to catch them young when their tastes are developing,” says Daphne Gomez, Principal of L'école Chempaka.
The School of the Good Shepherd also thinks on the same lines. Parents of children going into class one are advised to send only food cooked at home for their children. “When their aunties in school open the lunch boxes for them, the children get pulled up if they find junk food. They tell us to pack whatever we make at home and not picked up from an outlet,” says Archana Gopinath, mother of an eight-year-old. 
Many schools in the city are beginning to keep a watch on what the students have in their lunch box. Teachers in the primary classes in Christ Nagar Higher Secondary School, for instance, have advised students to bring a wholesome meal for lunch instead of opting for snacks or packaged ready-made food. 
“One of the students in my child’s class was given bread and tomato sauce on a daily basis. The class teacher concerned had to speak to the parents to give the child cooked food for lunch,” says a mother of a student in Christ Nagar School. 
In the case of government schools, the Government’s breakfast and noon meal scheme ensures a wholesome diet for the students. “The Government guidelines insist on a healthy, balanced diet, which includes vegetables, especially leafy vegetables, and pulses,” explains Jaseela A.R., Principal Headmistress of the school. 
However, nutritionist Gayathri Asokan, head of Nutrisolutions, says bread, pasta or noodles is not the problem. “If a child enjoys pasta, give her a healthy pasta filled with vegetables and, if she is a non-vegetarian, eggs, meat and fish too. If she is fond of bread, then give her sandwiches with a filling that is made of fresh veggies, cheese or egg. The trick is to see that the child gets enough of carbs, proteins and vitamins. There is no need to stuff the child but she must be eating healthy,” she says.

Two wheels and some chicken wings "," The smell of soot and sweet barbecue sauce laces the evening air as I near Navalar Nagar 1st Street on Bypass Road. By the side of the road stands a Royal Enfield Classic 350, with its chrome finish exterior, shining under the street lamp. Attached to the bike is a sidecar modified into a stylish cooking station with a grill, a tava and storage for charcoal, spices and meat. On the bike’s fuel tank, a wood-framed menu announces grilled chicken varieties and mounted atop the sidecar is a black umbrella branded in bold white letters ‘Bullet Bbq Ride’.




Chef Abbas Ali is busy tossing marinated chicken pieces on the grill. He gently smears some sauce on to the meat chunks with a brush and a small ball of fire erupts from the fiery red charcoal pieces underneath the hot grill, sending puffy clouds of fresh smoke into the air. Soon, piping-hot and perfectly grilled chicken wings and strips are dished out on paper plates with mayonnaise to the eagerly waiting crowd. My plate of drumsticks arrives and I bite into succulent chunks of chicken with a spicy and crispy outer-coat. With a flavoursome after-taste, the grilled chicken surely floors me and many others alike, for a lot of us order a second plate.




Bbq Ride India, the Bangalore-based food chain on a bike has set foot in the city and has received good response in just over 45 days. Apart from the food, the idea of a mobile kitchen on a bike and the entire set-up are the crowd pullers. “Since Madurai people are meat lovers, we have introduced some interesting combos that are priced between ₹150 and ₹200. Of late, barbecue has caught on as a popular street food in the city and we wanted to tap into its potential. But we also wanted to stand out in the growing number of barbecue restaurants and felt the Bullet Bbq Ride with its unique look, presence and taste is a good option. It’s working out pretty well,” says biker M Ashraf Sulthan, who, along with his friends has taken up the franchise.




“We experiment and add innovative items but the taste is maintained with a set of standardised masalas provided by the company. There are three varieties of spice mixtures with different flavours,” says Ali, who took a two-day training in Bengaluru. “The cooking method is pretty simple. We source around 15kilos of chicken every morning, marinate it for five hours before setting up shop in the evening. Grilling is a healthier method than frying in oil and people lap it up; we have been able to sell out all of the procured meat for the day, so far.”
“The boneless whole chicken breast, shawarma, kebabs and lollipops are fast moving items. We plan to introduce prawns, fish and mutton in the future, apart from more options for vegetarians. Right now, we only have grilled paneer, capsicum and pineapple. We have also increased the quantity and kept the price competitive to attract customers,” says Sulthan. “With the mushrooming of many food trucks, Bypass Road is becoming the eat street of Madurai, similar to OMR in Chennai. That’s the reason we plonked ourselves here. We may soon open another one in the north side of the city, around KKNagar.”
Currently, the Bullet Bbq Ride is stationed near Sangeetha Mobiles, from 6 pm to 10 pm. For details, call 9787528399, 8667529015

The craft of documenting food
","Let’s admit it, we live to eat. And what better way to kickstart the weekend than a food conclave that offers discussions and masterclasses on art, literature, photography and media production all which centre on food. The event dubbed The Culinary Chroniclers Conclave is helmed by food consultant and author Rushina Munshaw-Ghildiyal and Vikhroli Cucina. “Many people have taken it upon themselves to record the diverse facets of food consumption, using whatever mediums are available to them at the time. Their chronicles become important windows to understanding their cultures, and sometimes through that, our very own,” says Munshaw-Ghildiyal who will conduct a food doodling session at the event. The event will also host food installations: ‘Layers of a Tiffin’ by Sonal Ved and Shirali Tyabji; and ‘The Story of Chocolate’ by chocolatier Zeba Kohli.Here are six sessions from the food conclave that should not be missed:
From plate to page
Ankiet Gulabani who has a popular Instagram account, Belly Over Mind takes you through the nuances of recipe writing. “When you are writing a recipe, you are talking to a friend. To make sure a reader follows the steps to the tee, it is important to know how to record a recipe and structure it with an interesting narrative,” he says.
Oral traditions
Author Saee Koranne-Khandekar will be in conversation with writer Lalita Iyer and television food content producer Shubra Chatterji. “Together, we will unearth culinary oral literature through harvest songs, nursery rhymes, kitchen songs that pass on food wisdom from one generation to the next,” says Koranne -Khandekar.
Media
Be it for your YouTube Channel, Instagram or Facebook content, learn to make food videos from food content TV producer Ruchi Srivastava. “People are passionate but don’t know how to shoot a video properly. I will take participants through shoot planning, must-haves for a shoot and how to get good content out of limited technology,” declares Srivastava
Culinary histories
Food historian Dr Mohsina Mukadam will take you through the sources for documenting culinary history. “Conventional methods consider archival material and archaeological sources, while unconventional references include cookbooks, ayurvedic texts, menu cards and even advertisements,” explains the good doctor.
Cooking the books
Journalist and food writer Vikram Doctor will be in conversation with food authors Saee Koranne-Khandekar and Jyotsna Shahane, who are knowledgeable about Marathi cookbook scene. “We will go to the depths of Maharastrian food culture, some of the earliest cook books, practicality of cookbooks, what makes people want to use cookbooks, and meaning of tradition among other things,” says Doctor.
Food fables
Celebrity chef Ranveer Brar “I am concentrating on the importance of food folklore and fables, as they are relevant towards documenting cuisine. We get fascinated towards facts, but there is a romance is storytelling,” says Brar, who will cite examples from the city and beyond. “The idea is to inspire people to collect and chronicle.”
Culinary Chroniclers Conclave takes place today from 10 a.m. to 7.30 p.m. at Vikhroli Cucina, Auditorium, Godrej One, Vikhroli; tickets are from ₹500-1500; for more details check at vikhrolicucina.com

Where to find quinoa beer in India
"," If quinoa puffs and upma can sneak into our supermarket trolleys, and one too many quinoa salads and burgers continue to make an appearance on restaurant menus, can beer be far behind? Microbrewery central — Bengaluru — is now brewing the country’s first quinoa beer and it is happening at Bangalore Brew Works, where it is available on tap as a limited edition option along with a seasonal mango beer. 
Veteran brewer and consultant Subroto Cariapa who has worked with Heineken, Pilsner and Cobra in the past, is behind this quinoa invention. “Quinoa’s high soluble fibres bring down cholesterol levels and its high levels of potassium (usually beers come with a lot of sodium) are good for managing blood pressure too,” he says. 
Quinoa is also gluten free, so hello guilt-free chugging. In fact, Sakshi Sagaraju, co-owner of Bangalore Brew Works, recently found out that she was gluten intolerant and thus started her quest for drinking and serving a gluten-free version. But, according to Cariapa, treating the quinoa grain is tough (because of the same virtues mentioned above), and a special processing and mashing technique (they wouldn’t divulge any of their secrets) is used to make it brewable. 
I tried a glass as a sundowner and found it to be refreshingly light and rather delicious, and I felt like saying, “Bring it on!” The beer was pleasant, sweet with a hint of bitterness. A certain graininess has been maintained in the flavour, shares Cariapa, and a couple of special hops have been added for floral notes, which explains the pleasant aftertaste. And what would pair well with the quinoa beer? Everything from grilled fish to white meat. Quintessential pub food (think chili chicken and chicken wings) is fine too. Sagaraju adds that the quinoa beer itself is not overpowering, making it a perfect counterbalance to that heavy duty grease in your chicken ghee roast. 
And if you are itching to ask how Bangalore Brew Works justifies the carbon footprint of importing quinoa all the way from South America, then the good news is that it does not. The quinoa is sourced from Anantapur district in neighbouring Andhra Pradesh, where this Andes region supergrain is now successfully cultivated. 
Local, homegrown champs like Karnataka’s very own ragi are not left out either. You can try a ragi beer on tap too — also gluten free — a sultrier, heavier, malty and darker brew. 
For those who fear that quinoa, with its superfood status, might not make for a delicious treat, here is a beer to prove you wrong with your favourite kind of buzz.
The quinoa beer, priced at ₹230 for 330 ml, is available at Bangalore Brew Works until August 31.

Joe Bastianich gets personal
"," I am a bit nervous before my call with Joe Bastianich, the no-nonsense television judge known for binning a bad dish without blinking an eye. In May, the celebrity chef and winemaker returned to Season 9 of MasterChef US along with co-hosts Gordon Ramsay and Aarón Sanchez. 
Yet, contrary to his television avatar, he is chipper on the phone. We start with his early days as a bond trader on Wall Street. “Imagine, if I had stuck to that, I would have been retired, super rich and living on a yacht,” Bastianich, now 49, says. He was no stranger to the restaurant industry; born in Astoria, he practically grew up in a restaurant run by his parents. 
The first in his family to go to college, he was determined to make it big. “I had humble beginnings. I didn’t want to be poor like my family,” admits the chef, adding, “I worked on Wall Street and hated it. My mother suggested I quit and spend some time in Italy for a few years and develop my already existing passion for food and wine. I travelled around the country and returned to New York in 1991 to open my first restaurant.”
Hard talk
Today, Batali & Bastianich Hospitality Group — which the chef founded along with his mother, and celebrity chef Mario Batali — owns 30 restaurants worldwide, including the Michelin-starred Babbo and Del Posto in New York.
In May, his company released a statement saying it would end all ties with Batali in the wake of multiple sexual harassment claims made by women, many of whom had worked in the B&B Group’s kitchens. Earlier this year, the MasterChef judge also apologised for racist and sexist comments he had made in Italy. When I bring up Batali and three of the group’s restaurant closures in Las Vegas, Bastianich chooses not to comment. We talk about the show instead.




Constructive critic
Bastianich agrees that the MasterChef franchise has had a huge impact on our palates and culinary travel aspirations. “The show opened horizons and changed perspectives. People feel it can change their lives,” he says. What about his brusque manner and sometimes harsh criticism onscreen? “Reprimanding them is part of giving them genuine feedback,” he responds. “My main role as a judge is to steer a contestant’s journey. We become vested in them and we put effort into their food journeys.”
Glocal is the way 
 With appearances on MasterChef Italia, Bastianich’s fame extends to his country of origin. “Similar to India, where family and food are the two most important things in life, Italian families too are close-knit. Food is a way to relive our culture, especially for immigrants living away from home,” he says. Part of his inherited culinary heritage is an emphasis on local, sustainable food. “The essence of Italian cuisine is hyper-regional, and a cook in Milan will always use seasonal produce. It is part of our cuisine culture,” he explains, finding parallels in the contemporary culinary world. “Campaigns like #unwaste are great, and heirloom food is finding its place across the globe. We should eat responsibly and adopt sustainable practices.”
Feel the pressure
Our conversation steers towards the recent suicide of Anthony Bourdain, a friend and mentor. “I didn’t say much about his death because I had no words to express my feelings. He was a great legacy. I even did a chapter in his book, Kitchen Confidential,” he says, describing how he turned to the late chef when he decided to write his own memoir, Restaurant Man. “I was trying to write something really honest and personal. He showed me the way to ensure each page had an impact on the reader.”
Depression in kitchens has become a talking point, with more media attention being given to the harsh working conditions at many elite restaurants. “We work in an environment of high pressure and long hours,” agrees Bastianich. “The problem of alcoholism is a reality of the industry. This is a good time to alter people’s mindset about mental health issues, and let them know there is help available.”
A recent trend finds the culinary world’s renegade citizens eschewing accolades and ratings. Last year, legendary French chef Sébastien Bras was one of many to return the Michelin stars awarded to his restaurant, Le Suquet à Laguiole, citing anonymous reviews and pressure to perform as a reason. “Yes, there is a lot of pressure to maintain standards,” Bastianich agrees, “but I think people who are drawn to that kind of restaurant want to be judged, they want a name, by customers and journalists and they do the hard work they do,” he concludes.
MasterChef Junior US, also hosted by Bastianich, airs every Saturday at 8 pm on Star World and Star World HD in India

'Savya Rasa' comes to Chennai: swipe right on bun parotta ","You know the excitement of finding the perfect match on Tinder? I feel that way when I am introduced to bun parotta at Savya Rasa. 
As the gleaming ball of parotta (yes, it’s round like a ball) arrives at the table, I can smell the ghee from a foot away. 
Restaurateur Nikesh Lamba and Japtej Ahluwalia look on with pride at this superstar on their menu. 
A dish from the Malabar region, it’s got a flaky top layer and is generously doused with butter and ghee. I eat it plain, then I discover it pairs perfectly with silky vegetable stew. And like Jim Carrey in The Mask, I am forced to say, “Somebody stop me”.




Ahluwalia, Lamba and Vikram Mohan’s latest project, Savya Rasa launched last month in Chennai. It first opened in Pune in 2015. After being listed in the Conde Nast Top Restaurant Awards 2017, the team decided to bring it to Chennai “for the real test”. 
More dishes have been added to this menu. The interiors draw influence from the regions featured on the menu, so there are Athangudi tiles, thick tribal anklets from Karnataka, an ornate kuthuvilakku from Kerala, an elaborate wooden chest from Puducherry, Pathamadai mats from Tirunelveli... 
“The idea is to go back in time when everyone else is going modern,” says Lamba.




Given how diverse South Indian cuisine is, it was Mohan’s idea to showcase food from the different Southern states. “He went looking for master cooks in each of these regions. 
Some of them run their own joints. He hired them in the test kitchen in Coimbatore and together worked on their recipes. Initially, we had around 300-400 dishes. But when the final menu was created, we brought it down to 120,” says Lamba. 
In comparison to other delicious heavyweight Moplah, Malabar, Rayalseema, Nellore, Kongunad, Mysuru, Chettinad and Nasrani specialities, the Karavali chicken and spinach soup is a weak contender. It’s a good way to down your greens though. 




We overdose on chutney paniyarams. Partly crunchy, partly soft, each is stuffed with a filling of Kashmiri and South Indian chilli chutney.
If you can handle spice, the Guntur mirpakaya kodi is a delight. It sparkles red like a gem stone and is coated in chilli paste, chilli powder and curry leaves. It’s cooked in coconut oil and that gives it a distinct flavour. The Pallipalayam mutton too is just as fiery. Tender pieces of mutton are coated with turmeric and tossed with red chillies. “Pallipalayam is a major producer of turmeric,” says a waiter helpfully, as he covers every inch of my banana leaf-covered plate with food.
Just as I am about to throw in the towel, napkin, in this case, he doles out a serving of creamy saamai thayir saadham, made with millets instead of rice. 
But everything pales in comparison to the grand finale: elaneer pudding. 
Made purely of coconut water, this crystal clear, jelly-like dessert is refreshing, and with every bite I fall a little bit more in love with it. So much so that I wouldn’t mind wearing a chunk of this on my ring finger.

The restobar at Greams Road
","Expect few surprises as you hit Greams Road looking for Glee restobar: it’s where B-Side was previously, which was where Plan-B was before that. Old wine, new bottle, minus the obligatory ‘B’ in the name? Not quite.
The interiors are, of course, mostly identical to the previous incumbents’, except the linen and livery, so expect the cosy, but collar-down environment you are used to. But once you’re through the quite extensive bar and food menu, you’re in for quite a fiery ride. They offer over 15 cocktails, not including the margaritas and martinis, and 10 varieties of chicken wings. Glee is a drinking non-vegetarian’s paradise, from the word go.




The cosmo is quite par for the course with just the right fruity notes, a strong cranberry flavour throughout, and a mild citric aftertaste. The proportions are spot-on, but this one may be too mild for some. You’ll want to go for multiples of these. The smurf’s revenge is far too light for any of the four liquors it has — vodka, gin, whisky and white rum — with little zip. The dominant blue curaçao makes it appear more cartoon mocktail, and tastes no different. Eschew it in favour of the Moscow mule. Served in the traditional copper mug, this one romps the cocktail contest with its perfect tango of ginger ale and vodka. 
For the only time, this writer recommends vegetarian nachos over the non-vegetarian. While the former gets the small things right, the chicken nachos are bland, with meat bits dry as bone. The chicken dynamite may be more up your alley. Based on a Malayali preparation, this dish of fried chicken topped off with vinegar, soya and tomato sauce could make me consider putting aside my dislike of curry leaves. It doesn’t overpower the sauce or the crispy meat, and adds a suave complimentary note.




If Glee wants to fly on the strength of its chicken wings, they’re guaranteed to soar. The naked peri peri wings are salty, spicy, crunchy, and a little bit of a happy-dance in your mouth — all one can ask a starter for. The mac ’n cheese wings are an interesting lot — deep-fried wings in mac ’n cheese sauce. The sauce itself is what the name promises. Creamy, rich in cheese, and subtle herby flavours: the chicken borders on bland, but the crunch and cream make up for it.
The grilled peri peri glazed fish is quite the deceptive meal. Served with mashed potatoes, it’s unabashedly spicy: all fireworks at first, but with a lingering, subtle sweet whiff, that leaves you curious and hoping for more. If you can live with your tongue ablaze for a brief while, go for this. The sliced pork belly is unavoidable: tender with the perfect balance of fat and meat. The barbeque sauce it’s roasted with just sings in perfect harmony. All things said, there’s a good chance you’ll leave this pub quite gleeful.

Mango and memories!
","Mangoes and I go back a long way. My grandfather had a mango orchard in his village in Western Uttar Pradesh, and I spent my summers rather fruitfully – literally and otherwise – among the trees there. I recall an incident in New Delhi, too, when we were among a group of families living together in a bungalow in Lutyens’ Delhi, which was – and is – lined with mango trees. I chucked a stone aimed at a ripe mango dangling from a branch of a fruit-laden tree and then ran for my life when I saw the maali approaching. But the stone took a strange arc and instead of hitting the branch, hit the top of my head as I ran.
But despite such misadventures, my love for mangoes stays as strong as ever. I love the chausa, which sadly comes for a very short while. Last week, I also had some nice ratauls, which my friend Sohail bhai brought from Rataul, a village just about 30 km from Delhi.
I have had another nice mango session this summer – and that was at The Imperial. Chef Veena Arora, Chef De Cuisine, The Spice Route, had rolled out her Summer Collection menu, and I had a taste of some of her delicious specialities. The menu spans dishes from Kerala, Sri Lanka, Vietnam and Thailand, and each dish includes either fresh or raw mangoes. The maambalam okra thoren, for instance, is a Kerala dish of wok-fried okra with slivers of raw mango, while the yum mamuang kung krob is a spicy raw mango salad with dry shrimp and battered fried prawns from Thailand. 
I had a Thai dish – tom som mamuang – which was a wonderfully light chicken and raw mango soup flavoured with lemongrass, galangal and kaffir lime leaves. For the soup, the chef had boiled a cup of water and then added a stock cube to it, along with lemongrass, galangal and kaffir lime leaves. When it started to boil, she added some fish sauce and crushed red chillies to it. Cherry tomatoes, onion, chicken and raw mango went into the broth, which was then seasoned and garnished with fresh cilantro. It was heavenly, and rejuvenated me on that hot and humid day in a trice. 
Nice and tart
The amba curry – a Sri Lankan dish of raw mango and assorted vegetables – was nice and tart. But what I loved was the ga xao hot dieu – a Vietnamese style stir fried chicken dish with ripe mango and cashew nuts. The chicken had soaked in the flavours of the mango, and the crunchy cashew nuts added to the texture. The Jasmine rice with ripe mangoes cooked in coconut milk was wonderfully fragrant and was almost like a dish by itself. 




Delightful mix
Chef Arora, who grew up in Thailand, likes to add fruit to her dishes – a delightful mix that is a veritable part of Thai cuisine. “That is the reason the complete menu revolves around mango, the favourite summer fruit,” she says.
The menu has been carefully crafted by the chef, who has also created the dishes. Among them is pla e saan – crispy fillets of sole served with a spicy palm sugar and shredded raw mango sauce and flavoured with mint.
The festival is on till July 31, for both lunch and dinner. A meal for two costs ₹8500 plus taxes. There are several desserts on the menu, too, but I am being a good boy and didn’t venture there. But the food that I did eat was, in one word, superb.
It didn’t just tickle my palate but also opened up a trove of old memories. And it even reminded me of a dent on the top of my head!

Hell’s Kitchen in Las Vegas: a quick taste
","Replete with pitchforks, shooting digital flames and cocktails fuming with dry ice, there is nothing subtle about Hell’s Kitchen. 
There’s even a video of a life-sized, suitably annoyed Chef Gordon Ramsay at the entrance, barely welcoming guests. And of course, a flurry of merchandise. But then, this is Las Vegas: Theme park restaurants are part of the package. Helmed by the famously irate celebrity chef, this restaurant — attached to the ostentatious Caesars Palace — Hell’s Kitchen, is based on the popular American TV reality programme by the same name.
Starring Ramsay and his colourful vocabulary, Hell’s Kitchen pits two teams of aspiring chefs against each other.With a kitchen divided into red and blue, just like the show, the restaurant, launched this year, is a magnet for Instagrammers, selfie-hunters and those who live for Facebook Check-Ins.
I bump into Michelle Tribble minutes after entering. A contestant on Seasons 14 and 17 of Hell’s Kitchen, she won the position of head chef at this restaurant (along with a salary of $250,000). She’s with cheery Christina Wilson, who won Season 10 and is now executive chef for the US Division of the Gordon Ramsay Group, which has a total of 35 restaurants globally, out of which five are right here in Vegas.




“I’ve been with the group for about six years now,” says Wilson, discussing how they put the restaurant together. “We began working on this project when filming Michelle’s season, so we were immersed in Hell’s Kitchen: 16 hours on set, 6 days a week.”
She describes the food as “American continental... Heavily inspired by the show.” She adds, “We are a chef-driven restaurant.” As for the kitchen? “Well, there’s a little less shouting,” she smiles, looking at Tribble. “Michelle already has her job, so she’s not fighting. She’s in a better mood...” In contrast to her tough on-screen persona, Tribble seems shy in real life, letting Wilson do most of the talking. “She was this little 22-year-old when we first met her on the set,” chuckles Wilson, adding with a wink, “A young gun. A little too big for her britches.”
At the restaurant, Tribble calls the shots. “It’s the busiest kitchen I have ever worked in,” she says, so softly I have to lean in to hear her over the music and hum of diners. “I am grateful to be here.” The location means she’s cooking for visitors from all over the world, many of whom are celebrities. “So many people come in really excited,” she says, adding, “This is the only restaurant in America based on a TV show.”




A chatty waiter in suspenders leads us to our table across the 8,000 sq ft restaurant, with floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking the lively Vegas Strip. The cooks are in red and blue jackets, accessorised with bandanas, just like in the show. A glance at the menu reveals that Ramsay has played to his strengths. Instead of falling into the celebrity chef trap, the food is simple without unnecessary bells and whistles. Or in culinary terms: spheres, foams and dehydrated powders.
 
A taste of the best
I begin with a golden beet salad, creamy with Greek yoghurt and topped with crunchy pistachio granola. For the main course, I’m torn between the legendary beef Wellington and Ramsay’s classic crispy skin salmon, which the waiter tells me is on the menu of his three Michelin-star restaurants. I settle on salmon, flaky with a deliciously crisp seared crust. It is served on a bed of robust Beluga lentils and a tangle of shaved fennel. Dessert is the universally popular sticky toffee pudding: warm, spongy and familiar, it’s served with creamy speculoos ice cream.
As for the question weighing on all your minds: does Ramsay yell in the kitchen? Both Tribble and Wilson burst into laughter. “Yes, he does sometimes. But for the most part no,” says Wilson, “He’s actually soft-hearted. Also really funny. Really sharp, witty and super engaged.”




Assuming this is just good PR, I ask my chauffeur from Bell Limousine later what she thinks of Ramsay, as she drives him around Vegas occasionally. She unreservedly answers, “He’s the nicest man. He likes to sit in the front seat and play with the radio.” She adds, “I was worried the first time I heard I was driving him: I’ve seen the show. I turned 60 this year and even my children don’t talk to me like that. I thought I may get into an argument with him... But he was so nice.”

On bunny chow, a staple food at Durban "," I couldn’t believe we were travelling 30 kilometres to eat bunny chow. Can’t we just stop at one of those ubiquitous Nandos instead? 
But a friend insisted we savour the Durban delicacy, and promised it would be worth it. So we reached De’Ma restaurant at the Gateway Shopping Centre in Umhlanga in Durban to eat the famed bunny chow. “Quarter or half?” the waiter asked, followed by, “chicken or mutton?”
Asking for a quarter with chicken seemed a safe bet. The size of the loaf and overflowing chicken curry, like volcanic lava, was an overwhelming sight. The look and taste of the gravy was pretty much Indian. Unlike the Gatsby, which is Cape Town’s favourite sandwich, where a foot-long bread is stuffed with just about everything available in the refrigerator, bunny chow has just one filling — curry.
It’s the plating that truly takes the cake. An uncut loaf of bread, hollowed out in the centre is filled with curry, either chicken, mutton or sometimes beans-based gravies. A big cut-potato and carrot salad are served on the side along with the scooped-out bread, to be eaten with the gravy. 
Succulent chicken pieces are well-cooked in tomato gravy and you can detect the distinct flavour of Indian spices. The closest Indian parallel I could think of is pav-bhaji. Halfway through, the bread loaf absorbs the curry, and as you go breaking the mountain of the bread, more curry spills out from the well. It’s a mess... but a delightful, finger-licking mess.
There’s no clear historical origin to Bunny Chow, though. It’s believed to be an Indian innovation in the 19th Century, when Indian workers arrived in South Africa. In between laborious work, they would pack their curries inside the bread to save time. 
Bunny Chow also became popular during Apartheid, when most restaurant owners would not allow black diners inside their restaurants, and instead, would pack the curries inside a loaf of bread and give it as a takeaway. 
The very name ‘bunny’, many agree, is derived from the ‘bania’ community, who’d run these restaurants. But for most Durban residents now, bunny chow is a staple, a fast takeaway option, or even an evolved fine dining experience. 
Either way, while in Durban, make sure not to miss this chow!

What makes the Riesling so special?
"," Okay, I admit it: for me, ‘Riesling’ equated to syrupy sweet wine. However, with wine-connoisseurs speaking eloquently about its aromatic delights, I had long wanted to reconsider my palate. The opportunity came during a visit to Rheingau, a designated wine region in Germany, where almost 80% of the grape grown is Riesling.
What I instantly experienced at the Riesling tastings was the aroma — a strong bouquet, ranging from tangy lemon to rich apricot in the late harvests, with lots of fruit notes in-between. That Riesling can only be a sweet wine was a preconception that stood on its head. Rheingau winemakers have responded to the market demand for drier wines, with Rieslings that carry the descriptions trocken and halbtrocken, the German classification for dry and off-dry wines. These Rieslings have a finely balanced acidity, leaving a clean finish on the palate.




It is important to note that ‘sweetness’ in the Riesling context does not mean an inferior wine at all. On the contrary, Riesling is a grape variety that lends itself delightfully to sweeter, fruit-forward wines. Which one prefers is just a matter of taste. However, Rheingau is the perfect place to sample the sweeter range of Rieslings, because this style of wine-making originated here, specifically at the famous Schloss Johannisberg. The 50th parallel — or circle of latitude — that cuts through the area, is marked. It serves as a reminder of Rheingau’s special micro climate and influential terroir, that is perhaps responsible for the term ‘minerality’ applied to many Rieslings here.
At Domdechant Werner’sches Weingut, another Rheingau winery, I had the opportunity to attend the estate’s spring presentation, a tasting of their complete programme of wines. This ranges from the powerful dry wines, Erstes Gewächs (the German equivalent of the French Grand Cru), to the world-famous fruit-driven dessert wines; of the latter, we did a vertical tasting of 10 Auslese wines. “Sweet” is an inadequate description of these opulent brews, whose clean acidity so elegantly balances out the velvety notes of honey and dried fruits.




Dr Franz Werner Michel’s family has harvested Riesling at Domdechant Werner since 1780. He talked of how the wine is already in the grape, their job is to “allow it to realise its full potential”. Painstaking care is lavished on the process, from the harvesting, the steeper slopes of the vineyards necessitating that the grapes are hand-picked. It is said that many man-hours of picking are required to produce a bottle of top-end dessert wine such as Trockenbeerenauslese. Apparently, many easily last 50 to a 100 years; Riesling is a rare white wine that fares well in the bottle over long periods.
Those who like theirs bubbly will be happy with the Riesling Sekt Brut or the fresh German sparkling wine. The Reisling, as it turns out, is a pretty versatile grape — it even worked well in the wine schorle, a refreshing mixture of wine and sparkling water.

Sunday specials at Sayahna Garden Restaurant "," 
Breakfast at an ‘evening restaurant’ might sound like an irony. But that’s exactly the delicious difference Sayahna Garden Restaurant brings with its stand-alone Sunday Breakfast, which boasts of a compact but inviting, chiefly ethnic Kerala fare. As you walk in after negotiating a particularly snarled-up mid-morning traffic despite it being a Sunday, the place suddenly offers you a semblance of serenity as a touch of the traditional comes garnished with a reposeful ambience.
Ensconced at a lush corner of Kerala Tourism Development Corporation’s sprawling Mascot Hotel in the heart of the city, Sayahna Garden Restaurant’s highlight is, as the name evinces, the green-hugged open-air dining space by the side. The stripped-down furniture adds to the sun-kissed garden’s visual charm by silently foregrounding the emerald vista.




However, opting comfort over aesthetics, we amble towards the AC dining area with artsy, oil-smooth wallpapers and we are welcomed by a courteous usher. The dinky list on the single-page menu proves particularly helpful in whittling down your choices for an economical breakfast. Apart from the few odd-ones-out like the good old bread-butter-jam combo or the improvised beef/chicken omelette or muffin, the rest of the list unequivocally sounds chaste naadan with the likes of kadala curry, beef roast, Kumarakom chicken curry, pidiyum kozhiyum, ari pathiri, chiratta puttu, mutta kuzhalappam... to name a lip-smacking few. The bonus is ‘the week’s special’, not on the list and something that can range from a variety of South India’s evergreen favourite, dosa, to a dose of the quintessentially Maharashtrian pav bhaji masala. The special on a chosen day is announced on the black board outside, and, today, poori bhaji masala it is. Nevertheless, the best part of the entire deal is the ‘small’ and ‘large’ portions available for the dishes on offer, especially curry. A great boon in trying out more while reigning in the final bill.




After a genial dialogue for order-taking and a brief wait, the dishes are borne in one by one. First up is ari pathiri, accompanied by a ‘small’ portion of beef roast and mutton stew. Soft and almost wafer-thin, the snow-white pathiri melts in the mouth, aided by a thick and creamy mutton stew with moderate dollops of potato and carrot. The well-cooked meat pieces seem to be in competition with the rice pancake for which is tenderer. However, the light-brown homely beef roast, unexpectedly with quite a bit of onion-infused gravy and fine green chilly chops, proves a spicy foil to the succulent but mild-tasting stew.




The chef’s recommendation of the day — the Kottayam-style pidiyum kozhiyum — comes calling next. Not a dish you would easily find in the city every day, this scalding gravy-rich delicacy lives up to its reputation with globs of pidi (rice balls equivalent to kozhakkatta) dunked in coconut milk-rich Kumarakom-style chicken curry topped with creamy residual sauce from the pidi. Wheat porotta, often cherry-picked as a healthier alternative to its otherwise unbeatable maida cousin for the Malayali, may be the only item tasted and tested that scored a low, only for its moderately high oil content. Nonetheless, it’s not a deal-breaker.
If the chef insists on trying out the day’s special, you can’t outright say nay, especially if your taste-buds have not demurred yet. Hence arrives the poori bhaji masala set, with three impeccably inflated pooris and a generous bowl of yellow, mellow mashed potato curry. Something simple to write home about. Enough is not enough and you can’t help but want to polish off the remainder of the stew and roast gravy when you scrutinise the menu again and see the spirit-lifting word ‘kallappam’. But blame it on transliteration as a double check with the waiter after the order clarifies any misgivings. Kallu-appam. One should have read ‘stone’ and not ‘toddy’. However, no blame on the chef as the flat dosa-like appam passes muster.




Shyam Lal, the chief chef, says Sunday Breakfast serves as a perfect choice mainly for church-goers on a Sunday morning. “Also, the idea of small and large portions for some of the dishes helps reduce wastage and spices up choices for the customer,” he adds.
Sunday Breakfast may not be the once-in-a-month, spoilt-for-choice meal plan you wouldn’t mind splurging on but it is certainly a toothsome idea for a no-frills but hearty kick-starter with minimal garnishing and maximum satisfaction that saves you the hassle of cooking on a day you would prefer to take it easy.
Cost for two can be as low as ₹200

A dragon from Kolkata ","There’s Chinese. And then there’s desi Chinese: Spicy curries, deep fried chicken and prawns in a golden batter. 
A lot of these dishes originated in Kolkata’s Chinatown, where a community of Chinese traders worked in tanneries, and started a number of restaurants.

The month-long promotion is a tribute to the culinary escapades of Kolkata’s Chinatown, famous for Indianised Chinese food. 
I begin with dragon chicken, which is possibly created by the Hakka community that first settled in Kolkata, according to legendso. The chicken, which is deep fried, is a perfect blend of tender chicken covered with crispy rice granules. 




“The main ingredients of Indo-Chinese cuisine include ripened chillies, ginger, garlic, fish sauce, lime, sugar and chilli paste A proper Indo-Chinese meal should consist of a soup, a curry with various accompaniments and a meat dish with vegetables,” said executive chef Sridhar Kare.

Chennai’s Spice Klub: Fine dining, with a taste of the streets
"," Spice dominates everything at this restaurant, from the food to the line of art work along an upper wall. They look like abstract paintings, but are actually works of chiselled wood: each painted in a basic colour and centred around a spice like cinnamon or chilli. The huge, staid wooden frames set the tone for the entire restaurant: high-ceilinged, narrow-walled, and tall panels aplenty.
The dishes placed on the table, though, are a trifle more funky. A constant is the Mumbai-style rack of eight cutting-chai glasses, each filled with a brightly-hued, delicious dip. 
What’s even funkier is their decision to start with the sweet stuff: popular among the beverages are coconut water with assorted caviar and mango on the rocks. While the former, served in a bubble-like container that spills foam from all sides, is as sweet and delicious as you can expect coconut water to be, the latter transcends the narrow boundaries of entrée, main course and dessert. No, really. Crunchy as ice, with some sponginess of pulp and the taste of, well, pure mango, it is one of those dishes you can spoon mouthfuls of with no regard for course, meal, or time of day. And that’s exactly what we did: mango on the rocks stayed put at the table throughout, and made it to our plates at the end of every course.
There’s much to be said for the inventiveness of Spice Klub’s head chef in Mumbai. 
Take, for instance, the fruit lassi served in six flavours, solidified into a jelly-like consistency through a process called spherification, that lets you tip one serving of unpleasantly saccharine-sweet lassi right into your mouth like an oyster. Or, take the dahi vada, aka vada boondi served with dahi caviar. 




If you have grown up feasting on the middle-class staple, served at every celebration and family get-together, you’ll recognise the core taste of the vada from the boondi you spoon up, and the pleasant familiarity of curd mixed with just the right spices from the bubble of ‘caviar’ that joins the former in your mouth. It’s a party — nay, a homely Indian wedding dance — in your mouth.
The gilavati kebab — unlike most others — doesn’t melt in your mouth. But then, it doesn’t need to. It’s barely softer than a regular tikki, and so rich in flavour that you don’t mind chewing on it for a while. And then there’s the vada pav: plain buns served with potato mousse, with the masala packed in little, edible, plastic-like pouches made of potato starch. Once it’s all in your mouth, it’s like chaat right off the streets. 
But the pouches melt as soon as they touch your tongue, so don’t try this dish if you aren’t willing to race the different components into your mouth. In fact, if you’re the kind of person who doesn’t like playing with your food, don’t come here at all.

World’s best alcohol products that have an ‘Indian’ element "," There are many alcoholic products in foreign shores that come with a tag “Indian” attached. Here are the world’s best known ones. 
Indian Tonic Water
A friend from New Zealand tells me that almost all tonic water in the market comes with the label “Indian Tonic Water”. Tonic Water is an important additive to gin, to be had straight or in cocktails. 
It was the prevalence of malaria in India that perhaps gave rise to the tonic water. It was originally used as a prophylactic against malaria, and intended for consumption in tropical countries such as South Asia and Africa, where the disease was widespread. 
The tonic water was a carbonated soft drink in which quinine was dissolved. The quinine was so bitter that the British in the early 19th Century began mixing the powder with soda and sugar, and a basic tonic water was created. The first commercial tonic water was produced in 1858. Gin and Tonic also originated in British colonial India, when the British population would mix their medicinal quinine tonic with their favourite gin or to create Vodka Tonic.
India Pale Ale
Way back in the 18th Century, European traders visited India through the East India Company. They brought with them a pale ale brewed by George Hodgson in his Bow Brewery located on the Middlesex-Essex border. It came to be known as India Pale Ale (IPA) and was brewed from pale malt.
The ale became a permanent fixture in English pubs and taverns too. So popular did it become that a brewery was established near the East India docks in East London. IPAs have a long history in Canada and the United States too, and many breweries there produce a version of the beer. 
Some of the most widely seen examples include Brewdog Punk IPA, Thornbridge Jaipur IPA, Oakham Green Devil IPA, and Fuller’s Bengal Lancer IPA. To conform to the style, Modern British IPAs should be in the range 40-60 IBU with alcohol in the range 5% to 8%. 
The modern incarnation is described as a moderately-strong, very well-attenuated pale British ale with a dry finish and a hoppy aroma and flavour.
Indian Single Malt
The Indian whiskey brand, Officer’s Choice, sold an astonishing 400 million bottles all over the globe in 2015. 
In recent years, the very Indian-sounding Amrut has made waves around the globe in the single malt category. Although discerning whiskey aficionados traditionally would choose Scotch and Scottish Single Malts, India’s craft distilling culture has also earned a reputation for the whiskey it is making for international consumption. 
Neelkanth Rao Jagdale produced Amrut Fusion Single Malt, made of 50% Indian barley and 50% peated barley from Scotland, and the world of whiskey took note.
Leading whiskey expert Jim Murray, in his Whisky Bible of 2010, named Amrut Fusion the third best single malt whiskey in the world, and declared it to be “one of the best malts ever made anywhere in the world”.
Indian whiskeys are made primarily out of molasses. Single malt is a new avatar for Indian brewers, but popular brands such as Amrut, Rampur and Paul John are making the Indian presence felt in foreign countries. Such Indian craft whiskeys are described as fruity, toasty, honey-like and cinnamon flavoured.
While the climatic conditions in Scotland and India are very different, the single malt in our country matures faster. But, Indian single malt whisky must be matured for a minimum of three years and a day in oak casks and must be the produce of a single distillery.

Bottle it up: Review of Frozen Bottle
","It was a busy day at work and what I needed was to indulge in something sweet. I decided to check out Frozen Bottle, the newly opened thick shake store. I found it tucked in a by-lane of Race Course, and thankfully, it was not crowded. The place was well lit and framed photographs of the shakes hung on the brown walls.
The menu had an array of milkshakes and ice-cream jars with flavours like Kesar Badam, Kiwi Krush, Oreo Cheesecake and Banana Gulkand. They also offered two sugar-free shakes in: Cold Coffee and Nutty Vanilla. After much deliberation, I went for the classic butterscotch milkshake, while my friend chose a Season’s Special Shortcake ice cream jar. “It is mango in this season,” said the person behind the counter, as he took our order. 




A filled-to-the-brim glass jar and a bottle arrived at our table without much delay. “These bottles are yours. You can take them with you if you want,” we were informed. My milkshake was thick with a thin layer of froth on top. I took a tentative sip; it had the right amount of sweetness. The ice cream jar had three layers: sponge cake, mango ice-cream and mango pulp. I tried it and was reminded of the fresh fruit. We ordered three milkshakes — Loving Litchi, Spicy Guava and Garden Strawberry — as a take away. The packaging was in glass bottles too and we walked out of the store happily holding on to the pretty bottles.
The litchi shake had a strong flavour of the fruit but was overpoweringly sweet. The Strawberry was nice but just standard; nothing special. The spicy guava was the best where the taste of the fruit could be relished with each sip and that the spiciness of the red chilly lingered as an after taste. It was almost like eating a slice of guava sprinkled with red chilli powder. 
As for the empty bottle I took home, a money plant now grows in it; while it graces the kitchen shelf in the home of my friend. 
Suggestions
The only downers were the plastic spoons and straws. Steel spoons are an option for the ice cream jars. For those customers who wish to take their bottles away, it would be nice to have a place to rinse them out.
Info you can use
Their range starts from ₹139. 
Frozen Bottle is at 127, Thiruganasambandam Road, Race Course.

Wai Kiki: a Polynesian promise of warm flavours "," When I first got word of Wai Kiki opening in the city, I was sceptical. What would Hyderabad do with a Polynesian place; and we’re not talking about the likes of Tiki Shack, this place promised to be authentic to its core. Naturally, I was prepared for some form of cultural appropriation be it the decor and ambience or the food. 


But I was taken aback upon stepping into Wai Kiki earlier this week. The interiors are set in hues of brown, blue and yellow, with a few pieces of large Tiki-style artwork peppering the walls. There’s a waterfall feature down a glass wall that provides more of an audio experience rather than a gimmicky photo opportunity. And best of all, the servers aren’t dressed in shirts with larger-than-life flowers. Wai Kiki’s interiors aren’t garish or a mockery of a beautiful culture and that was a thumbs up for me. 
According to the team at Wai Kiki, the concept had been in the making and planning for a few years, thanks to the hotel’s general manager who wanted to give Hyderabad a slice of something truly different. He then snagged Chef Manoj Kumar who previously worked at the Polynesian franchise Trader Vic’s in Dubai, so rest assured you’re getting the good stuff.




Drinks and dining galore
Usually, when we think of Hawaii or other Polynesian states, our palates’ memories are geared towards fruity and colourful drinks– but Wai Kiki has way more on offer. I indulged on a Wai Kiki Tuk from their Freshinis segment, a well-balanced blend of whiskey, Triple sec and grenadine served in a blue tiki-style cup and the right amount of ice. Yes, the amount of ice is extremely important; too much and the flavour dies faster than a mayfly. 
For group settings, there are sharer cocktails available all served in glazed Tiki-style cups and bowls of various sizes and starting at ₹1300, how can any party resist?
At first, the menu for Wai Kiki seems small but given the heartily generous portion sizes, there are options. After all, the heart of Polynesian cuisine isn’t just the flavour profile but also the shareable platters for that family connection. 




Served the Island TidBits first, I was pleased by the sight of various textures of the nibbles available, from the glistening pork strips and the crispy and juicy-looking prawns to the succulent chicken satay to the crunch crab rangoon and cheese balls. These went great with the drink on hand, ideal for that pre-dinner chat up. The crab meat within the parcels was silky and delicately seasoned while the pork strips sang a yummy song in my mouth. And just as Chef said, as the food moves through your mouth, while there’s not a lot of spice there will be bursts of flavour. 
What followed was the Kalua Manu, a set of barbecue chicken skewers served with vegetables and mashed potato. The succulence of the chicken is preserved, but be sure to let the culinary team drape the barbecue sauce over the skewers prior to serving, trust me. 
For the coconut aficionados out there, don’t let the signature Polynesian Princess go untried; the dish is an amalgam of shrimp, chicken and vegetables in an indulgent coconut sauce. The coconut, for Polynesian culture, is helmed as the ‘tree of life’ and rightfully so if this dish alone is justification.
 


The Wai Kiki is also worth a try if you’re one for a little spice; a noodle basket that slowly blooms open with the steaming vegetables, shrimp and chicken sitting in it. From first to last bite, this is the perfect sharer dish.
And one dish that’s worth the trip over is the dessert; cinnamon and orange jus crepes prepared before your eyes. I’m not a citrus-lover but this finisher warmed me up on a rainy and gloomy day. 
Ultimately, don’t expect the food at Wai Kiki to satisfy cravings for hot and spicy dishes because that’s not what the cuisine itself offers, and Chef Manoj is adamant about that.

What happens when you buy, cook and eat produce found only in your locality
"," Some months ago, I made scarlet-tinted juice with fresh kokum fruit, and sent the photograph to a friend. We got talking, and I told her about the locally-grown vegetables I keep discovering in little markets in Mangaluru, where I live, after many years of shopping in big city grocery stores. “You should do an Indian version of the 100-mile diet,” she texted back. 
That got me started on a five-month experiment where I decided to eat only food grown in and around Mangaluru, thus learning not just about local, seasonal ingredients, but also how to cook, eat and appreciate them. In the influential book, The 100-Mile Diet: A Year of Local Eating, Alisa Smith and JB MacKinnon of Canada elaborate on their experiment from March 2005 to February 2006, eating only food grown within 100 miles of their home.
The diet struck a chord with many. It not only promoted a more responsible living, but also provided an opportunity to sample the bounty of food grown in a set geographical area. When I lived in Delhi and Chennai earlier, though I did make the effort to buy some organic food from farmers’ markets, I didn’t really think about provenance and food miles. 
However, I was forced to confront these issues in Mangaluru, where squash is gnarly, snake gourd ashen and amaranth leaves overly-fibrous, as locals let the plant mature since they prefer the thick stem to tender leaves. Okra — pale, long and slender — is plentiful, as is the region’s signature brinjal, Udupi mattu gulla, given a GI tag in 2011, and available in abundance from May to October. 
But how much okra and brinjal can a person eat? I was soon to find out.




When a friend mentioned a Sunday farmers’ market three kilometres from home, I made my way there and found juicy banana stem, tender greens, jeegujje (breadfruit), and a local sour fruit called bimbli (cucumber tree), all grown within a 60-kilometre radius. Slowly, I started cooking local.
Admittedly, the shift is not easy, but neither is it impossible. I began with vegetables, and some staples. Roundels of fresh turmeric and bimbli turned into a fragrant, colourful pickle. Breadfruit was used in every possible form — steamed, baked, stir-fried and even fried with batter. 
It took some time to get used to the sticky texture of basale soppu (Malabar spinach) and the idea of cooking the plump stem of matured amaranth, instead of its tender leaves. But they quickly replaced stock staples: potato, double beans, carrot, beetroot and capsicum. Onions, garlic and tomatoes were available occasionally, and I learnt to stock up. 




Until the monsoon set, my shopping bag consisted of the following: two bunches of red and green greens, and as many of spinach. A pack of raw jackfruit slices to cook with soaked legumes, a bundle of butter beans, shiny green matti gulla, a brinjal variety intrinsic to the eponymous village near Udupi, scarlet pink alasande (long beans), slender striped ivy gourd, kesuvina gedde (a local variety of taro root), pale green foot-long lady’s fingers, a native variety, and some doddapatre (ajwain leaves). For dessert: papaya, pineapple, gaali baale bananas and egg fruit (canistel). 
For juice, I’d pop two packs of fresh kokum fruit and passion fruit into my basket. A handful of colourful bird’s eye chillies and three lemons completed the list.
I now stock up on native rice varieties and locally grown pulses, native tamarind, kokum and byadgi chillies besides farm-ginned coconut and gingelly oil. The milk comes from a dairy where Gir cattle is raised; I churn butter and extract ghee.
Mundi gedde (alocasia family) partly compensates for potato, and foot-long butter beans (just six for a family of three!) for double beans. I make the monsoon staple thambli, using everything from guava leaves to betel leaves toasted with spices, ground and stirred into curd.




Most importantly, I’ve learnt to eat like a local. Red and brown rice instead of white, except for when my love for dal powder with ghee is too strong to overcome. I’ve learnt to keep my eyes open at the santhe (fair) and ask questions. The farmers pass on recipes even while weighing your produce. You try them out, because next week, he or she wants to know how the curry made using the two purple brinjals you bought, tasted. (I now buy three kilograms of brinjal a week, for sambar, poriyal and bhajjis!)
The best part about this change is that there really are no rules, only choices. A choice is easier to stick to. You adapt to seasons and palates, minus the guilt.

Bakey’s edible cutlery allows you to eat with them, then gobble them up "," Narayana Peesapaty’s phone rings incessantly. Taking a break from the calls he says, “Enquiries about the product and machinery keep me busy all day. Even while I am at the factory, my staff and I get very little time to do any other work. ” Some of these phone calls are to congratulate Peesapaty for the Swachh Bharat Award, which he received on June 23 from Prime Minister Narendra Modi, on the occasion of World Environment Day. 




Apart from the congratulatory messages, some calls are enquiries for a product Peesapaty’s brand, Bakey’s, manufactures — edible cutlery. The unique cutlery is made mixing jowar (sorghum) with rice flour and wheat flour. He uses jowar only because unlike ragi and other millets, which have an overpowering taste, jowar is fairly neutral and allows different flavours to be mixed in. 
One year and many kilograms of millets later, Peesapaty, with the help of his wife, was able to successfully get the right recipe to make the spoons. Finally, in 2016, Bakey’s took shape. Baking the dough at 280° Celsius for 28 minutes makes them tough enough to even spoon up soup with. Peesapaty thought about this cutlery first by accident while he was 5000 metres above sea level. “I was on a business trip and had packed jowar rotis. I forgot all about it. Then, when hunger pangs began, I reached for my food. I don’t like in-flight meals. My jowar roti had hardened. It was brittle, but still edible. I slowly began scooping the curry with the pieces, thus making me aware of what can be done to avoid disposable spoons,” says Peesapaty.




He realised the solution was not simple. His obsession with finding an alternative to disposable cutlery had two angles. “Apart from harming the environment, do we really know how disposable spoons are disposed of in reality? If they are all really being disposed of, then spoon piles should be as big a concern as discarded sanitary napkins. But no one talks about single-use spoon piles. Why? Because, often, they are not disposed of,” asserts Peesapaty. 
To double-check this theory, not only did he wade through garbage, but even started sneaking into catered events to get first-hand information. “I made my way to the ‘service’ section of the function hall. I saw that while food and other things were being discarded, the spoons were separated and put in a bowl of water. When I enquired about it, the staff said ‘the spoon will be washed and reused. It is the supervisor’s instruction’. Still not convinced? Wipe a disposable spoon with your finger or a tissue paper, or drop them in a bowl of water. You will observe a thin film of oil floating in the water,” he says.
Another concern is depleting ground water levels and the presence of chemicals in them. “Millets use less water than rice. The dry belt of Telangana was mainly cultivated for millets. Rice was aspirational because it was consumed by the rich. But once the farmers grew rice, they came into the trap of fertilizer companies, because dry lands do not yield good produce. Everyone wants to make a profit, so the use of fertilizers has become rampant,” says Peesapaty, explaining why he was determined to engineer his product specifically with millets. 




The cutlery also serves the purpose of promoting millets for consumption. As a result, “Farmers get encouraged to cultivate millets, which require very less water,” explains Peesapaty. Bakey’s sources the jowar millet locally from Telangana. 
The crisp spoons taste like thick baked rice crisps. They need a strong bite with the molar to break and chew them. The spoons, if not bitten, do not dilute the taste or flavour of the curry you are having. Bakey’s has sweet and savoury varieties as of now, and a team of 27 people are working on other flavours like chocolate as well, in the factory at Dilsukhnagar in Hyderabad. They are also looking at decreasing the current waiting period of two months.
“The demand and feedback the world over are overwhelming, and the company is taking care of delivery logistics on its own to keep costs down,” he says.

A dose of health "," Stop me if you have heard this before, but health is wealth. Or, at least, that’s what many of my friends seem to believe. I am being flooded with suggestions on healthy living and being introduced to food with high health quotients. I am not really complaining, for I have come to the conclusion that healthy food doesn’t taste bad at all. Taken in small amounts, that is! 
It was with a halo over my head that I agreed to a friend’s suggestion that we meet at a small place called Minerals in the DDA sports complex in Asiad Village. I was told it had two USPs: the food was light and tasty, and the surroundings were beautiful. 
Both turned out to be true. Minerals is fairly new. If you are on Khel Gaon Road, coming from India Gate, turn left at the Siri Fort crossing. Minerals is right at the end and is open to all. We went there one weekend and found the place bustling with life. 
Lively ambience
A lot of people stop there after doing their regular exercises at the sports complex. We took a table by the window, and I was struck by the greenery all around. There were too many people being overly active all around me (walking, jogging and doing other such unspeakable things), but I felt at peace when I saw the green expanse. I sipped my coffee and looked at the menu.
We asked for a plate of grilled egg sandwiches (₹180), French toast (₹95 for single; 155 for double) and assorted vegetable poha (₹125). 
We thought we’d have idlis (₹75) or vegetable-stuffed idlis (₹99) but they had just finished a batch, and the new one would have taken some time. We asked for cold coffee and fresh coconut water along with the food.
I had a grilled egg sandwich after a long time and enjoyed it thoroughly. French toast, again, is a favourite of mine, but in our house it is cooked in two ways – a sweet version with cinnamon that the other family members like, and my kind, which is savoury and has onions. This was a mix of the two, mildly sweet and salty, and quite nice. 
Wholesome dish
 


But what I enjoyed the most was the poha, which was light and fluffy and great to eat. Poha, if not cooked well, can be either soggy or too dry. This was just right.
There are other interesting items on the menu, which has various kinds of fresh juices, snacks and soups and salads. 
The menu includes tomato and basil soup (₹79), lemon and coriander soup (₹ 89), hummus and pita (₹159), sprout salad (₹95), lemony chickpea salad (₹175) and Caesar salad (₹195). It has a vegetable club sandwich (₹125), paneer and salsa tortilla wrap (₹175) and different kinds of Blue Tokai coffees.
I liked Minerals. The traffic was light that day, and we cruised our way there for our early lunch. I tried not to look at all the men in their shorts and tees, drinking their orange juice after a heavy work-out, and instead concentrated on the picturesque green lawn outside. I’d had my dose of health.

Herpes virus linked to Alzheimer’s
","Scientists have found evidence of a link between herpes infection and Alzheimer’s disease as well as the potential of antivirals in reducing the risk of the neurodegenerative disease.
In the study, when people who suffered with severe herpes infection were treated aggressively with antiviral drugs, the relative risk of dementia was reduced by a factor of 10.
Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) infects most humans in their youth or later and remains in the body for life in dormant form, within the peripheral nervous system. 
A study by Taiwanese epidemiologists shows that herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV1) leads to an increased risk of developing the disease, said researchers from the University of Manchester.
In a commentary, reported in the Journal of Alzheimer’s Disease on the three articles, the team argued that they provide the strongest evidence yet for a causal link between herpes infection and Alzheimer’s. 
“I believe we are the first to realise the implications of these striking data on this devastating condition which principally affects the elderly. No effective treatments are yet available,” said professor Ruth Itzhaki. 
“But we believe that these safe and easily available antivirals may have a strong part to play in combating the disease in these patients.

The canvas of health care
"," 
A media report recently highlighted how the supply of a vital, life-saving drug has dried up ever since the Indian drug pricing regulator slashed its price by a tenth. These medicines were meant for babies suffering from heart ailments. 
There is no doubt that when price control is imposed on medicines and other medical technologies, it is done with the best intentions — to make them affordable. However, when framing policy, addressing a problem in its totality rather than in bits and pieces is more likely to yield dividends for the intended beneficiary. In health care, this means having to address not just affordability but also the issues of quality, safety and access.
The shortage of the drug referred to earlier illustrates this. With smaller doses now unavailable, desperate parents are being forced to administer a fraction of the adult dose to their children and not always correctly. In other words, lowering the price of the drug to a point where fair competition has not prevailed has resulted in the choice available to a consumer being compromised. Not only has it denied access but also promoted unsafe practices, in turn affecting patient safety.
Let us take the issue of access next. The prices of heart stents were cut steeply last year. The problem of stenting however is not just about price. It is that not all those who need it know that they do. Nor can they access it easily. According to a study, 70% of cath labs where stenting procedures are performed, are in metros and Tier-1 cities where just 15% of the population resides. There are also issues of access beyond cities, such as the lack of diagnostic facilities and skill sets among primary-care physicians to interpret medical reports. Lowering prices has had no impact on the uneven distribution of interventional cardiologists, cath labs and other infrastructure and health-care resources across urban and non-urban areas. Without equitable access, will all those who require stenting be able to receive them unless they forego their income and come to these cities for treatment? The answer is no. We must examine all such issues, answers to which will improve accessibility rather than price control. 
 
Does the pricing policy reward investment in quality and improve choice? Not really. In the case of stents, for instance, whether a product is the result of patient-centric innovation or plain-vanilla reverse engineering, it is awarded the same price. An innovation that makes it easier to implant a stent and cuts procedure time is still priced as much as any other in its category. This discourages innovators from making such technologies available in India even to those who can afford them.
In short, price control ends up as a short-term measure to bring down costs of only specific consumables, and for the benefit of certain sections of the population who are in a position to access health care.
The government considers some of these price control measures as a stellar achievement. This is understandable in cases where the benefit has been passed on to the patient. However, this is not automatic. A reduction in the overall cost of stenting packages by hospitals does not reflect the steep drop in stent prices as there have been compensatory increases elsewhere in the package. Similarly, hospitals can even replace products that have passed stringent regulatory standards set by regulators with those that are designed to meet lower standards.
The government needs to introspect on what would best serve the interests of a patient in the long term. The answer lies in an approach that looks at all aspects of health care as threads of an interwoven fabric. From a pricing perspective this could mean controlling trade margins instead of capping retail price so that the benefit of any reduction does reach a patient. India boasts of the world’s highest intermediary cost, rather than a lean trade margin, which makes products expensive and scarce. Research by the pricing regulator has shown that profits made by hospitals and distributors on health-care consumables are beyond acceptable levels — and partly responsible for overall pharma/medical price inflation. Capping such profits will ensure affordability without the accompanying compromise on patient safety and an availability of quality products.

Rethinking the risks
"," 
Obesity on its own isn’t a killer. A study by researchers at York University’s Faculty of Health, Canada, has found that patients with metabolic healthy obesity, but no other metabolic risk factors, do not have an increased rate of mortality. The results could force a rethink in how medicine and health consultants view weight management and obesity, according to Jennifer Kuk, associate professor, School of Kinesiology and Health Science, who led the research team.
“This is in contrast with most of the literature and we think this is because most studies have defined metabolic healthy obesity as having up to one metabolic risk factor,” Dr. Kuk told Science Daily. 
“This is clearly problematic, as hypertension alone increases your mortality risk and past literature would have called these patients with obesity and hypertension, ‘healthy’. This is likely why most studies have reported that ‘healthy’ obesity is still related with higher mortality risk.”
Medical literature says that obesity — as a high mortality risk — is in the same league as dyslipidemia, hypertension or diabetes alone. Dr. Kuk and colleagues say this isn’t true.
The categories
In their study, they analysed profiles from 54,089 men and women from five cohort studies who were categorised as having obesity alone or clustered with a metabolic factor; elevated glucose, blood pressure or lipids alone, or clustered with obesity or another metabolic factor. Researchers looked at how many people within each group died as compared to those within the normal weight population with no metabolic risk factors.
Current weight management guidelines suggest that anyone with a body mass index over 30 kg/m2 should lose weight. This implies that if you have obesity (even without any other risk factors) it makes you unhealthy. In their report published in the journal, Clinical Obesity, they found that 1 out of 20 individuals with obesity had no other metabolic abnormalities.
“We’re showing that individuals with metabolically healthy obesity are actually not at an elevated mortality rate. We found that a person of normal weight with no other metabolic risk factors is just as likely to die as the person with obesity and no other risk factors,” says Dr. Kuk. “This means that hundreds of thousands of people with metabolically healthy obesity will be told to lose weight, when it’s questionable how much benefit they’ll actually receive.”
Indian context
 Obesity is major concern in India. The prevalence of obesity is increasing and ranges from 8% to 38% in rural and 13% to 50% in urban areas, according to the Indian Heart Journal. Obesity is a risk factor for development of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), hypertension, dyslipidemia, coronary heart disease and many cancers. In Asian Indians, excess abdominal and hepatic fat is associated with increased risk for T2DM and cardiovascular disease.

Burning calories with the pooch
"," 
Walking a dog can be fine exercise. But many people do not have access to a dog, and many of those who do choose not to walk them.
Two small new studies, however, may offer novel ways to promote dog walking and its myriad benefits, even to people without dogs. But the results also indicate that there can be substantial barriers to using a pet to improve your health.
Anyone who owns a dog, which includes me, knows that most of them yearn to go on walks, whatever the time or weather. If I skip our usual morning jog, my dogs flop onto the floor, disconsolate and reproachful.
The walk would be good for all of us. According to recent studies, adults who often walk a dog are more likely than those who do not to meet the standard exercise recommendation of about 150 minutes a week of moderate physical activity. Well-exercised dogs also tend to be leaner and better behaved than sedentary canines.
But nearly 40% of dog owners almost never walk their dogs, other studies show.
Concerned by that statistic, Katie Becofsky, a professor of kinesiology at the University of Massachusetts in Amherst, U.S., and dog owner, began to wonder recently whether it might be possible and worthwhile to essentially trick people into walking their dogs more often.
So for one of the new studies, which was presented in June at the annual meeting of the American College of Sports Medicine in Minneapolis, U.S., she and her colleagues invited a group of about 30 local dog owners who reported rarely walking their dogs to join a special dog obedience class. 
The owners were told that the programme was designed to improve their dogs’ behaviour while leashed, but the surreptitious goal was to see if the classes could also increase the owners’ dog walking and physical activity after the instruction had ended.
To that end, half of the group began six weeks of instruction while others were wait-listed as a control group. The participants attended classes with their dogs several times a week, kept a log about extracurricular dog walks and wore an activity monitor, ostensibly to record those walks. The researchers asked them to continue to record any walks and wear the activity monitor occasionally for an additional six weeks after the classes ended.
The logs and monitors showed that people in the class did start to walk their dogs for a few minutes more each week than the control group, both during and after the six weeks of classes. Surprisingly, though, those minutes did not increase the owners’ overall weekly exercise totals. 
Dr. Becofsky might have been disappointed with the results, she says, but suspects that one factor was that the programme collided with a particularly intractable East Coast obstacle: the weather. The study took place during a prolonged period of rain and cold in the area, she says, so the increase in participants’ dog-walking time, while small, was notable.
More important, she says, most of the class participants reported feeling closer to their dogs and happier with their behaviour afterward.
“We know from other research that the best predictor of dog walking is feeling a strong bond with your dog,” she says.
She plans to conduct a larger study, she says, again featuring obedience classes but this time being open about the programme’s intent to increase owners’ physical activity. She’s also planning separately to study dogs’ self-chosen movement patterns, on a leash and off, using activity monitors made for dogs. 
Much potential
 “Dog walking has so much potential to inspire more physical activity,” she says. 
That possibility extends even to people who do not own dogs, according to the other new study, which looked at dogs and pedestrianism. Also presented at the American College of Sports Medicine’s annual meeting, it involved college students, a group notorious for their inactivity. Many collegians exercise seldom, if ever, studies show, often blaming time constraints and academic demands. 
To bypass those barriers, researchers at East Carolina University in Greenville, N.C., U.S., created a for-credit physical education class centered on dog walking. Students who enrolled in the class visited the local animal shelter twice a week for 50 minutes and walked one of the shelter dogs in a nearby park while wearing a pedometer.
The gadgets’ data showed that the students were averaging around 4,500 steps, or about two and a quarter miles of walking, during each session with a dog.
“Most of them were surprised that they were walking so much,” says Melanie Sartore-Baldwin, a professor at E.C.U. who led the study.
“They said that the time had gone quickly and they hadn’t really felt as if they were exercising,” she says. Many also reported side benefits. “They told us that the dogs had seemed so happy about the walks, which had made them feel better about themselves and the whole experience,” Dr. Sartore-Baldwin says.
There were complaints, of course, she adds. The class began at 9 a.m., which the students considered punishingly early, and were required to continue whatever the weather. But few students skipped any sessions, and the class currently has an enrolment waiting list, she says. She also is working with other universities that are looking to incorporate dog walking into their P.E. programmes.
“There’s something very appealing about spending time with a dog who is so delighted to see you,” she says, “and getting in an easy 4,500 steps before 10 a.m.” NY TIMES

‘Cos now I’m living on green power: An ode to the green guava
","At a recent wedding, there was a surprise element on our vazha yellais. A chutney made with green guava by a local caterer. An appetising green in colour, it was smooth, creamy and delicious. It had the sour flavour that one associates with chaat.
It is now a sought-after item at wedding feasts and the credit goes to Madhampatty Rangaraj for not just developing the recipe but for getting me to think about using the green guava as a veggie option. 
The guava may have originated in Central America but after hundreds of years in the Indian subcontinent, it is considered local. When it comes to nutrition, the guava is to Asia what the apple is to the west. Guavas contain possibly the highest amount of Vitamin C present in fruits. They are equally rich in Vitamin A, manganese, which helps the body absorb other essecinal nutrients, and folate, which is necessary for conception and growth of the foetus.
Yet it is not a fruit that is found as often as some others at our homes. This may have something to do with the fact that it isn’t used much in cakes, pies or even salads. While I have heard of guava jellies, squashes and jams, I wonder how much of the actual fruit goes into making these condiments. Also given that these products are pink/peach in colour, they are probably made using the pink strawberry guava rather than the green, which are easier to find here.
The country variety ranges from a small one with dark green flesh to bigger ones that with a paler green exterior. I wasn’t too fond of the guava especially because of the seeds that wouldn’t break, no matter how hard they were bitten. 
With guavas in season now and available everywhere here, the first dish I experimented with was, of course, the chutney. I didn’t want to ask the caterer for his secret recipe but going by the taste, I used onion, green chillies, tamarind, turmeric powder, rock salt and a few coriander leaves. In went the chopped guava, seeds and all, because discarding the latter meant losing so much flesh. Once it was all blended together, we had to strain the chutney. The smooth purée was tempered with dried red chillies, curry leaves and mustard seeds. One taste and I was supremely happy.
With the rainy weather we’re having, a warm green guava soup is next on the agenda. And a koyakkai rasam maybe?

Three in five HIV-carriers now have access to drugs: UN ","Almost three in five people infected with HIV, or 21.7 million globally, took antiretroviral therapy in 2017 — a new record for anti-AIDS drug access, the UNAIDS said on Wednesday.
There were 36.9 million people living with the immune system-attacking virus in 2017, of whom 15.2 million were not getting the drugs they need — the lowest number since the epidemic exploded, the joint UN programme on HIV/AIDS reported.
Hailing progress in curbing new infections and deaths, the agency nevertheless lamented the mounting human toll: almost 80 million infections and 35.4 million lives lost since the first cases became known in the early 1980s.
Progress made to date risks being halted, even reversed, if funding and world attention is allowed to dwindle, the agency warned.
Mission 2020
“We are short by $7 billion per year to maintain our results and to achieve our objectives for 2020,” UNAIDS executive director Michel Sidibe said. “Without these resources, there is a big risk of the epidemic rebounding, of an increase in mortality due to AIDS,” he said.
In 2017, about $20.6 billion was available for AIDS programmes in low-and middle-income countries which funded about 56% from their own budgets, said the report.
Under Donald Trump, the U.S. administration — a major funder of AIDS programmes historically, has threatened to cut spending.
The UN goal is for 90% of all HIV-positive people to know their status by 2020. Of these, at least 90% must receive ART, and the HIV virus be suppressed in 90% of those.
Assessing progress towards the target, UNAIDS said 1.8 million people became newly infected with HIV in 2017.
This was down from about 1.9 million the year before, and 3.4 million at the peak of the epidemic in 1996. 
Deaths declined from 9,90,000 to 9,40,000 year-on-year, compared to 1.9 million in 2005 and 1.4 million in 2010.
Antiretroviral therapy
The number of people on antiretroviral therapy (ART) grew from 19.4 million in 2016 to 21.7 million last year — up from a mere 6,11,000 in the year 2000 and 2.1 million in 2005, said the report released in the run-up to the International AIDS Conference in Amsterdam next week.
This helped boost the number of people living with the virus from 36.3 million in 2016 to 36.9 million last year.
Despite more than three decades of research, there is no cure or vaccine and HIV-positive people have to take lifelong treatment that can be expensive and have nasty side-effects.
ART inhibits the virus and can limit its spread between people — mainly through sex — but does not kill it.
UNAIDS reported large variation between world regions in the battle against the killer virus.
In the West Asia and north Africa, for example, less than a third of people with HIV have access to ARV, only 36% of those in eastern Europe and central Asia, and 40% in west and central Africa. For west and central Europe and North America, the number is 78%, with about 1.7 million out of 2.2 million infected people on ARV, said UNAIDS. In east and southern Africa — home to 53% of people living with HIV in the world — deaths declined by 42% from 2010 to 2017, thanks largely to the widespread rollout of treatment.
However, “there has been no reduction in AIDS-related mortality in eastern Europe and central Asia since 2010, and deaths from AIDS-related illness increased by 11% in the West Asia and North Africa,” it cautioned.

India still lags behind in routine immunization programme: WHO-UNICEF report
","In 2017, an estimated 19.9 million infants worldwide were not reached with routine services such as three doses of diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP vaccine). Around 60 per cent of these children live in 10 countries — Afghanistan, Angola, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, India, Indonesia, Iraq, Nigeria, Pakistan and South Africa.


This according to the most recent World Health Organisation and UNICEF immunization estimates released this week.
The report further noted that global vaccination coverage — the proportion of the world’s children who receive recommended vaccines — has remained the same over the past few years. It added that since 2015, the percentage of children who received their full course of three dose diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP3) routine immunizations is sustained at 85 per cent (116.2 million infants).
Although global immunization coverage with DTP3 remains at 85 per cent, it is important to highlight that an additional 4.6 million infants have been vaccinated globally in 2017 compared to 2010, due to global population growth.
The report highlighted that more concerted efforts needed to reach universal immunization coverage.
As per the figures released — an estimated 20 million additional children need to be vaccinated with DTP3; 45 million additional children need to be vaccinated with a second dose of measles vaccine and 76 million more children need to be vaccinated with 3 doses of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine.
“Of the 19.9 million infants who are not fully vaccinated with DTP3, almost 8 million (40 per cent) live in fragile or humanitarian settings, including countries affected by conflict. And about 5.6 million of them live in just three countries — Afghanistan, Nigeria and Pakistan — where access to routine immunization services is critical to achieving and sustaining polio eradication.
Meanwhile, newly available vaccines are being added as part of the life-saving vaccination package — such as those to protect against meningitis, malaria and even Ebola. Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most common viral infection of the reproductive tract, and can cause cervical cancer, other types of cancer, and genital warts in both men and women. In 2017, the HPV vaccine was introduced in 80 countries.
“On the other hand, vaccines to prevent against major killers of children such as rotavirus, a disease that causes severe childhood diarrhoea, and pneumonia have been around for over a decade. But the use of rotavirus and pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV) is lagging behind. In 2017, global coverage was only 28 per cent for rotavirus and 44 per cent for PCV. Vaccination against both these diseases has the potential to substantially reduce deaths of children under 5 years of age, a target of the Sustainable Development Goals,’’ noted the report.

Feasting Bhojpuri style "," More than a particular dish, it’s the warm, spicy and sinus-clearing vapours of roasted garlic and mustard oil that immediately makes me think of ‘ma ke haath ka khana’. This is not an aroma that is easily found outside of a Bihari home. This fact was true until last weekend. One whiff of the mustard-garlic combination in the roasted tomato chutney at Neel’s (Tote on the Turf) ‘Experience Magadh’ food pop-up and I felt like I was home.
Home-style menu
 Curated by Authenticook and chef Chandana, this was the first time I experienced Bihari food in a Mumbai restaurant. The pop-up, which will be available on this weekend as well, features Bihari favourites like litti (wheat balls stuffed with roasted gram flour, tempered with mustard oil and onions) served with aloo chokha, baigan chokha, tamatar bharta and copious amounts of hot ghee, aloo parwal bhujiya and malpua. But it’s little-known dishes like oal ka chokha (spicy yam mash) bhabhra (peas and kala channa fritters), kathal ki tarkari (jackfruit cooked in mustard oil), besan ki machli (a unique vegetarian dish of fluffy besan cake simmered in a thin gravy) and dehati mutton (a slow-cooked mutton dish) that made the trek to Mahalaxmi on a rain-soaked afternoon worth it.
Very little is known about Bhojpuri cuisine outside the state. The only dedicated Bihari restaurant I have been to is Potbelly in Delhi. While there are a handful of obscure litti-chokha stalls in the city, it’s the in-home dining experience offered by homechefs like Chandana that is familiarising Mumbaikars with the cuisine.
Joy of cooking
 I rediscovered my love for the food of my childhood last year when I chanced upon chef Pallavi Nigam Sahay’s cookbook, The Bhojpuri Kitchen. From the basic dahi choora gud to the more exotic parwal ki mithai, the cookbook has it all. Sahay, who trained at the Grand Hyatt, Mumbai and received her culinary diploma from ICIF, Italy, was introduced to Bhojpuri food after marriage. Her grandmother-in-law’s first piece of advice to Sahay was ‘masala tel choddne tak bhunjna, dulhin’ (sauté the masala till you see the oil at the edges of the pan) and this was something I’ve heard my mother say a million times in the days when she tried to get me interested in cooking. I just never bothered to listen then, but ever since I got my hands on this cookbook, it’s become a mantra of sorts in my kitchen. 
I’ve tried quite a few different recipes from the book. Papra is a basic besan chilla but with a twist that comes from adding sautéed green peas to the batter. Sahay’s chokha (spicy potato mash) to accompany litti is different from how my mother makes it. Tempering the mashed potatoes with mustard seeds and dried red chilli means that the chokha is not as spicy as I like it but it is ‘good’ different. Other outstanding recipes from the book are a fiery halwai-style mutton curry, choora mattar and malpua.
The recipes appear in seven chapters: comfort food, snacks, curries, bhujias, saags, chutneys and sweets. There is also a chapter on the festivals of Bihar and their culinary significance. Chapters differ in length but the spectrum of the recipes is very wide. Most Bihari food is non-fussy — dishes are quick to assemble and pretty much look after themselves once on the stove.
But if you’d like to discover a taste of Bihar in the heart of Mumbai this weekend, without stirring a finger — just head over to Chef Chandana’s pop-up instead

A food and drink story "," The Urdu word goyaa, refers to the suspension of disbelief that takes place when fantasy is so realistic that it temporarily becomes real. Usually associated with the good powerful storytelling, restauranteur Siddharth Somaiya has chosen it for his new culinary venture.
In a quiet bylane away from the hustle bustle of monsoon traffic and potholes, the narrative begins with an appropriate setting. Designed by Architecture and Design Studio — STaND, Goyyaa has a minimalist approach with high ceilings, cane chairs, clean grey walls and an open kitchen on the far end, sending a message that you can gather around to watch the food being prepared, just as you would at the bar, situated in the centre corner. Behind it, gradient rises with a flight of steps on the side leading to casual seating options. 
Starting out
 Somaiya, who earlier helmed the Bao Haus Co, has roped in his buddy Mariki Sayles a New York friend from his first job). When Sayles came to India, she realised not every ingredient from the United States was available here. So, she set out to find suitable replacements that were available locally. For example when she couldn’t buy the herb gentian, Sayles replaced it with an interesting Ayurvedaic option — chirayta. 
Sayles begins the first chapter of our meal at Goyaa with the Universal Gravitation (₹550), a gin-based drink with apple and toasted fennel. The creaminess of white beer and cool absinthe in the drink pave the way for our first dish, Carrot Mochi (₹400), a carrot dish which presents the vegetable as a doughy dumpling, pickled and roasted form with a vinaigrette tossed in nutty pistachio dukka. 
We are gripped and we move to the next offering. The Sichuan Shrimp (₹300) is cocooned in a lettuce wrap and comes drenched in a coconut sweet potato cream, which transports us to the seaside, and keeps us hooked with its yummy side of mango chilli salsa. 
Main bites
 The Cast Iron Cauliflower (₹ 350) takes us from France to Chennai in one spoonful of mash with dollops of vadouvan butter. The fresh orange slices and a rather chewy toasted sour dough cuts the creaminess of the brown butter - blended with French masala that contains curry powder among 16 other ingredients. At this point, we are floating in a flavourful stupor. We’re surely coming back for this one.
The Pulled Lamb BBQ (₹500) is served with a jalapeno corn bread, smoked in hickory and topped with fried pickles. The jus is way too salty and promptly kills our taste buds. The Pork Belly Burger (₹400) comes with a punch of sundried tomato ketchup, kimchi mayo, but we find the juicy patty a tad too salty, between a brioche bun that is too dry. The Veggie Burger (₹350) is a mouthful of chickpea patty with tzatziki spread and a side of sweet potato fries and packs in a spicy punch. 
The end of every story should leave an imprint , and Sayle has saved No Sugar Tonight (₹550) for last. A cloudy milk punch of whiskey, coffee bean liqueur, fig and clarified milk is stiff, smooth as every liqueur should be, and leaves us with a subtle sweetness of figs on our palate. To keep up with the mood, Somaiya serves us dessert, ’Smore. It is a chocolate lava, drizzled with miso caramel, and whiskey toasted marshmellows.
Despite the hiccups, Goyaa is a story we’d like to read again, for its no-pretence décor, well-crafted cocktails and a soulful food menu.

A twist to Indian desserts
"," 
 We are known for our sweet tooth. And more often than naught, it’s dessert that we pile up high on our plates after our meals, right from melt-in-the-mouth bolis to juicy gulab jamuns or creamy ice creams and fudgy brownies. But, just as the world of fashion sees new trends popping up each year, the culinary world too is constantly evolving, as customers seek to expand their tastebuds. While we have witnessed the union of pizzas and dosas, French fries and masala fries, and kathi rolls and frankies, chefs are now experimenting and transforming traditional desi sweetmeats into gourmet desserts by fusing them with Western recipes.
And if you think the spin-offs served are as limited and as unimaginative as gulab jamuns or gajar ka halwa with ice cream, think again; specialist chefs are now pushing the envelope with their sweet concoctions. So there’s the hot favourite gulab jamun cake, the sponge cake soaked in sugary rose petals and cardamom infused syrup and layered with sliced jamuns; the malpua cheesecake, which fuses star anise flavoured cottage cheese with creamy, luscious cheesecake or, that rasmalai filling hidden in rabri icing and more.




 “Since Indians are fond of everything sweet, and almost everyone has a dessert after a meal, pastry chefs are having a field day experimenting with textures and flavours, trying to one-up each other to serve unique desserts,” says Pastry Chef B. Sunil Kumar of Vivanta by Taj, Vazhuthecaud.
Chef Sunil enjoys playing with ingredients. So he has dipped berry-sized gulab jamuns, not in its conventional rose flavoured sugar syrup, but, in thick, rich chocolate and has stuffed profiteroles, not with the standard cream, or custard, but with rasmalai and mango rabri to name a few. 
While his experimentations with desserts feature mostly during “international food fetes,” or “when a guest requests for a chef’s special,” the dessert counter at The Leela Raviz Kovalam, always features a handful of fusion sweets during their weekend buffets.
Sandeep Sukesan, pastry chef at The Leela, says borrowing Western influences is a great way to introduce our desi sweets to foreigners. He says: “While most diners are open to fusion cuisine, when it comes to desserts, most of them stick to things they know. By serving hybrid desserts such as dry fruit stuffed ravioli with saffron rabri and carrot halwa strudel, you are serving guests something familiar, yet different, to cater to their urge to try something new. These sweet treats are a gateway for people from around the world to savour our delectable range of mithais,” says the chef who has also infused local flavours to foreign desserts such as ilaneer payasam mousse with manganosa and aval vilayichathu in baklava.




But the trend of creating fusion desserts is not limited to star hotels. Home bakers are giving traditional sweets massive makeovers too.
Jasmine Sanumon, a homebaker who has roots in the city and runs Jasmine’s Cake Boutique in Mumbai, says the trend for fusion desserts has been going strong for the last two to three years in Mumbai. “In fact, there are courses and workshops offered in Indo-Western dessert making, here.”
Mithais, she points out, play an important role in any festive occasion in North India. “But as tastebuds go cosmopolitan, the more exposed people are to other cultures, the more variety they seek.”
 Hence, spin-offs of popular Indian sweets such as the rasgula cake and eggless ghulkand cakes, which she feels, began in Mumbai, “the culinary hub of India before it started trickling elsewhere.”
Like a scientist in a laboratory, Jasmine concocts recipes for her “desi sweets with a twist” in her head and tries them out through trial and error. Today her Jasmine’s Cake Boutique, which she operates from her Mumbai home, boasts of gulkhand truffles, rose and betal leaf chocolates, rasmalai cake with rabadi, Indian mithai cake with thandai frosting, gulab jamun mix cookies… besides the regular pastry and baked goodies.




In the city, the trend is however, rather recent and the varieties, limited, with just a handful of homebakers like Anjana John, Nasiya Aysha and Parvathy Ravikumar serving unusual combinations of fluffy cakes and traditional mithais.
Anjana, who specialises in gulab jamun cupcakes, points out how conventional Indian mithais from up North and East are not that popular amongst Malayalis as “we have our own traditional sweet dishes like boli, palada payasam and unniappam, which caters to our tastebuds.” 
So, isn’t introducing such desserts a bit of a gamble?




Parvathy who serves decadent kulfi cakes admits she was hesitant to add the cake to her menu, but is all smiles as customers line up for the kulfi flavour of the season – mango. “There is a plethora of homebakers who serve the usual cakes and bakes out there and so one needs to keep innovating and introducing novelty fares to keep the customers coming. As of now, it’s mostly star hotels in the city that serve fusion desserts, so home bakers like myself, have an edge in the bake field.”
Nasiya points out how customers are gradually open to experimenting with flavours. “Also desserts these days, are all about visual appeal, flavour fusion and the oomph factor, all of which such contemporary desserts have.”
But unlike up North where mithais are easily available, the homebakers in the city have to make their own desi sweets from scratch. “It’s fun,” says Nasiya, who apart from the rasmalai cake and the recently introduced thandai cake, plans to add more hybrid goodies to her repertoire.




But fusion can lead to confusion, and the key in blending culinary worlds, lies, in teaming the right ingredients and in the balance of flavours, says Chef Sunil. “Else, you will have a bittersweet ending to your meal.”
So, borrowing a popular advertisement’s catchphrase, “Kuchh meetha ho jaye?”

What’s cooking in Jonathan’s kitchen "," When it rained like doomsday here earlier this week, my only prayer was that my drive to Jonathan’s Kitchen (JK) doesn’t make me regret it. After an eternity — a long drive, during which all I could think of was a foot massage, I am was offered a refreshing gin and tonic. A sip later, I feel I was ready for the food, no sooner did I think, out came baked Brie coated with pistachio and almond dust. I was too hungry to care about dying from the Brie overload so I went straight ahead and carved out a generous portion and put it in my mouth. If you love cheese, you will definitely love this one; stringy, soft and warm, with the perfect feel in the mouth. The nut-dust coat adds the crunchy bite allowing a bite to the gooey cheese.




Jonathan’s Kitchen is not a new place. Nor is the chef, nor one of the investors called Jonathan — and Jonathan’s Kitchen doesn’t just serve western food. If you want a selection of Indian and Asian, apart from the steaks and burgers, at Jonathan’s kitchen that too is made.
To set the mood for the fuzzy monsoon evenings, the chef has decided to make changes in the menu. Some of these are better versions of bar food and definitely worth considering for binge eating.




Those who love spicy Indianised Asian, should try the chilli fish. I would recommend it with or without a drink. It is spicy enough to conjure up some sweat on your hairline and still not give up on it. Want to raise the bar? Take a bite of the bird-eye chilli with which the fish is garnished.




Personally, I wasn’t sure what was kept for the tasting session, so I went overboard with the fish and still couldn’t refuse the fried soft-shell crabs which I ate effortlessly and heartily.
Then came sushi and it vanished faster than it appeared from the kitchen. The spacious interiors of the restaurant makes one feel very comfortable inside. The ‘no fuss’ interiors make it even easier to make your way to the lavish buffet if one is opting for such a spread.




Apart from the interiors, JK has menu that will caters to a wide variety of diners. Their steaks are popular for the selection of meat and its quality. The seafood selection at JK is worth the drive and if you are in the mood for a lavish Asian meal, then a must-try is the Masamam curry with sticky rice.
Chef is also very proud to say that their menu lays stress on veg selection and it was a welcome to see paneer wasn’t the focus in the veg section.
What's a meal like without desserts? Can’t really say, because the chocolate mousse wasn't something that could be refused. After one spoon of the sticky-gooey dessert, there was nothing more to think about.

All smoked up ","All you crave for on a windy afternoon is a cosy place where you can binge on some piping hot food. That is exactly what the American style pub and restaurant —Plan B offers.
The place is on the second floor of the #13 building on Rhenius Street. We occupy a table right beside a huge open window that gives us a pretty view of green branches swaying gracefully to the sound of the wind, creating its own dance.




The speciality of Plan B is that it offers smoked meat in various avatars. The chef, Thashvin Muckatira, mainly “plays around with pork as “that is my favourite meat and it takes beautifully to the smoked flavour.”
We start off with a few mocktails and chilled beer, which looks gorgeous frothing as it gently runs over a tall glass it is served in. Along with it arrive the starters — smoked winged chicken (marinated chicken wings smoked over charcoal), BBQ pork belly (smoked pork spareribs, glazed with a sweet and spicy sauce), smoked meat tacos (crunchy fried tacos stuffed with smoked meat and coleslaw). The perfectly smoked meat with varied flavours creates a beautiful tingling sensation on your palate which is cooled off with every sip you take of the beer —making it a perfect affair with food.
Then we dig into the main course, which is smoked meat lasagne, beef brisket andouille sausage along with corn on cobs, creamed spinach, garlic toast and spicy coleslaw. These come in the BBQ platter section and are served in style on wooden boards.
The dishes are created by the chef Thashvin, a post graduate in Business Management, who actually started off as an engineer.




“The switch to food happened when I couldn’t drive every day to Whitefield,” recalls the chef. That is the genesis behind the name. ""As taking to cooking was indeed my plan b,” says the man who loves experimenting in his kitchen and adds that his passion for smoked meat began when he lived in the US.
“I went for a five-day training in smoked dishes and took it up as a passion. The toughest part about creating smoked meat is getting the timing and the temperature right. If you are careless, the meat just dries up,” explains Thashvin.
As of now, Plan B does not have in-house desserts as Thashvin wants to create them with pork as one of the main ingredients.
“That will happen soon,” beams the young chef.

The very many avatars of fries "," No longer are fries served as a sidekick to your burger or sandwich. Of late, this comfort food has undergone a makeover, and in its new avatar, finds a place of its own on restaurant menus — sometimes with an entire dedicated section running into pages.




“Fries are one of the most loved and relished comfort foods. Be it an accompaniment to other dishes or something to just munch on with drinks, fries are an all-time favourite. We wanted to expand the offerings by bringing an innovative touch to the classic fries,” says Sanju Arora, General Manager, The Irish House. He adds, “Initially, we just had the classic salted fries, which were extremely popular. Over the years, we introduced more options like garlic fries, sweet potato fries and then, a dedicated section of fries with toppings like Mac n cheese, chicken Bolognese, fried eggs, amongst others.”
Sahil Sabhlok, executive chef, Westin Pune Koregaon Park, opines, “With the advent of ‘progressive’ or ‘avant-garde’ cuisines, cafés and bars have also upped the ante. Potato, that too fried, is an all-time favourite to munch on and soaks up the alcohol well too. To add to it, it is hassle-free and cheap.”
Another reason is exposure to newer cuisines, says Sabhlok, “A few years ago, the dish poutine was unheard of in our menus, but now it is a part of bar menus across the country.”
Creative spree
The array of fries that restaurants today offer is endless — spicy, fiery, dry, loaded with sauces or gravies. Chili’s across India offers Texas cheese fries, which are home-cooked style fries, coated with Texas chilli, melted cheese and jalapeños. The crispy seasoned skin on the fries, tossed in truffle oil and served with truffle aioli sauce, smeared with garlic and freshly sourced herbs, is equally sought after.
Hard Rock Café has hot chilli fries, which are Cajun-spiced and crisp, topped with cheese sauce, sweet chilli drizzle and tangy masala. At The Bombay Fries, the XXXL Fries are served in a pizza box with jalapeños, olives, nachos and sauces. They also offer a Jain option.
Right on top




Chef Sabhlok points out the sheer scope for experimentation. “Chefs can choose to serve waffle fries, curly fries, steak fries, wedges, crinkle cut and potato tornado. The next step is to offer a variety of toppings. While the most popular toppings remain cheese and spice mix, many chefs are offering innovative toppings and dips like wasabi mayo, Indian spices, caramelised onions, sriracha mayo, sour cream and onion, chimichurri... The options are endless.”
Most cities in India, including Tier 2 towns, are now jumping on to the innovative fries bandwagon. While Tall Blonde French in Bengaluru serves Bollywood fries and peri peri fries that perk up your taste buds, The J in Nashik has two pages on their menu dedicated to fries. Popular ones include cheese mayo fries and Thai sweet chilli fries. 
The Independence Brewing Company in Pune, on the other hand, is known for its hand-cut, double-fried, crispy home fries.
Such is the popularity of fries that Sanket Agarwal, Founder, The Bombay Fries, decided to set up a chain of quick-service restaurants (QSRs) serving only fries. With outlets in Mumbai, Pune and Chennai, The Bombay Fries is wowing the palate of the younger crowd. “During my visits to USA, I saw these and was curious about how someone can just sell a side product and be so successful.”
F for Fries in Byculla, Mumbai, again is a small QSR, offering fries of all shapes and types. Their signature, dessert fries white plus dark — topped with chocolate — is a huge hit.
Non-vegetarian toppings range from shredded chicken to bacon and ham. Butter chicken fries and double-decker chicken fries are among the top sellers at Tall Blonde French. 
Sausage fries with smoked sausages at The J, Nashik are extremely popular, as are caramelised onion and grilled sausage fries and bacon and cheese fries at Chennai’s Double Roti. The pulled pork, bacon and cheese-loaded fries at Kolkata’s Macazzo sell at a whopping ₹330 per portion, with many takers. 
Basic shift
If the common potato isn’t your thing, an alternative is sweet potato, a typical choice for fries popularised by Chef Paul Kinny at 212 All Day Café & Bar.
Chef Sabhlok uses various root vegetables, and vegetables like sweet potato, yam, purple yam, beet, carrot, rutabaga, colocasia. At Indigo Deli, the sweet potato fries are served with thecha mayonnaise, giving them a local Maharashtrian twist. 
The Bombay Fries uses a variety of bananas, to create their own special healthy fries, whereas Gateway Taproom does buckwheat fries. So whether you’re a health nut or just looking to gorge, indulging in fries just got way more fun.

South Indian tiffin amidst Delhi's food streets ","What are the first few things that come to mind when we talk about the street food in Delhi? Golgappe? Chole-Bhature? or Bread Pakode? What if we tell you there is a place hidden in Delhi’s streets that serves scrumptious dosas and parottas, idli and upma?
Mathew Café stands inconspicuously among other food shacks on a busy street in the capital. Most of these specialise in a variety of Delhi staples — aloo parathas, kadhi-rice, chole-kulche, paneer–naan... From a distance, the café seems like just any other. It is only when you get closer that the difference unfolds.
I arrive at the café early on a breezy Sunday morning. The place is abuzz, the air heavy with the aroma of sambhar and clouds of steam rising from the dosa griddle. The tables are already occupied by families and about a dozen men and women await their orders. Half a dozen more wait for refills. But none of the men behind the counters seem perturbed.
“To me, Mathew Café is synonymous with South Indian tiffin in Delhi. Whatever be the time of day, you will always get fresh food here. That it is also authentic South Indian fare is an added benefit,” says Simi Nair, a regular. The menu is extensive — dosas, idlis, vadas, pongal, utthapam, parrotta, upma, pulav, coffee, tea — and the pricing inviting. I want to sample everything, but make do with just masala dosa, idli, and kurma parotta.
The dosas come after a long wait. Wrapped around a generous filling of potatoes, they are crisp and golden. They also happen to be the hottest selling item. The sambhar is a perfect blend of spicy and tangy. The parotta, meanwhile, is fluffy, crisp and tender:Served in a portion of three with a coconut-based vegetable kurma, it stand apart in bread pakora-dominated Delhi.
“I first spotted Matthew Café in 1999, while walking home after work. I had just come from Chennai and was missing the food here, and suddenly the aroma of pongal wafted through the air. I was pulled to it like a bee to nectar. It has been almost 20 years since, and I still come here for breakfast,” says D Kar, who works in Gurugram. Looking at him gushing over his pongal, I cannot help but order one too. One mouthful of the ghee-laden dish, and I know why the cafe is a hit.

When in Rome, eat like a Roman ","I arrived in Rome all set to take on wood-fired pizzas, hand-made pasta and vibrant gelato. And while I ate them all in the one week I spent there, I also learnt a lot about regional Roman cuisine and other Italian delicacies. in particular while devouring my way through the Roman dishes and other regional Italian delicacies from near and far.
On our first day in Rome, based on our tour guides advice we found a table at Taverna Romana for lunch. It was Roman cuisine at its best with specialised in Roman cuisine and had on offer local specialities like saltimbocca, biscetta, oxtail stew, roasted leg of lamb, tripe and Guinea fowl among other local specialities on the menu.
Later, we went hunting It was pasta time and we went on a hunt for signature pasta dishes of Roma — carbonara, amatriciana, cacio e pepe and gricia, all It was an introduction to a simple yet flavoursome fare. After a couple of days in Rome, I learnt about its signature pasta dishes - which were simple yet packed with loads of flavour.The key ingredients in these pasta sauces were guanciale and pecorino Romano cheese. At Salumeria Roscioli restaurant, crispy and salty bits of guanciale (salt-cured pork cheek), in the pasta sauces were sinfully delicious. The key ingredients in these pasta sauces were guanciale and pecorino Romano cheese. we had the opportunity to try out these fine Roman pastas.
Restaurants specialising in other regional Italian cuisines were also scattered around Rome. We also said hello to the regional produce of Sicily at A Maidda in the Trastevere neighbourhood. introduced us to the gave us an insight into the food culture and regional produce of Sicily. A wide variety of seafood, along with pistachios and capers, featured heavily on the Sicilian menu. We had Sicilian cannoli are also not to be missed for breakfast. The tubular pastry was filled with creamy ricotta, then to order and then garnished with pistachios, chocolate chips, almonds, orange rind or cherries, based on personal preference.




After eating a fair share of pizza-guzzling through the week, We discovered Bonci Pizzarium only towards the end of our stay in Rome. Pizzas here were priced by based on their weight, and the toppings were mind-blowing. The in-house chef was famous for makinges over a 100 different topping combinations in a day. There is no menu, and at any given time there are about a dozen different kinds of pizzas to choose from. Their pizza base is was very light and the toppings were creative: with options like slices of rare steak, eggs with truffle, red wine-cured meats, mortadella and crushed hazelnuts to name a few.
‘In Rome Cooking’ organises cooking sessions and we In addition to our daily dose of gelatos, one afternoon we signed up for a class on gelato and biscotti making class. by In Rome Cooking. It was also a fun-filled activity for the entire family and
We tried our hand at making three different flavours of gelato — coffee with hazelnut, pistachio with vanilla and Nutella. As While we waited for the gelatos to freeze in the blast chiller, we baked a batch of light biscotti to use as garnish. on the gelato.




Not a day in Rome went by without several cups of espresso, cappuccino or macchiato. in it. One day, it was a sheer delight The Italians may not grow their own coffee, but they sure know how to brew some excellent of the best coffee-based drinks in the world.
Sipping on a shakerato while people-watching near a piazza was an unforgettable. We enjoyed Eating eggplant parmesan and porchetta in the Mercato Trionfale was also quite the an experience, as was the plateful of fresh buffalo mozzarella, that was made just that morning with a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil, a few cherry tomatoes and basil leaves from a one of the market stalls.

We bought sausages and preserves to bring back home, in with the hope of recreating some a true Italian magicmeal in our own kitchen.

Kodaikanal’s Pastry Corner is a snacker’s delight "," A warning first. Bring along a lot of patience to sustain you until it is your turn to order at Pastry Corner in the busy bazaar area of Kodaikanal. 
No matter what time of the day it is, this unassuming shop, on congested Old Post Office Road, brims with people. Just 10x10 sq ft in size, it is perhaps the most visited corner in this touristy hill station. Here, orders for super-delicious bakery items keep buzzing at the counter and the service matches the speed with which items disappear off the shelf. Customers seem to know what they want and it means a majority of them are not first-timers. They also gauge that once inside the shop, there is not an inch of space to turn, twist or even wait. 
In spite of this, proprietor Prasanna Ghosh appears calm. His customers leave smiling after grabbing quick bites of freshly-baked goodies. Ghosh and his small team work to ensure this small haven, filled with aromatic oven products, is the most reliable go-to place. 
The popular bakery remains open between 10 am and 2 pm, and from 3 pm to 6.30 pm, with wholesome loaves of bread, fluffy and buttery fresh-cream pastries and cakes. 




It is impossible to just walk past the alluring aroma of freshly-baked items wafting over the counters or ignore the beckoning of deliciously displayed croissants, cup cakes, cookies and brownies, besides pizza with grated cheese and tomatoes. 
“All our products are without colours, preservatives or additives, and hence are perishable. We tell our customers to consume everything on the same day,” says Ghosh, who takes pride in the fact that only word-of-mouth brings him new customers and returns the old. 
Ghosh and his sister Meenakshi started with baking 30 loaves of open top breads daily. “We had a fixed order from a school and the rest we supplied to individual homes,” recalls Ghosh. The brother-sister duo called their product ‘The Daily Bread’ and sustained themselves for six years from 1985. In 1991, they set up a small shop on Seven Roads and shifted to the present location two years ago and gave it the present name. 
Daily grind 
Fresh batches of the items are prepared twice a day. Ghosh is liberal in offering free samples for tasting to his customers. “It is my small treat to them. Our customers are fond of us,” says Ghosh, who also explains to those interested about the various flavours and tastes of the goodies he offers and what goes into making them.
He is happy with the limited selection he offers at an affordable price. “It is not in my capacity to go big. I don’t want to push myself further. I am happy that people are able to differentiate the taste from what is available in the market and keep coming back to us.” 
At Pastry Corner, a mini jumbo 500 gm loaf of white or wholewheat bread sells for ₹35, and the 400 gm loaf comes for ₹30. All types of pastries come at ₹35, while items like brownie, cream and cinnamon rolls, egg sandwich, veg roll and veg puff, besides tea and filter coffee, are priced at ₹15 each.
Natural ice creams
Eighteen years ago, Ghosh introduced melt-in-your-mouth natural ice creams, made with fresh seasonal fruit. The favourites are plum, mango, pineapple, pear, sapota and butterscotch. He gets raw fruit from Dindigul and ripens them naturally for a month at home, to make organic ice cream. He started by selling a scoop for ₹15 and almost sounds apologetic for raising the price to ₹20 six months ago.
“Nowhere else will you get healthy, organic stuff at such a price,” says Pandiyan, his trusted staffer of 17 years.
Many customers vouch for the quality of the snacks here. “I owe a lot to our local suppliers and celebrate the local produce and the craft of baking,” says Ghosh. You will find him on his toes all day, chatting up with customers, slicing bread with a flair and going around with trays of hot tea and coffee for customers gathered on the platform outside his shop.




The best part about the cakes and ice creams is that they are not overly sweet and allow you to appreciate the ingredients and textures. Despite the rush, it is not easy to resist what arrives freshly baked from the factory.
Ghosh recalls that he was always fond of bread that came out fresh from the oven daily at 3.30 pm, when he was studying in Kodai International School. The fragrance of the long-fermented bread was delicious, and he realised it was not available outside. 
His sister as a Home Economics student learnt to bake from an American teacher, while Ghosh self-trained with the help of local bakers. His sincerity to keep improving and improvising has today earned him a name for his authentic doughnuts, mango spice tarts and mango marmalade. 
“I love to experiment with intriguing flavours,” beams the baker, as his hands deftly change the flavour of his cakes to surprise his customers.

Karkkidaka kanji on the menu
"," 
An Ayurveda medicine manufacturing unit is busy packaging its Karkkidakam special — Karkkidaka kanji kits. Soothing aroma of an oily mixture of herbs simmering in large bronze vessels fills the air in its sooty ‘kitchen’, where the medicines are prepared at Bhaskara Vilasam Vaidyasala. But an adjacent room in the ‘medicine factory’ in Panayamuttom, Nedumangad, turns a depository for parcelling up the ingredients already wrapped and sealed for the therapeutic porridge. Some of the factory staff carefully, but deftly, pick up little silver packets from steel trays and sort them to be finally put into the kits before they are sent to pharmacies.
“This is an annual ritual here when the Karkkidaka maasam kicks off,” says Pradeep Kumar, the factory manager. “All the ingredients that go into the Karkkidaka kanji are sourced and tested for quality in our laboratory.”
The murmur of rice being winnowed accompany our conversation. “Navara rice, which has many health benefits, is used for the breakfast kanji alongside roasted payar and oushadakkoottu (medicinal mix),” says Pradeep.




He says though the process of preparing the oushadakoottu takes about only two weeks, the work starts much earlier in the peak of summer when the various herbs are sourced. Bhaskara Vilasam sources most of the herbs from places such as Thenkasi and Theni in Tamil Nadu while the rest are bought locally. “Some herbs like Krishna Thulasi, Kurumthotti, Thottavadi or Navara leaf can be easily found in the region. They are normally grown in households or sometimes naturally thrive in the backyards,” points out Pradeep.




Rarer herbs are sourced with the help of distributors from within and outside the state. If they have to get something in bulk, they get in touch with the distributors. However, some common herbs are cultivated in a small farm near the factory itself. The raw herbs, shoots and roots are then culled, cleaned, cut and classified at the ‘unprocessed store’ before tested for quality. Those that pass muster reach the ‘finished store’ before they are crushed or powdered accordingly in a mechanised ‘pulverisation room’. 




“Some of the items that go into the oushadakoottu would require a different preparation method and would be processed separately,” says Pradeep as he leads us to the pulverisation room where judders funnel-mouthed machines. Nearby is a heap of drying Kudangal, or Pennywort, freshly sourced from suburbian bushlands, that will soon go as part of the next batch of oushadakoottu.




In essence
The oushadakoottu in powder form includes aashali, changalamparanda, njavara leaf, jeera, kudungal, erikku, thottavadi (touch-me-not), krishna thulasi, kurunthotti, karuvapatta (cinnamon), chittaratha, karimkurinji, devadaram, aavanakk, karinochi, fenugreek seeds, uzhinjam, thiapplli, bhrahmi, ramacham, mukkutty, poovamkurunthal, muyalcheviyan etc.

On a snail trail "," Is it a fish? Is it a shell? It’s a snail! On one of our usual trips to the Nochi Kuppam fish market one evening, we spot something unusual. Snails, in gleaming black and brown shells, float languidly inside a box filled with water. When we stop for a closer look, J David, the seller, runs up to us.
“Take the whole lot for ₹200,” he says. “I collected these at the Narayanapuram eri near Pallikaranai,” he adds. “I went in at noon today. I don’t go into deep waters. I simply walk with a bag secured at my hip and pick the snails from under the water plants.” The 65-year-old heads to the marshland every time there’s a spell of rains. “That’s when the snails come out; there will be plenty of water in the ponds and the snails will have a lot to eat.”




David has been collecting snails from the time he was a little boy. “Back then, I would go jump into Retteri with my friends to look for them. We sold them for our spending money,” he says. 
A resident of Villivakkam, David works as a daily-wager for a living and turns a snail collector on rainy days. He pulls out a bunch of visiting cards from his shirt pocket to show us. “These belong to my customers. I give them a call every time I get snails.” He has quite a large customer-base. 
According to David, snails are a delicacy. “It’s good, especially for women,” he says. P Sasikala, who has offered him space to sell the snails at her fish stall, says that the snails should be boiled like eggs in water, or can be steamed like idlis. “The flesh can then be slid out of the shell using a spoon. It can be cooked like prawn thokku — sauté onions and plenty of tomatoes, add the flesh and sprinkle chilli powder, coriander powder, turmeric and salt and cook for a few minutes.”

Dal, as you like it
"," It’s fair to say, finding a plate of pocket-friendly dal-roti in Visakhapatnam is still like finding needle in a haystack. Especially if you like your rotis served warm. But luckily for us, we found Shree Shyam, a homely eating place, where one can enjoy a meal in peace. 
Rajesh Sharma, the owner says, “My father started this place 20 years ago, after handing over the family business of sweets to his brothers. Since then we have been serving north Indian meals because there hasn’t been much demand for Rajasthani cuisine. However, we take orders if someone requests us to make dal baati or kichadi kadhi for 10 or more people.” According to him, the restaurant is most busy during lunch hours.
I order the largest thali on the menu with a glass of lassi. It looks legit. In many places a portion of sambar finds itself included in the thali, but not here. Instead, its got all the favourites from up North. 
I am served matar paneer, the classic aloo ki sabji, mixed vegetable, yellow dal, jeera rice, dahi boondi, chopped onions, aloo paratha, missi roti, chapati and gulab jamun. 
I start with aloo paratha and curd, and what a delightful combination this is.. The paratha goes just as well with yellow dal and matar paneer. 
The crunchy top layers of the paratha conceal within a piping hot filing of mashed potato redolent with a dash of red chilli powder. I finish the paratha in a matter of seconds.
The mixed vegetable has more gravy than vegetables and is a bit too watery. After tasting the mixed vegetable, to undo its after-taste I reach out for the lassi and stop with just one sip as it’s too sour.
Next, I try the missi roti and chapati. But they fade in comparison to the paratha. The matar paneer and dal are just right. For anyone who has a soft corner for home-style dal rice, the jeera dal here is sure to flood you with memories of a lazy afternoon meal at home. 
My dinner ends with the delicious gulab jamun. It’s got the perfect texture — it’s not too soft or hard and thankfully isn’t over powered by the sugar syrup either.

Mother Mirra’s Coffee’s 100-year legacy "," “I promise, you will keep coming back for more,” declares Sundar Subramaniam with a confident smile. The executive director of Mother Mirra Group of Companies offers me a fragrant brew, made with coffee powder from Mirra’s Idhu Namma Veetu Kaapi brand. The group recently launched three variants of filter coffee. It’s limited to retail in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry for now, but Sundar is bursting with plans.
“We are marketing Mirra’s Coffee with the line ‘I want you to buy my coffee once’... we plan to give away free brass coffee davara sets with every packet soon. And, there will soon be wet sampling at malls and stores.”
Mother Mirra’s Coffee has a 100-year-old legacy. It comes from the house of the first Asian planter, PPR Subramaniam (Sundar’s great-grandfather) and his Virakesari Plantations. PPR was an entrepreneur and journalist from Avanipatti village, in the Sivagangai district of Tamil Nadu. He also started Virakesari, the first Tamil newspaper in Sri Lanka in the 1930s, to give a voice to the rights of plantation workers.
“Back home, our community was often associated with the money-lending business. My great-grandfather set a new path. He moved to Sri Lanka at a time when plantations were still owned only by the British and the Scottish,” Sundar says with pride.
Later, PPR moved to Malaysia, where he bought more plantations. “My grandfather Sundarakesari continued the tradition and owned plantations in Coorg. My father S Subramanian followed suit,” says Sundar, now settled in Coimbatore.
Today, their plantation AA — or Premium Arabica — variety of beans is exported to countries within Asia and beyond. They also have a line-up of Arabica and Robusta with varying ratios of chicory content in them.
“Our wholesale market is thriving. We also sell online on Amazon, Flipkart, Paytm, and Big Basket, something I introduced after I took over in the last six months. My focus is on digital marketing. We are getting a good response from our active social media pages too.” The group has also branched into budget homes and service apartments.
“I did my masters in business marketing at Cornell University in New Zealand. I wanted to work abroad, but my father had other plans. He met me at Singapore and handed me my return ticket to Coimbatore,” laughs Sundar.
What followed was the launch of the retail brand. They added more German machineries to the factory at Coorg and introduced three new products — pure coffee (100% premium Arabica), premium filter coffee (with 15% chicory) and Gold (with 47% chicory). A network of 350 dealers ensures that the filter coffee reaches stores in Coimbatore, Madurai, Chennai and Puducherry. “In a couple of months, we want to start exporting to Singapore and New Zealand.” They also plan to enter the Sri Lankan market, from where it all began. A particular street in Colombo, from where Virakesari was born, still goes by the name Chettiar Street, to honour his great-grandfather.
Among new products, a green coffee is in the offing. Sundar also plans coffee counters at airports: where one can sow coffee, roast, grind and brew a perfect davara.

Your fish’s journey from the trawler to the plate
"," S Govindhan is Kasimedu’s dhorai, meaning, big guy. Seated in front of a mammoth sawed-down tree trunk that functions as a cutting table, he rapidly slices tuna into neat fillets. 
The enclosure, a little beyond the wharf at Kasimedu fish market, houses the men who cut big fish. Smaller fish are cut by women who are seated with their aruvamanai in front of the Old Fish Market. 
Govindhan is a star here — he laughs, revealing all his teeth, and jokes with his colleagues as his gloved hands chop fish with surgeon-like precision. It is here that our journey begins.
Ahlauyu S V Naiud, who runs Idly Fish Curry, a take-away food startup that offers an idli and fish curry combo, is waiting to get her mammoth parai fish cut. She just bought it for ₹6,000 from K Arasu, who has a stall at Kasimedu fish market. “This one was caught using a thoondil (hook and line),” the 43-year-old tells us. 
He adds that a group of five fishermen left on a fibre boat at 8 pm the previous night. Our parai arrived with them on the wharf at 4 am. It changed hands twice before it reached us. “I bought it on auction. M Aravalli was the auctioneer,” says Arasu. On a good day, fish sellers can get double or triple the price they pay the fishermen when they sell fish to customers. (Yet, it’s still probably significantly cheaper than what you pay for your cleaned, sliced and home-delivered seafood in the city. Or that grilled fish on your plate in a restaurant.)
Auctions are held by a bastion of bossy women. Tough and gruff-voiced, they call out the price of fish that marathukaaranga (meaning men of the catamaran) deliver to them. These are men who connect the boats and the wharf; they transport catch from the boats to the wharf on their catamarans.


At the cutting area, Govindhan, who’s been here from 6 am (and will stay here till 6 pm) slices the fish into two-inch-long cubes on Naiud’s request. From here, the parai travels to her house in Kottivakkam. 
“They’ll soon go into the curry that’s simmering on the stove,” she says, back at her house. In her kitchen — a wide-mouthed aluminium container is on the stove, and in it, a fragrant concoction of onions, tomatoes, tamarind, and a blend of nine spices, including red chillies, coriander seeds, black pepper, jeera and lentils, ground at a nearby mill.
“For 20 boxes of curry, I use 1.25 kilograms of fish,” she says. A music teacher who runs the 3Bs Western Music Academy in the city, Naiud started her food venture in January this year. She slides the fish slices into the curry. “The fish will be done in ten minutes,” she says. From Naiud’s kitchen, the curry is packed in plastic containers and transported to a kiosk at Spencer’s Daily Store in Thiruvanmiyur; she also sells on Swiggy. “90% of my stock is sold on the platform,” she says.
Meanwhile, some 13 kilometres away at Ente Keralam, a restaurant in Poes Garden, chef V T Jaya Prasad is plating a deep orange curry made with red snapper on a plantain leaf. “We call this Alleppey fish curry,” he says. He bought the fish at the Kasimedu fish market at 3 am. “We have a seller whom we regularly buy from,” he says. Prasad adds that he enjoys the ambience at Kasimedu. “People there are so warm,” he says.
For the curry, Prasad has used a base made of thick coconut milk. “I sautéed green chillies, onion, and curry leaves, added turmeric and chilli powder, before introducing the fish and coconut milk,” he says. It all ends here, on this plantain leaf.
It’s been quite a journey — from the sea, each fish has changed hands an average of five times, travelled hundreds of kilometres, been flopped on the wharf, sized up carefully, bought on auction, victoriously held aloft by the buyer. It’s been de-scaled and sliced, washed, frozen, thawed, bathed in spices, simmered... 
Finally it sits on your plate swathed in curry. A lot of work has gone into that fillet: Eat it with respect.

What your gut is telling you
"," 
Millions of microorganisms that live inside the human gut play a critical role in not just metabolising food but also in maintaining overall health. The type and composition of gut bacteria depend on where we live and what we eat. For example, a study of gut bacteria among groups of Indians has shown that they vastly differ from those found among western populations and even depend on multiple factors such as exposure to pollution and the cooking medium.
The India focus
Human microbiome (colonies of bacteria) plays a key role in digestion, fat metabolism, ensuring resistance to infection and boosting human immunity against diseases. They are linked to a variety of human conditions ranging from obesity to anxiety and even one’s armpit smell. Thus, a study of the dynamics of microbiomes could help scientists understand/treat various conditions/diseases.
The new study, on the nature and composition of gut microbiomes of healthy Indians, has shown interesting trends. It was done among healthy individuals living in Ballabhgarh near Faridabad, Haryana, and Leh in the Ladakh region of Jammu and Kashmir; the findings have been published in the journal, Scientific Reports. The samples from Ballabgarh were categorised into rural and urban as there are different food habits/patterns of living. Faecal samples were analysed to document gut bacteria.
The findings
It was found that the gut microbiome of Indians are generally dominated by Firmicutes bacteria followed by Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, Spirochetes, Verrucomicrobia and Fusobacteria. There was marked variation in the functional compositions of microbiomes in the sample populations from the two regions. Variation was also seen between rural and urban areas as well as between plains and high altitude areas.
The study also suggests a link between the use of cooking oil and an abundance of specific microorganisms. For example, Collinsella was abundant in the gut of individuals who consumed ghee. Pseudomonas, which is associated with dairy products, was largely lacking in the Leh population probably because they don’t much consume dairy products. However, people here had a significantly higher concentration of bacteria like Faecalibacterium and Lachnospiraceae, which have anti-inflammatory functions.
The gut microbiomes from Ballabhgarh were found to have an abundance of genes which play an active role in the degradation of xenobiotic substances (carcinogens, pollutants, drugs and pesticides). This could be as a result of high exposure to industrial or agricultural chemicals such as fertilizers and pesticides. This means that in addition to food, environmental exposure plays a role in shaping our gut microbiome.
“Gram-positive bacteria (Fermicutes) are in more abundance in Indian microbiome. This is in sharp contrast to the earlier belief, according to which Gram-negative bacteria dominated the gut of Indians,” said Dr. Bhabatosh Das, lead researcher of the study. Gram positive and Gram negative are two broad categories of bacteria based on the difference in their cell walls.
Road ahead
“This research could open up possibilities of new interventions such as faecal transplantation in future to counter diseases such as Inflammatory bowel disease and Clostridium difficile infection, where antibiotics are proving to be less effective,” added Dr. Das.
The study was funded by the Department of Biotechnology and the Department of Science and Technology (DST)-UK India Education Research Initiative. — India Science Wire

Giving shape to the TB fight
"," 
Tuberculosis (TB) is one of the world’s biggest global health crises; 1.7 million people died of the disease in 2016. New data suggest that the global scope of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is much larger than previously estimated, in turn requiring concerted international efforts in combating this deadlier form of the disease. BRICS nations (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) together account for over 40% of TB and over 50% of drug-resistant TB cases. 
The disease has started receiving political attention not only domestically but also internationally. To fast-track progress in tackling TB, the United Nations is to hold the first-ever UN high-level meeting, on September 26 in New York. Here. global leaders will decide strategies on how to tackle one of the deadliest infectious diseases. 
Negotiators and missions of member countries in New York are working this month to finalise the text of the political declaration that will be released in September by global leaders and set the direction in which policy and resources on TB and drug-resistant TB will move globally. 
Sticking points
Countries negotiating the final declaration text are coming under significant pressure by the United States to drop all references to protecting the rights of countries to take fully legal actions to access affordable medicines for their people. 
One of the final sticking points remains the language on public health safeguards enshrined in the World Trade Organization’s (WTO) Agreement on Trade-related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS). This allows governments, among other things, to issue ‘compulsory licences’ to override patents in the interest of public health, so that they can allow generic versions of medicines to be produced or imported and more people can receive needed treatment.
The affordability of medicines and use of TRIPS flexibilities has been agreed upon in multiple international fora, including the UN high-level declaration on anti-microbial resistance.
But the U.S., backed by its powerful big pharma lobbies, is pushing to remove any mention of the need for medicines to be affordable. 
The U.S. is exerting extreme pressure on the ‘Group of 77’ bloc — of developing countries — by refusing to sign the declaration at the U.N. General Assembly in September if language such as the paragraph that “recognises the importance of affordable medicines” and “urges countries to enforce intellectual property rules in ways that promote access” is included. 
Countries, including those in the Group of 77, and BRICS that have a high burden of drug-resistant TB, need to urgently stand up right now against the bullying that aims to keep newer oral TB medicines out of the hands of the people in their countries who need treatment. 
The upcoming TB Summit is an important opportunity to address drug-resistant TB. Blocking more affordable generic versions of safer oral medicines that are needed to scale up effective treatment for people with drug-resistant tuberculosis, or DR-TB, will not be the way to do it.

Making the most of a stretch
"," 
Should we stretch before exercise?
A thought-provoking new experiment with athletes suggests that the answer could depend on how we feel about stretching and what kind of exercise — and stretching — we intend to do.
Once, stretching before team sports and other activities was almost ubiquitous, especially so-called static stretching, during which you assume a pose and hold it for anywhere from a few seconds to several long minutes.
Change in strtetch type
 But static stretching has fallen out of favour in recent years, after studies showed that prolonged static stretching might cause reactions in the nervous system that temporarily weaken the stretched muscle. Consequently, athletes would not spring quite as high or sprint quite as fast after lengthy bouts of static stretching.
So, many coaches and organisations, including the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM), began to advise against static stretches and advocate instead for dynamic stretching, during which limbs and joints stay in motion.
During a static stretch of your quadriceps muscles, for example, you might stand up, grasp one foot, ease it up until your heel touches your backside and stay in that position.
A dynamic version of that same stretch would entail tugging your foot a bit farther up your back, then releasing your foot to the floor, and repeating the motion multiple times. It was thought that such dynamic stretching should bypass any negative impacts on performance, while helping muscles and joints to warm up and prepare for intense activity.
But little research has examined the actual performance effects of dynamic stretching.
Testing routines
So for the new study, which was published in June in Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise (an official journal of the ACSM, a group of international scientists, many of whom work with elite, national-team athletes, decided to test different stretching routines.
They began by recruiting 20 young, male athletes who play team sports such as soccer or rugby that involve running, sprinting and sudden shifts in direction — activities that are believed to demand a thorough warm-up.
To control for placebo effects, the researchers asked the athletes what kind of stretching, if any, they each expected would aid their performance. Almost all named dynamic stretching.
Then, on four different days, each athlete warmed up at a human performance lab.
Their warm-ups were lengthy. In some past studies of stretching, volunteers had stretched but not otherwise warmed up. In the real world of sports, though, warm-ups tend to be elaborate.
To better emulate those conditions, the athletes in this study began with a few minutes of easy jogging, followed by stretching, and then an additional 15 minutes of increasingly intense sprinting, jumping, zigzagging and other moves.
During the four days of the experiment, only the stretching changed during these warm-ups.
In one session, the athletes completed nine very brief static stretches of various muscles, with each stretch lasting five seconds.
On another day, the same nine static stretches were held for a total of 30 seconds each.
On a third day, the same stretches were all done dynamically.
And on a fourth day, the athletes did not stretch during their warm-up.
At the end of each warm-up, the athletes completed a battery of tests of their flexibility, jumping, sprinting and agility. 
Then the researchers compared their numbers.
Surprisingly, they found that the men’s performances had not changed, no matter what their warm-up. They were just as swift, agile, powerful and lithe when they had not stretched as when they had, and whether that stretching had been static or dynamic.
“There was no difference in performance on each day,” says Tony Blazevich, a professor with the Center for Exercise and Sports Science Research at Edith Cowan University in Joondalup, Australia, who led the study.
There also was no placebo effect; although the men almost universally had expected dynamic stretching to prepare them best for the coming activities, it had not.
Reading the results
These results have multiple implications, Dr. Blazevich continues.
They suggest, for one thing, that stretching does not bolster athletic performance when it is part of a full warm-up.
But at the same time, they show that stretching does not impede performance, Dr. Blazevich says, even when the stretching is static.
In practical terms, these findings suggest that if you enjoy and trust stretching before a competition or workout, you may as well keep stretching, Dr. Blazevich says.
“Our subjects felt more prepared for the tasks when the stretching was included,” he says, and that psychological expectation might affect their confidence and play during an actual game, he says, a possibility that he and his colleagues did not test but would like to. On the other hand, people who hate to stretch before exercise could probably skip the effort, he says, if they otherwise warm up.
Of course, this was a short-term study and included only fit young men who play team sports. Whether the findings apply equally to older people, women and those of us who participate in activities like distance running or cycling is still up in the air. 
“We need to test all of that in the future,” Dr. Blazevich says. “More to do!” NY TIMES

‘Lost cuisines of India’ at the Marriott Hyderabad: Dig into some history
"," Have you ever wondered what else you could be having on your plate? Perhaps something the masses know very little about? Well, enter ‘Lost Cuisines of India’, a culinary heritage project which is the result of a collaboration between executive chef Aungshuman Chakraborty of Marriott’s Bidri and the chefs from other Marriott properties in Jaipur and Kolkata.
Meat-lovers will find themselves indulging big time. Come with an empty, and I mean empty, stomach and pace yourselves as one would do in any history lesson.
Memorable appetisers include a succulent murgh zamin doz, a favourite dish of Mughal emperor Akbar. The dish comprises chicken tenderised in yoghurt, cardamom, saffron and almonds and wrapped in a rumali roti. The meat temptingly slides off the bone here and works great with a mustard seed dip.
The pretty appetiser, as I like to call it, is the Bengali fish kabiraji; it’s helmed pretty for its delicate lacy egg net surrounding the fish fillet.
According to the chef, the parindey main parinda is a dish worth the trip over; an egg stuffed into a quail stuffed into a chicken. The assembled mix is placed under a rumali roti in an earthen pot which is cooked in the sand. While this may sound — pardon the pun — filling, it’s a great sharer dish to go with the moti biryani made with chicken and egg whites. 




The railway mutton curry is a classically lip-smacking go-to while the Lady Curzon seafood curry is a light yet satisfying amalgam of all the good things under the sea: prawns, calamari and more. Lady Curzon, for the history novices out there, was the wife of the Viceroy of India, Lord Curzon of Kedleston. 
“We chose to do some dishes encompassed within the British era for their landmark effects on original Indian cuisine and to show how the culinary timeline is stretched out,” points out chef Aunghsuman. “Plus our staff and servers are well-versed in the history behind each dish so do not hesitate to ask for back stories.”
Chef Aunghsuman didn’t forget about the vegetarians; the surprising mewa shahi kebab is a great palate cleanser while the jackfruit pulao is a delightfully flavourful addition to the city’s never-ending rice repertoire.
The curries can be enjoyed with the extensive breads on offer but a stand-out item is the maah choleya de thode, hand-flattened and made with crushed dal makhani. On its own, it was a food for farmers. 
One may have a tough time choosing a dessert; each one has a fascinatingly detailed backstory. Biasedly though, a must-try is the kabhishambardhana sandesh, a Bengali dessert first made in Jorasanko by Rabindranath Tagore’s niece for the writer’s 50th birthday. 
Yes, there are probably hundreds, if not thousands, of dishes lost in time we are yet to revisit, but what’s on the menu at Bidri is definitely an invitation to not only dine but to keep discovering. About 25 dishes will be taking over Bidri’s menu for the duration of the festival, but iconic favourites like their in-house biryanis will continue to be on offer. 
‘Lost Cuisines of India’ starts today at Bidri at Marriott Hotel, Tank Bund Road, and will run up till August 5, for dinner only.

Yoga and smoothies "," Quaint little vegetarian cafes, often attached to yoga studios, are coming up all over the country. They offer a contemporary vibe, greenery, and nutritious food that call for mindful eating. We explore a few. 
Yogi-sthaan, Bengaluru
Plot 89, 11th Cross Road, Indiranagar, Stage 1
Yoga studio, B&B, café, retreat. When Ajitsingh Tapasvi conceived Yogi-sthaan, all he wanted was a fluid space where one could ‘just be’. “I wanted this space to be like home — you can treat it as your office or as a café; you can do yoga or read; you can even stay over,” he explains. “We ask no questions and force nothing upon you. When a guest walks in, he gets a copper water bottle with two kansa glasses. After that, we do not disturb him.” Open, green, unobtrusive, and relaxed, Yogi-sthaan’s food is vegetarian, uses macrobiotic practices, ancient grains and traditional methods of cooking. Try their hash browns that come with mozzarella, red and yellow pepper, spinach and herbs served with yoghurt dressing. Or simply ask for tea with toast and liquid jaggery. 
Mystic Yoga Café, Kolkata
20A, Camac Street, 2nd Floor
The yoga practitioners coming to Mystic Yoga centres asked what they could eat after an invigorating session of yoga; some just wanted to spend more time in the peaceful environment of the studio. It’s what led Abhishek Maheshwari to start the cafés (four, across the city). They serve small meals, snacks, and an all-day breakfast. “Our meals are cooked using the principals of Ayurveda and are based on four pillars: healthy, tasty, satisfying and affordable,” says Maheshwari. If the no-fuss décor, fresh menu, and wide range of spiritual books doesn’t bring you back, the spinach and chickpea soup, or the vegan omelette might. 
Yogi’s Belly, Hyderabad
IshaLife, Plot No 522, Road 27, Jubilee Hills
White wrought-iron chairs set under a large mango tree, bare white walls and a chequered tile-grass floor beneath, Yogi’s Belly is the zen you need in the middle of the busy Jubilee Hills. An extension of the Yoga Studio, crafts store, and Mahamudra, a fine-dining restaurant, at IshaLife Foundation, the place marries the traditional with the modern. Try the ice tea with turmeric and sabja seeds, drumstick soup, ragi mudde, and rice waffles. 
Artjuna, Goa
No 972, Monteiro Vaddo, Anjuna Bardez
Attached to an Iyengar-style yogashala that also has a quaint boutique, on the Anjuna beach, the Artjuna Goa was set up in an old Portuguese house, and has both indoor and outdoor seating. Moshè Imbar, who owns the place, tells us, “Our café primarily serves Mediterranean cuisine.” A lively space, and one of the few yoga cafés that has a small section of non-vegetarian fare, Artjuna serves an all-day breakfast and small eats. Its USP is the freshness of the ingredients, home-made cakes and coffee, and a vegan menu. 
The Yoga House, Mumbai
Nargis Villa, Water Bungalow, Sherly Rajan Road, Bandra West
A bright space in the heart of suburban Mumbai, The Yoga House Café takes you away from the noise and traffic of the city, even if for a little while. Sheer curtains, white furniture and sea-green walls make the place a haven. Attached to the Yoga House, the food here is based on macrobiotic recipes rooted in ancient dietary wisdom and traditions, and the menu centres around whole grains and local, seasonal produce. Try the 10-grain toast, home-made muesli, fresh juices and smoothies and the signature hash brown at this plastic-free hangout.
Yogi’s Belly Café, Chennai
New Number 117, Old Number 50, Luz Church Road, Mylapore
The Yogi’s Belly Café brings together the best of Indian culture: yoga, traditional cuisine and artisanal craftsmanship. Located within the IshaLife premises, it blends traditional with contemporary. “The menu here has been curated with a unique approach to health and fitness that stems from a deep understanding of the yogic sciences,” says Meena Thennaapan, who manages the centre. Café offerings like raw turmeric juice, papaya and red capsicum salad, and black sesame kulfi blend the regular and the exotic. With large rattan chairs, comfy couches and sheer curtains, the café is a modern take on an ancient science.

Southern spice "," Chef Ramachandran smiles when we ask him how he became a chef. “I used to spend all my free time learning to cook from my mother, grandmother and neighbours.” The shy, soft-spoken chef, who only speaks when prodded is in the city on a work visit. He’s come to Mumbai on loan from Taj Gateway Bengaluru’s landmark restaurant – Karavalli for a Syrian Christian Kerala pop-up. 
When asked about the pop-up’s speciality food, he explains that Malayali Syriac Christians from Kerala trace their origins to the arrival of Saint Thomas in Kerala circa 52 AD. Thomas’s evangelical activity gradually led to significant number of high class Brahmins taking to Christianity. Syrian Christian food is a confluence of the east and west — while their food is robust with Kerala spices including cardamom, cinnamon, cloves, black pepper and kokum, the cuisine also incorporates western techniques like roasting and steaming.
Spice kitchen
 Our first palate cleanser is the good old rasam, which is spiked with tamarind, black pepper, and tangy tomatoes, the spices hit the throat, clearing every clog instantly.
For starters, we get Vazhapoo cutlet (₹850) patties made of banana flour and sweet potato mash topped with a spicy tomato chutney; Urulai roast (₹850) has marinated baby potatoes tossed in a sweet and spicy onions and tomato mush and Kozhi Roast (₹1,250), a peppery chicken kebab tossed in onion and brown spices. The roast has a touch of cooling saunf. The cuisine uses dry, shredded coconut as well as coconut milk, and a generous dose of curry leaves that beautifully balances the sweet and sour. There’s also a Portuguese influence that can be seen in the use of toddy to ferment dishes. The main course, is Avial (₹950) creamy yogurt and coconut curry, seasonal vegetables like parwal and aubergines, finished in green chillies and cumin. The Taarav Roast (₹2150), a dry preparation of duck with black pepper and onions, has a touch of jaggery gives every dish a sweet relish, to calm the fire of the red chillies. While our appams are too dry, the flaky Malabar parottas and rice and coconut kallapams (pancakes) pair well with the dishes. The mean moilee, a rich creamy milky gravy is perfect for a rainy day.
Sweet notes
 Dessert is homestyle Ila ada (₹600) steamed rice flour cakes stuffed with grated coconut and jaggery. The rice flour coating is too chewy. A kokum sorbet with a topping of coconut cream, turns out to be a lighter and more enjoyable dessert. 
As the two flavours melt, the dessert evolves in taste, the sour and sweet forming a dual rhapsody on our palate. We also appreciate the warmth of Ada pradhaman (₹600), which has fat rice flakes slow-cooked in thick and creamy coconut milk and jaggery. This is that dreamy dessert that makes you crave more. Since it’s made with jaggery, it makes us less guilty when we help ourselves to seconds.
The Karavalli Pop-up – Exploring the Epicurean Legacy of Syrian Christian Cuisine is ongoing until July 27 at Masala Bay, Taj Land’s End, Bandra

Roadside rendezvous
","The weather is great and the appetite is sharp and there is a roadside food festival in town. So we head to Fairfield by Marriott that promises some sweet, sour and crisp fare. Step in and two thallu vandis greet you. Fryums in plastic bags hang from it and bottles of goli soda decorate the front.




‘Kovai Kulir Bhaana Kadai,’ announces one. “It means Kovai’s cool drinks shop,” explains Bharath of Marriott. A pyramid of shiny davara-tumblers are a reassuring hint of filter coffee to come. There is rose milk, nannari sherbat and shukku coffee among other ‘cool drinks’. We decide on the goli soda with a dash of refreshing nannari syrup and it is a good choice.
The Chintu aur Mintu Chat Bhandar on wheels offers chaat in various avatars. Dahi chat, kachori chat, bhel puri, paani puri, alu tikki... Sit or stand around it and pick and choose your toppings and garnishes as the chaatwallah obliges. Sundal with manga is there and it is served with a side of sweet potato that is absolutely delicious with a squeeze of lemon on it. Just the chaats could be dinner, but there is more inside with momos (both veg and non-veg), dosa, vadaa pav and paav bhaaji. 
There is nice sizzle and smoke at the live counters as dosas fly off the tavaa with assorted accompaniments. We are persuaded to try egg curry made two ways with the dosa. There is chicken curry to go with it too. Chicken, mutton and fish kebabs are being prepared at a nearby counter.
If you still feel the festival fare is but starters, dig into a main course of Thai curry, mushroom curry, paneer gravy, several non-vegetarian curries to be eaten with steamed rice/rotis, biriyani and pastas. 




The goli soda does its job of washing everything down smoothly and the phirni served in a kulhad (mud pot) completes the experience of eating street food and the Tirunelveli halwa (sourced from there) is the grand conclusion.
The Rottu Kadai Fest is on till July 29 from 7.00 pm to 11.00 pm and costs Rs 699 plus taxes. For reservations, call 7094446622

Slim pickings
"," At first glance it appears we have walked into a film set, of the kinds associated with over-the-top dramas featuring rich businessmen and heavily bedecked women. One sweep across the long narrow space that is Plum by Bent Chair throws up purple walls, green creepers (all fake) hanging from the ceiling and snaking out of massive vases, glass shelves with typewriters masquerading as teapots, horses leaping out of columns, and stuffy high-backed chairs. There’s even a table formed in the shape of a man bent over. It’s big and colourful and quirky and the only relief comes from looking out onto Lower Parel’s concrete skyline. 
There’s nothing quiet about this new restaurant: it’s meant to capture your attention and keep it. It is understandable in a way because Plum is competing with its own sister establishments, Lord of the Drinks and Rocky Star (they all opened around the same time). The three restaurants share an owner — First Fiddle Restaurants, and a space — demarcated from each other by floor to ceiling windows. Plum is a collaboration with Bent Chair, a home décor brand by Natasha Jain, and it doubles up as a retail space — you can shop while you eat. Everything is on sale, from crockery and wall art to the furniture.
Missing zing
 Leafing through a menu that doubles up as a brochure helps us bide the time as we wait for our orders. On that day, service is slow and turns our lunch turns into long lazy brunch. We put it down to opening week blues. Our cocktails, when they do arrive, are a hit and miss. Our Plum Berry Sour (₹575) has elements of a sour but is an otherwise confused drink with too many elements that don’t work well together — why add in blackberry liqueur and cookie dough? Plum and Passion (₹500) fares better with rum and vodka muddled with passionfruit juice and lemon. There’s an aftertaste of wasabi to cut through the sweetness. The Pumpkin and Cinnamon Fruit Bellini (₹500) lacks the flavours of its two main ingredients and turns out to be a bitter, fizzy drink. 
Plum’s interiors are dressed to the nines but the food is not. Chef Sagar Bajaj defines the offering as pan Asian but it is largely Chinese. We don’t have a problem with Indian Chinese food, it’s comforting at its best and familiar at its worst. Bajaj’s food falls somewhere in between — there were a few standout dishes but overall, we just expected more. 
Mixed fare
 Our plates have animals on them, monkeys and zebras, dressed in glares. These are soon covered with Edamame and Truffle Dumplings (₹425), with translucent skins packed with cream cheese, carrot and corn and earthy truffle. It is a bit dry and our demand for dips brings a plate of six spicy sauces to the table — all of which drown out the delicate flavours of the dumpling. The Prawn Tempura Uramaki (₹690) is adequate, crispy prawn helped by lashings of mayonnaise and teriyaki glaze. Fermented Garlic Oil Chicken (₹495) is a light curry that’s heavy on the garlic. Mongolian Chicken Claypot (₹555) is sweeter and has a fair amount of peanuts. The accompanying rice, Truffle Shimitzu Fried Rice (₹425) marries the umami of mushroom with the earthiness of the truffle. It’s a dish worthy of second helpings. 
For dessert, we order the much publicised Plum Tropical Fruit Citrus Cheesecake (₹590). The ingredients are in the name and the cheesecake is served in scoops, like an ice cream but lighter and creamier. It comes on a bed of sliced fruit, which though refreshing would have taste better served cold instead of warm. It’s a dish that is symbolic of the dining experience at Plum by Bent Chair: a good idea that just needs some polishing.

Feeling so fresh about Sofrehh
"," 

“Feroza, but with a darker blue,” is how Arash Naseeruddin describes the pretty blue of his Sofrehh food truck. You might miss it if you don’t look closely enough because this eatery that’s growing to be the latest talk of the town is in its own little alleyway — but it’s not as seedy as it sounds.
I had first spotted Sofrehh in late March when it had first opened, its first post near the new Conçu in Jubilee Hills. Then it wasn’t there anymore. I had shrugged my shoulders and had assumed it had either moved or gone bust — it was the the former. And boy, what a sweet set-up.




In the small alleyway space by Zasya, Arash and younger brother Abdul Moiz set up streaming lights above a sit-out area by the truck complete with canopy covers for the occasional rainy day. The warm light accentuates the blue of the truck, of the blue accents on the walls and the feroza-coloured cushions set upon the cane furniture for that travel-esque Mediterranean feeling. 
Not just ‘Instagrammable’
Arash and Abdul put their heads together a couple of years ago to bring life to an age-old dream: an eatery that succinctly envelopes the best of Persian sandwiches, inspired by their Iranian mother. Sofrehh is derived from the Persian word sofreh, the cloth spread on the ground upon which diners sit and have meals. It’s a name evocative of a homely and cosy feeling; the extra ‘h’ is to differentiate this establishment from an existing Persian eatery in New York. The logo, which may resemble an herb, is actually the Parsi symbol for the letter ‘s’. Plus, the minimalism of the van’s decor keeps it classy.
The brothers wanted something that wasn’t just pretty for social media, they wanted something that would leave an impression of Persian food we don’t know about, in the best way. And they’ve achieved that with their minimal menu. 




The kubideh sandwiches at Sofrehh are a rite of passage for meat-lovers. Laid with fresh tomatoes and vegetables with a small dash of mayonnaise, the tangy lamb patties really sing. The cutty murgh variety teems with flavour that doesn’t leave an unpleasant aftertaste... quite the opposite actually. 
For vegetarians, the veg falafel is an easy go-to, but the more adventurous lot should try out the penir olivieh, a cold sandwich as per the olivieh suffix filled with various vegetables and fresh cottage cheese. The meatier equivalent is the murgh olivieh, which has chicken potato and egg salad.
And the bread — oh, my! Arash and brother have carefully sourced a baker in Hyderabad after hunting for a very long time. A fresh batch of delightfully light and soft Mediterranean black olive loaves comes in everyday to match the freshness of their ingredients. According to the menu and the brothers, the bread is all-organic and preservative-free. 
To enhance your Sofrehh experience, Arash recommends coming at 10pm when the passing traffic is pretty much non-existent and all you can hear is the jazz music from the portable speaker they keep on hand and the buzzing conversation from other customers. 
While I’m yet to try the homemade marmalades and the Batsam coffees, I’m sure I’ll be back — with an emptier stomach.

Pulses: lentils, chickpeas and beans
","Collectively known as pulses, lentils should be on the farming calendar of every kitchen garden. The leguminous plants are harvested when the pods are dry and the hard lens-like seeds can be stored away for future use. Toor (pigeon peas), moong, masoor and chickpeas are a few of the most favoured lentils that are consumed daily in most regional cuisines. These nutritionally dense pulses come packed with proteins, fibre, calcium, iron, zinc and antioxidants. Like all leguminous plants, most lentils are rabi crops, traditionally cultivated after the Indian monsoons. However, they can be grown through the year in the controlled environment of a kitchen garden, if the soil is kept moist during the dry periods.
Lentils can be grown on terrace gardens with equal success. Use large deep pots or growbags filled with a mix of garden soil and sand. Companion plants like cucumber or potato can be planted alongside: they are beneficial to each other’s growth.
Choose an open sunny spot or sow in between other plants, keeping in mind the plants favourable to its growth. Prepare the soil with a mix of crumbled neem cake, organic leaf matter and clean dry compost. Healthy soil naturally contains rhizobia, a healthy bacteria that fixes nitrogen in the soil. In a small garden space, the soil will have sufficient organic matter to nourish the plants. But, farmers with large areas under cultivation often add an inoculant powder containing rhizobium culture to the soil before sowing.
Source your seeds from a farmer in your region, choosing a tested variety. Sow directly in the prepared beds, leaving a distance of 5-6 inches in between. When the plants are about 6 inches high, train them up poles or over a low trellis. Lentils will also thrive as bushes without support, but will naturally climb up taller companion plants.
Moon phase
Sow during the new moon and the first quarter phase, as the sap flow is drawn up. Harvest with the waning moon, as the sap is drawn down — this phase is beneficial for drying and storage of produce.
Potatoes, cucumbers and corn are good companion plants. Keep garlic and onion at a distance from lentil plants.
Though lentils are relatively drought tolerant, the plants must be kept moist through the growing phase. Feed the plants with a compost tea when they are about six inches high; repeat when they start flowering. Stop watering once the pods start drying.
Lentils are generally not prone to disease, though they may be attacked by aphids and weevils. Strong hosing with water will get rid of aphids, but weevils must be removed by hand.
Lentils are ready for harvest four months from sowing. As they are stored away for long use, pluck the disc-like seeds once the pods are dry and the seeds within are hard. Store for up to a year.
Allow the pods on the healthiest plants to dry on the plant, till the shell becomes papery and shrivelled. Remove from the stalk and dry further. Lightly coat with wood ash and store away for the next planting season.
Like all leguminous plants, lentils enrich the soil by fixing nitrogen. They continue to do so as long as the roots remain in the soil. After the harvest, let the plant dry out completely and decompose into green manure. The roots will continue to nourish the soil. For the next round, rotate crops and watch them thrive in the enriched soil.
Lentils are an ancient Indian crop that originated from the Mediterranean region; India is now the world’s largest producer of lentils.
The seedlings of leguminous plants can be used as nutritious microgreens to be lightly sautéed or used as fresh greens in salads.
Sprouted lentils also provide an additional burst of nutrition.

Sweetmeats for the sweet toothed
"," In the temple town of Kumbakonam, the sticky, syrupy monopoly of the gulab jamun is quietly being challenged by the success of dry jamuns. Its creator, Kumbakonam Murari Sweet, a family-run business, sells 250-300 kilograms of dry jamuns a day. 
“How we make the dry jamuns is a trade secret, but it is rare among sweetmeats in the South,” says D Arun Kumar, the proprietor of Kumbakonam Murari Sweet. The dry jamun, looking like a sugar-dusted brown pearl, is smaller than its original namesake, but its crisp exterior gives way to a squishy centre that has the same delicious taste of the gulab jamun. 




Just the basics
Arun Kumar gives us a rough idea of the process. “We use maida, sugar and milk solids in the jamuns and then soak them in a caramelised syrup. It has a shelf life of a week without refrigeration,” he says.
The small office, on the premises of the Murari Sweet eatery on Sastra College Road, is redolent with the aroma that only lip-smacking food can generate. Whether it is batches of samosas being fried or sweetmeats arriving fresh from the centralised production unit, there is a palpable excitement in the way the food is displayed and served here. “Customers still come to us and reminisce about our founder Murari Lal Sait, who used to personally pack sachets of Ashoka halwa in leaves at our earliest shop,” says Arun Kumar, as he recollects his family’s journey to Kumbakonam over a hundred years ago.




A traditional confectionery and sweet maker (halwai) from the town of Khurja in Uttar Pradesh, Murari Lal Sait travelled to Kumbakonam with his brother (Arun Kumar’s grandfather RB Anantharaman Sait) and a few friends in 1914, in search of livelihood.
While the friends returned after a few months, the Sait brothers stuck it out, determined to make a mark in Kumbakonam. 
“In those days, our grandfather sold sweets from a handcart that he pushed around the town. He was hard-working and made the sweets himself. His ideas and success are what have helped us retain our position in the market today,” says Arun Kumar.
As he did not have children of his own, Murari formally adopted Anantharaman’s son Devidas (Arun Kumar’s father) to ensure his culinary legacy for posterity. “I was 12 when my grandfather passed away. The first store was a small place. We too have had our struggles,” says Arun Kumar.
While the founder made his name as a seller of traditional South Indian staples like Mysore pak, badusha, kaara boondi and pakoda, which were packed in leaves or cane baskets, Devidas diversified the menu by introducing North Indian and Bengali specialities.
Arun Kumar, who started assisting his father at the age of eight, says, “We would try and create something unique in our shop. Ajmeer cake, made with date pulp, dried fruits and milk solids, was created like that,” he says. It is a lighter version of the wheat-based habshi halwa.




Going solo
After working with his father for 40 years, Arun Kumar branched out on his own in 2012. He is assisted by his wife and sons and has opened branches in Sarangapani Kovil Keela Veethi in Kumbakonam, and in the nearby towns of Mayiladuthurai and Tiruvarur. 
Constant experimentation has helped Arun Kumar create a sizeable catalogue of best-selling goodies, that combine the best of North and South vegetarian cuisine, plus the usual foray into global fast food like pizzas.
Today, besides dry jamuns and ajmeer cake, the brand is known for milk peda and soan papdi in sweets, and inji (ginger) pakoda in savouries — a founder’s recipe that combines ginger, mint and gram flour. 
From improved packaging and corporate gift ideas to an online retail portal and computerised delivery systems, the family has upped its merchandising game considerably. 
Currently, the family employs a staff of 200. Cooks start work at 4 am and wind up by 11 am. 
Sweet mix
Arun Kumar is a product of both the South and the North. “I grew up in Kumbakonam,” he says, in fluent Tamil. “But at home, we keep in touch with our Khurja roots. We speak in Hindi and also love phulka, aloo subzi and the gajar halwa that my wife makes,” he says.

Jasmine syrup is here!
"," A profusion of images flooded my Instagram feed during the summer holidays. My favourite were the pretty flowers that dot the woods and the countryside abroad in spring. Among the ones that caught my fancy were pictures of the dainty elderflower celebrated throughout Switzerland.
My Swiss friend had picked large quantities of it to make syrup, which would last her through the year and her posts had me wishing that I was in her kitchen at that moment. 
As if that wasn’t enough, a friend from Bengaluru who was holidaying in the Swiss Alps returned with bunches of elderflower and proceeded to make a golden syrup in her cosy Airbnb.




While I loved the process of picking delicate, aromatic local flowers and making an infusion, there was no way I could get elderflower in my neighbourhood. As I gazed at the small, white flowers, it made me think of our very own jasmine. Mallige, mogra, mallipoo, chameli ... the jasmine is known by different names across the country and romanticised on celluloid and used during traditional rituals for its aroma and pristine beauty. Elsewhere, in Asia, it is in demand for the mild flavour it lends to tea and rice grains, but it is not commonly used as a kitchen ingredient here. Ideally I would have liked to pick my own flowers but since my plant was a little low on offerings, that wasn’t possible.
When I asked my local flower seller for loose blossoms to make syrup with, she was amused. “You don’t want any for your hair?” she kept asking. I just filled my basket with a handful of open flowers, and rushed home to begin the immersions.
The method is straightforward. A citrus element is optional, depending on your preference. Given the delicacy of the jasmine aroma, I realised that I didn’t want to dilute it with any other spice or ingredient. Not even my favourite lemon.
We sat down to separate the petals from the short green stalk, and the heady fragrance was an instant mood elevator. While elderflower needed to be steeped for a few days in a simple sugar syrup, jasmine required only a few hours. The colourless liquid took on a slightly creamy hue and captured the fragrance beautifully. The sweet syrup carried the unmistakable flavour of the flowers making this a hugely satisfying foray into the exciting world of floral infusions. There was also a very slight bitter after taste that is commonly felt when tasting most flower petals.
This syrup needs to be stored in the refrigerator and can be used to mix a simple lemon juice or even some stronger clear brews. I am now thinking about making a lemon sour cream cake and glazing it with this delightful jasmine syrup: one helping of this sweet tangy confection might just not be enough.

Fitness at a click of a button
","Bored of going to the gym? In the long list of issues we face today, ‘lack of exercise’ tops it. The world however, is waking up to a new trend – Virtual Training via Youtube, which is a hit with the online-savvy generation.
With my own gym membership sleeping, and fitness goals lagging, I decide to accept my friend’s invitation to experience this new trend.

How it works

If Madhuri Dixit can conduct dance classes, and top chefs dish out gourmet recipes, online, why cant fitness trainers demonstrate various fitness postures virtually?
Armed with a laptop, we browse through short videos, elaborate ones and even a 10-minute workout routine, which was rather tempting. Be it yoga, Pilates, Zumba or functional training, the choices available are mind-boggling, a reason why it’s a hit in the west.
While I was grunting and gasping, my friend did the workout effortlessly, listening to the narrator and hardly even glancing at the video. You can download free videos where the instructor describes and demonstrates each workout with slow motion samples. The only equipment required with these ‘remote coaches’ is self-motivation.
In no time the instructor’s upbeat energy has me moving. My sweat-drenched self makes a mental note to try this portable fitness option more often. If you opt for the paid workouts which are cost-effective you can interact with a personal trainer.
Besides being economical and private, it saves the worry of dressing up or the ugly traffic to go out. Depending on your mood you can workout for 20 minutes or up to two hours.
Vinod Channa, who has trained John Abraham and Shilpa Shetty, is going to launch an online fitness programme. “The idea is to present multiple exercise techniques in a simple, effective manner. The varied needs of individuals will be catered along with diet consultation and personal training too,” he says.
Whether you want to kick start your fitness journey or use E-fitness, working out online is a great way to break into sweat. If you’re the kind who needs fitness buddies and a trainer around to bond, it’s unlikely you will opt for this.

Choose Wisely

- New to workouts? Choose basic videos depending on your lifestyle.
- Don’t get carried away initially. You need to be in tune with your body and learn when you can push yourself and when you should back off to avoid injuries.
- Scout for videos of certified and famous professionals which will warrant safety . Some options to choose from are - BeFit, Fitness Blender, XHIT, Sadie Nardini which are free while toneitup,
- FitOrbit and Hitchkit are the economical options available.

Whipping up a variety
","I am distracted by the peanut cookies. Conducting an interview in the kitchen throws up unique problems. Wanting to snack mid-way through your subject’s story is just one of them. Then there was the time I inadvertently sat on a hot stove while watching a chef demo his signature pasta. And let’s not even get started on the hair-nets, compulsory head gear in five-star kitchens, and guaranteed to make even Angelina Jolie look like a frumpy old lunch lady.
Nevertheless, appearances must be maintained. Even with a hair net on. (Though fortunately this particular interview, conducted in a guerrilla makeshift kitchen doesn’t require one.) So I ask my questions, and try to ignore the three trays of still warm cookies, lined up with regimental precision, which have evidently just been taken out of the oven. “Try a cookie,” urges baker Suresh Babu, finally pushing a tray towards me.
Yes! I lean over, carefully select the brownest cookie in the batch and bite in. It’s delightfully crumbly, packed with crushed, roasted peanuts. I then resume studying Suresh, languid in a beat up old T-shirt and jeans. Take another look at his tiny kitchen, meticulously stacked with pans, trays and jars. And then I glance around his little ‘café’ — a room haphazardly furnished with three tables, a business-like fridge and oversized wind chimes — with renewed curiosity. There’s got to be a story here.
A few weeks ago ‘Warm Brown’ hoisted its sign on a tree-lined street in CIT colony. I follow my nose to find the space, like a well-trained golden retriever. The scent of cookies makes its way out of the café’s open doors, snaking out of the compound and onto the street. Walking in, I’m startled by the space — it’s less café, more college canteen, with three big tables pushed together and mismatched chairs.
The décor is absent minded: yellow tea pots here, an over-sized mirror there, and above it all an unblinking model of a rather flashy gecko, reminiscent of Spanish artist-architect Gaudi. Suresh Babu comes out of the kitchen to say hello, before taking me back in to show me his miniature oven, an OTG, and those cookies. When we settle down at the main table, where a chocolate and orange chiffon cake are cooling, he cuts me a slice of each, then pushes over a cup of sweet filter coffee.
A former creative director with O&M, he left the firm in 2012 to start working on ad films. “But that didn’t really keep me busy. I was freelancing, and suddenly found I had a lot of free time,” he says, adding that he gradually began baking. He began with cookies, moved on to quiches, and then learnt how to make bread. “I started practising at home, and found my kids were enjoying what I baked — and it was much better than what was commercially available. I realised the difference was ingredients; I use only butter — no margarine. No preservatives. And as far as possible, no artificial flavouring,” he says, pointing at the last few crumbs of orange chiffon cake on my plate. “That cake, for example, it’s flavoured with nothing but orange juice and orange zest.”
The cake is spongy and fragrant, an ideal ambassador. While his chocolate cake is less striking (“but it’ll change character with ganache”), he also makes a vanilla-flavoured teacake. This is not fancy baking. It’s not even unusual. It’s just basic cakes, cookies and tarts done right. Where Warm Brown scores is in its ability to offer home-baked flavours in a professional setting. Additionally, since one man does all the work, and he’s meticulous about measurements, the products are standardised.
Besides, it’s undeniably fascinating to see a one-man show run with this kind of single-minded determination. “I found this space. I climbed on a stool and painted the walls. See those lamps — I made them with crushed paper. Look at the table — I made it with reclaimed wood.” As my jaw drops, he continues, “The sign outside? I made it — bending the cane myself.” He adds, “I painted signboards in Kerala in my teens. I took a carpentry class in my 20s. I learnt cooking in my 30s and baking in my 40s. Now I use all those skills.”
As I leave, after buying packets of arrowroot biscuits, which are surprisingly good despite their faintly chalky texture, crisp raisin-oats cookies and a chicken sandwich (which turns out to be overwhelmed by rather average bread), he takes down a roll of brown paper and a pair of scissors. “You like the labels? I do them too.”

Soothing the spirit
","Scars on the body are apparent. But Mamta Mohandas wants a mind free of battle scars. The actor never concealed her intense fight with lymphoma. Between bouts in the hospital, she has lived memorable roles, a recent top recall being Janet (Celluloid). She hit the theatres again this week as the endearing Noora in Babu Narayanan’s To Noora with Love (TNWL).
Being Noora was therapy, says Mamta over the phone from Chennai. The actor who fought spiritedly when she was first diagnosed with lymphoma admits relapses were tough. “I went mad, I did lose it.” She may have responded to the illness differently each time, but the constant was her succour – cinema. Films drew her out of the abyss first time around, it did so now. When real life was saddled with scans and tests, tubes and needles, films lent her a semblance of the normal. “This profession helps you feel normal as you try to look the same. When you see yourself in the mirror, you look good and fresh. No other job can offer you that,” says Mamta. Films not only took care of her physical self, it cocooned her mind as well. “I took on TNWL when things were not going well. I needed something to latch onto, to work towards, to stay mentally motivated to see through my treatment,” says Mamta.
Mamta realised early it is the mind she had to watch out for amidst strenuous treatment. “At the hospital, they are constantly poking and pulling tubes into you – gore, blood, scan and tests are routine. Your body gets used to it. But what about the mind?” she asks emotionally. Earlier, she had walked into Kadha Tudarunnu and a State Award post her chemotherapy sessions. “I would push myself to be normal. For me my mental state is very important. If I did not do those exciting projects then, I might not have been so happy and my treatment would not have panned out so well,” believes Mamta.
For the actor who sought to nourish and nurture her spirit after an analogous stem cell transplant and subsequent complications, the sets of TNWL proved perfect. “It was nice to be in such a good unit. The idea of the film was put across to me by Krish (Sattar), the hero of the film. I was told my thattam-look in Anwar was widely liked. I heard the material, decided to be positive; get up and get going,” says the actor. Kaniha was an old pal, Archana Kavi became a new one. “We are even on WhatsApp under ‘To everyone with love’. I worked with a producer who was passionate about making a good movie. It was an endearing experience,” she says.
In the film, Mamta turns the do-gooder who sets her eyes on the happy-go-lucky Shahjahan. “Noora is greatly loved, she reaches out and helps ordinary people. The film captures beautifully a husband’s duty to his wife, contemplates on true love and how it breaks the thickest boundaries,” Mamta gets eloquent.
The actor admits physically it was tough to be on a movie set. “Yes, it was taxing. My energy levels were lower. I still have a long road to recovery.” Shooting in Kozhikode gave her the solitude she yearned — comfortably friendly, yet with a space of her own. She lived with her aunt, worked with people she knew from the Telugu film industry and was in a city whose restaurants and hotels she was familiar with. “It was important as I had to start falling in love with myself, keep my mind happy.”
The first time, Mamta plunged into an array of roles after recovery. Now she chooses to keep her mind clean.
“I haven’t planned. I am indecisive,” she says. She may be uncertain on films, but clear-cut about life. “When things are not good at all, you expect the world to treat you well. My friends and family have been through torture. I remember my dad telling mom that she has forgotten to smile. Now their happiness is what matters to me. My life is so different from others. I think of what is good for me right now.”
On Mamta’s immediate plan is a long-desired trip home — Bahrain. “I need that change. Every time I am in India working, all I had to do was go and come back, it was pressing the refresh button.” She wants to try out alternative therapies now that there is finally good news on the health front. Her priority now is dwelling on her inner sphere of calm.
“You just learn to be mature. I want to stay calm during the time of upheaval and watch silently the crazy world around me.”

Think before you pop an antacid
","Stress, restaurant food, not enough nutrition, irregular eating hours, no exercise…this is the sad story of most of our school and office-going population. Constipation, indigestion, bloating, flatulence and Irritable Bowel Syndrome are so commonly prevalent that it is now considered “normal” to pop pills and digestive aids. But we need to give our digestive system a lot more credit and attention than that. Second in intelligence only to the brain, the human gut secretes acids and enzymes that can break down the most complex foods for easy absorption. Our bodies and hence our lives are fuelled by the efficiency of this powerful body system and when it malfunctions — even slightly — it is time to sit up and take notice of our lifestyles. Restoring your digestion is not just a matter of eating better food and on time but also stabilising the digestive system through simple exercises to be done on an empty stomach.
Lie on your back.
Bend your right knee. interlock your fingers just below the knee and bring your thigh to your chest.
Keep the left leg straight and on the ground.
Inhale deeply and raise your head and shoulders off the ground and try to touch your nose to the knee.
Exhale and return your head to the ground and stretch your leg out.
Repeat thrice.
Now repeat with the left leg.
Bend both your knees to your chest and clasp your elbows.
Inhale and lift your head and shoulders off the ground and try to bring your nose in between your knees.
Exhale and return your head to the ground and stretch your legs out.
Repeat four times.

Warning: If you are pregnant, have high BP or hernia, avoid this posture. If you have sciatica or cervical issues, do not lift your head up.

War of the decoctions
","It’s tough for establishments in Mylapore to compete with some of the best home-brewed coffee in the area. It sets the expectation meter soaring among regulars who are not easy to please. Mami Tiffin stall serves an invigorating tumbler of coffee but Mylai Karpagambal Mess is our pick. The restaurant sources coffee seeds, roasts, grinds and brews its own trademark coffee.
The interiors have been refreshed slightly but given the constant flow of diners you can’t linger over your tumbler of coffee. If you are not counting calories sample the restaurant’s legendary Keerai vadai and sinful Badam halwa.
Address: 20, East Mada street, Mylapore, Chennai: 600 004 (opposite Rasi silks)
Iconic Udupi restaurants have been an integral part of the Chennai filter coffee landscape with their legion of die-hard fans. New Woodlands hotel that grinds and blends its own secret recipe with chicory is a natural favourite. If you want a piping hot cup of freshly brewed filter coffee at 1 am then there’s no better place than Mathsya at Egmore. The restaurant has been sourcing its Arabica beans from a single estate in Chikmagalur for decades. No tumbler and davara here but it is authentic Udupi-style filter.
Address: No: 1 Halls road, Egmore, Chennai: 600 008
Phone: (044) 2819-1900
Chennai wakes up earlier than any other metro, if there’s one restaurant that’s geared for the city’s early birds it is Saravana Bhavan. It’s the restaurant’s proximity to Marina beach where walkers start milling about even before daybreak. Some of those walkers are joined by late night revellers in search of their ‘pick-me-up’ on a Sunday morning. The restaurant starts buzzing with activity at 5:30 am as regulars and curious onlookers line up for one of Chennai’s most refreshing tumblers of filter coffee.
Address: No: 101, Dr Radhakrishnan Salai, Mylapore, Chennai: 600 004
Phone: (044) 2811-5977
This is tricky territory for five star hotels – they need to please local diners and adventurous travellers armed with local information and experiences. It’s tough to choose between two top class brews at Dakshin at Sheraton Park and Southern Spice at the Taj Coromandel. The Southern Spice coffee follows a rigorous manual and is crafted with full cream milk. It’s not just the coffee but it’s the showmanship that adds the X factor at the end of your meal. The ‘coffee pulling’ drill by their service staff almost never fails to wow international guests.
Address: No: 37, MG Road, Nungambakkam, Chennai: 600 034
Phone: (044) 6600-2827
It might be your shopping weary heels or that sudden urge for your caffeine fix. While the city’s malls have a plethora of ‘instant’ coffee options it’s not easy to find a cup of filter coffee that hits the spot; Madras Coffee house is a welcome exception. The chicory-free coffee here is spot on and probably the best coffee served in a disposable paper cup in Chennai.

What kills wine
","I am not here to demystify wine. I think it would be disservice to this fine beverage to even attempt it; allow me to explain.
There is something about the word ‘commercial’ that connoisseurs (not just of wine) abhor and corporates love. So strong is this term when used as an adjective, that the same bottle of wine with sediments can be considered indifferently ‘faulty’ in one case and beautifully ‘rustic’ in the other, all depending on whether the product is considered supermarket-scale commercial or boutique and artesian.
This leads us to further explore the question, just what exactly defines a wine as commercial? If success is a measure of commercial viability, then the most expensive Champagnes and Bordeaux clarets are commercial yet they don’t seem to lose consumers (not yet anyway). If the world commercial implies wines that are cheap then that is something rather subjective and one man’s prize will always be someone’s plonk.
In my knowledge, a commercial wine can be considered to be one which is made using grapes that are internationally famous, and in a manner that implies cognizance of taste, i.e. the person who drinks it should be able to identify the grape or style, even if s/he can’t tell much else about it. Such wines are safe fence-sitters, never too edgy or punchy, just safe mama’s good boys, delivering exactly what they promise and not a whiff more.
A lot of winemakers in a lot of countries indulge in this habit: to make ‘commercial’ wines. It almost becomes a problem that threatens the existence of other autochthonous grapes when a vintner decides to uproot a local variety and plant instead a Cabernet or Chardonnay patch.
This may sound like bowing to the ‘system’, but here’s why a winemaker may have to consider going the commercial way.
Say a winemaker makes some superb Nero d’Avola on the sun-kissed slopes of Sicily. He is known in all the nearby villages and there’s seldom a tourist who leaves without buying a bottle or two. Outside of that, the market is non-existent. Lack of knowledge about the region and the grape make international markets difficult to harness. And being a small winemaker, he can’t afford to start a campaign to educate the world about the wines of the region. If he continues like this, soon he shall have to sell and move out and people will only be able to talk about the legendary reds of the regions which alas wouldn’t exist anymore.
Then he hits upon an idea – a small patch of Merlot. The world knows the grapes and it is a fairly hardy type. If he can make a good Nero d’Avola, he can surely make a decent Merlot, one that would be easier to sell internationally. It could also possibly draw attention and consequently a demand, for his other wines. And soon enough he releases not just a Merlot but also a Sauvignon Blanc. These wines are more saleable and find quick acceptance in certain international markets.
In some places, his other wines, including the prized albeit unknown Nero d’Avola, also become popular slowly but in other markets, the demand for the ‘commercial’ styles continues to rise. Soon, the winemaker finds himself uprooting more traditional grape plantings to incorporate the popular varieties. This is how we end up endangering certain wine styles and this is why ‘people in the know’ consider commercialisation of wine a bad thing on the whole.
Let’s face it, when this happens in another artisan fields, like say textiles and tailoring, or cricket, people are quick to respond, vehemently voicing opinions et al. But with wines, it is this general slackness on the part of the people to not make an effort to learn, a numbing complacency to have everything broken down to the simplest possible forms that compels hapless winemakers to cater to dumbed down tastes.
Demystification is for join-the-dot sketches; to understand Picasso or Monet, some background study is necessary. Without curiosities and complexities, life would be but disguised ennui. And so it is with wines: one can tell you things about it but they need to be read, analysed, and memorised, before one can understand this beverage. Here then is the first lesson: there is no best wine, there never will be. The best part about wines is that each sip, no matter how undecipherable, leaves you more prepared and learned for the next.

A cauldron, a kettle and a frying pan…
","My journey to West Delhi last week triggered an avalanche of suggestions. Everybody I know seemed to know of an eatery in that area which demanded an immediate visit. But I had decided that I was going to go there only when I was certain that the food was going to be good. So when my friend NK said that he know of a good little food place on Pusa Road, I was intrigued. NK is not much of a foodie, so when he talks about food, I take notice.
Actually, I’d heard about this from a few other friends earlier, but hadn’t given it much thought. Then when NK mentioned it, I thought I should go there. And I did so earlier this week.
This place is essentially known for its kharora broth (goat trotters), though you also get brain curry (Rs.130), chicken and mutton rolls (Rs.130) and chicken soup (Rs.60 for a bowl). The gentleman who runs it is a genial Sardar called Tony Singh. If you move towards Pusa Road from Connaught Place, you’ll see a petrol pump next to Springdales School. Tony Singh is right there, and has been serving food for the last 20 years or so.
He stands on the pavement, with a huge cauldron, a kettle and a frying pan in front of him. A pile of roomali rotis is on the side for the rolls. I asked for some kharorey soup (Rs.100) and brain curry (which I love). He brings with him cooked masala which he mixes with other ingredients in the frying pan and gives you a hot plate of brain curry. I had it later at home with soft hot rotis, and enjoyed it.
The kharorey soup was delicious, with just some mild spices and flavourings. It was very light, and most nourishing, I thought. What I also enjoyed was the chicken soup, which Sardarji very kindly gave me a bowl of when he heard that I was a food writer. He put some chunks of boiled chicken in the bowl, and then topped it with chicken stock. He added a spoonful of ginger-garlic chutney to it, and then ended with a dash of chilli sauce and lemon juice. It was superb.
The place is very busy, and I could see people sitting in their cars, gorging on brain curry and rolls. If it’s this busy in summer, I wonder what it’s going to be like in winter, when it’s the season for trotters and chicken soup.
Tony Singh has his devout clientele, and I can understand why. For one, you don’t get kharorey very easily in Delhi these days. Two, his other dishes are equally good (though I must admit I didn’t have the rolls). And three, his stuff tastes really, really good.
NK, I must say, has demonstrated that he may or may not be a foodie, but he is certainly a foodie’s friend.

The sound of sizzlers
","The weather, in more ways than one, is beginning to be unkind. The nights are short, the days long and challenging. The heart though longs once more for days of leisure, nights of pleasure. As a poet said in similarly political volatile climate many summers ago, “Dil dhoondta hai phir wohi fursat ke raat din…” Those days are still to be hugged, those nights yet to be embraced.
The other day though I stole an evening of pleasure. The occasion, nay, the excuse was provided by the ongoing sizzlers’ food festival at The Claridges. It was to be my Pickwickian moment. For a man who swears by Dhaba cuisine, it takes more than a few sizzlers to turn up at any other restaurant in a hotel I have grown up loving, admiring. It was provided by some delectable company — a man who has been my friend through many a prayer and three charming ladies, each of whom added to the mood of the moment with their political insight, literary flourishes. And of course, their take on the food which, honestly, needed little recommendation.
However, as most people would appreciate, conversion, even partial, is not an easy process. Yes, I had momentarily kept aside my love for Dhaba, but the heart is difficult to please. So there, sitting at Pickwicks, I requested the chef if I could get to taste that delectable kabab platter from Dhaba. I was in luck. Soon, there were four kinds of steaming hot kababs on our table, each more tempting than the other. The best was the seekh, hot, soft and succulent.
It was a delicious, if politically incorrect way to begin our food journey. But didn’t I say I was in luck? Soon, I got a chance to make amends for my indiscretion thanks a Surf platter. It had Norwegian salmon, lobster, Chilean sea bass and the rest. With smoke and that gently sizzling sound emerging from the dish, it begged to be polished off in a hurry. Even potato wedges found happy takers. I didn’t linger over the platter; nor did my co-diners.
After Surf, it was time for Turf, not necessarily a case of classic alliteration but the platters with chicken, lamb chops and Cajun potatoes was not a bad follow-up. The downside was the tenderloin steak. It was a challenge for my fork and knife first, then my teeth.
What Pickwicks lost with tenderloin was more than adequately made up with the classic sizzler with stuffed chicken and slow roasted vegetables. Not one to even think of trying out any sausages, I piloted my friends across the table to skip over to the veggie platter which offered us cheddar stuffed eggplant, cottage cheese steak and chickpea patty. My years as a journalist with the attendant travelling had prepared me well to appreciate the offer. I took a helping, smiled, took another bite, smiled some more. The erudite women from the hotel were obviously loving it.
But, hey I had started the session on a note of political incorrectness by tasting a Dhaba platter. I decided to end the same way too. Once again I gave in to temptation. Once again, it was delectable. As for the journey, well, it had several enchanting moments, some tasty ones too.
Saying my good byes to the lovely ladies, I stepped out of the hotel with Aslam, my pious friend. As he got down from the car a few kilometres down the road, I switched on FM radio. A song, “Kitna Haseen Hai Mausam, Kitna Haseen Safar Hai” wafted across. I slunk into my seat. An evening of leisure continued with some more pleasure.

Fried and flavourful
","Very few people view Japanese food as comfort food. Many even have a perception that everything served in a Japanese restaurant is raw. But not to forget is the Japanese Teppanyaki cooking style where the food is cooked on a hot iron griddle. And it is one of the most exciting ways of cooking in any cuisine where the chef with all his jugglery skills displays a wonderful theatrical session with food.
A restaurant doing it with ease and finesse in Delhi is Shiro in Samrat Hotel, New Delhi. It is quite popular for its Teppanyaki cuisine and also as a party destination with good music and food to compliment. It is one of my favourite places to dine in as I just love its serene ambience. However, it was my first experience with the teppan chef there recently. It was a Monday and hardly any crowd was there. Out of the three Teppanyaki tables at Shiro, mine was the only one which was occupied. A USP of teppanyaki food is that it is cooked right in front of you and is served directly onto the plate.
I had a good time interacting with the chef whenever he added an ingredient to enhance the flavours of the dishes he was cooking for me. My meal started with a Miso soup which was smoked to perfection and was very flavourful. The chef started making Japanese fried rice with egg in it. Once cooked, he formed a heart out of the fried rice and cut it from the centre and served saying, “Sir, here is a piece of my broken heart.”
He then cooked chicken breast in hoisin sauce. At Shiro, you can choose from 13 sauces or different flavours to go with the choice of meat. Prawns in lemon, scallion and garlic butter sauce was tasty but had a very viscous texture. Scallions lost their flavour as garlic butter overpowered it a little too much. Basa in Thai fresh red chilli and prawns in spicy laksa were good, specially the fish. Though prawns seemed to be bland and lacked the typical aroma and flavour of laksa.
I finished my main course and the bowl of Japanese fried rice which I loved. But how can a dinner be considered complete if it’s not ended with a dessert? Being at Shiro simplifies the task for you can choose from its chocolate lava cake with eyes closed.

Meal for two: Rs.4000 plus taxes

The royal flavours of Awadh
","Known for its royal cuisine with delectable flavours, Awadhi cuisine has a specific style of cooking that brings out the real essence of the delicacies. “The bawarchis (cooks) of Awadh were the ones who first brought the concept of the ‘dum’ style of cooking or the art of cooking over a slow fire. It is this combination of slow cooking with perfect ingredients that brings the flavours,” says Chef Bulai Swain of Euphoria which is currently hosting an Awadhi Food Festival.
The Awadhi cuisine is originally from Uttar Pradesh’s Awadh region, which is a part of Lucknow now. Greatly influenced by Mughal cooking techniques, it bears similarities to the cuisines of Persia, Kashmir and Hyderabad. “The richness of Awadhi cuisine also lies in liberal use of ingredients like mutton, paneer and rich spices including cardamom and saffron,” Chef Swain explains.
And indeed, the kebabs dished out at the festival have a fine flavour of the spices that brings a delectable softness. One of the must-haves in the menu is the Kakori Kebab. This Mughlai dish has minced lamb marinated with a mix of ingredients and almost melts in the mouth.
The Nawabs considered cooking as a distinct form of art and were rather touchy about it , the chef tells us. Thus, you will find that every dish has been carefully presented with a distinct artistic touch.
One of the features of this cuisine is the Dum Pukht process, which involves sealing the ingredients in large ‘handis’. “There is an underlying sweetness in most of the dishes; that’s typical of Awadhi cuisine,” says the chef.
The Awadhi Biryani, unlike the Hyderabadi one, is simple and meaty wherein the rice and the meat are cooked separately and then mixed together. Some of the other dishes in the a-la-carte menu includes Dum Pukth Galouti Kebab, Mutton Boti Kebab and Murgh-e-Kalmi. The main course includes Khade Masala Ka Ghosht, Nihari Ghosht, Makhmali Murgh, Saffron Murgh and Nargisi Kofta with Ulta Tawa Paratha and Rumali Roti.
Vegetarians fret not. There are some delicious options in the menu like Veg Seekh Kebab, Badam Pasanda and Khumb Palak Kofta. And to wrap the culinary tour to the erstwhile kingdom of Awadh, there some delicious desserts like Shahi Tukra and Sohal Halwa. The restaurant’s live musical band enlivens the entire experience with a string of ghazals.

The festival is open for dinner till May 11.

Increasing cases of chickenpox, measles surface
","The sultry weather has brought with it an increasing number of cases of chickenpox, measles and viral fever among children.
State-run hospitals in the city are receiving at least three cases of viral infection daily. Some private hospitals and clinics have also reported high incidence of such infections. However, it is not an outbreak, and the disease has not reached alarming levels, said doctors.
According to doctors, most cases are going unreported because of the superstitious beliefs followed by some parents who feel that the infection in their child is because of the “blessings of a goddess”.
At the State-run Indira Gandhi Institute of Child Health, at least four cases of chickenpox and two cases of measles are reported daily. According to the institute director R. Premlatha, most of the cases are from orphanages and overcrowded places where summer camps are being conducted in the city.
S. Pushpalatha, head of the Department of Paediatrics in Bowring and Lady Curzon Hospital, said the incidence of chickenpox is usually high between February and April as the weather is conducive for varicella-zoster, the virus that causes the infection, to thrive. “Children aged above two are usually affected. Adults, who have not had chickenpox, are also likely to be affected,” she said.
Dr. Pushpalatha, who is also seeing a considerable number of measles cases, said the infection could be spreading from overcrowded areas and slums where there is a possibility of some children having missed the routine immunisation.
Measles is one of the most contagious viral diseases caused by a virus from the paramyxovirus family. Infected children develop fever with rashes all over the body. The virus depletes Vitamin A in the body, she said.
If the baby has been vaccinated against measles before nine months, there is a possibility of maternal antibodies interfering with the vaccination, making it ineffective. This could be another reason for the spread of the disease, Dr. Pushpalatha said.
Paediatrician H. Paramesh said both chickenpox and measles could affect the brain, if not treated early. Chickenpox symptoms include low fever, running nose, cough and loss of appetite. According to the doctor, most parents do not bathe the infected child, which is wrong. The child should be bathed with an antiseptic soap daily for the infection to subside quickly, he said.

I am... Shilpa C. – Yoga instructor
","“My association with yoga was a coincidence. My mother had some health issues and I began to attend yoga classes at the Satyananda Yoga Research Centre to give her company. It was a one month course, but I soon realised the virtues of yoga. It opened me to a world I had never known. That was way back in 1999 and after practising yoga for 4-5 years regularly, I did the Yoga Teachers Training Course at Satyananda and became an instructor here. Since I held a teaching job for a while, I taught yoga at the centre in the evenings.
Yoga, for me, was a life-changing experience. I had weight problems which were kept in control with yoga and strict diet. Lot of other health niggles I had reduced considerably once I started yoga. It made my body more flexible. The biggest takeaway though was what yoga did to my mind; it relaxes the mind completely. My personal yoga sessions are for an hour in the morning.
I believe there are many misconceptions about yoga among people. When they think yoga, they think acrobatic postures. Yoga is about doing in a slow, relaxed way postures your body is comfortable with. But it is important to do it regularly to bring about change. Even simple asanas can relax you tremendously.
Here I do not teach very advanced courses. If people have health problems like high blood pressure or back pain, asanas that suit them are prescribed. In yoga, the mind is given as much significance as the body. It is through the mind that one can control the body. So here I teach meditation, yoga nidra (a relaxation technique done in shavasana) and pranayam too.
Most of the students who join for the month-long course are those around 40 and more. I don’t see many youngsters may be because they prefer something more active like being in a gym. Most sign in for a course when life-style related diseases have begun to raise their head. Not many are taking up yoga just to remain fit. But of course people are more fitness conscious now. In fact, people should not wait till they have some kind of illness to begin yoga. As they say, prevention is what one must be looking at. Of late, we have had many senior citizens too learning yoga. They are dedicated and they also have time on their hands. I tend to see that women are much more committed once they start out on something like this.”

Labour that sweetens jaggery!
","Several outlets exclusively selling Andhra sweets here are now offering those made of jaggery as a speciality. But making jaggery itself is a back-breaking work.
The juice obtained by crushing sugarcane will be directed onto a huge crucible set on a pit. After having adequate juice, it will be boiled using the heat produced by burning bagasse. A person will keep stirring it with a ladle until it acquires the right thickness and later pours into vessels solidifying into lumps of 15 kg each.
In the peak season, they work round the clock producing 50 lumps in one round. In 24 hours, seven rounds can be made. The season lasts from November to March and generally, farmers have their own jaggery crucibles, says Karri Sanyasi Naidu, who runs a jaggery making unit at Tallavalasa. Farmers are finding raising casuarinas more profitable nowadays as making pulp is comparatively easy.
“For three years, a farmer gets around Rs. 2 lakh on casuarinas plantation. On sugarcane, if we are investing Rs. 3.5 lakh, we more or less get the same amount,” says a farmer at Tallavalasa. To make jaggery, a farmer also has to employ at least three persons to work at the unit.
For one round, around Rs. 2,700 to Rs. 3,000 is earned and a farmer is left with around Rs. 1,000, he adds.

Aminabad platter
","During a party for a British officer at the Nawab of Awadh’s residence, a particular kebab became the centre of attention. The officer loved the fine mince skewered kebabs and asked to see the chef. Complimenting him, he asked for the name of the kebabs so that he’d know what to ask for. “But the bawarchi had no idea; he’d just made up the recipe. The chef came from Kakori, a small town near Lucknow, and so the kebabs were given a name,” recounts Shahnawaz Qureshi, sous chef, Saffron, JW Marriot, on how the Kakori kebab originated.
Regaling me with Awadhi tales heard from his maternal grandfather, Qureshi plays the perfect host. But instead of serving up the famed Kakori kebab, he insists I try the gilawati kebab, literally meaning melt-in-the-mouth. Rather than skewered and barbequed on charcoal like the Kakori, these round kebabs are fried on the tawa. According to the menu, the lamb is ground to a velvety smooth texture, marinated and cooked in over 18 different spices. “Oh, that’s just what we write on the menu! We use a lot more spices; way too many to count,” says the chef, refusing to reveal his secret recipe.
One of the oldest and best-known eateries to serve gilawati kebabs in Lucknow’s Aminabad bazaar is Tunday Kababi. The restaurant, which has been around for about 100 years, gets its name from its owner. “He had a slightly disfigured arm so everyone called him tunday. The name stuck,” says Qureshi. The restaurant’s reputation is such that gilawati kebabs are often referred to as Tunday kebabs.
“Aminabad is one of the most popular food streets across the world,” says Qureshi, whose first job was at a restaurant in the area about 10 years ago. “I learnt the tricks of the trade at Arabiya restaurant, right opposite Tunday Kababi.” Qureshi has fond memories of eating mewe ki kheer, harey masale ka kheema, nalli nihari, and bhuna gosht in Aminabad.
Though Arabiya was Qureshi’s first stop in a professional kitchen, he had a head start in cooking. “It is a khandaani pesha (family profession),” claims Qureshi, whose paternal grandfather and father were both butchers. “Butchers are always fine cooks as well. They know exactly which section of the animal to use for a particular dish. nalli nihari, for instance, is made best with the meat just above the trotters.”
The first time Qureshi cooked, he ended up replicating the Hyderabadi kacche gosht ki biryani. “I was barely 17 and didn’t even know the dish existed! I made it by accident and my mother recognised what I’d created. That’s when she gave me all the cooking secrets her father had passed on to her, such as using jaiphal (nutmeg) in mutton biryani, or using spices such as khas ki jadh (dried vetiver roots) or the popular Lucknowi spice pipri to add a sourness to the kebabs.”
Food was always an integral part of his life. “I had two sisters and three brothers and all of us have a passion for food. If the handi (dish) of the day didn’t turn out well, it ruined everyone’s mood,” he laughs. Despite having worked at a number of five-star properties across the country, the nalli nihari his mother made is still his favourite. “The nihari was made of either beef or mutton, which was left to cook in a stock in the clay oven all night long. We would wake up with the aroma filling our home. It always made my day,” he says nostalgically. Although he now cooks nihari in refined oil to make it lighter, he admits that the best way is to cook it in mustard oil. “Heat the mustard oil in the pan, then add a little salt and water. That helps to soften the flavour,” is his tip.
We sample the chef’s special koh-e-Awadh instead. The incredible falling-off-the-bone lamb is served in delicious gravy. “The cuisine of Awadh has no use of tomatoes. The fruit was introduced much later,” he says.
During the course of our meal, I’ve sampled some of the best of his Awadhi starters, as well as his signature dal-e-khaas. However, I have a long way to go before I have sampled all of Awadh’s delicacies. So when Qureshi claims that the cuisine uses spices such as ajwain and saunf to aid digestion, making it summer-proof, he has inadvertently encouraged me to call on him again!

Karnataka forced to explore options to procure millets
","The State government is forced to consider other options for procuring millets for distribution under the public distribution system (PDS) as it could not meet the requirements from open market.
It is estimated that 30,000 tonnes of jowar and 25,000 tonnes of ragi are needed for distribution under the PDS along with rice every month. However, only around 14,000 tonnes of ragi and hardly any jowar have been procured by the Department of Food and Civil Supplies from open market.
Officials said the offer price of Rs. 1,500 to Rs. 1,800 per quintal for both jowar and ragi had deterred farmers from selling them. The recent hailstorm damaged jowar crop on large tracts of land in north Karnataka. With reduced supply, the price has shot up beyond Rs. 35 a kg, a senior officer said.
“We are committed to providing the foodgrains. We have succeeded in providing parboiled rice in coastal districts and ragi in some south Karnataka districts at least to a small extent,” Harsh Gupta, Commissioner, Food and Civil Supplies, said.
“We are exploring other options for procurement of jowar and other foodgrains,” he said.
According to him, the options include decentralised procurement and distribution, and working with cooperative institutions and farmers’ organisations.
“The first option is to buy foodgrains from farmers directly at Primary Agriculture Cooperatives (PAC) or Raitha Samparka Kendras (RSK). This will avoid the involvement of intermediary agencies or middlemen. Farmers will get an assured market for what they grow. For us, it will reduce the logistical hassles of centralised procurement from multiple agencies. We could also save on the cost of storage and transport. We also want to experiment with decentralised distribution at the village level, at least in some taluks,” Mr. Gupta said. “We are also inquiring if any cooperatives could help us in this task,” he said.
A pilot project to include minor millets such as bajra and sajje on the list of foodgrains to be supplied is on the cards. “Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha units in some districts have volunteered to work with non-governmental organisations such as the Deccan Development Society to help us procure and distribute minor millets. This will involve creating awareness about the nutritional values of these millets and encouraging farmers to grow them and people to consume them. We want to start the pilot project in Heggadadevanakote and Aurad taulks,” he said.
M.S. Sriram, IIMB fellow and visiting faculty, said decentralisation of procurement and distribution was the “best available method”. “It minimises logistics issue and reduces cash exchange points. It, however, needs to be planned in detail. We need to start with a map of what foodgrains are needed in each district. Then, we need to empower the PACs or RSKs to enable to them procure and distribute the foodgrains. Thirdly, the government should devolve financial powers to gram panchayats and enable officials at the village level to take decisions. Long-range planning and effective implementation will ensure success,” he said.
“The government can also look at gradual reduction of physical distribution of grain and increase use of innovative methods such as direct cash transfer or issuing food stamps. These will reduce costs and increase effectiveness of the delivery mechanisms,” Prof. Sriram said.

New method to ripen mangoes
","A new and legitimate method of ripening mangoes has been introduced.
Food Safety Officers stepped in to guide vendors for ensuring the quality of mangoes.
The vendors were trained to use ethylene to ripen mangoes. Ethylene, secreted from mango trees, was used in liquid form to apply on mangoes, District Designated Officer, Food Safety and Standards Act (FSSA), M. Jagadis Chandrabose told The Hindu here on Friday.
The ethylene liquid should be sprayed on mangoes and it would make mangoes ripen in a day or two thus making them fit for consumption as per FSSA norms.
Ethylene produces natural gas initially but ripens mangoes, kept in a favourable atmosphere.
Ten ml of ethylene liquid needs to be dissolved in ten litres of water for spraying it on considerable number of mangoes. With this, sweetness, nutritional value and palatability of the fruit would remain intact, he said.
Explaining adverse effects of artificially ripened mangoes done with the help of calcium carbide, a harmful chemical compound, he said the latter would emit acetylene gas causing health disorder like ulcer, insomnia, loss of appetite.
Such practices were adopted by vendors to skip warehousing expenditure and make a fast buck. Consumption of such mangoes might lead to cancer, he said.
With such a substance, mangoes could ripe within eight hours.
These mangoes would be colourful and attractive but its pulp would not be sweet, Dr. Chandrabose said. He added that surprise raids would be conducted in stalls to check any illegal method of ripening mangoes.

","Officials of the Department of Food Safety and Drug Administration conducted checks at mango godowns for adherence to quality norms in the city on Friday morning.
A team led by District Officer for Food Safety and Drug Control G. Karunanidhi checked 15 godowns in order to ensure that the mangoes were not ripened using carbide stones.
As the mangoes have just started arriving, we wanted to ensure that only naturally ripened mangoes are kept in the godowns, Mr. Karunanidhi said.

A touch of Swiss
","Stepping into the cool confines of Ottimo Cucina Italiana at ITC Grand Chola is a blessed relief from the searing Chennai heat.
Through the open kitchen one can see Peter Wyss, who has been part of the luxurious Gstaad Palace in Switzerland for 41 years now. Chef Wyss is in India as part of a four-city tour organised by Four Seasons Wines to promote the pairing of Indian wines with international food. Ironically, Four Seasons Wines is not registered in Tamil Nadu due to state government regulations, and so the restaurant is not permitted to serve the home-grown wine.
Nevertheless, we sit down to lunch with Abhay Kewadkar, chief winemaker and director of Four Seasons Wines and Ajit Bangera, senior executive chef, ITC Grand Chola. Our meal begins with a refreshingly pink cocktail of re-carbonated white wine blended with lychee juice, pomegranate seeds and crushed ice. The cute little tartlets filled with Gruyère cheese, served as starters, are quite delicious. The salad that follows is pretty basic, greens and pine nuts, with tomato marmalade adding an interesting element.
Chef Wyss says, “What I liked about cooking here in India is that everything on the menu is seasonal. Back at Gstaad, we source ingredients like strawberries and mangoes from all around the world.” Hence, his Swiss version of risotto, which is thicker than its Italian counterpart, comes with a generous smattering of fresh, diced vegetables, topped with mountain cheese. It turns out to be a tad too salty and quite heavy. One can imagine savouring such a dish in a chalet on the Swiss Alps, but for Chennai’s muggy weather, it doesn’t do much.
A potato röschti topped with succulent grilled chicken and mushroom sauce follows. It’s excellent paired with a glass of red wine. Dessert, as they say, was truly the icing on the cake. A tart composed (there’s no better way to describe this creation) of melt-in-your-mouth puff pastry topped with sliced apples, caramel sauce and a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream is the highlight of the meal.
Chef Wyss says, “India could be making better wine than France in 20 to 50 years. There is a lot of competition and it takes time, but I believe it will happen.”
He then passes us some freshly-made macrons and delightful Lindt chocolate: what better way to end a feast.

A different experience
","Five years ago, I visited a friend in Mumbai, and chanced upon a Bohri wedding that was taking place in her neighbourhood. Invited for the celebrations, I found myself tasting Bohri food for the first time.The flavour of the food stayed with me, and years later, I got the opportunity in Delhi to revisit the taste when I got an invitation from K3 restaurant at JW Marriott to attend a Bohri Food Festival.
I was introduced to Chef Musakir Khan, in town from Mumbai to organise the festival. Before the meal, the Chef explains Bohri food to me. He says, “A Bohri meal starts with a pinch of salt and is followed by sweet dishes. Traditional Bohri food is eaten by eight people from a large plate. It gives the feeling of community eating.”After the pinch of salt, I startmy meal with Malida. It is a suji dish, mixed with eggs and boiled milk, and then fried with ghee and melted jaggery and dry fruits. Chef Khan has more than 16 years of experience with Bohri food. His knowledge of the cuisine is amazing. Explaining the speciality of the cuisine further, he says, “We use very little spice and oil in our food. We don’t use red chillies.”
The next round of dishes arrives, which includes nargis kabab, meat cutlet, chicken patty and kokum batata. The non-vegetarian starters are succulent and tender. My main course comprises the popular dabba gosht and mutton biryani. In dabba gosht, mutton pieces are marinated in ginger, garlic and chilli, stewed with whole spices in a cashew and onion gravy, topped with an egg and baked. The meat is boiled to make it tender and then cut into small pieces. Then macaroni, egg and cashew are added to the mix before it’s put in the oven. The dish is very different from the usual non-vegetarian fare, and highly enjoyable. The mutton biryani is also quite different from the ones we usually find in restaurants. In this version, the garlic and ginger are added before the Dum is put in. “Only those people can make the perfect Bohri food who have knowledge and understanding of this cuisine. And perfection comes with years of experience, as well as spending time with this Bohra community,” adds Chef Khan.

This fest ends on May 4. Meal for two: 3300 plus taxes

Flavours of its own
","Rosang Café is a journey of the passion and hard work of a woman who came to Delhi from Mizoram a decade ago with her baby in her lap. She always wanted to give her daughter a good education and exposure to grow in life. Mary Lalboi opted to serve people with food of all the Northeastern States.
New to Delhi, she first started at Safdarjung with a small eatery. Mary recalls, “When a customer asked for water, I used to say ‘Fridge is on the left, go get it’, as my baby used to be in my lap all the time.” That’s a glimpse of the homely environment which Rosang is famous for. Then she shifted to Hauz Khas village market, which made Mary quite popular amongst youngsters. Mary, who was very active on Facebook, started uploading pictures of prominent people who used to visit the café quite often. But as sealing issues cropped up, Mary had to shut Rosang for the second time. But nothing could dent her passion and zeal and now she is back with a much bigger outlet next to the Green Park metro station.
As soon as I entered, I saw Mary sitting in a corner wearing a traditional North Eastern costume. Simple wooden furniture and pictures of the North East make up the ambience. The menu has all the major dishes from the eight States. Chicken dry, fried and stuffed with sesame seeds was my first bite and it impressed me with its flavours and crunchy yet juicy texture. Maroi bora, Manipuri style fritters, with chives from Manipur, also had a very distinct flavour. Tokhan, a chicken curry from Tripura, aksa meh with seasonal herbs, was redolent with flavours and went well with wild rice, a specialty of Rosang. Worth a mention is iromba chutney made out of fish paste which goes well with everything. There are no lamb or mutton dishes on the menu.
Two points to keep in mind: Rosang’s flavours are for people with an evolved palate. Secondly, end your meal with a wild rice kheer whenever you visit Rosang.

Meal for two – Rs.600

Morning socials
","Tucked away in a corner of Anna Nagar, the Gandhi Park is abuzz with activity well before the crack of dawn. From walking to jogging, most people find their own pace to move around the park, while some others play a game of badminton and a few more take part in a group yoga session. The children keep themselves occupied on the swings and the monkey bars or walk along side their parents, looking at the morning sunlight dripping in through the canopy of trees. As the summer sun signals everyone that it is time to wrap up their morning workout session, Palanichamy and his wife, Lalithabai, who are practitioners of Siddha, walk in with a home-brewed Siddha drink to kick start everyone’s morning. A concoction made of many Indian herbs such as betel leaves, neem, omam and pepper, the drink proves to be a socialising agent for all the fitness enthusiasts around.
People from all walks of life gather around to chat over their morning health drink which has become an indispensible part of their workout sessions. Retirees, advocates, bank managers, railway officers and people from different professional disciplines sip their drink and voice their concerns about the social and political issues of the day. Over a cup of health drink, the early risers of Anna Nagar have found a place to meet and make friends, often discussing problems from work and life, to clear their mind before they start their day. “We have too many personal and social responsibilities during the day, so we only get to do this in the mornings”, says Nallaperumal and complains that without the drink he feels sluggish throughout the day.
The brewers of this famous concoction, Dr. Palanichamy and Dr. Lalithabai, are retired Siddha doctors who fell in love while they were qualifying themselves in Indian medicine. After travelling through South India, educating people about various Indian herbs and medicines, the couple moved to Chennai to enjoy their retirement. For 11 years they frequented the park before they came upon the idea of providing their home-brewed drink to their old friends and now, many new ones. “It’s all about sharing what you know,” says Dr. Palanichamy, who smiles generously at everyone and holds the same views about happiness. “When we’re happy in life, it is important to spread the happiness to those we come across.”
Married for the last 40 years, the retired doctor couple still seem very much in love with each other and with life. Dr. Lalithabai’s love for variety makes sure that the morning drink she makes has different ingredients and flavour every day. To mark the beginning of the summer vacation, a health drink that tasted deceptively similar to lemon juice was made for the children who’ve begun to visit the park in the mornings. This just goes to show that whatever your age, your profession or preferred morning exercise routine, the morning socials in Gandhi Park will be more than happy to have you join them.

Going all out for fitness
","Keeping the body fit is a passion for some people, and they are willing to go to any extent to achieve their objective.
A few fitness groups in the city have adopted quirky exercise models of their own to keep their enthusiastic members fighting fit.
While gymnastic master A.R. Eashwar’s group troops to the Thiruvanmiyur beach on Sundays to perform gravity-defying stunts, the Oval Crew led by Yohannan John undergoes a rigorous exercise regime during the week at Oval ground in Besant Nagar.
Mr. Eashwar, a martial arts expert in taekwondo, fencing and kung fu, and his group of students practise gymnastics featuring back flips, somersaults and upshot positions on the sands to keep fit, even while enthralling spectators.
Mr. Eashwar trains people from all walks of life, from IT professionals to autorickshaw drivers.
The Oval Crew believes doing arduous physical exercises makes a person fit and independent during his/her old age. Co-founded by fitness experts Yohannan John and Sudhir Rao, the group, mostly comprising IT professionals, takes its name from the ground where they do their exercises.
The group has come out with a fitness module for three groups — junior, intermediate and senior.
*****
Good food has always attracted these youngsters. Now, they share their culinary secrets with customers.
Collegemates Sailesh Mohan, Prem Ravi and Nitesh Nagarajan, who work as engineers in different firms in the city, also run Saintwitches, a sandwich-making service for parties.
“Rather than spend our spare-time watching movies and eating out in restaurants, we wanted to do something useful. We thought we could do something with our passion for food. So we zeroed in upon sandwiches. We came up with eight combinations that we serve at parties,” say the trio, who, until recently, had a stall near the Jai Nagar park in Koyambedu.
Due to some problem with another stall at the spot, all the bunk shops were removed. They are now scouting for other locations where they can sell sandwiches in the evenings during the weekends. “We are thinking of providing complete event management services for parties. Nithesh is a very good photographer,” said Sailesh, who, along with Nithesh, does thecooking. Most times, Prem does the shopping, accounting and other back-end jobs. The group now operates from Sailesh’s kitchen at Arumbakkam.

In a first, skin harvested from non-brain dead patient
","Recently, the State saw its first skin harvest from a patient who was not declared brain dead, but had died of a cardiac arrest following liver failure.
The donor, V. Vinod Kumar (47) was admitted to Global Hospitals around three months ago with end-stage liver disease.
“He was in critical condition and was constantly in the ICU. Two months ago, the work up for a liver transplant was begun. However, a liver was not found on time and he fell very sick and passed away due to a cardiac arrest and septic shock on April 20,” said Rathan Kanagavelu, senior consultant anaesthetist and interventionist, of the liver department at the hospital.
“From the time my husband was admitted, he told his doctors that if he died, he wanted all his organs donated. When he passed away, I told the doctors to take whatever they could,” said Sridevi Vinod Kumar, the donor’s wife. “It feels good to know that his organs are helping others,” she added.

Eyes donated, too

Mr. Kumar’s eyes went to Sankara Nethralaya and his skin was harvested by G. Balakrishnan, medical director and consultant plastic microsurgeon of Right Hospitals. Dr. Balakrishnan said 2,700 sq. cm. of the skin was harvested and is currently being stored in the hospital’s skin bank.
When needed, it would be donated to the burns unit of a hospital where it would be used to help treat burn injuries.
The skin, cornea and bones, which are classified as tissues under the Transplantation of Human Organs Act, can be donated even when a person dies of natural causes. For the cadaveric donation of other organs such as the heart, liver and kidneys, the patient needs to be certified as brain dead before harvesting can take place, said a senior official of the State transplant programme.
He added that skin donation was now being encouraged and promoted by the State.

Old favourites back on the wedding menu
","On a warm Sunday morning, guests gathered at a ceremony in Kalapatti are taken in by the healthy breakfast. The menu is traditional, but far removed from the regular idli, dosa, pongal and poori. Instead, there are counters offering chola paniyaram, flat yet spongy thattai idli, kuthiraivali (barnyard millet) uthappam, methi poori and wheat halwa, with accompaniments such as peanut and curry leaf chutneys, among other items. As an antidote to the heat, there’s fresh sugarcane juice with a dash of lime or ginger. “It is exciting for us when people are keen to try out something different. In this case, the client requested us to come up with a breakfast menu that’s high on health,” says T. Rangaraj, CEO of Madhampatty Thangavelu Hospitality Pvt. Ltd.
The menu for both weddings and smaller gatherings is witnessing a gradual change, observe caterers in the city.
A small yet growing segment wants something new within the traditional framework for breakfast and lunch, and caterers are bringing back dishes that are nearly forgotten. “We’ve had varied requests, from the regular menu to a French Onion Soup,” says J. Dayalan of Kovai Caterers. The food differs according to the weddings and receptions hosted by different communities that have settled in Coimbatore, making it necessary for caterers to hire specialty chefs. So, Thai, Italian, Chinese and Mexican cuisine are also making their presence felt.
“Some want a mix of South Indian and Continental cuisines. To make this possible, we need to engage two master chefs. The price obviously becomes higher,” says Dayalan. From theplas and Rajasthani-style khichdis to Erode malligai idli, Kancheepuram idli and ragi puttu, choices are plenty.
The dessert section has also gone in for a churn. Think baked rasgullas, shahi tukda, elaneer payasam, Kerala-style ada pradaman with jaggery, pineapple rava payasam and idiappam topped with unrefined sugar on one hand, and trifle puddings and mini pastries on the other. “The regular kheer is considered boring. So we use seasonal fruits like jackfruit to make halwa and payasam,” says Rangaraj, observing that the clientele that wants a new menu is small, but growing. “Some people ask us for alternatives to pongal, which they feel makes a meal heavy. We suggest alternatives using millets such as samai arisi pongal or thinai arisi pongal,” he adds.
The scope is better to offer something unusual is better with smaller gatherings. For large gatherings, caterers and clients play safe and stick to popular choices. “In such cases, they make small changes, like replacing a regular sambar with kozhambu — vathal, ennai kathirikai, mushroom and vada curry kozhumbu varieties,” according to Friends Caterers managed by K.V. Subramaniam. Pidi sevai, idiyappam and kambu thayir sadam have also made their way into menus.
Want something that will appeal to children? Caterers are willing to set up counters for popcorn, cotton candy and sugarcane juice.
Says Mustafa, proprietor of Aasai Foods: “In Muslim weddings, biryani is preferred. We suggest Hyderabadi dum biryani among other varieties.” The salad spread is tweaked according to the profile of the guests expected. “Children may not like salads, so we suggest spring rolls stuffed with vegetables,” says Dhayalan.
The next time you attend a wedding, look out and you might be lucky to find something that reminds you of your grandmother’s recipe.

Go local!


Old favourites: Pidi sevai, paniyaram, Kancheepuram idli, ada pradaman, ennai kathirikai kozhumbu and jackfruit kheer are among the popular choices.

Bring in the new: Dinner menus offer scope to experiment, with counters serving up Italian, Mexican, Thai and Chinese.

Mother's recipes from all around
","She carefully adds pieces of fish to a pan and lets them sizzle and brown, before turning them to the other side. Her fingers tremble a little but her concentration is complete. She covers the pan and turns off the gas before turning to smile at me, “I’m making a fish pie for dinner,” she says. “It is one of my favourite dishes.”
Rachel Chacko may be ninety years old but she continues to pursue a passion of a lifetime—cooking. “My mother was a good cook too and I developed an interest in cooking while I was in school,” she says. “I really enjoy seeing other people relishing my food.”
It was her marriage to an army officer however that deepened her knowledge of cooking, “My husband always appreciated my food,” she smiles.

 It is a manual for a novice cook. I’ve tried to relate it in a manner that is easily understandable 
“As he was in the army we travelled all around the country. It gave me an opportunity to mingle with people from different communities at the parties organised by the army. Since we were posted to faraway army posts, other entertainment was difficult to come by and the army ladies would get together, share recipes and have cookery demonstrations. We began to assimilate the culture and food from all parts of the country.”
Over time, her collection of recipes grew, “Each time we moved to a new place, my husband would complain about having to cart the trunks of recipes along,” she fondly remembers.
When he passed away she realised that she had a lot of time on her hands and encouraged by her daughter, Geeta she began to compile a collection of her favourite recipes, “My daughter tells me that these recipes are very easy to follow and make,” she says. “It is a manual for a novice cook. I’ve tried to relate it in a manner that is easily understandable — I want it to feel like the words of an experienced mother telling her daughter what to do.”
Her book titled Mother’s Recipes, published by Notion Press and priced at Rs. 310 is a collection of 300 recipes divided into ten sections which include dips& beverages, soups, salads, rice&rotis, lentils, vegetables, fish/egg& meat, snacks& sweets and pickles and chutneys. “A lot are typical Malayalee recipes but there are recipes from other parts of India too,” she says.
“This is an ideal gift for a newly married bride,” she says. “Most modern young girls don’t know how to cook. The preparation of food is an expression of love and I hope my book will motivate my readers to rediscover the joys of cooking.”

It’s the malt of the earth
","Almost everybody who attended the whiskey appreciation event at EEST, Westin Velachery seemed to discern the many complex flavours of whiskey. All this was new to someone like me who followed the general rule of thumb, which is to slowly take the first sip and then gulp down the rest. Sensing my awkwardness, the evening’s host, Sandeep Arora, director of Spiritual Luxury Living, that provides consultancy and services in top-end luxury spirits in India, walked up to the table and gave me my first lesson in whiskey appreciation. “Today, you’re not getting drunk,” he said sternly. This is not the occasion, I told myself.
Through the course of the evening, we were to taste the Glenlivet Single Malt whisky — actually three of them all of which have aged differently. He picked up the glass that contained a 15-year-old Glenlivet and looked at it with awe, just for a moment.
“A little bit of water is enough to release the oils and its many flavours,” he said, adding some water to the whiskey. Holding the glass up, he said, “Look, look. Can you see the whisky opening up?” At this point, I sank into my chair. I had been doing it wrong all this while. My friend clarified her doubt: Is coke the worst thing to add to a glass of whiskey? “It kills the flavour,” replied Sandeep. If you are thinking that ‘on-the-rocks’ is perhaps the best way to drink it, apparently that doesn’t work as well. “Too much ice dilutes the whisky, but I leave it to you,” he said.
What is so special about Glenlivet that it deserves appreciation? “The Glenlivet variants are complex whiskeys. They have different layers of aromas and flavours. For instance, a 12- year-old Glenlivet has pineapple and Indian summer fruit flavours coming through. A 15- year-old whiskey is softer,” he says leaving me to my first drink of the night — a 15-year-old Glenlivet.
On this particular Saturday night, it was paired with pan-fried scallops, dim sums and sushi. To read from the menu, the liquor is supposed give out orange peel and grapefruit aromas and taste incredibly smooth. After making a mental note to crosscheck for facts, I ‘open’-ed up the whiskey as instructed and took my first sip. It was indeed smooth and sweet although it was difficult to understand the logic of why this particular scotch needed to be paired with this specific cuisine. “It is not as though Glenlivet should only be paired with Asian foods. It is difficult to embrace pairing because we all have different palettes,” he offered.
Next up on the menu was the 12-year-old Glenlivet, which was paired with the main course that consists of tenderloin teriyaki (beef), salmon or fried noodles with vegetables. The flavours felt a bit stronger than the previous one.
“Wait until you drink the 18-year-old, which is a lot more complex and has depth,” he assures. After hearing the word ‘complex’ for the hundredth time at the event, it was time to ask the basic question: what does he mean by complex? “Take Fanta, for example,” he graciously tried to answer, “There is only one single flavour – it feels orangey, right? When you are drinking a certain whisky, you should notice how it doesn’t have a single statement. There are different layers of flavours and aromas. That defines the complexity.” I nod in agreement.
We are served the dessert — triple coconut bliss, along with the final drink of the evening, an 18-year-old Glenlivet. The 18-year-old does feel more complex and is harsher on the tongue, just like how Sandeep said it would be. The taste lingers even after you have a spoon of coconut ice cream.
Hearing this, Sandeep replied, “Oh, many felt that the 18-year-old was the smoothest.”
As the informative evening came to a close, I was feeling good about myself — I did not feel high and I was learning to appreciate whiskey the way it needs to be. But, something was wrong. As I tried to get up, my legs refused to untangle themselves and that’s when my friend broke the news: I had had one too many, yet again.

Bye Bye Burgerman!
","In 2006, when McDonalds was nothing more than an urban legend, Burgerman was a brand that brought us double patty burgers and sausages on a stick, which only Americans on Star Movies and HBO ate during meal times. Burgerman was the result of a college project that went rogue and took over Chennai. Sunil Cherian, the owner of the brand, decided to serve fast food even faster when he found a way to make and dispense delicious burgers out of 25 sq. feet kiosks around the city.
Burgerman burgers had a unique taste, were easy on the pocket and made available to everyone through the 50 kiosks that opened in the city. Once we got hooked, we let ourselves get reeled right in! Soon, veteran customers took to being a part of the burger making process and asking for extra sauce, knowing full well that it would drip down their faces as they bit into their juicy burgers. Their delicious mayonnaise was for those who liked their burgers to be rich and creamy, the barbeque sauce was for people who liked their burgers to have a slightly sweet flavor and their fiery Mexican sauce was to appease the taste buds of those who liked Andhra food. Whatever combination of sauces we liked, the men who worked in the burgerman kiosks were always very understanding of our preferences and generous in their servings.
Those of us who were paying attention realized, starting from around 2009, a lot of the Burgerman kiosks in the city were beginning to be replaced by random burger brands. We found ourselves travelling all the way from Anna Nagar to Nungambakkam to eat our favorite brand of burgers. At a time when autos in Chennai did not run on meters and getting anywhere to anywhere required a good ten minutes of heated haggling, this was quite a level of commitment to feel towards a brand.
In 2014, the only kiosk standing is the one on Cathedral road and that too, just till the end of the month. Come May, the brand that fed Chennai burgers before McDonald’s found its way here will shut shop. “Burgerman started in my garage and the brand was built out of passion, I do not want to give it out to franchisees.”, says Sunil Cherian as he bids adieu to his burger brand, to take over his family business, after opening the 100 burgerman kiosks that he hoped to. “I still own the brand, I’m not giving that up. So the day Chennai needs a good burger place, we’ll come back”, says Mr. Cherian, laughing as he realizes that he sounds like quite the Dark Knight!

Man’s death leads to tension at GH
","The death of a 42-year-old man, who had sustained a head injury in a road accident, sparked tension at Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital (GH) on Monday morning. Family members said he had been on ventilator support and claimed it was disrupted after a brief power interruption at the Institute of Neurology’s head injury Intensive Care Unit (ICU).
But, hospital authorities said he was brought to GH in a critical condition with a severe head injury. His death was not related to the power disruption as every ventilator has battery back-up of two hours. A generator facility was also available, they said.
R. Ponmurugan, a resident of Triplicane, was injured after his two-wheeler skidded off the road on April 30. He was treated at a private hospital and shifted to GH on May 2. Doctors said his family members were informed about his critical condition on Sunday.
“He had bilateral temporal bone fracture and blood clot due to the injury. He was put on ventilator at the ICU. His condition was deteriorating and his blood pressure dipped on Sunday. Neurosurgeons tried to revive him but he collapsed on Monday morning. He was declared dead but his family members protested,” said a hospital official.
R. Mohan, a friend of the deceased, claimed the ventilator support snapped as soon as the power supply was interrupted. A doctor said the rains had caused sudden power disruption. “Even if the ventilator turns faulty, we have manual resuscitators (Ambu bags). There is no question of neglect,” he added.
Police sources said there was a brief power disruption around 5.20 a.m. but supply resumed within minutes.

Pecking on Peking duck
","A restaurant which is quite popular for its food as well as for its ambience is The China Kitchen at Hyatt Regency New Delhi. I would suggest making reservations in advance as the restaurant is packed even on a Monday. It’s wooden flooring and separate seating arrangements give the feel of a private dining room.
The reason for my visit this time is the launch of the new menu which has changed after a gap of six years. It now has more options for vegetarians though I feel it hardly makes a difference as the patrons at The China Kitchen still visit it to taste the kung paos and the Peking duck on offer.
Nothing better than a bowl of soup to start with when you are at an Asian restaurant. I order my seafood dumpling soup and it comes to my table pretty quickly. The piping hot soup is flavourful, has that perfect aroma of seafood which I just love. Though a pinch more of the seasonings would make it even better.
The hot soup is followed by a refreshing cold buckwheat noodle. Chilli sesame oil and vinegar give the noodles a subtle flavour which I enjoy till the last bit. Worth a mention is its colourful presentation.
The Chinese cucumber salad with some peanuts, however, is unexpectedly not up to the mark to be incorporated in a niche menu. Peking duck, one of the signature dishes, is still done in perfection here and tastes delicious. Honey chicken onion puff, a baked dish, is awesome too. A very tasty and yummy puff with the perfect crispness to complement the stuffing. Seeing the steam wafting from the huge steamer inspires me to have a platter of dim sums. Prawn siew mai to start with is nice but the batter is not at par and even the prawn is a tad dry. The vegetable dumpling with celery and mushroom stuffing is tasty. I miss my favourite har gao in the menu and satisfy the craving with a shrimp dumpling in a spicy vinegar broth.
For the main course, pepper crab, kung pao with some udon noodles and fried rice form a wholesome combination. The crab and noodles are good but the kung pao is disappointing. The sauce lacks the sticky texture and even the combination of sweet and sour flavours. I sign off for the day with a dessert platter containing a mi fresh fruits, crispy rolls, mango pudding and scoops of ice cream.

Meal for two: Rs. 6000 plus taxes

No crossover in the kitchen
","“I rather not eat the food I was not expecting.” Gurinder Chadha comes across as a different kettle of fish across the table. Going through the menu at Elan in The Lodhi hotel, she wants to distinguish between Rajasthani and Punjabi karhi and asks existential questions about ulta tawa parantha. “Why do you need to turn the griddle upside down,” she asks. Sometimes, she uses her husband as a taster before proceeding with a dish but here she is eager to play the role for me. “Can I order for you? I like the menu here for there are elaborate descriptions,” says Gurinder as she picks palak ki chaat and bhalle ki chaat to set the spicy tone for the evening. “I love the yoghurt stuff that you get here. We don’t get it in England. Many times I have tried to make chhach at home but I just don’t get the same flavour,” laments the British Indian filmmaker.
Adept at cooking, Gurinder — who was in India recently for the recce of her next project on Partition — is fond of an array of cuisines and has a number of experiences to narrate. “When I was in school, during cookery classes we used to make traditional English dishes. One of my favourites was Lancashire hotpot. It is from the North and is basically lamb fried with onion and you have it like a stew. When I brought it home I was very proud to show it to my mom. My dad had one look at it and then he made my mom re-cook it as lamb curry! In fact whatever I would make, they would ‘Indianise’ it with masala masoola and tadka laga as my dad would say. And I would cry: you guys are ignorant! Once I made chicken casserole and as usual they described it as bilkul pheeka (absolutely bland). Again my mom turned it into chicken curry, and he said, ‘She brought casserole and we turned it into casserolla’.”
Things have changed now as new generation British Indians can flaunt their spicy food openly. “Oh! Yes. I think what is interesting is when my parents first came to England whenever my mother would cook people, going past would make all sorts of faces, calling the smell awful. And 20 years later when the tables turned, people would come and ask what the recipe was. ‘Give me the recipe. That thing smells so good.’ Today curry is the number one food. You can find an Indian restaurant on every prominent lane. Indian food has become an important part of British cuisine.”
She cites how deep the relationship has become. “Halloween is a big thing in the part where we live. And making Halloween cupcakes with scary faces on them is the norm. But last year, we had a party and instead of making cupcakes, we made jalebis and put scary faces in the middle of each of them. They looked like a spider’s web.” Does she see a movie in these anecdotes? “May be…possibly,” she says after a pause.
From Thai to Jamaican, she tries her hand at a variety of delicacies. “My favourite recipe is aloo wadiya which goes well with a watery contraption of ginger and garlic. In England when the weather is cold and you have sore throat, this is the best thing. I also like kadhi chawal.” Then in Jamaican food she cooks chicken stew by using one of the hottest chillies in the world, the scotch bonnet. With her husband and long time collaborator (Paul Mayeda Berges) being of Japanese origin, wasabi is also an important ingredient in Gurinder’s kitchen. “I have different kinds of chillies for different cuisines. We try to keep it as pure as possible. No crossovers here!” she laughs. However, she adds, “There is not enough space to store all the ingredients in the British kitchen. The British cut it, grill it and boil it. They don’t need too many ingredients, but our case is different and my cupboards keep groaning.”
Gurinder feels a fondness for spicy stuff doesn’t mean that she has lost interest in the simplicity of British cuisine. After a round of spicy food when I crave for something plain, I bake potatoes in the oven and then we have it with cheese and tuna fish. That’s comfort food.” Right now ulta tawa parantha is here and Gurinder is glad that “we are breaking our roti in a smart restaurant!”

Ordering a cake is now as easy as pie
","It’s 11.30 p.m., and you are holed up on your couch watching reruns of Lost and it suddenly occurs to you that in less than half an hour it’s your best friend’s birthday. What do you do? Whom do you call? The Ghostbusters aren’t an option. But you could bank on >Caked.in to come to the rescue. Started a few months back by Vineet M. Benny, this 24-hour portal that delivers cakes around the clock, is a saviour for all those absent-minded, scatter-brained or just buried-in-work types.
“We do plenty of last-minute cakes because a lot of people, we’ve noticed, forget anniversaries and other special dates…” laughs Vineet. Their major chunk of business therefore happens between 11.30 p.m. and 2 a.m.
At Caked.in, in addition to the cake, you can also order bouquets, teddy bears, chocolates, or other desserts. And the good news is that delivery anywhere within the city is free. Their most popular feature however is the services of a ‘music man’. Imagine standing on your balcony as a musician strums his guitar and sings for your loved one. “It’s a service much in demand and the reason why we had to hire two musicians,” says Vineet, recalling the day four people had asked for the musician and what a challenge it was for him to race him from one point to another.
Caked.in manages at least 30 orders every day. “We always have extra cakes for emergencies. One of our challenges involved delivering a six-tier cake. Our delivery personnel usually travel by bikes, but in this case the towering cake had to be carefully taken in my SUV. We deconstructed it and then put it together at the venue.” A cake weighing more than 3-kg gets delivered by car, sometimes even in Vineet’s Audi.
While it is a joy to see a smile on surprised faces, the team at Caked.in has also had its share of not-so-nice experiences. “A guy wanted us to deliver a cake to his girlfriend. But the girl’s father opened the door and didn’t look too pleased. My delivery boy had to answer numerous questions till the girl came to his rescue…all the while her boyfriend watched, hidden in his car,” he laughs.
Vineet’s future plans include extending this service to other metropolises, starting with Bangalore. Guess as long as there are people who forget important days there will always be services like Caked.in

Only 12 per cent of city-dwellers breathe safe air, says WHO
","Only 12 per cent of the people living in cities for which air quality data is available, are breathing “safe” air, reveals World Health Organization’s Urban Air Quality database.
About half urban population being monitored is exposed to air pollution that is at least 2.5 times higher than the levels recommended by the WHO, putting those people at additional risk of serious, long-term health problems.
According to the WHO, air quality in most cities worldwide that monitor outdoor (ambient) air pollution fails to meet the organisation’s guidelines for safe levels.
WHO’s Urban Air Quality database that covers 1,600 cities across 91 countries has revealed that more cities worldwide are monitoring outdoor air quality, reflecting growing recognition of air pollution’s health risks. More than 120 Indian cities, including Delhi, Mumbai, Ahmedabad, Agra and Varanasi also figure in the list of cities with high pollution levels.
In most cities where there is enough data to compare the situation today with previous years, air pollution is getting worse. The factors contribute to this increase are reliance on fossil fuels such as coal-fired power plants, private transport motor vehicles, inefficient use of energy in buildings and the use of biomass for cooking and heating.
But some cities are making notable improvements, demonstrating that air quality can be improved by implementing policy measures such as banning the use of coal for “space heating” in buildings, using renewable or “clean” fuel for electricity production and improving efficiency of motor vehicle engines.
The latest available data have prompted WHO to call for greater awareness of health risks caused by air pollution, implementation of effective air pollution mitigation policies and close monitoring of the situation in cities worldwide.
In April 2014, WHO issued new information estimating that outdoor air pollution was responsible for deaths of some 3.7 million people under the age of 60 in 2012. The organization also emphasised that indoor and outdoor air pollution together are among the largest risks to health worldwide.
Measurement of fine particulate matter of 2.5 micrometers or less in diameter (PM2.5) is considered to be the best indicator of the level of health risks from air pollution.
In high-income countries, 816 cities reported on PM2.5 levels with another 544 cities reporting on PM10, from which estimates of PM2.5 can be derived.

Fasting test not required for gestational diabetes screening
","Diagnosing gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) in pregnant women in low- and middle-income countries with high diabetes burden, like India, has become easy thanks to the revised 2013 WHO guidelines. Any intervention that can prevent many more becoming diabetic therefore becomes important. The revised guidelines address the concerns faced by pregnant women with gestational diabetes in developing countries with a non-Caucasian population.
The revision comes 15 years after the world health body came up with its guidelines for diagnosing GDM. Meeting the requirements laid out in the 1999 guidelines was particularly challenging for pregnant women.
Diabetes that develops during pregnancy is called gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Though GDM most often resolves after delivery, the effects of elevated glucose levels in a pregnant woman tend to affect the foetus. Foetuses exposed to elevated maternal glucose tend to become big babies before birth (macrosomia). Such babies are at higher risk of becoming diabetic later in life much like the women who had GDM.
A simple solution to prevent this is to go in for universal screening of pregnant women for gestational diabetes and to keep the glucose level within desired levels — fasting plasma glucose 90 mg/dl and two hours after meal — 120 mg/dl. “But it was difficult to follow the 1999 WHO guidelines to diagnose GDM,” said Dr. V. Seshiah, Chairman of the Diabetes in Pregnancy Study Group India (DIPSI) and WHO expert committee member on GDM. He is also the Chairman of Dr. V. Seshiah Diabetes Research Institute and Dr. Balaji Diabetes care Centre, Chennai.
The 1999 WHO guidelines required a pregnant woman to come fasting for testing. The plasma glucose level was tested two hours after 75 mg of glucose was given to a woman. If the value was between 140 mg/dl and 199 mg/dl, the pregnant woman was diagnosed as having gestational diabetes. “The revised WHO guidelines retain the same value but the biggest difference is [that] women need not come fasting for testing,” Dr. Seshiah underlined. “A pregnant woman can come for testing irrespective of her last meal timing.”
The rest of the procedure remains the same. The non-fasting plasma glucose level is tested two hours after 75 gm of glucose is given to the woman. “If the two-hour plasma glucose measurement is between 140 [mg/dl] and 199 [mg/dl], she is diagnosed as GDM,” he said. “The 140-199 range for diagnosing GDM in pregnant women is the same as the one used for diagnosing impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) in non-pregnant adults.”
WHO’s non-fasting plasma glucose testing recommendation makes testing easy for pregnant women. The non-fasting test is patient-friendly and causes the least inconvenience to pregnant woman. The single-step procedure is easy to follow, economical, simple and evidence-based. “Women develop nausea or tend to vomit if they are given 75 gm glucose in a fasting stage,” Dr. Seshiah said.
Several studies done by a team led by Dr. Seshiah have found that the non-fasting test two hours after 75 gm glucose challenge had no statistically significant difference from the fasting test. The single-step procedure is followed in India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh.
Screening for gestational diabetes should be done in the first trimester (at least by 12-16 weeks). Earlier, the screening was done at 24-28 weeks. The reason why WHO does not recommend the late screening (24-28 weeks) is because by the 12 week, the beta cells develop in the foetal pancreas. And these foetal cells respond to the elevated maternal glucose levels. As a result, when the foetus gets more than the required amount of nutrition (glucose), it gets converted into foetal fat; the foetus thereby gains weight and becomes big. So, the earlier the screening of pregnant women, the better the foetal outcome.
Often, a modified meal plan (staggered, small portion meals) is sufficient to control the elevated maternal glucose level. “In our study, over 90 per cent of GDM women responded to a meal plan. Only 10 per cent required a very low dose of insulin,” he said.

Deciphering the cause of viral joint pain
","The chikungunya virus often leaves those it infects with severe joint pains. This could be the result of arthritic changes brought about by the virus getting into certain cells in the bone, suggests research that was recently published.
Suresh Mahalingam at the Griffith University in Australia and colleagues studied such changes using a closely related virus, the Ross River virus (RRV). This virus infected bone-forming cells, known as osteoblasts. The infected cells began secreting molecules that attracted certain immune cells (monocytes) and turned them into bone-devouring cells called osteoclasts. These osteoclasts produced arthritic bone loss, they reported in a paper in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
The work, along with other recent studies, suggested that infection by RRV and related viruses “may directly lead to arthritis” and could be amenable to forms of treatment for that ailment, write Kate D. Ryman and William B. Klimstra of the University of Pittsburgh in the U.S. in a commentary on the paper published in the same journal.
The authors showed that when the RRV infected human osteoblasts grown in culture, those cells began to produce various molecules, including some that served to bring monocytes to infected bone sites
The infected osteoblasts also began churning out interleukin-6 (IL-6), a molecule that induced those same cells to produce more of a protein, RANKL (receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappaB ligand). The binding of RANKL to a molecule on the surface of monocytes, which had been attracted to the infection sites, coaxed them to turn into osteoclasts, the cells that can break down bone.
Such differentiation into osteoclasts could be held in check by yet another molecule secreted by osteoblasts, osteoprotegerin (OPG), which locks on to the RANKL. However, IL-6 not only causes osteoblasts to ramp up RANKL secretion but reduces the amount of OPG they put out. This “disruption of the RANKL/OPG system can tilt the balance toward bone resorption,” noted Prof. Mahalingam and colleagues in their PNAS paper.
They found that the fluid drawn from the joints of RRV patients had elevated levels of the protein and lowered amounts of OPG. These patients also had higher levels of a protein marking the formation of osteoclasts. A previously published study carried out by a different group has shown that the chikungunya virus too could infect osteoblasts, leading those cells to secrete more IL-6 and RANKL as well as less OPG.
The scientists infected laboratory mice with RRV, and found that the virus could be detected in osteoblasts embedded in a membrane that surrounds bones. By about two weeks after infection, the mice showed “clear bone loss” at several places. They gave some infected mice an antibody that blocked IL-6, a technique similar to an antibody treatment for rheumatoid arthritis that is currently going through clinical trials. The mice that received the antibodies not only showed greatly reduced bone loss, but their RANKL-OPG levels also improved.
The work demonstrated that “IL-6 is a critical mediator of the RRV-induced increase in RANKL/OPG ratio and bone loss,” the scientists said in their PNAS paper.
Many chikungunya patients suffer chronic joint pains that lasted for months and sometimes years, observed Prof. Mahalingam in an email. “What contributes to this is not known. Our findings suggest that virus-induced bone loss might be responsible. Our findings also suggest that using existing drugs that target factors that trigger bone loss might be useful in treating patients.”
It is important to determine whether chikungunya and other viruses closely related to RRV also produced similar responses in laboratory animals as well as in humans, said Dr. Ryman and Dr. Klimstra in their commentary. The study may also shed light on the arthritis produced by a wide range of other viruses, including the one that causes dengue.

From flab to fit once more
","A few months after she delivered her first baby, a young mother posted a photograph of herself with a caption ‘getting back to shape project’ and Facebook friends of the former journalist were quick to cheer and motivate her. She followed it up with sporadic status updates, outlining her diet and fitness routines. Months later, she posted photographs of herself, much slimmer after all the working out.
Many young mothers choose not to be oblivious to post-partum weight gain. The intention to walk that extra mile and get back to being their former selves stems from a growing awareness towards being healthy and fit and the yearning to be a young, fit mother. “There’s a lot of peer pressure. I looked around me and realised all my friends went back to being fit in no time after pregnancy,” says Sunaina Sood, a mother of two.
Between golf, swimming, gym and jogging, Sunaina manages to keep herself fit amidst her family and work commitments. “Women today take on so many responsibilities that keep us on our toes because unlike the previous generation, we have only one or two children,” she adds.
The journey towards being healthy and fit begins during pregnancy with a firm focus on ‘eating healthy’ than ‘eating for two’. “The book ‘What to expect when you’re expecting’ was my bible and I was stuck by an observation that one could get away having an ice cream in normal condition but during pregnancy, the empty calories without nutrition are going to add to your waistline. I understood the need to eat sensibly,” explains Sunaina.
Women who habitually lead a healthy lifestyle find the path back to fitness easier to handle, observes fitness trainer Gavin Holt who mentions a young mother’s transformation from flab to fit in six months. But he also points to the danger of fitness turning into an obsession. “When new mothers come to the gym, we check their medical history — normal delivery or a C-section, and find out if they are nursing. Nursing mothers should take up easy to moderate workouts and have a regular, nutritious diet.”
In many cases, training new mothers calls for counselling to deal with post-partum depression. “Some women take time to cope with the changes in their body. They want to get back to their pre-pregnancy weight as quickly as possible and don’t like walking around with a sagging lower abdomen. We make them understand that it’s all part of a natural process and losing weight is not tough,” says Gavin. In the initial stages, he suggests working out as and when possible. Twice or thrice a week would suffice for women attending to the new born day and night.
Consistency and moderate exercise help in gradually knocking off extra pounds, notes trainer Faiyaz Ali. “One has to be rational. For nursing mothers, I would recommend a 20 to 30-minute workout that consists mainly of cardio and light weights. Going overboard can stress the body that’s witnessing hormonal changes,” he says. Faiyaz suggests maintaining an active lifestyle coupled with healthy eating habits. “I ask women to take it easy and be judicious with their workouts. The intensity can be stepped up eventually. I’ve come across mothers who are good runners. Think long term and don’t fret if it takes a few more months to get back in shape,” he sums up.

Fitness checklist

- Consult your doctor before you begin a fitness routine.
- Sleepless nights while attending to the newborn can make it tough to stick to a workout pattern. Begin with two days a week.
- Remember the basics — eat moderately at regular intervals and get enough sleep.
- Do not starve.
- Eating leftovers of baby food is not a great idea.
- Exercise can help overcome post-partum blues, so enjoy the process.
- Don’t give in to peer pressure to get back in shape. For some, the process takes only a few months while for others it might take a year or two. Be consistent with workouts.

Street-food in a comfortable setting
","If like me, you have lived in and around the same area of a city all your life, the subtle changes tend to pass you by. The narrow road next to the Cosmopolitan Club on Race Course is one such place I have often crossed, but seldom lingered and explored. Imagine my surprise when I heard from some foodie friends that there was an eatery situated on that very road. I couldn’t wait to check it out and the opportunity arose when I had I some house guests.
It seemed the perfect time to check out the highly talked of local fare. So, with friends in tow, off we went. It was a short walk from the main road and in the far distance the faint glow of a tube light suggested the presence of the eatery. As we got closer, we spotted a small illuminated board with Valarmathi Mess written on it. A noisy group of people, who looked quite satiated and happy, exited from an air conditioned room. Just before we entered we saw an open area which happened to the kitchen. Immediately noticeable was the standard of cleanliness which was quite impressive. The staff, attired neatly, seated us right away. In the absence of a menu, they relied on their memory to tell us the items on offer, assuring us that they would not get our order wrong.
Green banana leaves and stainless steel utensils were placed on clean granite topped tables. They served mineral water along with a choice of aerated drinks. The place was comfortable, and had not more than six to eight tables. Their repertoire included huge triangular dosas with a variety of fillings like masala, egg and kheema, veg and non-veg kothu parotas, chilli chicken, chilli paneer and pichhu pota kozhi, along with  many sea-food dishes, plain parotas and gravies. They said their lunch menu was even bigger.
The owner, a charming elderly gentleman, seemed rather surprised that it was my first time at his establishment. They have been around since 1986, serving the same fare. Only recently did they add the a/c dining room. He said they also had a loyal vegetarian clientele.
The food was piping hot, straight from the pan to the plate, and service was quick. The silence as we ate spoke highly of the food. In under an hour, we were done and all set to head back home. It may have been fast food, but by no means junk food.
A meal for five cost around Rs. 1,000. One can take away food as well. I’m glad I heard about Valarmathi Mess. It’s definitely a place to visit again, when you are in the mood for a quick bite loaded with the flavours of street food, served in a comfortable setting.
P.S. The owner Mr.Rajan said the Pallipalayam chicken they served was cooked with a recipe from his hometown.

Buzz your anxiety away
","Anxiety is a natural response created by your body to deal with situations of stress and tension. Though we don’t need to fight for survival now, the primitive part of our brain still considers life situations like deadlines, insecurity, financial woes, pain as threats to our continued existence and responds accordingly. Your heartbeat increases, breath becomes short and rapid, the adrenalin coursing through your blood diverts circulation from your vital organs to the limbs and your blood pressure increases — thus preparing you to fight or run as required.
Depending on your mental and emotional state, sometimes these natural responses don’t turn off, keeping you in a perpetual state of stress and ill-health. This manifests as nail-biting, teeth-grinding, short temper, breathlessness, high blood pressure, poor sleep and loss of appetite and libido. Yogic practices soothe the nervous system to calm you down and reverse the punishing effects of anxiety. The following is a simple practice where you mimic the buzzing of a bee to release the tension in your system. The action of creating sound also gives you a vocal vent to channel your stress — it is like shouting but in a healthier manner.

Bramhari Pranayama


(Humming Bee Breath)

Sit on a chair with your back straight, relax your shoulders and bring your chin parallel to the floor.
Close your eyes and take a few deep breaths.
Use your index fingers to close your ear flaps.
Part your teeth gently and keep your lips together.
Bring your attention to the center of the forehead.
Inhale deeply and as you exhale create a steady, smooth humming sound — like a bee.
Pay attention to the effect of the sound on your skull and face.
This is one round. Do up to 15 rounds.
Sip on water if your throat gets dry.

Bowled over by bamboo
","I have come to the conclusion that the giant pandas are pretty smart. Just because they look cute and cuddly doesn’t mean that they are not sharp. They eat bamboo — shoots, stems and leaves — through the day, and almost nothing else. I had a very nice bamboo meal earlier this week, and now I know why the giant pandas go for bamboo.
It’s because bamboo tastes good. And especially so when it is served with soft pork belly, succulent chicken, flavoursome fish or spicy tenderloin. I ate all this — and some more — at The Claridges’ Chinese restaurant, Jade. I had been invited to try out the food being served at a bamboo festival, which is on till May 18. The dishes had been prepared by the hotel’s Chinese chef, Linlin Yang — and I was bowled over.
The bamboo had been cooked in all kinds of sauces and spices. For instance, our starter was a dish of stir-fried diced bamboo and chicken in spicy black bean sauce. The bamboo with diced tenderloin was flavoured with anise. And the double cooked pork belly was just allowed to simmer with bamboo shoots and Chinese cabbage.
Chef Linlin tells me that bamboo comes in various kinds in China, and is a veritable part of their cuisine. Even baby bamboo leaves are eaten for they are sweeter than the variety that you get in parts of India. In India, bamboo shoots are mostly eaten in the Northeast. I’ve had some excellent fermented bamboo as part of Assamese food. But I understand that it’s bit of an acquired taste — for the strong flavours of fermented bamboo don’t appeal to everybody. I, however, love it.
This meal presented bamboo with all kinds of flavours. I loved the lightly spiced bamboo pork belly as well as the bamboo and beef, and enjoyed the five-spice flavour that had been infused in a dish of fresh bamboo and ginger cooked with scallops. The scallops, soft and sweet, were perfectly cooked.
I also liked the river sole with vegetables and bamboo. The shoots had been cut in such a way that they looked like the sliced fish. I alternated between the mildly flavoured fish and the bamboo, adding some spicy veggies every now and then — and thought it was a nice mix of flavours.
I suppose at a festival like this, the taste is as important as the look. So the food was served in small bamboo containers and on crockery with pretty green images of bamboo trees. Some of the main dishes were steamed in the bamboo containers, too. And I was told Chef Linlin had designed the bamboo utensils especially for the festival.
There are a host of vegetable dishes with bamboo too — but I managed to avoid them all. But those who like their vegetables could try out the stir-fried young bamboo shoots with spring onion and dry chilli, or fresh tofu and fresh bamboo with pok choi and asparagus.
The prices are high, as befit a restaurant in a luxury hotel. But if you order carefully (rice, one appetizer and two entrees), a meal for two, with taxes, can come for less than Rs.4000. If your rich uncle is in town, you can, of course, have a feast. And if you are the rich uncle, there is nothing like it!
The bamboo food fest at Jade in The Claridges is on till May 18

A spoonful of goodness
","I have a strong belief that whatever we eat reflects on how we look and react to situations. As the one-liner goes, “We are what we eat”.
Somewhat believing in my philosophy and attempting to execute it is a young entrepreneur Prasoon Gupta who after passing from one of India’s most reputed colleges, IIT Roorkee, thought of feeding people food which is healthy and light on the stomach. After a lot of R&D, he came up with an idea to start a restaurant in the M block market of New Delhi’s Greater Kailash Part II by the name of Sattviko which is based on sattvik food.
Though a vegetarian restaurant hardly attracts me, Sattviko has a menu which is selective but offers dishes from across the globe. It is slightly biased towards the Mexican flavours, though. I quite liked the vibrant feel of the 35-seater restaurant and left it to Chef Rishi to decide my course of the meal. He began by serving me a small bowl of sabudana poha and fruit oatmeal. Having a mix of tastes like sweet, sour and spicy, the poha was light and tasty and could be a perfect dish to have in between meals to kill the cravings. The oatmeal having crunchy muesli complimenting the nuts and raisins was so refreshing that a spoonful after a hectic day could bring back the lost energy within minutes. Though the fchilled melon salad that followed it was not chilled to perfection and even lacked the zing and tanginess of a salad.
Trying the Mexican imports was fruitful as the quesadillas and even the burritos were tasty. Kudos to the chef who was able to keep the flavours and taste intact, even though it was a sattvik preparation. Another two dishes which were bang on were the quad burger and vada croissant. I loved the aroma and freshness of the focaccia used to hold the stuffing. Mumbai’s vada married to French croissant turned out to be good. Vada laid on the special dried chilli powder mix gave life to the preparation.
The dishes which were a disappointment were the pindi cholas and paneer curry. The chola was too dry and slightly under cooked while the curry had an unappealing texture and suppressed flavours.
Nitisha Jain, the Experience Head at Sattviko who educates customers about the Sattvik lifestyle, helped me by suggesting to end the meal with sabudana kheer and shrikhand. Both were yummy and delicious though a tad more of cardamom powder would have given the shrikhand a nice flavour.

Sattviko is at M 72, M block market, Greater Kailash Part II

Meat that matters
","“You must try the lobster bisque,” insists Thomas Kurian, food and beverage manager. It’s good advice, for what arrives is light-red creamy-rich goodness. Made from stock of sautéed lobster pulped into puree, with occasional pieces of grilled lobster meat, the soup is a great beginning for a filling meal at the ongoing Steaks and Grills Festival at Regency restaurant in Abad.
The seafood chowder soup that’s up next doesn't quite match up. It is better suited for those with bland preferences. Senior sous chef, Mohan Babu, says the soup is made in typical North-American style, comprising fish, shrimp and squid accompanied by capsicum. The starters bring more American fare with BBQ chicken wings, served with abundant barbeque sauce. For vegetarians, the chef suggests his innovative baby corn lollipop — corn stuffed with cheese and fried — or mushroom remoularde, (crumb fried mushrooms with tartare sauce).
The meat of the matter comes at the main course. Although generously skewed to the non-vegetarian dinner, the menu does offer two vegetarian options: a platter of grilled vegetables marinated in spicy tomato sauce, and the classic cannelloni (a baked breed of pasta stuffed with corn and spinach). Of the 12 other dishes offered, chef Mohan says his seven seas platter has been the hot favourite of the season. It features squid served with an Indian spiced sauce, prawn served with butter-garlic sauce, fish fingers served with a lemon butter sauce and lobster with a Mexican sauce.
His other quick mover is the traditional beef steak, named the Tournedos Opera — a chewy, chunky affair that comes doused in pepper sauce with more pepper sauce on the side. Several of the menu’s offerings are also available on a sizzler platter, given that you like the dance and drama of smoking meat and boiling vegetables. For the quieter sorts, the meal comes primly plated on white dinnerware. The Regency’s steak festival has been an annual staple until the restaurant underwent a recent revamp, explains Thomas. “The menu hence comprises creations that have done well in the past, and some new ones for this season,” he says.
One of the newer entrants is the ranch burger steak, made of grilled beef burger that comes with a cheery fried egg sunny side up. The chef also recommends his Chateaubriand bearnaise, beef again, marinated in oyster sauce, and named so for chateaubriand refers to the particular undercut of meat used, and the bearnaise is an egg-yolk and butter based hollandaise sauce. We’re also served the braised chicken supreme roulade, which was the highlight of the meal: chicken breast stuffed with minced chicken and mushroom. Chicken also comes in Hawaiian style garnished, of course, with pineapple.
To round off the elaborate spread, there’s an assortment of five desserts to choose from. Your best bet is the chocolate truffle mousse.

The festival is on for dinner from 7 p.m. to 11 p.m. till May 11.

A crepe fit for the Louvre
","After much meandering, we finally find what we are looking for: Breizh Café, home to a unique Parisian delicacy: crepes.
These are not any roadside crepes. No, these are so much more. Known as ‘galettes,’ these buckwheat delicacies are made even more delectable by the toppings that adorn them. From rich chocolate ganache to buttery caramel, Breizh prides itself on housemade delights.
As my sister and I take our seats, we are directed to the menu projected on the wall; all in French, of course. With my six years of French and my sister’s semester of class, we can piece together the ingredients. She chooses a simply magnificent creation: caramel galette with Chantilly cream. The smoldering heat of the caramel combined with a slight hint of vanilla from the cream is simply irresistible.
One week later, we arrive at the same place. There’s no need for a menu, we know what we want. As my Paris voyage comes to a close, more than the Eiffel Tower and the Louvre, there is one place that I know I must visit during my next journey, for a trip to Paris cannot be complete without an appearance from the classic, Breizh Café.

Spiked with kadugu maangai
","I must admit, the topic of this column intrigues me. Twenty minutes in general does not leave time for anything ultra elaborate, whether it’s a good workout or getting ready for a special evening. But, quite frankly, after a busy day, ‘quick and easy’ is sometimes the order of the day.
This opportunity knocked just as I returned home from an inspirational Food Blogger conference. I was knee deep in clearing out my kitchen for an overdue renovation. Ideally, I’d have launched my maiden post by prepping and executing a great debut with a planned recipe, but as often happens with fixing dinner, things never go as planned. And that can lead to some memorable meals.
The choice of using broccoli isn’t totally random. Broccoli and cauliflowers are cruciferous vegetables related to mustard, although it takes some imagination to associate the traditional pungency of mustard with these. But just as a painting combines tints and shades of a colour, pairing different ingredients from the same family can result in some fabulous flavour creations.
In this case, I perk up the mild soup by drizzling a few drops of pickle oil or sauce from traditional mustard based condiments such as ‘Kadugu maangai’ or ‘Avakkai’ just prior to serving. Just as you need a mere ‘touch’ of the condiment to elevate that iconic South Indian staple, yogurt rice to heights of ecstasy, the same rule applies to this creamy, flavourful and filling soup.
As with all my recipes, I like to cite my references if I’ve been inspired by other authors/bloggers. This particular recipe has been inspired and adapted from Ree Drummond’s blog ‘The Pioneer Woman’.

Cream of Broccoli & green pea soup

(makes ~ 4 servings, Prep time: ~10 min, Cooking time: ~ 20 min)

You need:

• 1 1\2 cups Broccoli florets (no stalks) shredded through a grater
• 1\2 cup fresh, frozen or dried green peas
• 4 tablespoons Ghee
• 2 medium sized onions finely diced
• 1\2 teaspoon powdered cumin
• 1\2 cup all purpose flour (Maida)
• 2 – 2 1\2 cups milk (add more as per taste)
• Fresh cracked peppercorn to taste
• 1\2 - 1 cup shredded cheddar cheese (depending on how thick you prefer your soup)
• Salt to taste
• Your choice of any mustard based traditional pickle sauce/oil

Method:

Add one cup of water to the peas and pressure cook them until soft. Using the back of a spoon, mash the peas and set aside.
Simultaneously, heat the ghee in a heavy bottomed pan. Just as it begins to shimmer, add diced onions and sauté for about 5 minutes on medium heat, until they turn soft and translucent. Add powdered cumin, and mix it well with the onion. (This allows the aromatic oils from the spice to be released). Now stir in the flour and cook for about a minute. Then add shredded broccoli, cracked peppercorn and just a pinch of salt (Add the salt judiciously since the cheese already contains plenty of it). Stir in milk, adjust the heat to medium-low, add the cooked peas and cook until the broccoli is soft. (~15 minutes)
Add cheese and allow it to melt completely. Remove from heat, taste and adjust for seasonings. Serve as is if you like a chunky home style texture, or if you prefer a silky smooth texture, pour the soup into a blender in batches and puree till it reaches your preferred consistency. Strain, ladle into bowls and serve warm with wedges of toast. Serve the condiment on the side to be added as per your preference. For an even milder variation, substitute the broccoli with shredded cauliflower.

Anand dishes it out
","
What did you have for dinner last night?

Chicken curry, gobi masala, matar pulao, dal and home-made fresh litchi kulfi at home.

What are you reading now?

I mostly read articles on the net. I read about food, culinary trends, happenings and developments in the world. Also articles on human behaviour. I have subscribed for daily updates from quite a few websites: Epicurious, The History Kitchen and 101cookbooksto name a few
.

 Good food is the best route to happiness 

Do you have a favourite recipe book?


Seasons by Donna Hay, it has simple but interesting and flavourful recipes, such as baked salmon with radish and cucumber salad. Then there’s balsamic pork belly with caramelized figs. Not to mention the simple, but tasty, asparagus and goat’s cheese bruschetta

Plans for your next vacation?

If in India, then Coorg. I want to try some of their fantastic pork dishes and bamboo shoot curry. If I’m going overseas, then I plan to head to Provence and try some French classics. My plans include coq au vin, blanquette de veau, pot au feu, and tarte tatin.

The most memorable meal you have eaten?

Stuffed kulcha and dal from a food cart in Amritsar.

What about the worst?

Dinner at a friend’s place. Since I am a chef, he and his wife decided to prepare something fancy, exotic and very complicated. Unfortunately, they messed it up. The menu was vegetable biriyani, paneer makhni, garlic noodles, chilli chicken, vegetable au gratin and gulab jamun with ice cream! It was not balanced and neither the flavours nor the seasoning was right. From what I remember of that meal, I only liked the gulab jamun and ice cream since they were bought from a store. So, of course, nothing could have gone wrong with them!

Lessons learnt in the kitchen?

Good food is the best route to happiness. When you’re in the kitchen, being patient always helps.

Any secret junk food confessions?

Samosas. And jalebis.

Last meal on earth?

My mom’s food. Her unique cooking includes parathas made of rice flour, then stuffed with stone ground poppy seeds, garlic and chilli. It’s topped with a dollop of butter, then served with roasted and pounded spice potato curry. And always, I end with kheer for dessert.

Ragi: the small but mighty millet
","Its botanical name is Eleusine coracana. But across the length and breadth of this country it is known as ragi, mandua, nachni and so on.
At the ground level, in the farms, this hardy grain grows in very diverse eco-zones: from the hills of Garhwal, to the Deccan Plateau or the Jharkhand plains. It requires very little care and can thrive even in drought conditions. It is also resistant to pests and diseases, ensuring that the food basket of a farm is never empty. With a 1 tonne per hectare yield, it has the highest productivity among the small millets of India.
As a food, with its sisterhood of millets, it shares a high nutritional profile and an equally high sustaining power; it, therefore, most definitely, qualifies as a Super Food. It has the amazing property of being suitable for the 0 to 90 age groups. Due to its high calcium content (at a whopping 344mg per 100g) and easy digestibility, in the South of India, its grains are malted and used for weaning babies.
The protein of ragi is said to be as complete as milk protein, which makes it an ideal substitute for lactose resistant people. Another health advantage is its low glycemic index which makes it suitable for diabetics as well. Moreover we should not forget that, like all millets, it is gluten free and as such its flour is ideal for those with gluten allergy. Its high on energy property has made it a popular food among those involved in hard labour.
Is it surprising then that traditional cuisines, at the pan-indian level, have evolved many tasty ways of preparing this ingredient? In the South, dosas, upmas, mudde and other delicacies, such as halva, are prepared with its flour. In fact, one must add here that due to its outer covering, finger millet has to be ground whole and used only as flour. But what could seem as a processing disadvantage is actually a nutritional advantage as this increases its fiber content.
In Jharkhand and Bihar, where it is known as mandua, the finger millet flour is used to make delicious pancakes, both savoury and sweetened with gud, while Garhwalis prefer to make rotis out of it. One must mention here the special “thag roti”, so called because the outer layer is made of wheat, with an inner stuffing of mandua; the roti therefore, so to say, masquerades as a plain wheat one whereas it has another layer inside. Given the heat generating property of finger millet, this roti is specially made in winter and relished after a hard day’s work when energies need to be replenished.
With its multiple benefits, ragi, the “forgotten food”, always favoured by hard working classes across India, is fast becoming a sought after Super Food. Many confectionary brands now proudly promote ragi biscuits. More importantly, at the artisanal level, ragi biscuits, muffins and cakes have been developed.
The new found popularity of finger millet just goes on to show the fact that very often gastronomy has its roots in the hearty cuisines of local food cultures. A good example to cite here is how at a winter session of Navdanya's Grand Mothers’ University (at both celebrating and validating the wisdom of our grandmothers), during a culinary workshop, one of the resource persons, an Ayurveda expert, prepared a wholesome, warming ragi halva and upped its gastronomic and taste quotient by just adding some orange peel to it. It is in these spontaneous and organic ways that food cultures keep evolving, adapting to new terrain, while being rooted in the terroir.
The finger millet has indeed covered an amazing journey; it started by being considered a coarse grain, specially from the colonial times, to becoming today, in post-colonial times, a grain duly recognized for all it has to offer ecologically, nutritionally and gastronomically, as a true blue Super Food, which packs in a powerful punch in its tiny grains.
For those who would like to include finger millet in their diet, here are a few suggestions on how to use it. The Navdanya Café at Dilli Haat regularly serves ragi pakodas in winter; you just have to make a batter, as the besan one, and add chopped vegetables of your choice to it.
You can then fry the pakodas in very hot cold pressed mustard oil, coconut oil or any other unprocessed edible oil. The best results are with mustard oil which suffuses the fritter with its own distinctive flavour.
Wherever a recipe asks for wheat flour,  re place half or a quarter of the quantity with ragi flour. Below, you will find the recipe of our in-house crepes and mathi. You can let your creative juices flow and create your own recipes.      

World-renowned seed activist Vandana Shiva and Navdanya Director Maya Goburdhun believe in the power of local superfoods. Navdanya is actively involved in the rejuvenation of indigenous knowledge, culture and forgotten foods.

Tea, coffee and commerce
","The aroma of freshly roasted and ground coffee fills the air as one steps into Sanker’s Coffee and Tea on Puthenchantha, M.G. Road. However, K.P. Sivaram, proprietor of the 62-year-old store, seems oblivious to the aroma. He is busy checking the accounts and attending to customers if his staff is tied up with other clients.
“My father, P.K. Parameswaran Nair, ensured my siblings and I were trained well in running the shop. He passed away last year. From him, we learnt how to roast, grind, package…,” says Sivaram, who starts his day with a cup of coffee and ends it with a cup of tea.
One does admire his fortitude, however, in limiting his coffee to just one cup, especially when he is constantly enveloped by the aroma of coffee. Sivaram smiles and says: “It’s not that difficult. It’s something I am used to, something I grew up with.”
He recalls his father telling him how he used to supply coffee powder and tea leaves to various restaurants and hotels in the city. Parameswaran Nair would buy coffee beans from wholesalers and would hand roast and grind them at home. He would then sell them at restaurants and hotels. As for tea, he would pack the leaves, also bought from wholesalers, into small individual packets and sell them. Realising the viability of his venture, he then decided to set up shop. And thus Sanker’s was born.
“My father focussed on coffee as the market for freshly ground coffee was small then. In those days, the coffee market was a closed one; one could only buy from the Coffee Board and hence supply was limited. We didn’t sell tea then as packaged teas were available in stores.”
Sanker’s started expanding its repertoire by introducing tea in the mid 1960s and nuts and spices 15 years ago. “Malayalis are mostly ‘tea drinkers’ and many of our customers started asking for tea.” Sanker’s obliged and started out by supplying tea in various grades.
The store has recently added flavoured teas, green tea and white tea to their list of products. “Such teas, especially green tea and white tea, are a trend amongst health enthusiasts while youngsters prefer flavoured teas; lemon being a favourite. We were perhaps one of the first to introduce green tea to the market. I read an article in a paper about the medicinal benefits in green tea and started out by introducing a limited supply of this tea. We now have five to six varieties of the tea which one can buy by the gram and also branded teas that come in packets.”
The 46-year-old says that foreigners tend to pick up white, green and black tea by the gram.
Both the young and the old visit Sanker’s. “There are those who frequented the store when it first began. I have had youngsters come up saying they remember visiting the shop when they were kids with their grandparents. A reason why we have repeat customers is because we keep a keen eye on the quality. We also ensure our staff is polite. These are some tips our father gave us on how to run the store successfully,” says Sivaram who has fond memories of his early days at the store.
A student of Government Model Boys Higher Secondary School, Sivaram recalls how he would look forward to going to the store after school. “As we were often hungry after school, my dad would pick up small eats from a nearby bakery called Queens. It was something, we all looked forward to.”
So, what next? “I don’t know. My wife, Asha, and I have two girls – Shivani and Kinara. Shivani is in class eight and Kinara is in class one. I hope to see them run the store one day.”

Kitchen Explosions
","“Maltodextrin. That’s the secret,” declares Chef Vikramjit Roy. He leans forward to stage whisper the details. “See. On a molecular level, Maltodextrin is a dextrose polysaccharide.” I sneakily hit Google on my iPhone, craftily hidden under a table napkin. Apparently “polysaccharides are long carbohydrates made of monosaccharides.” Great. That really clears things up. (Eye roll.)
We look at Chef Roy hopefully. Maybe it will all make sense soon. He’s finishing his speech with a happy flourish. Don’t quote me on this, but I think the story ends with polysaccharides entrapping oil droplets and thus “stabilising the emulsification.” Then they live happily ever after. Or not. I’m still a little resentful about chemistry creeping up on me in a restaurant. Though, to be honest, I should have resigned myself to it long ago – what with Molecular Gastronomy trend revolutionising restaurants right from the 1990s, with menus involving emulsification and spherification, foam and powders, deconstruction and reconstruction.
Take a deep breath. It’s not that frightening. In fact most chefs hate the blanket term ‘molecular gastronomy,’ saying it makes their food sound difficult and pretentious, when all they are really aiming to do is make meals fun.
Which brings us back to Chef Roy, an interesting poster boy for India’s foray into ‘Modernist Cuisine’ – the more evolved (and chef approved) version of molecular gastronomy. Roy’s creating a style of cuisine that’s daring and unfamiliar, yet rooted in comfort food. In Bangalore, Chef Abhijit Saha of Caperberry is on a similar mission. Working with what he describes as ‘Avant Garde European Gastronomy,’ he aims at integrating culinary arts, culinary science and culinary artistry in his food, using traditional as well as modern cooking techniques. An imitation Carpaccio, for instance, with compressed watermelon, mint caviar, chrysanthemum and microgreens. Or Sous vide poached asparagus. But also hearty, familiar dishes such as a smoked pork belly with apple-onion relish.
At Chef Roy’s restaurant, Pan Asian at the ITC Grand Chola Hotel, the focus is on reinventing Japanese food. This is a world away from India’s first wave of sushi, filled with mayonnaise, cream cheese and pickled cucumbers. But it’s also a world away from contemporary Pan Asian cooking. And it’s strongly individual food like this, created with imagination and experimentation that will influence the next wave of restaurants in this country. That’s what makes Pan Asian’s 15 course tasting menu so intriguing. And that is why I’m getting this crash course on kitchen chemistry.
We begin with a duet of homemade tofu, set with agar agar, and are served with truffle powder, created using maltodextrin, a derivative of tapioca. (Remember every “chemical” is actually food based. Xanthan gum, for instance, used as a thickener or stabilizer, is similar to yeast.)
“For me having food is also about having fun,” says Chef Roy.
“I want to expose my diners to something that is nicer, more evolved, unique… I want to leave an indelible impression. The truth is, no matter how great a chef you are, there’s only so much you can so with a potato and an onion.
So we eat Asahi beer battered oysters with soy emulsion. Cheese croquets filled with gooey gruyere and set on a fluffy puffed rice salad interspersed with roasted pine nuts and betel leaf. Warm buttery Lobster wasabi puffs, served with a pipette, so diners can squeeze sweet chilli jelly into their puffs. Tuna Carpaccio with tart, crisp freeze dried tomatoes. Scallop stuffed morels, glazed pork ribs and salmon tartar topped with dehydrated potato crumble.
While the menu does sound intimidatingly alien, it’s designed to subtly replicate comfort food. The oysters are a version of beer-battered fish and chips. The croquets are reminiscent of deep fried cheese. The lobster’s in a familiar puff pastry. “If you really look at it, every dish has something people can relate to,” says Chef Roy. “As much as I love Heston Blumenthal, the truth is full fledged molecular gastronomy just cannot work in India. If I serve you a thin sheet of pork hanging on an edible wire, will you come back to me? This will become a ‘once in a lifetime’, or ‘once a year’ restaurant. This is what I understood long ago.”
The central idea is to create food around people’s memory banks. To take a dish, deconstruct it, change the texture and temperature, but still preserve its essence. It has to be familiar, but still radically different from the original. Like our dessert. Powdered Nutella, served with tender coconut crumbs and Nitrogen infused chocolate mud. So, yes. Ultimately, we eat mud. Literally and figuratively.
