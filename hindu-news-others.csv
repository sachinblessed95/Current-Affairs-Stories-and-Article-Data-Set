Border Crossings
","Commander Mahmud had previously fought against the Soviets, the Taliban and a few others he called traitors. His stories changed a little every time he narrated them to me. He was a creature of a ruptured society, which required certain murkiness of character and malleability of beliefs to negotiate alliances and friendships with an unlikely spectrum of characters. In his new role he would recruit, train and command the Afghan Local Police. Created at the behest of and funded by the Americans, the ALP was a policy designed to “secure local communities and prevent rural areas from infiltration of insurgent groups.”
It was the very young, the poor, the orphaned, the uneducated and the disenfranchised who were regularly conscripted and forced to fight under threat of violence. One of the cadets, who looked no older than 15, said he regularly crossed into Pakistan to see his family and moved there every winter in search of employment. “My maternal cousin joined the Taliban”, he said. “They pay well for doing nothing. He had the gun first.” Pointing to his gun he said, “These guns are not bad, either”.
Young boys were being prepared for slaughter; the accidental recruit was meant to fight the accidental guerrilla across the border. The US sergeant in Sar Howza, brushed it off saying “It is an Afghan solution to an Afghan problem”. I repeated this to Commander Mahmud and he responded with silence.
The day I left Sar Howza, the commander prepared a grand meal of goat and rice, and sent me away with words that betrayed his appearance. “Memory is a funny thing. It differs from the history you came here with.”
On the road back to Kabul and for the next two years I thought about the palpability of an arbitrary border and what it did to people. A border might create two distinct nationalities out of the same stock, but can it create a break with people and their past? The territory that divides the citizen and the alien is messy. Yet these lines are imperative for the politics of statehood and statelessness, who belongs and who is excluded. It separates us from them; it creates hierarchy and order; it consolidates and defines.
***
With the Partition, something unique, unprecedented and disorienting happened in the subcontinent. The clarifying violence at the moment of creation made the borders palpable, political and personal. Contested borders, territorial disputes, population transfers, communal strife, sectarian violence, self-determination movements have happened within the territory of the state. All these events remain traditionally described within the clinical framework of historical cause and consequence that discounts the haemorrhage; that bleed into each other. I instead stand with Thomas Carlyle when he says, “History is the essence of innumerable biographies.” These biographies are the finer details that don’t fall into delineated categories of cause and consequence.
Sitting in his backyard, Gazi, an Indian, said, “The Partition did not just happen; the war did not just happen. It is unfinished and ongoing.” His backyard was also home to one of India’s border pillars with Bangladesh. The backyard opens into a river, through a narrow passage that acts as the riverine border between the two countries. As we walk by the river, I see people from both sides crossing regularly. “Yes, it happens” he says. “How do you cut a river into two”? Like thousands who live along this densely populated border, he has family just a few metres away in another country. Gazi’s grandmother was born when there was no border, just British India. A few years into her life, she became a citizen of Pakistan. One of her sons was in India. East Pakistan then became Bangladesh; then came the border pillars and more treaties. Gazi was born into a farming village with porous land and riverine border. Throughout his adolescence he witnessed ubiquitous BSF camps mushroom along the farmlands, barbed wire fences being erected, floodlights being installed, and a visible militarisation of the border. Fencing and floodlights, accompanied by aggressive and violent state intervention, are now rapidly transforming a once porous border. Fencing petitions a powerful logic through narratives around illegal migration, national security, counterinsurgency and illegal trade that is difficult to contest. Yet, this logic is regularly betrayed by the dailiness of it all. People like Gazi continue to transgress and subvert the border. It has not stopped migration, illicit trade, or secured the border. Instead, it has increased social and personal cost of the crossings.
Felani Khatun and her family, like millions before her, crossed over into India illegally a few years ago. Felani’s father Nurul Islam was taking her back to Bangladesh to have her married. They were crossing the border illegally at night by climbing over the barbed wire fence in Anantapur, Fulbari. It was widely reported that Felani’s clothes got caught in the barbed wire and she screamed in panic. BSF constable Ghosh fired at her, wounding her fatally. What followed were multiple repetitions and versions, with the most gruesome being that Felani struggled to stay alive for four hours, begging for water before dying.
A year later, I travelled through the region and asked various BSF guards and officers along the Bengal frontier about the killing of Felani. Most of them had never heard of this incident; almost all BSF personnel responded in abstractions or replied with questions. The afterthought was unhappiness about India’s new policy of restraints and how it was impossible to protect the borders without coercive force. “These women cross illegally and cry rape; they smuggle goods inside their purdah…Some are Indians only in name; all of them have relatives in Bangladesh. Family means more than the lines,” said another young officer in Amudiya, who went on to show a video in his phone, where his team had apprehended two women smuggling in Nike shoes. The more time I spent with the BSF guards, the more they reminded me of the young recruits I met in the remote borders of Afghanistan.
By the time I returned, Felani’s trial had had its day in the General Security Courts set up by the BSF. Constable Ghosh was charged and acquitted of culpable homicide. Evidence against him was deemed “inconclusive and insufficient”. Constable Ghosh and thousands like him are responsible for the preservation of the State’s rights in these exceptional places, where they are vested with the power to make unilateral decisions over life and death, without being accountable to the law. They are not evil, wicked, sadistic or vile; yet they are terrifying in that, with all this power, they are trained to act, not think. The BSF border guards are ingrained through training and constant reinforcement that the borderlands are “a different space, a contentious space” where order must be established through force. Here exceptional acts of coercion and violence are the new normal. The most clinical and pathological argument in defence of killing was: “Since Felani and many others like her were illegally transgressing into Indian territory — often at night, paying touts and traffickers — they were ‘not innocent’, but ‘legitimate targets’.” Felani’s death and other deaths over the border is a face to a much larger politics of State of Exception that transforms identity, migration and militarisation of territory into issues of national security.
“There is no end to the ideology of difference,” said Pakistani political scientist and writer Eqbal Ahmed. Yet along the borders people are regularly turned into religious and cultural categories. Bengali becomes differentiated into Hindu Bengali and Muslim Bengali. Within Muslims, the categories are locals and Bangladeshi. While turning people into categories is accomplished easily on paper and policy, in practice how do you differentiate local Muslims and the Muslims from Bangladesh who speak the same language, follow the same customs, and are part of the same cultural composite? When I asked a BSF guard in Taki, he acknowledged that it was hard. “They all look the same, speak the same.” Then “that it is why we need to keep a closer watch”. Here suspicion and surveillance go hand in hand.
A BSF document produced earlier this year describes the border population’s characteristics. Key attributes include, “Predominantly Muslim”, “Illiteracy, backwardness and poverty”, “Inclination of youth towards easy money”, “Hostile towards the forces”. An officer at Petrapole remarked, “They don’t drink, so they use cough syrup.” It is tacitly implied that people’s behaviour can be predicted based on their religion, and socially deviant behaviour is a residue of one’s religious and cultural beliefs. Stereotypical depiction of an entire group of people as shiftless and inclined to criminal behaviour sustains the idea that the populations they secure is fundamentally different and demand such treatment. Complex and nuanced accounts regularly become esoteric reductions and representation of whole groups of people, their history, memory and boundaries. Obligation towards ‘individual truth’ is regularly and systematically undermined in these edges. Truth is neither altered nor silenced, instead setting limits to it, has become the greatest weapon against resistance.
Nietzsche once noted that only that which has no history can be defined. And yet the discourse of nationalism is aimed at creating foundational myths about a Nation’s beginning, defining the people, its conflicts and its aggressors. While defining the “problematic other”, the state always casts them as actors in the discourse of conflict, stripped of history and agency. “A nation is bound not only by the real past, but the stories it tells itself, by what it remembers, and what it forgets,” said Colin Thubron. We are at a time when we have not earned the right to forget the past, yet around us is a vigorous effort to prematurely rewrite a singular history that is fraught with multiple, competing narratives of memory.

Borderlands Project is Suchitra Vijayan’s 9,000-mile journey through India's borders to understand the human dimension of political borders. The project is conceived as a travelogue chronicling stories along India’s border with Pakistan, China, Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh, and Burma. Partly visual anthropology and partly an attempt at understanding the Indian state, and the fringes it governs.

CB-CID teams rush to Guwahati, Patna
","As part of the probe into the twin blasts on the Bangalore-Guwahati Express here on May 1, special teams of the Crime Branch-CID have reached Guwahati and Patna, agency sources said on Saturday.
Armed with the CCTV footage of two persons who were found moving in a suspicious manner in the Bangalore and Chennai Central railway stations, investigators would make inquiries with some passengers who travelled in S-4 and S-5 coaches up to Guwahati.
After preliminary inquiries, the State police and National Security Guard (NSG) officials revealed that the explosives were similar to those used in the Patna blasts, another team reached Patna.
“We want to examine the suspects arrested in the multiple blasts in Patna, which occurred hours before BJP leader Narendra Modi was to address an election rally there,” a CB-CID official said.
Meanwhile, forensic experts who analysed the debris from the scene of blast indicated that Ammonium Nitrate was the main ingredient. Investigators were seeking the help of Information Technology experts to extract a better visual from the CCTV footage.
The footage in Bangalore showed a man taking the escalator and walking towards Platform No. 3, from where the train departed, sources said.
“Since he was carrying a bag, it is possible that there was another person who either boarded the train in Bangalore or the following stations. We are seeking the assistance of IT experts to improve the quality of images found in the CCTV footage,” a CB-CID official said.

Love in the time of apps
","Long distance relationships. LDR. Whatever you call them, they still tend to suck most of the fun out of life. Here are a few apps that might help keep the spark in your relationship alive, unless of course, you are a firm believer of the adage, “Out of sight, out of mind.”

Couple

This app is a private way to utilise social media just for the two of you. You can have you own timeline using it to share photos, videos, voice notes, sketches and stickers. It also has a calendar — for those dates you just have to remember — and a feature that lets you both sketch simultaneously on the same screen in real time. Two of its best features, though, are: ThumbKiss, that lets you touch the same spot on your phones to make them both vibrate simultaneously and Thinking of You, that lets you tell your significant other how much you miss them and how often.

Handwritten

This app is the perfect way to blend today’s technology with that of writing long love letters. Handwritten, specifically for iPad users, allows you to personalise your mail by letting you compose the letter in your own handwriting. Use of a stylus is recommended.

Red Stamp

So you screwed up. And now he/she is sulking. This app might not earn you forgiveness, but it’ll help to partly make up for your boo-boo. Personalise a card and post it on Facebook, email, tweet, or text it to that special someone. Red Stamp can also print a high-end, eco-friendly paper postcard or luxe paper card and mail it in a coloured envelope to the recipient. Useful for birthdays, anniversaries or just to surprise your significant other. Major brownie points to be earned, y’all.

Voxer

Voxer, as someone very rightly put it, is a messaging app on steroids. Not only does it offer you everything a typical texting platform does, it also lets you use it like a walkie-talkie. You can send voice messages as well — they are all saved so you can play them back later. So it’s like a personal line just for the two of you. Beats a couple of cups and a really, really long thread.

Relationship Lovers Counter

‘So when’s your anniversary?’
‘June. No, wait, July. Or was it January?’
If you empathise with the above predicament, this app is here to save you a major fight or two. It keeps a track of how many days are left for your anniversary, even informing you if it’s a one-month or a silver jubilee. It comes with a love meter that rates your relationship on a scale of one to 10 (Hmmm, not sure if that is a good thing, though). And if you’re the kind of couple that likes making others uncomfortable, this app has a Twitter and Facebook connector to help you share the love on social media. Aww. Cho chweet.

RTI activist dies as car catches fire
","An RTI activist, who was trying to evict alleged land grabbers from a temple in Kasna village here, was found charred to death in his car on Thursday night. His family has alleged foul play.
According to the police, Chandra Mohan Sharma, who worked for a global automobile giant, was on his way home in Alpha Sector here around 11-20 p.m. when his car went up in flames.
Gautam Budh Nagar SSP Preetinder Singh said: “The people at the spot tried to break the car’s windows with stones, but they were unable to rescue Chandra Mohan.”
By the time the police reached there, the victim had succumbed to his burns. The body was then taken to a hospital for post-mortem.
The police said Chandra Mohan had been experiencing problems with his Chevrolet car. “Four days ago, he had removed the CNG kit from the car. Even on the day of the incident, he had trouble starting the car,” said Mr. Singh. The car will be sent for technical inspection.
While the police are investigating all angles, the victim’s family has alleged foul play.
“He was murdered because for the past eight to ten years he had been working to remove encroachers from a temple. He had been threatened and attacked many times, the last being on April 28. He was driving near Pari Chowk when his car was stopped and he was beaten and verbally abused,” said Videsh Kumar, brother-in-law of Chandra Mohan.
Mr. Kumar, who also lives in Kasna, said villagers were trying to evict some individuals who had encroached on temple land. “Chandra Mohan had filed an application to get details about this issue,” he added.
Chandra Mohan, who was in his mid-30s, is survived by his wife, daughter and son .

Prolonged drought condition hits mango productivity
","Mango productivity has been hit in the district due to prolonged drought conditions, according to growers.
In only a matter of few years, the productivity had come down to 30 per cent of the original yield due to water shortage, said V. Vaideeswaram, president, Erode District Mango Growers' Association. Alphonso, Bangalora and Imam Pasand varieties are mostly grown in Erode district.
Mangoes have started arriving in large quantities from Salem and other parts of the State to the markets in Erode. Though the mango season has begun, it will take a month more for fruit-cutting to begin in the district.
Due to the low productivity, there is no compulsion for the growers in the district to ripen mangoes in bulk by artificial means, Mr.
Vaideeswaram said. The stocks kept in the market come under periodic scrutiny of the Food Safety department. Mangoes ripened with calcium carbide stones are confiscated.
Farmers say artificial ripening of fruits is not unusual the world over. For, ripe fruits cannot be transported. The raw fruits, after harvest, are first transported and then ripened at places close to consumption. But, ripening of the fruit with calcium carbide, a chemical material made of limestone, is illegal in India due to health risks, reflecting in vomiting, diarrhea, and burning sensation. The Food Safety Department, sources said, confiscates mango stocks if it is found that only the outer skin of the fruit has ripened while the flesh remains firm and more fibrous. Such fruits, the sources said, are more acidic and have shorter shelf life. ""In Erode district, growers use doses of ethylene to induce ripening. This method of ripening is legal,"" Mr. Vaideeswaram said.

Security beefed up across railway stations in Delhi
","About 500 security personnel fanned across railway stations in the Capital, the bomb disposal squad began extensive checking and sniffer dogs were deployed to look for explosives as a high alert was sounded across Delhi stations following the bomb blast at the Chennai Central railway station on Thursday.
“The dog squad has been deployed since morning, while the bomb disposal squad is on standby. Checking and frisking of passengers and their baggage has been increased. While usually there are adequate number of policemen at the station premises, around 500 personnel are on patrolling duty at the stations on Thursday,” said Deputy Commissioner of Police (Crime and Railways) Sanjeev Bhatia.
Officials claim the situation is under control even on normal days.
“General Railway Police personnel are onboard all long distance trains. Different teams keep changing their personnel as per the jurisdiction. The presence of cops on board helps check petty crimes as well,” said Northern Railway spokesperson Neeraj Sharma.
Though officials claim presence of manpower and round-the-clock surveillance, some recent incidents — cases of dacoity onboard trains — in areas closer to the Capital have of late exposed the chinks in the security apparatus.
For their part, the authorities term such cases as aberrations. Railway officials here said that the GRP had recently launched an extensive drive against robbers and busted a gang with the arrest of three active members from neighbouring Ghaziabad.

2030 India will see massive housing crunch
","What should set alarm bells ringing for urban developers and policymakers is the data released by the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) that says more than 70 per cent of the buildings that should stand in India by 2030 are yet to be built.
According to CSE executive director (Research and Advocacy) Anumita Roychowdhury, while in the United Kingdom 80 per cent of the building stock that will stand there in 2050 has already been built, India is lagging behind with a mind boggling number of 70 per cent of the buildings, that includes homes, offices and commercial establishments, not being constructed.
“What is worrisome is that Indian cities use more of precious water and energy and generate massive amounts of waste. The construction boon can be a bane as unfettered growth can have a damaging impact. In India, buildings are responsible for 40 per cent of the energy use, 30 per cent of the raw material use, 20 per cent of water use and 20 per cent of land use. At the same time, they generate 40 per cent of carbon emissions, 30 per cent of solid waste generation and 20 per cent of water effluents. With almost 70 per cent of the building stock in India yet to come up, the country is looking ahead to a critical situation.”
As a major destination point for real estate, the National Capital Region will be particularly affected. Therefore, the CSE has stressed the need to see the scalability of the buildings that have to be constructed.
“At homes, we have to use our air conditioners judiciously. With more and more homes using air conditioners, the challenge is not to become energy guzzlers. High performance buildings will require good insulation. Poorly insulated buildings severely effect the efficiency of air conditioning units and are high energy losses,” said Ms. Roychowdhury, while conducting a two-day workshop on “Urbanscapes: How sustainable are our buildings and cities”. The CSE has stressed the need for conducting workshops for the benefit of architects, engineers and prospective owners of flats so that they can understand the energy-saving strategies for constructing homes.
Pointing out that traditional wisdom needs to be kept in mind while constructing buildings, Ms. Roychowdhury said only one per cent of Delhi’s population lives in Lutyens’ Delhi and the urban boom in terms of housing and commercialisation has taken place on the periphery of the city. “Therefore, people living in East Delhi have to travel long distances. We have congested places like the Chawri Bazar and scantily populated areas like Aurangzeb Road.”
Citing another example, she said cities like Chennai, which have hot humid climate, do not require air tight glass buildings. “However, quite a few tight glass buildings in Chennai are being constructed. It is important to understand that we do not require 100 per cent air conditioned buildings. A fine example is the traditional Chettinad homes which have sufficient cross-ventilation. A big verandah is a common feature in every traditional home there,” she added.

Murder victim identified, cabbie suspected
","A young woman, whose body was found, chopped to pieces, on the banks of Porur Lake on Saturday evening, has been identified. Police suspect the involvement of a city cab driver, who is on the run.
Rekha Sriram, a Nesapakkam resident, was a business process outsourcing (BPO) centre employee and a consultant dietician at a fitness centre. Policemen at SRMC station, who are investigating the murder, said she had married Sriram, a software professional working in Ambattur, in February this year.
On Saturday, residents in the vicinity of the lake saw a gunny bag on the banks of the waterbody around 7 p.m. and alerted the police.
Policemen opened the sack to find the decomposed torso and head of a young woman. The victims’ hands and legs were recovered from nearby. Investigations revealed that Sriram had lodged a complaint with MGR Nagar police station on May 1 about Rekha not having returned home.
“On Sunday, Sriram identified the body as that of his missing wife at the Government Royapettah Hospital mortuary,” said an investigating officer.
The investigating team has found that Rekha had approached the Madhavaram police with a compliant of repeated harassment by Sitaraman alias Samson (25), a cab driver and resident of Sitapathi Street in Madhavaram. “Samson used to drive Rekha to work and home when she worked at a call centre in Vadapalani and was upset when he learnt of her marriage,” the officer added.
It is suspected that he along with a few accomplices may have murdered her and flung the body into the lake from Chennai Bypass. Police are searching for Samson and have found his car that is suspected to have been used to transport the victim’s body.

Zoo animals escape mercury’s fury
","As summer begins to peak and the mercury keeps its upwardly climb, the Nehru Zoological Park has made arrangements to help the animals, birds and reptiles here escape the hot weather conditions.
From air-coolers to rain guns and sprinklers, the authorities have covered the different zones of the zoo with the required paraphernalia, said curator B.N.N. Murthy.
“Most animal and bird enclosures have been enriched with different plant species that help reduce the temperature,” he said.
More than 100 sprinklers have been installed along the peripheries of the enclosures, and the bigger enclosures have been provided with rain guns that could throw water at a distance of about 30 metres.
There are eight rain guns for the enclosures of the chimpanzee, lions and others, while they would be installed for elephants and rhinoceros in the next couple of days.
Foggers that create a mist and keep the enclosures cool were already in place in the aviary, and also in the enclosures of some smaller cats. The others were draped with thunga dry grass and also khas-khas matting and watered regularly, Mr. Murthy said.
All the night houses to which the animals retire in the evening have been fitted with air-coolers, and these include those of the leopard, white tiger, lions, jackal and sloth bears.
“We ensured that the temperature in these night houses is at least 5 degree Celsius less than that outside,” he said.
In another move, the electricity department was approached with a request to ensure that the power cuts do not happen here during the day time.
“The APCPDCL has agreed to go for its load relief and have power cuts only during the early mornings and late evenings to help our efforts of keeping animals and birds comfortable during the hot day conditions,” Mr. Murthy added.

‘Trans Queens’ ooze confidence
","Turning up in beautiful chiffon and georgette saris and ‘lehengas’, along with spaghetti-strapped designer blouses, the contestants exuded poise and confidence at the national-level ‘Miss. Trans Queen’ beauty pageant.
The much-awaited beauty contest for the third genders, which stopped due to sudden thundershowers on Thursday, resumed its charm with heart-pounding music, dance, and energy-packed audience at Gurajada Kalakshetram here on Friday. Of the 125 contestants who made their way to the venue from different places like Delhi, Pune, Kolkata, Kochi, Hyderabad, and Visakhapatnam, among other cities, 22 were short-listed for the final round.
With the tagline ‘Hum kisi se kum nahin’ attached to the beauty show, hosted jointly by Naandi Service Society and Moon Power, the participants walked down the ramp with ease, teaming their attires with attractive stilettos. Apart from creating a platform for the others, the pageant kept its focus on raising awareness on the acceptance of the third gender community.
“We are not bothered about winning or losing the beauty pageant, but a platform such as this is really heart-warming. What our hometown (Delhi) has not done so far, the City of Destiny has done for us. Whoever we are, all we need is your love and acceptance,” one of the contestants from Delhi said. While some of the participants surprised the viewers by introducing themselves in Telugu, a few shared their wonderful experience of being part of the national-level beauty pageant. It was the first time the beauty contest for the community was being organised in Andhra Pradesh. “We have been planning for the event for the last five years. The objective is to provide a platform for the others to exhibit their talent and allow them to express themselves,” director of Moon Power Srinivas said.
The top winner walked away with gold crown worth Rs.1 lakh and the second and third winners grabbed silver crowns. The other titles of the pageant included ‘beautiful eyes’, ‘best skin’, ‘best walk’, ‘beautiful smile’, and ‘beautiful personality’.

Crafting a new legacy
","In the Fifties, two brothers settled in Manacaud near the Fort area. The brothers, T.N. Kochu Kunju Achari (1890-1960) and his younger brother T.N. Padmanabhan Achari (1893-1987), hailed from the famed Edavancaud family of Cheriyanad village in Chengannur taluk. They were not new to the city, as both of them had visited and stayed in the Fort, working in their capacity as the kottaram moothacharis.
As chief craftsmen to the Travancore royal family, members of the Edavancaud Chattoth Thiruvambadi family were truly the nobles among the traditional Vishwakarma clan.
The title of Edavankadu Achari was given to the eldest male members of the family; they attended to all the major construction and religious activities concerning the royal family of erstwhile Travancore. The members of the family were also the head craftsmen of the Subramanya temple of Harippad. The renovation works of the ancient temple were carried out under the order of the then Maharaja of Travancore Sree Moolam Thirunal Rama Varma. The works, which commenced in 1920s, was carried out by T.N. Kochu Kunju Achari, his younger brother T.N. Padmanabhan Achari and their cousin G. Padmanabhan Achari (Padmanabhan Achari was the maternal grandfather of Jagathy Sreekumar).
However, what made the fame of the brothers spread far and wide were the life size and miniature wooden figurines of Kathakali characters they created. According to P. Neelakantan Achari, the youngest son of T.N. Padmanabhan Achari, it was Sethu Parvathy Bai, the Amma Maharani of the royal family of Travancore, who asked his father and his brother to craft the Kathakali figures.
She asked the craftsmen to observe the Kathakali plays that were staged for the royals. Following her order, the brothers went to Fort Palace complex and closely studied the Kathakali artistes.
They made detailed sketches of the characters and their costumes and attire. The sketches formed a base for their carvings in ‘kumbil’ wood.
The royal family of Travancore owned many of the masterpieces made by the brothers. The life-size Kathakali figures made by the brothers are now exhibited in Kowdiar Palace, Pattom Palace, Kuthira Malika and Napier museum, as well as in various museums across the country and around the world. For their services, the brothers were presented veerasringalas.
Soon after they made Thiruvananthapuram their abode, Kochu Kunju Achari passed away. After his death, the hereditary title was passed down to his younger brother T.N. Padmanabhan Achari. The craftsman’s profound knowledge on silpasastra made him the supervisor in charge of the new idol made for Sabarimala temple.
In 1966, he received the first National Award for woodcarving from Dr. Radhakrishnan, the President of India. T.N. Padmanabhan Achari relocated to Pattom where the master craftsman spent the rest of his life.

Ancient granary found in Haryana
","A “beautifully made” granary, with walls of mud-bricks, which are still in a remarkably good condition, has been discovered in the just-concluded excavation at Rakhigarhi village, a Harappan civilisation site, in Haryana.
The granary has rectangular and squarish chambers. Its floor is made of ramped earth and plastered with mud.
Teachers and students of the Department of Archaeology, Deccan College Post-Graduate & Research Institute, Pune, and Maharshi Dayanand University, Rohtak, Haryana, excavated at Rakhigarhi from January to April this year.
Vasant Shinde, Vice-Chancellor/Director, Deccan College, who was the Director of the excavation, said: “We excavated seven chambers in the granary. From the nature of the structure, it appears to be a big structure because it extends on all sides. We do not know whether it is a private or public granary. Considering that it extends on all sides, it could be a big public granary.” He called it “a beautifully-made structure.”
The excavating teams found several traces of lime and decomposed grass on the lower portion of the granary walls.
“This is a significant indication that it is a storehouse for storing grains because lime acts as insecticide, and grass prevents moisture from entering the grains. This is a strong proof for understanding the function of the structure,” explained Dr. Shinde, a specialist in the Harappan civilisation.
The discovery of two more mounds in Rakhigarhi in January this year led to Dr. Shinde arguing that it is the biggest Harappan civilisation site. There are about 2,000 Harappan sites in India, Pakistan and Afghanistan. With the discovery of two more mounds, in addition to the seven already discovered, he estimated that the total area of Rakhigarhi was 350 hectares. It thus overtook Mohenjo-daro with about 300 hectares, in Pakistan, in laying claim to be the biggest Harappan site, he said.
The Rakhigarhi site belongs to the mature Harappan phase, which lasted from 2600 BCE to 2000 BCE. The teams have also found artefacts, including a seal and potsherd, both inscribed with the Harappan script.
In Mohenjo-daro and Harappa, granaries were found in citadels, where the ruling elite lived. So mound number four in Rakhigarhi, where the granary was found, could have been the settlement’s citadel, Dr. Shinde said.
Rakhigarhi is situated in the confluence of Ghaggar and Chautang rivers and it was a fertile area. “So Rakhigarhi must have grown a lot of food grains. They could have been stored in the granary to pay for the artisans or other sections of society or to meet any crisis,” said Dr. Shinde.

Non-bailable warrant against Raj Thackeray
","A local court on Friday issued a non-bailable warrant against Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) president Raj Thackeray for not having been present in court for a long period.
The matter relates to alleged stone-pelting by MNS workers at a Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) bus on the Jalna-Aurangabad road on October 20, 2008, near the Shekta village in Maharashtra. The driver of the bus, Ibrahim Shaikh, later lodged a police complaint after which a case was registered against Mr. Thackeray and six others.
However, Mr. Thackeray did not attend court proceedings and filed an application before the Judicial Magistrate seeking exemption from being present in court due to election campaigning.
The magistrate rejected his plea since Maharashtra polls got over on April 24 and issued a non-bailable warrant against him. The next hearing is scheduled on May 8.

Bharata’s magnanimity
","Even when we are clearly in the wrong, we do not accept blame for our conduct. We tend to blame someone else for our wrongdoing. But Bharata was an exception. Rama was sent to the forest by Dasaratha, upon Kaikeyi’s insistence.
Bharata had no hand in this. In fact, Bharata was not even in Ayodhya, when Rama’s banishment took place. It was only when he arrived in Ayodhya, did he come to know of what had happened. He was furious with Kaikeyi for what she had done. He did not want to rule the Kosala kingdom and went to the forest in search of Rama.
When he met Rama, he said that it was not Dasaratha or Kaikeyi who was to be blamed for what had happened, but he himself was the culprit. So here we have a man, who did no wrong, but blamed himself. Bharata’s magnanimity is a lesson for us all. To take the blame for what others have done is a rare quality, said Kidambi Narayanan, in a discourse.
Bharata wanted Rama to come back to Ayodhya and take charge of the kingdom. So he said to Rama that it was the tradition for the first son to become king, when the father died.
He also said that only a person whom the people liked should be made king, and the people of Kosala were unanimous in desiring Rama as their king. Moreover, Kaikeyi had sinned in getting Rama exiled, and Bharata did not want to accept kingship that came to him as a result of his mother’s sinful act.
Bharata tried every method possible to get Rama to agree to his request. But Rama stuck to His stand, and sent Bharata back to Ayodhya.

2G case: Court to commence recording of statements of accused
","A special CBI court in New Delhi is likely to commence on Monday the recording of statements of the accused, including former Telecom Minister A. Raja, in the 2G spectrum allocation scam.
Special CBI judge O.P. Saini, who had earlier supplied the draft questionnaire containing 1,718 questions running into 824 pages to the 17 accused, including Mr. Raja, DMK MP Kanimozhi and three top executives of Reliance Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group (RADAG), had fixed the matter for Monday.
The special court, constituted to deal exclusively with the 2G scam related cases, is also scheduled to start on Monday the recording of statements of the accused, including promoters of Essar Group and Loop Telecom, facing trial in a case arising out of the probe into the radiowave scam.
In the case involving the promoters of Essar Group and Loop Telecom, the court had given a questionnaire to the eight accused having 645 questions each and running into 308 pages.
CBI had filed charge sheet against them, alleging they had cheated the Department of Telecommunication (DoT) by using Loop Telecom as a “front” to secure 2G licences in 2008.
Essar Group promoters Ravi Ruia and Anshuman Ruia, Loop Telecom promoters Kiran Khaitan, her husband I.P. Khaitan and Essar Group Director (Strategy and Planning) Vikash Saraf are facing trial in the case along with three firms — Loop Telecom Ltd., Loop Mobile India Ltd. and Essar Tele Holding Ltd.
All of them have denied the charges levelled by CBI in the case, arising out of the probe into the 2G spectrum scam.
In the case involving Mr. Raja and 16 others, the court had on November 27 last year concluded recording of prosecution evidence after deposition of CBI’s Superintendent of Police Vivek Priyadarshi, the chief investigating officer, got over.
The court had recorded statements of 153 CBI witnesses, including Reliance ADAG chairman Anil Ambani, his wife Tina Ambani, former corporate lobbyist Niira Radia and Attorney General G.E. Vahanvati, running into over 4,400 pages.
Besides Mr. Raja and Ms. Kanimozhi, former Telecom Secretary Siddharth Behura, Mr. Raja’s erstwhile private secretary R.K. Chandolia, Swan Telecom promoters Shahid Usman Balwa and Vinod Goenka, Unitech Ltd. MD Sanjay Chandra, RADAG executives — Gautam Doshi, Surendra Pipara and Hari Nair — are facing trial in the case.

Menacing men with arms of clay
","Arasu, the manager of Illusions, a popular nightclub on R.K. Salai, has a name for the bouncer manning its door: ‘Another door.’
“You talk to the door, if the door is okay, then you get in,” Arasu declares proudly. The bouncer manning the door, who has overheard his boss’s comment, allows himself a nervous smile: it is eight in the evening and his day has just begun.
Once the sun has set over Chennai, it is often the bouncer who stands like a mountain of muscle between the most happening people and the most happening places in the city. As the alcohol begins to flow, people’s behaviour becomes unpredictable and these men, trained to gauge people, become alert.
“It’s all about guest management and having the presence of mind to identify trouble even before it crops up,” says Deena, who has been a bouncer with Pasha for the past six years. 
Customers showing up to a club drunk; a group of men seeking entry into a night club without the company of women; being too loud and arrogant even before getting past the front doors — these are some of the problems bouncers have to deal with even before the best remixes of the night are played.
“A few drinks down, even a gentleman creates trouble on some nights,” says Arasu, who depends on his bouncer to be his security blanket when he deals with his unruly clients. “He might be a small guy or he might be a big shot, but ego will be the same. None of these guys want to mess with me when I have a six feet tall guy with bulging muscles backing me up though.”
Most bouncers haven’t had the chance to finish school and come from a variety of backgrounds. With an interest in physical fitness and body building, being physically intimidating is a prerequisite to being a bouncer. On the face of it, he may seem to wield enormous clout and be able to decide for some people, the course of their Saturday night, but he has a tough job on his hands, one that brings unforeseen challenges his way every evening.
“I was once stopped and cornered by four guys when I was heading back home at 2 a.m.,” says the bouncer of a popular resto-bar in Chennai, asking not to be named because he does not want his wife to find out about his profession. “It’s okay though, I can handle up to five to six guys at a time, and it’s only when there are more than that, that I need to call for back-up,” says the bouncer, confessing to carrying a few weapons with him at all times.
“A drunk customer might challenge a bouncer to a fight, but most bouncers are trained to handle such situations sensibly. It’s a tough task, I must say. Sometimes when things get out of hand and I step in to handle the situation, they challenge me to a fight too,” says Muthu, head of security at Pasha. “But usually all this ends with the night. Come dawn, all is well again.”
With customers inebriated and incapable of making sound decisions, disputes between people, disagreements regarding the bill and general misunderstandings are an everyday occurrence. With time, most bouncers build a relationship with their guests and can often get their customers to listen to them. When things do get out of hand, the manager steps in to exercise his authority and deal with the situation as manhandling a high profile customer is not something a bouncer can risk.
“Once a guy got hold of my collar,” says Rajesh, who has been guarding the door of 10 Downing Street for over a year now. “Most threats made are empty though and the next time he came to the club, he apologised and we made peace, and that’s the way it usually happens.” Now a father of two, fearless Rajesh knows he has to watch his step. “If we get hurt while trying to stop a fight, we shouldn’t make a big deal out of that, that’s just part of the job.”
Not all occupational hazards of a bouncer involve the clenched fist. “I have many female friends who come here often. When they’ve had enough to drink, they sometimes insist I dance with them, but I have to politely decline because I am working,” says Rajesh.
While women don’t usually create trouble that is difficult to handle, trouble is often created when people want to ensure they are safe and not subject to any sort of manhandling. “Even if a girl slips, they assume she is drunk and some men think they can approach her. We usually notice men with such intentions and keep an eye on them,” says bouncer Soundar of 10 Downing Street.
Married for 20 years and a father of two, Soundar often sees people as old as his children visit the nightclub, but he would never allow his own to ever visit one. “Culturally, we are very different. My son is almost 20 years old now and to date, I’ve not even let him go to the beach by himself,” says Soundar, 40, who looks atypical for a bouncer with 
vibuthi on his forehead on a busy Sunday night.
Having only studied till Standard 8, he wanted to ensure that his children received a college education and proudly announces that both his children are now looking to pursue their Masters’ degree. “Every day I give my son Rs. 10 or maybe Rs. 15 for his expenses, not because I don’t have the money to give, but because I’ve taken care of everything he needs,” says Soundar, who gives his daughter Rs. 5 for her daily needs.
Most of these men — needless to say — come from humble backgrounds, earning anything between Rs. 6,000 and Rs. 15,000 a month. The biggest perks of the job are that they get to rub shoulders with the rich and the famous — apart from receiving tips from people who spend the equivalent of a bouncer’s salary on one night’s revelry.
“When a big political figure wraps his arms around you and talks to you, while hundreds of people outside are waiting for his attention, how can it not make you feel really happy?” asks bouncer Deena with a wide smile.

Nature, nurture and niches in cities
","Holiday plans ensure promises and perils; hopes and hypes; excitement and disappointments; good news and not-so good news. The not-so good news is that not everyone can plan a vacation to Arctic Alps or to the Amazon to observe the diverse wildlife there for obvious reasons like lack of resources or failure to obtain the necessary sanction for leave. The good news is that there is so much to eye, experience and enjoy right where you live – amidst the hustle and bustle of the city. For some, vacation is all about circus, beach, malls, movies, shopping, reading, and catching up on sleep. But for nature enthusiasts this is the time to make the best of wildlife spotting in the city.

Urban wildlife

The wildlife diversity and cities have always been treated as an oxymoron. In highly congested and thickly populated cities with myriad skyscrapers, flyovers, malls, real estate, heritage buildings and magnificent edifices, it’s incredibly amazing to see wildlife abound in their own secretive niches. The untamed birds, insects, mammals, reptiles, amphibians and of course the untended plants are all over.

Bustling neighbourhood

Summer vacations render an awesome reprieve from stressful work schedule and also bestow time to enjoy pleasant surprises over a cup of morning coffee in your own neighbourhood – birds busily engaged in courtship and nesting, squirrels relishing mangoes, spotted owlets peeping out in stupor from tree holes, butterflies hovering over the peacock flower, bees visiting the yellow elders, sunbirds hovering over the fire bush.
This is the season to look out for the fiery blossoms of Indian Laburnum and Copper Pods. Indian Laburnum otherwise known as the golden shower tree produces gorgeous pendulous inflorescence and is a greatly refreshing sight to behold when the city is actually reeling under heat wave. Copper pods produce dense clusters of crinkled yellow flowers which are highly relished by the rose-ringed parakeets. The flowers fall down to the ground and truly form a magical carpet of gold that brings nostalgic memories of examinations in school and college campuses. Another tree to look for during this time is the indigenous Crepe Myrtle, also known as Pride of India, which produces upright blooms in shades of pink and purple. Also not to be missed are the Siamese and Java Sennas, African Tulip Tree, Rosy and Yellow Trumpet Flowers, to name a few.
Birds to look out for in home gardens and in the neighbourhood are magpie robins, tree pies, golden orioles, wagtails, hoopoes, sunbirds, sparrows, tailor birds, barbets, kingfishers, woodpeckers, babblers, warblers, bee-eaters, bulbuls, shrikes, shikras, koels, pipits, parakeets, rollers and sometimes even the rare paradise flycatchers and pitta. Each bird has a distinct call and it is easy to trace their presence to their sound, which is otherwise not too easy. Water bodies too nurture and sustain a lot of aquatic birds. Easily one can spot snipes, sandpipers, black-winged stilts, pelicans, painted storks, darters, purple moorhens, pond herons, lapwings, pin-tailed ducks, coots, flamingoes, avocets, godwits and shanks.

Field trips

One day trips to observe, understand and document wildlife inspire city-bred children to develop passion and concern for wildlife and instills in them the need to engage in appreciation for nature, species conservation and in the protection of our ever-shrinking natural resources from further loss or damage. Time spent outdoors is a worthy investment that gives simple pleasure but great satisfaction. Just in case, you turn into a hardcore nature enthusiast and decide to visit national parks, reserve forests and wildlife sanctuaries that come under the jurisdiction of wildlife authorities and forest department you need to take prior permission and respect rules. Be on your guard as it is really ‘wild’ there unlike the urban wildlife that has evolved to coexist with human beings.

Role ofpolicy-makers

The role of urban policy-makers and city-planners is very crucial in earmarking areas that are rich in biodiversity that support diverse life forms. These areas should never be utilized for developmental purposes otherwise it may lead to local extinction of certain species. It is highly important to make a sincere effort to protect the wild side of nature in a war-footing spree in cities, since scores of water bodies, trees and parks have already been lost to intensive urbanisation thereby painfully facilitating habitat loss for birds and animals. Also, government authorities need to ensure that these places are garbage-free, provide adequate protection to wildlife as well as to people who visit these places, being clear of anti-socials, thereby making it a pleasant experience for those who come to study, enjoy or appreciate wildlife.

Security stepped up at railway stations in Mysore division
","Security has been stepped up at important railway stations in Mysore division following the twin blasts onboard the Bangalore–Guwahati Express at Chennai Central station on Thursday.
Divisional Railway Manager Rajkumar Lal told The Hindu they had security protocol in place that automatically came into effect during such situations. He, however, added that he had given instructions to senior security personnel to personally supervise the operations.
“Though there are no major threat perceptions regarding Mysore division, nothing is left to chance. At the Mysore station, we have an established security protocol for the rakes maintained at the station,” he said.
“While some of the cleaning operations have been outsourced through private contractors, there is no entry without ID cards. In addition, their activities are monitored by the Railway Police and the Railway Protection Force,” said Mr. Lal.
In addition, senior officials conducted random security checks, he added. Mr. Mohanan, a senior official in charge of security, said important trains were checked for suspicious objects by sniffer dogs while the RPF squad provided security for all long-distance trains running in the division. “The squad accompanies the trains running through sensitive areas,” he said.
Another official on condition of anonymity said that while preventive measures were in place, there was also a high degree of monitoring though it was unobtrusive by nature. Most of these security protocols came into place following earlier terror attacks on trains.
In the meantime, the Integrated Security System for Mysore is being put in place in a phased manner and this includes round-the-clock monitoring of the station premises through a network of closed circuit television (CCTV) cameras, vehicle and baggage scanning instruments and metal detectors at the main entry and exit points.
Mysore is one of the important stations identified for implementing the Integrated Security System in view of its tourism importance and originating passenger traffic from the station.
Apart from the platforms, the parking area and maintenance section would also be under surveillance. Mr. Lal said that while some of the measures are already in place, implementation was an ongoing process. It would be completed in another six to eight months at an estimated cost of Rs. 3 crore, he said.

NIA to probe Assam killings; toll 32, hundreds flee their homes
","Nine more bodies were recovered in the Bodoland Territorial Area Districts of Kokrajhar and Baska on Saturday, taking the toll to 32 in the violence unleashed by the National Democratic Front of Boroland (NDFB)-Songbijit militants on Thursday and Friday.
The State government decided to hand over the investigation to the National Investigation Agency.
The nine bodies, four among them of children and two of women, were recovered from Khagrabari in Salbari sub-division adjacent to the Manas National Park in Baksa, official sources said.
The mayhem started on Thursday when heavily armed militants shot dead three members of a family, near the Ananda Bazar area, in the district. On Friday, insurgents opened fire at Balapara-I village in neighbouring Kokrajhar, leaving eight persons dead and several injured.
On Friday night, 12 bullet-riddled bodies, five among them of women and one of a child, were recovered from Nankekhadrabari and Nayanguri in Baksa, where ultras set ablaze nearly 100 houses and a wooden bridge.
The police opened fire in the air after a mob armed with spears and sticks tried to set ablaze a forest range office at Basbari in Baksa on Saturday morning, the sources said. This made hundreds of people flee their homes with some taking shelter in two relief camps.
Of the four BTAD districts of Baksa, Kokrajhar, Udalguri and Chirang, the first two were affected. Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi who chaired a Cabinet meeting decided to hand over investigation to the National Investigation Agency to find those responsible for the violence.
“Let the NIA investigate who is involved. No one will be spared if found responsible for the violence,” Mr. Gogoi told presspersons after the meeting here. “I want to coordinate with neighbouring Bhutan as the militants may hide there after committing the crime. If the NIA comes then that can be done,” the Chief Minister said.
The NDFB (Songbijit) has denied its involvement in the violence, claiming it was “a political conspiracy by the Assam government to trigger clashes between two communities.”
A press statement by NDFB Secretary (Information and Publicity Wing) N.E. Esara said: “We ask the Assam government and its officials to stay away from such accusation without the slightest justification.”

Know your trees: Baobab in Mumbai, Senegal lilac in Malleswaram
","A ready prop for string lights and suitable canopy for parking like any other avenue tree, the solitary Baobab on a busy Mulund (Mumbai) street has turned overnight into the subject of substantial curiosity and debate among participants of a citizen science project to document trees across the country. Titled ‘TreesIndia’, it is an effort to create awareness about neighbourhood trees and aggregate information on tree diversity in India.
After all, the Adansonia digitata (known also as the “upside-down tree” as its branches can resemble roots) belongs to the dry savannahs of sub-Saharan Africa, and while it is known in botanical gardens in India, the Baobab is not the commonest avenue tree here.
The campaign was launched on Earth Day, April 22, and is hosted by India Biodiversity Portal. Among 3500 entries received so far by the crowd sourcing campaign, Mulund’s Baobab, a Senegal lilac (or Lonchocarpus sericeus from West tropical Africa) in Malleswaram and other exotics were unexpected finds, says R. Prabhakar, who created the India Biodiversity Portal.
Nature enthusiast, Ravi Vaidyanathan, who uploaded photos and observations about the Baobab, says it grows near the Mulund railway station (East) and is more than 50 years old. He has seen the tree “grow from a small slender tree during my school days to the huge tree that it is now [with a] base diameter an easy 2.5 metres”.
Anvitha S. from Bangalore says she has seen five Senegal lilacs around 11th Cross Road, Malleswaram. Indeed the biggest contribution to the portal has come from the increasingly mowed-down Garden City. Of the around 680 tree species identified and mapped, 400 have come from Bangalore, said Mr. Prabhakar. The most commonly recorded species across the country were Peepul, Gulmohar, Mango and Jacaranda.
The campaign continues to receive observations that will be used to build an open-access information system for tree species and distribution in India, he added. The enthusiastic participation from citizens “has convinced us that crowd-sourcing is an effective way to aggregate biodiversity data from different locales,” the TreesIndia team says.
“We hope to create a page for every one of the 7500-odd species in India and have this information up in the public domain,” Mr. Prabhakar said.
The campaign was launched in association with ATREE, SeasonWatch, Nizhal (Chennai), Keystone Foundation (Kotagiri), Strand Life Sciences, Azim Premji University and others. To upload your observations visit http://treesindia.indiabiodiversity.org.

Were the bombs timed to explode in Andhra Pradesh?
",": Did those who planted the Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) on Bangalore-Guwahati Express train aim at carrying out the explosions in Andhra Pradesh where BJP prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi was to address a series of election meetings?
The A.P. State Police are disinclined to believe so, though they do not rule out any such possibility. The train was supposed to reach Chennai at 5.40 a.m. and with railway officials stating it was running nearly 90 minutes behind schedule, the train would have reached closer to Gudur and not beyond going by the average speed of 55-60 kilometres per hour, said investigators.
Interestingly, Mr. Modi was addressing the first meeting at Madanapalle of Chittoor followed by Nellore, Guntur, Bhimavaram and Visakhapatnam. “Detonating the IEDs would have killed the passengers on board the train even if it had entered A.P. So the theory of the attackers specifically targeting A.P. doesn’t hold water,” opined intelligence officials.
They maintained that while Mr. Modi did face the threat to his life and central intelligence agencies have been sending alerts from time to time, most were general in nature with no specific alert was sounded so far with regard to his A.P. tour.

Birdwatchers throng backwaters of Tungabhadra dam
","Birdwatchers in and around Bellary district have been thronging the backwaters of the Tungabhadra dam at Hospet to catch a glimpse of Greater Flamingos (Phoenicopterus roseus) that have flocked in large numbers.
Greater Flamingos, with its majestic looks, are 1.5-metre tall, pinkish birds from the Rann of Kutch in Gujarat which migrate to the south in winter. They are known to congregate at Pulicat lake in Tamil Nadu in winter. They migrate to Gujarat in the summer to breed. On their way back, they spend some time in large reservoirs such as the Tungabhadra dam and Alamatti dam in Karnataka.
Samad Kottur, a bird watcher in Hospet and author of the book Birds of Hampi, is of the view that all the flamingos never stay the entire winter in the backwaters of the Tungabhadra reservoir. During their journey towards Pulicat, they stop wherever they find food and stay there for some days in November and December and continue their onward journey. On their return to Kutch, they spend some time in the Tungabhadra dam, Alamatti dam and other waterbodies in the vicinity. However, some non-breeding species stay till monsoon. As the water recedes, birds such as Greater Flamingos, feed upon the crustaceans, molluscs, algae, shrimps, worms, Blue Green Algae, seeds.

Piping his own brand of music
","A contested history of flamenco music traces its roots to Indian shores. It says migrants from Rajasthan travelled across Central Asia, through the Middle East and finally settled in modern-day Spain over a thousand years ago, creating, along the way, a musical idiom that culled influences from its travels. The title track of flautist Rajeev Raja’s debut album Cosmic Chant brings this journey full circle. It opens with soft flamenco guitar work, builds strength with drums and bass, breaks into a full-fledged Carnatic vocal section and closes with a conversation between the tabla and flute. Flamenco now has an Indian home.
Stories of such sojourns are central to Cosmic Chant. Above all, it narrates the journey of frontman Rajeev Raja himself, from a harmonica-toting boy born to Malayali parents and brought up in Bangalore, to playing with early jazz-rock city bands, onto accompanying the best in Mumbai’s 90s music scene, to finally creating his own Indo-jazz outfit: the Rajeev Raja Combine. In Kochi for a concert at JTPac, Rajeev says it all began with a stroke of luck. He was once jamming with a college classmate who handed him a two-rupee bamboo flute and suggested he try his hand at it. “I was amazed that I could play it. It’s almost as if the flute found me,” he says.
From these beginnings, Rajeev worked the competition and festival circuits with college bands, winning several accolades until he moved to Mumbai to work at an ad agency. Within a year there, he was absorbed into an Indian fusion band named Surya, which had Shankar Mahadevan on vocals, Salim, of Salim-Sulaiman fame, on keyboards, Sridhar Parthasarathy on mridangam with Faisal Qureshi on tabla and Taufiq Qureshi on percussion. “I would sit there in awe, listening to these amazing musicians, barely believing that I was playing with them. Bombay changed my life,” he says.
While Rajeev’s foray into Indian classical music began here, as a flautist he was exploring far different worlds. Largely self-taught, except for two years under an Indian classical flautist, Rajeev says his wide musical tastes have educated him. He counts among his idols, rock music flautist Ian Anderson of Jethro Tull, jazz flautist Hubert Laws, Western classical flautist Jean-Pierre Rampal, and India’s own Hariprasad Chaurasia. All these streams blend into the sound that Rajeev says defines the Rajeev Raja Combine. “I’ve had this sound in my head for 30 years; it’s only now that I’ve begun to realise it with this band.”
Alongside his music, for 25 years, Rajeev maintained a flourishing career in advertising. “At every job, I would tell my interviewers that my music meant as much to me as work, that rehearsals and concerts would all be a part of my life, without compromising my career responsibilities.” Juggling the two also meant that the principles of one fed into the other, for teamwork, collaboration and building off team members’ ideas were as integral to music as to advertising. In 2012 though, Rajeev quit as national creative director of DDB Mudra and plunged full-time into music.
All of these myriad influences come together in Cosmic Chant. The Combine comprises Hitesh Dhutiya on guitars, JD on bass, Chandana Bala on Carnatic Vocals, Vaibhav Wavikar on drums and Vinayak Netke on tabla. “The sound we were seeking was not one that paid lip-service to fusion with disparate elements hanging loose, but one which created an organic whole of the sum of our influences, right from the compositional stage onward.” Through eight tracks, that range from the rock music genre (‘Grunge’) and ballads (‘Nightingale Song’), to funk-rock (‘Friday Night Funk’) and smooth jazz (‘Mulligan’s Mood’), all laced with Indian Carnatic vocals and tabla, Rajeev’s dream has been realised. The compositions span from his earliest ever, named ‘Peace’, now dedicated to his wife, to more recent collaborations with Hitesh. 'Mulligan’s Mood' for instance was written in 1982, while Rajeev studied for his college final exams and happened to listen to Jerry Mulligan on the saxophone, when this tune popped into his mind

Cosmic Chant was released last October and has since done well for itself on online platforms, earning the Combine several gigs across the country. In the meantime Rajeev is busy with BrandMusiq, a company he’s floated that specialises in sonic branding, which creates a consolidated sound for brands, replete with a ‘mogo’ (musical logo) that can be adapted for any medium from television to radio. “This keeps me in touch with the marketing space besides providing an income, for the music doesn’t pay, just yet.” But that doesn’t matter for Rajeev admits that his music will always be niche. “We’re committed to creating an indie sound that’s artistically meaningful, with a depth of musical experience. Bollywood will continue to get the crowds and the money; but we’re in this for the long haul.”

Idukki water level enthuses KSEB
","Though summer rain has not made any impact on the water level in the Idukki reservoir, the storage level is far better when compared to last year.
The Kerala State Electricity Board (KSEB) is hopeful of the summer season passing without much hassle.
As per the estimate on Friday, the storage level in the Idukki dam is 36.7 per cent, which is considered a good sign of the summer season passing without much trouble. It has been attributed to the decision taken by the government against releasing water during the end of the last monsoon season, when the level reached the brim.
An official of the KSEB (Generation) at Moolamattom told The Hindu on Friday that power generation varied considerably and remained at a high level.
Though the generation level during the past 24 hours till Friday morning was 5.34 million units (mu), on the previous day it was 11.9 mu. “The low production level was owing to low demand, it being a holiday,” the official said.
The Idukki reservoir is a hydroelectric project reserved for meeting the summer demand when the consumption goes up. The water level continued to decline with summer rain having little impact on the reservoir capacity.
However, it is after a long time that the water level is at a considerably better position during the peak month of May. The reservoir area received a rainfall of 4.2 mm during the past 24 hours.
There is variation in the generation level as the demand fluctuates during the peak consumption period of summer.
An official at the Dam Monitoring and Research Wing, Cheruthoni, said the water level on Friday was 2,333.5 ft. The early arrival of southwest monsoon last year had been a favourable factor. The delayed summer this season also helped in keeping the water level at a high in the reservoir. The generation level each day was decided considering the demand factor.
The Idukki reservoir meets nearly 45 per cent of the total power consumption in the State.

Homing in on faith
","For a remote mountain hamlet of barely two dozen households in a predominantly Hindu and Christian region, Thinghejang in Manipur seems an unlikely setting for a synagogue resonating with Hebrew chants. Unlikelier still is the carnival spirit that sweeps nearby villages like Matiyang, a cluster of 150-odd residents, when hundreds of people converge to celebrate Israel’s Independence Day.
At play here is the curious lore of the Bnei Menashe, a community of around 9,000 people who trace their ancestry to the tribe of Manasseh, one of the 10 tribes of Israel lost to history over 2,700 years ago. What began a few decades ago as a search for their theistic moorings has since turned into a quest for a new national identity. “Israel is our home, our Promised Land,” gushes Leah, a student in Aizawl. “Residing in Israel is a must for every Jew,” says Khizkiyah Menashe, a law graduate from Lunglei. Those already there, such as Avishai Guite and Mirna Singsit, affirm that the greatest longing of their people back in India is to return to their ancestral land. For Shalem Gin, becoming the first Bnei Menashe officer in the Israeli defence force in 2011 marked the fruition of a childhood dream to serve as an Israeli combat soldier.
At Tel Aviv’s Ben Gurion Airport, every touchdown of the Bnei Menashe waving Israeli flags is imbued with emotion. Around 2,000 Bnei Menashe have already migrated to Israel. Those eagerly awaiting their turn erupted in tears and jubilation recently after the Israeli government passed a resolution paving the way for another 899 to return to Israel.
The Hebrew nation, claim the Bnei Menashe, was their home until their ancestors fled eastwards to escape the Assyrian conquest of the Northern Kingdom circa 722 BCE. Pushed further out by the marauding armies of Alexander the Great, they ended up in China nearly five centuries later. When their faith was persecuted there, nearly two generations were forced to seek refuge in lonesome caves, earning the name Shinlung (cave-dwellers). After the Chinese found them, they fled south to Indochina, before migrating to their present-day habitats some 600 years ago.
All along, the community held on to the oral history, songs and traditions handed down by their ancestors. Yet it wasn’t until they were introduced to the Bible in the 19th century by Welsh evangelists seeking to convert them to Christianity that the Bnei Menashe identified Manmasi or Menasia, a legendary ancestor of theirs, as the Biblical Manasseh, the son of Joseph.
“My grandfather was full of anecdotes about community elders uncovering the parallels between our customs and those of pre-rabbinical Judaism,” says David Yambem. “It must have been quite a revelation for the missionaries that our community would celebrate a springtime festival by singing songs about crossing a sea although we lived nowhere near one and by eating unleavened bread although our staple is rice.” The missionaries are said to have acknowledged the community’s Israelite origins when they saw them observing Sabbath and the laws of Kosher, circumcising new-born boys on the eighth day, and invoking Mount Sinai, Mount Moriah and Mount Zion in sacrificial ceremonies performed on altars reminiscent of the ancient Jewish Temple.
The community’s belief in a Jewish identity was reinforced in the early 1950s when Mei Chalah, a revered Pentecostal minister from Buallawn in Mizoram, dreamt that his people belonged to Zion. “Uptil the generation of my grandparents, the community yearned for Zion, but thought that was in heaven,” says Binyamin Haokip. “That changed after we learnt about the state of Israel.”
Realising the dream to migrate to Israel has not been easy. In 1955, a few Bnei Menashe set out on foot to Israel, but were turned back by Indian authorities. In the 1980s, after having started living according to halacha (Jewish laws), they reached out to organisations in Israel to make their case for aliyah (return of the Jewish diaspora to Israel) in fulfilment of a Mitzvah (a Jewish commandment) that calls upon all Jews to come home to Zion. “We couldn’t study for conversion in India for want of a Rabbi, so some of us decided to travel to Israel in the 1990s on tourist visas,” says Haokip.
In 2005, one of Israel’s chief rabbis recognised the Bnei Menashe as the lost children of Israel and made them eligible for aliyah. However, for that to materialise, Israel’s law required them to first convert to Judaism. “That was far from easy in India where proselytisation is a touchy issue,” says Yambem. Matters came to a head later that year, when an Israeli rabbinical court’s visit to India for mass conversion triggered a diplomatic row between the two countries. “The Bnei Menashe now undergo the process of returning to the Jewish people only after they arrive in Israel,” says Michael Freund, chairman of Shavei Israel, a Jerusalem-based organisation that helps descendants of lost Jewish tribes return to their roots. Interestingly, it was a Bnei Menashe plea for help with aliyah that inspired Freund to form Shavei Israel a decade ago.
In the complex mosaic of faiths and ethnicities that is the north-east of India, one’s religious identity is often a matter of social adjustment and assertion. “We were always acutely aware that we were different from the others around us,” says Leah. “Be it observing Saturday as a weekly day of rest and worship, or adhering to the strictures of Kosher food, pursuing a Jewish way of life is not without its difficulties here,” adds Liyon Fanai, a Mizo Bnei Menashe leader based in Zarkawt, Aizawl.
Nonetheless, it is possible today for the Bnei Menashe to announce their religious identity by wearing kipots (skullcaps), tzitzit (ritual fringes) and tassels on their person or writing “I am the son of Manasseh” in Hebrew or Latin on their houses without turning heads or raising eyebrows. “It is a testimony to India’s greatness that unlike most Jewish communities in the diaspora, the Bnei Menashe do not suffer from any hostility or discrimination,” says Freund.
In October 2012, the Israeli government revoked its predecessor’s suspension of the aliyah programme. Yet, opinion on the Bnei Menashe claim continues to be divided within Israel. “There are no scientifical proofs of Israelite affiliation, but narratives that are spun and sometimes take hold. This is true of the Bnei Menashe, as others,” says Dr. Shalva Weil, anthropologist at Hebrew University of Jerusalem. “There are neither Biblical nor rabbinical tractates on their existence. Historical myths are authentic for the people who believe in them and become realities for those who listen.”
Many in Israel also fear that allowing migration on the basis of historic legends may snowball into a serious immigration challenge. They feel that the Bnei Menashe might be using Israel as a way out of economic hardship in India. Israel’s former interior minister Avraham Poraz once called the Bnei Menashe “peasants seeking to escape poverty”. “That is incorrect,” counters Jeremiah Hnamte, who runs a successful bamboo business in Aizawl. “Most of us are educated and make a decent living in India”. A case in point is Azriel Hmar, a government employee, and his wife Mayian, a teacher, who are willing to give up their comfortable lives in Aizawl to be in Israel. “It is not as though we are going to heaven,” says a Bnei Menashe youth. “We will still have to work hard, perhaps even harder than in India. We may not be as well off as the Israelis, but it is unfair to label us economic migrants.”
“I know the community well,” says Zaithanchhungi (Zaii), Aizawl-based researcher and author of the book Israel-Mizo Identity. “Their decision to migrate to Israel is indeed driven by faith.” Fanai avers, “People can think or say what they like, but India is our second home and will always be a part of us.” That was evident when the Bnei Menashe performed Mizoram’s Cheraw folk dance during India’s Independence Day celebrations in 2013 in Herzliya, Israel.
Many like Poraz and social scientist Lev Grinberg even view conversions as a right-wing game-plan to boost Jewish majority in disputed territories, an issue brought back into sharp focus by Israel’s recent approval to build nearly 1,200 apartments there. “In Israel,” writes journalist-activist Mike Marqusee in If I Am Not For Myself: Journey of an Anti-Zionist Jew, “champions of the Bnei Menashe openly describe their immigration as part of the solution to the ‘demographic problem,’ that is, the numerical preponderance of non-Jews in Palestine.”
Freund dismisses that view. “The Bnei Menashe immigrants to Israel are spread out across the country, from north to south. Israel, like India, is a free country and the Bnei Menashe are free to choose where they wish to live. Those who criticise their immigration do so largely out of ignorance tinged with a whiff of racism.”
The quirks and demands of starting all over again in a new land are no deterrents for the Bnei Menashe. For Menashe Lhundgim, Gidonmung Khongsai and Hila Singson, migrating to Israel has been an experience in contradiction. While the tranquillity of their life in Manipur and Mizoram did little to assuage their inner turmoil, they claim to be at more peace even amid the occasional blasts of Qassam rockets and Grad-type Katyushas in their neighbourhoods in Sderot and Kiryat Arba, even as they go about their lives in the eye of the Israel-Palestine conflict.
To many in Israel, the suggestion of a racial kinship with the Bnei Menashe seems far-fetched: the balance is often tipped more towards the differences in their Semitic and Mongoloid traits than the quiet similarities in their ritual observances. “We were often told we didn’t look Jewish and we didn’t quite understand what it meant to ‘look’ like one,” says Amos. “We felt like outsiders in India because of our looks. In Israel, we get mistaken for Filipinos and Chinese,” laughs Yitzhak.
“Like any immigrant community, the Bnei Menashe who come to Israel must learn to adjust to a new mentality, a new language and a different way of doing things,” says Freund. “Being an immigrant is never easy and it does not matter if you originate in India, the U.S. or elsewhere. But the Bnei Menashe absorption in Israel has been successful.”
As it turns out, Thinghejang and Matiyang are as much about the Bnei Menashe’s long wait at the intersection of faith and history, as about the beginning of a journey that seems no less exhilarating than the destination.

Friends for life
","Life is full of uncertainties and it is only friends and the camaraderie which makes it possible to cope with it. Madhuri Iyer’s first printed fiction, Manhattan Mango, is the story of three Indians — Neel, Shrikant and Shankar — and their bonding. Hailing from different parts of India, their friendship begins in Mumbai and continues in Manhattan, New York, where they add new friends to their circle.
As a child, the author was fond of narrating stories to her younger sister but admits that she used to reveal the end only when the ardent listener forked out chocolates. Later, she continued to write short stories though none were published. On completion of graduation in applied arts from Sophia Polytech, Mumbai, she started working as a visualiser in an advertisement agency and later became a copywriter. She has 25 years of experience in the field. “Honestly I could not have written this novel had I not got my basics right having trained as a copywriter,” she says during a telephonic conversation from Mumbai, adding, “It helped me to stick to the word limit.”
Having stayed in Manhattan for more than two years, she found the place fascinating as it was multicultural and multiracial and that inspired her to locate the novel in that city. Fond of Mumbai too, Iyer says she found similarities between the two places — both are hives of commercial and financial activities, cosmopolitan and imbibed with fast-paced life — though Manhattan attracts people from all the corners of the world. The protagonists in the novel share almost similar cultural and family background with the majority of them hailing from upper middleclass strata — all familiar to Madhuri — yet none of the characters resemble her friends or relatives.
According to Madhuri, Indians in New York have a mixed selection of friends and do not tend to restrict their circle to fellow countrymen. Can the place be termed a melting pot? “No, though the English-speaking Indians hailing from big metros tend to have friends transcending races, they still maintain their identity,” she says. “They are open-minded, accepting as well as contributing to the cultural space.” This, according to her, is the essence of the Manhattan experience which adds a whole new layer to their being.
The novel which was completed in less than a year — having started it in 2012 — underlies the value of friendship in a turbulent life. With more conflicts and problems, the characters tend to gravitate towards the known comfort zone — buddies. “Honestly, young people seek the opinion of their friends and peers more than parents,” reflects Madhuri. This is more so due to the absence of family.
Another pertinent point highlighted in the story is the desire of the youngsters to be intimate with their family circle but demanding a hands-off approach when it concerns their personal lives.
Fond of painting oil on canvas, Madhuri has already finished the draft of her new novel The Strongman's Daughter and is working on two Bollywood screenplays. She also plans to write a lifestyle cook book.

Little things in life
","It has become a routine to wake up, get ready for the day, go to work or class, come back home, eat and sleep. People have become robots. There is not enough leisure time. In fact, there is no time even for family and friends. We hardly acknowledge the presence of a child or parent at home. We simply want to lie down and rest.
Once in a blue moon, during a family function or inevitable occasion, we remember people. The meeting usually goes, “How long has it been?”, “Do you remember that time when…” We plan to get together every weekend after remembering the fun we’ve had in the past, of the “fun and happy memories” and “those were the days, man”. But we forget that we have gotten used to lives that are mostly about work, stress and exertion; that all we want during the weekend is to rest and recharge for next week.
By this I don’t mean that we should drop everything and live without any responsibilities. All I’m saying is that we shouldn’t miss the little things in life. Leave your work behind at the office and spend time with your child, talking about his/her day. Try talking to your parents about your day. Make it a point to go out with your friends occasionally, if not every weekend. What is the point of working so hard if you don’t have any memories to enjoy later in life?

Madras labour and May Day
","A rather confused reader, L.A. Rajendra sent me a letter shortly before May Day wondering who really had started the first trade union in Madras. He’d heard of at least four claimants to that honour and was thoroughly confused by not only these claims but also by the different stories circulating about those beginnings.
In fact, I’ve heard six names mentioned, Annie Besant and Ramanujalu Naidu were the additions to Rajendra’s four: M. Singaravelar Chetty, B.P. Wadia, G. Selvapathy Chetty and Thiru Vi Kalyanasundaram Mudaliar. But as far as I can gather, the story goes like this.
Selvapathy Chetty, a small businessman, took over a sabha his father was running and moved it to D’Mellow’s Road, Perambur, alongside the Buckingham & Carnatic Mills campus, where it was converted into a club of sorts. Moving on from religious discourses and bhajan singing that the sabha had originally offered, it began offering lectures by eminent personalities on a variety of current topics. Then, during the Great War, there were daily discussions on the progress of the war and what it all meant to India. A large number in the audience were mill workers and, before and after meetings, they would pour out tales of woe about the happenings in the mills to Selvapathy Chetty and his friend and fellow trader Ramanujalu Naidu. The two helped many of the workers to write petitions to the management, but, gradually, as they got more involved with the problems of the workers, they began to feel that something formal needed to be organised to negotiate with the mills’ management for the amelioration of the harsh working conditions.
On March 2, 1918, the two organised a public meeting near the mills where several speakers addressed a 10,000-strong audience, mainly of mill workers. Philosophical and religious themes, as advertised, were the subjects of all the speakers bar one, whose topic had only been whispered about. Thiru Vi Kalyanasundaram (ThiruViKa) forcefully urged them to form a trade union; that would be the only way they would get fair treatment, he had argued.
Selvapathy and Ramanujalu next went to meet Annie Besant of New India and invited her to address a meeting where the union would be inaugurated. She was unavailable but B.P. Wadia, her colleague, was. With Wadia presiding, a mammoth meeting was held on April 27, 1918 in Perambur at which the formation of the Madras Labour Union (MLU) was announced. Wadia was its first President, Selvapathy and Ramanujalu its first General Secretaries and ThiruViKa, Sella Guruswamy Chettiar and Dewan Bahadur Kesavapillai it first Vice Presidents. The Union survives to this day.
It has been claimed that this was the first trade union in India. This claim is perhaps in the context that it is still in existence, its name unchanged, and was formed as an organisation in rather formal circumstances. A year earlier, a union had been formed by mill workers in Ahmadabad, but from reports I’ve heard, it did not survive for long nor did it have a formal structure.
As far as the MLU is concerned, if I had to pick a founder, I would choose Selvapathy and Ramanujalu as its joint founders, though from what I’ve heard the latter would have most likely given the honour to the former.
Singaravelar was undoubtedly a fellow-traveller with this group when it came to trade unionism, but he was more a political figure. He was associated with the Congress Party, but broke with it over differences with Gandhiji, and, on May 1, 1923, at what was then the High Court Beach and Triplicane Beach, he announced the formation of his Labour Kisan Party of Hindustan and wanted May 1st declared a holiday. And, so, May Day, International Workers’ Day, came to India thanks to Singaravelar. He next helped form the Communist Party of India (CPI) over whose founding he presided in 1925. Then he broke with the Communists and became associated with the Self-Respect Movement and its overtones of Dravidian politics.
But thereafter, with age catching up, he gradually faded from the political scene, though maintaining an interest in all the causes he had espoused.

An architect’s story

My quest for information about J.R. Davis of Prynne, Abbott and Davis (Miscellany, April 21) brought me much information from P.T. Krishnan, who had a latter day connection with a successor firm, and a rather rude phone call from a reader who refused to send me his information in writing, which is the only way I like it as I am averse to long telephone calls that necessitate taking notes I’m hard put to later decipher.
From what Krishnan and I have been able to piece together, it would seem Prynne, Abbott and Davis (PAD) had its beginnings in one of the first firm of architects in Madras, Jackson and Barker, who set up practice around 1922. They were responsible for converting the Spencer’s-owned Connemara Hotel’s building, that at the time resembled something better suited to a forest lodge, into a then modern hotel building that reflected a classical art deco style. The remodelled Connemara opened in 1937 to rave reviews. Today’s façade and much of the main block are what Jackson and Barker bequeathed to the Connemara.
Shortly before World War II, H.F. Prynne took over Jackson and Barker when the partners were planning to return to the U.K. Prynne, curiously, was no architect; he was the Governor’s ADC. And his first architectural work, so to speak, was to convert the stables of his house on College Road into his firm’s offices. He was joined by Abbott and Davis. It is stated that Abbott never took his place with the firm, passing away during his journey to India. When Prynne went back to England in the early 1950s, Davis stayed on and ran the firm till the 1960s, when Kiffin-Petersen and Bennett Pithavadian (whose father changed his name from Fenn to Pithavadian), who had worked for the firm, took it over. Amongst the best buildings PAD designed were the University of Madras’s Library and Teaching (Clock Tower) Block and the Centenary Building, both raised in harmony with Senate House. If Abbott never made it to Madras, the bespectacled person explaining the Centenary Building’s model to Prime Minister Nehru in my 1957 picture today must have been Davis, though the University has named him as Abbott in a caption it has used. Davis was also responsible for the Bombay Mutual Building and Dare House on N.S.C. Bose Road.
Another noteworthy building the firm did design was Adyar Villa in Kotturpuram, the assignment for his home being given to it by M.A. Chidambaram, who was a good friend of Davis. The design, however, was by Kiffin-Petersen, an Australian, who favoured the Spanish villa style that Florida’s Palm Beach had made famous in the 1930s. Many of the corporate houses in the Boat Club area too were designed by him. Davis returned to England in the early 1960s before construction of Adyar Villa started and the building was raised during the Petersen-Pithavadian partnership that succeeded Davis.
When Kiffin-Petersen left Madras in the late 1960s, Prynne, Abbott and Davis was taken over by Pithavadian who ran it as a proprietorship. Then, in 1972, he took in partners and renamed the firm Pithavadian & Partners. Of Pithavadian Krishnan, who had worked with him, says, “A McGill University, Canada, graduate, he was a modernist more concerned with the problems of a poor country and used his civil engineering skills to produce functional and economical buildings. He won the President’s Gold Medal for the design of a low-cost house during the early years of his practice.” Later, however, he was responsible for another type of landmark in Madras, the IOB Building, “the first highrise in Madras responding to principles of designing for the tropics.”
I’d be glad to hear from my caller who prefers telephone-chat to writing if he has anything more to add to this — provided he sends it in duly written.

When the postman knocked…

- A copy of Ravenshaw’s 1822 map of Madras is with P.T. Krishnan and, he tells me, the five boundary pillars of the second esplanade, the one beyond the New Town Wall (Miscellany, April 14), are marked on it. Only, the present site of the Washermenpet Police Station is nowhere near where the boundary marker is shown on that map. The plaque had obviously been moved, as I had conjectured. Krishnan also tells me that the boundary markers also indicate on the map the boundaries of Royapuram, Tondiavoodu (Tondiarpet) and Washermenpet. Three paths led out of gates in the Wall and crossed the esplanade. These paths became, from west to east, Tiruvottriyur High Road, Monegar Choultry Road, and Mannarsamy Koil Street. Their gates, I reckon, would have respectively been what were called Ennore Gate, Trivatore Gate and Pully Gate. I look forward to more details of this area from Krishnan.
- Dr. R.V. Rajan (Miscellany, April 21), writes Dr. P.S. Venkateswaran, had studied to become a surgeon and went to England where he got his FRCS, but got interested in Venereology and became an internationally recognised expert on the subject. Dr. K.S. Sanjivi, who was part of Dr. RVR’s intellectual circle, retired as Professor of Medicine and was awarded the Padma Bhushan. But in what must be a unique record, Dr. Sanjivi’s brothers, Prof. K. Swaminathan and Dr. K. Venkat Raman, were also awarded the same honour. Swaminathan, Professor of English at Presidency College, turned to journalism after he retired and then became the Chief Editor of the 90-volume Collected Works of Mahatma Gandhi. Dr. Venkat Raman retired as the Director of the National Chemical Laboratory. As for Dr. RVR, as already mentioned, he went on to become the first Indian Dean of the Madras Medical College, but, points out Dr. Venkateswaran, it was a designation that came into being after the term ‘Superintendent’ had been done away with. Two Indians had served as Superintendents, Col. Pandalai and Dr. Sangam Lal. Dr. Rajam lived on G.N. Chetty Road in a house that has now given way to Ankur Plaza. As was the vogue those days, it was “a sort of semi-circular house (art deco?) with many doors. Dr. Rangachary’s house had 16 doors; Dr. Rajam had fewer.”

Three injured in LPG blast
","A couple and their nine-month-old son suffered burns when fire broke out due to leakage of LPG at their house in Kasturi Extension in Rajgopalnagar on Friday.
The police identified the victims as Jagadish (30), Nagarathna (25) and their baby boy. According to sources, all the three persons have suffered third-degree burns and their condition is said to be serious. The incident occurred on Friday morning when Jagadish lit the gas stove to boil milk. According to the police, though the gas hose pipe was damaged, it had not been changed. The damaged part had been covered with a cellophane tape, and that is suspected to have led to the explosion.

Glitter and glad tidings
","There was a time when parents and family elders would take it upon themselves to buy gold every time whenever it was possible. And on occasions like Akshaya Tritiya, a small gold souvenir, if not an elaborate piece of jewellery, simply had to be bought for posterity’s sake. Of late however, an increasing number of young professionals have also begun to invest in the precious metal on such occasions. The reasons vary from carrying forth family traditions to making sensible investment choices.
Anubha Singh, a communications professional, prefers to buy some jewellery every year on Akshaya Tritiya. “I started doing this because I grew up watching my parents do so. Also it seemed like a good investment option. No matter how small, I ensure I buy a piece of jewellery. Earlier I would buy it for myself, now I buy something for my two-year-old daughter. It might seem silly to some people but in the long run the value of the jewellery I accumulate will only increase. The fact that it is keeping in mind the family tradition is just an added bonus,” she says.
According to popular belief buying something new and valuable on this day ensures continued prosperity. For Divya Nambiar though it also means a security investment. “I set aside a small sum every month so I can buy some gold or diamonds on Akshaya Tritiya. It could be anything from earrings to bracelets or even just a gold coin. At least I know that I have a small treasure of my own. Also the gold coins I bought over the last five years proved helpful when I was investing in property last year. When I needed a little extra cash I could fall back upon the gold that I had invested in,” she explains.
Rahul Nigam, brand manager at Meena Jewellers, who has been in the jewellery business since the early 1990s agrees that the trend has been changing over the years. “Earlier I’d see parents buying gold on such occasions for their daughters or daughters-in-law. However, these days the same youngsters who’d scoff at this habit of their parents are now investing in the precious metal. We get a lot of pre-orders from these people and they pick up the jewellery on Akshaya Tritiya day. Basically, young professionals these days are aware that the value of gold will never drop and it is a good security investment for them – much less riskier than investing in stocks,” he says, adding, “It is so easy to spot a young buyer because there is a sense of pride and confidence in them when they choose the piece of jewellery they’d like to buy. When they accompany their parents, it is usually the parents’ choice that comes to fore. But this is different.”
Incidentally, he says that it is young women who buy pieces of jewellery on Akshaya Tritiya. “Men prefer to invest in gold coins that thay can store in their lockers and use as and when required. Women on the other hand would rather buy jewellery because they want to enjoy it,” he smiles. Rahul adds that with the elections going on, this year’s sales haven’t been high so far. “With all the checking going on, there have been restrictions on the amount of cash people can carry.” Now with polling complete in and around Hyderabad, they hope to see more business.

Blasts bring to fore RPF squad’s needs
","To make the Bomb Detection Squad (BDS) of the Railway Protection Force (RPF) more effective, a high-level committee of the force has recommended that only trained personnel form part of the squad.
Aware of the key role played by the BDS in emergency situations, the committee has made it clear that the personnel should not be utilised for any other duty.
The committee was constituted on the instruction of the Inspector General-cum-Chief Security Commissioner, RPF Southern Railway, to review the functioning of the BDS units in the Southern Railway zone. The panel, comprising the Additional Chief Security Commissioner, the Senior Divisional Security Commissioner, Chennai, and the Divisional Security Commissioner, Palakkad, made recommendations in March on manpower strength, duties and the working pattern of the BDS. The recommendations have been circulated to various divisions of the RPF in Southern Railway, railway sources here told The Hindu.
Foremost among the recommendations was that the BDS consist only of trained personnel adept at handling and maintaining equipment used in anti-sabotage operations. The committee also made it clear that the role of BDS personnel was only to detect explosive substances and not to dispose of them. The disposal had to be done by the Bomb Detection and Disposal Squad of the State police.
The committee said the BDS should be constituted in stations where the Integrated Security Scheme was being implemented. The BDS should function round the clock on three shifts, and its personnel should be sent for specialised courses as well as refresher programmes from time to time to enhance their skills.
The sources said the BDS units were now functioning in the Chennai, Tiruchi, Madurai and Thiruvananthapuram Divisions, besides Coimbatore.
The strength of the BDS in Tiruchi would come down to 11 from the existing 15. Those who were not trained would be taken out as per the committee’s recommendations. Instead, those who were trained in handling and maintaining anti-sabotage equipment and serving in different locations in the division would be attached to the BDS.

Where brooms attract grooms
","There is a relation between brooms and grooms in this tiny village which is 25 kms from Rajahmundry city in East Godavari district. Brides here have a great demand so much so that grooms are willing even to pay kanyasulkam (a practice where the groom pays dowry to the bride) for a bride from Palla Kadiyam village.
It is a semi-rich village in Rajanagaram mandal which became famous for making broomsticks, an activity that became a cottage industry, providing livelihood to over 1,000 families.
A great source of self-employment, parents in the village don’t worry about their daughters’ marriage. “Girls after attaining marriageable age have wannabe grooms queuing up because it takes care of their employment, making brooms here in the village,” says Chintapalli Arjunudu.
According to Ch. Sahadevudu, the raw material to make broomsticks comes in gunny bags from Assam and Maredumilli in Rampachodavaram Agency area in the district. “A 50-kg-bag of dry grass used in the broom costs Rs. 2,000. After wastage, we get only 40 kg,” he says, explaining that soft grass is cleaned up before it is assembled into a broom.
A handle is made for a comfortable grip and buyers have a wide range of varieties to choose from.
Most villagers secure additional raw material like plastic pipes, coconut sticks and wire from places like Vijayawada.
Every household generates between 250 and 400 brooms every day which is then weighed, says Arjunudu. “Each bag of grass is used to make 150 to 200 brooms of four different varieties and the price ranges from Rs. 30 to Rs. 60,” he informs.
Citing financial constraints, Mr. Arjunudu says banks should come forward to give loans and the government must look into the issue.
The agent who helps the villagers secure raw material, also assists them in sale of their product. Some villagers go as far as Rayalaseema and Srikakulam areas to bring in grass or plastic pipes.

Salman Khan case: Witness identifies articles presented by prosecution
","Sambha Gouda, the police witness, continued with his deposition on the second day in the Bollywood actor Salman Khan’s hit-and-run case of September 2002.
Mr. Gouda is the first witness to depose in the >re-trial of the case that began last week at a Mumbai sessions court. A piece of the shutter of the American bakery, mud guard of the actor’s car that came off during the accident and glass shards that were presented by the prosecution in the court on Friday were identified by Mr. Gouda.
Mr. Gouda, a tea vendor by profession told the court that he lives on the footpath which is five minutes away from the accident spot. On September 28, 2002 night, at 3 a.m., three constables came to inquire him. He then reached the spot in an auto and saw a huge crowd gathered there. He told the court that he had never visited the crime spot before the accident and that the spot was at Hill Road in Bandra. The defence however claimed that Mr. Gouda never visited the spot.
In September 2002, one person was killed and four injured after the actor’s SUV allegedly jumped over a footpath where the victims were sleeping. Mr. Khan was earlier booked for rash and negligent driving. But later, the court observed that he could be charged with culpable homicide not amounting to murder.
He then moved an application for fresh examination of witnesses on the grounds that the witnesses were previously examined for lesser charges against him. His application was granted by the court and a re-trial was ordered.
The matter was adjourned to 6th May and the actor is likely to be present in the court as the witnesses need to identify the actor. During the identification parade in the court, the accused is required to be present

Girls take to veena-making
","A group of nine girls from different age groups have successfully completed the crucial stages of Nuzvid veena making under the watchful eyes of Sheik Meera Saheb, 63, one of the first generation veena makers from Nuzvid in Krishna district.
At a time when the industry is facing a dearth of technical workforce to produce the jack-fruit-wood traditional musical instrument - veena - the All India Handicraft Board has provided a six-month training to these girls. “Except crafting of the instrument, we have learnt every stage of the veena-making, from giving a final touch of colours to bringing the shine to the instrument,” says B. Rajani, a student.
Officially, the training will be completed on May 5. The students are given a stipend of Rs. 2,500 a month. “The traditional designs on veena reveal the identity of the artisans and the place where it is made. These girls have mastered the art of making and they are carving the exact veena designs,” says Mr. Meera Saheb, who recently quit the art.
The girls, waiting in the wings to make a name for themselves in the industry, include Sheik Shafi Munnisa Abi, N. Nagalaxmi, G. Saranya, Sk. Nurzahan, V. Durga and Anjali Devi. “We have a handful of orders for designing veenas. It is a nice feeling to be called an artisan as the pursuit is helping us earn a livelihood,” said G. Saranya, a degree student of Nuzvid town.

Visually-challenged paraglider flies solo
","On Wednesday afternoon, at Kamshet near Pune, a 36-year-old undertook his first solo paragliding flight. As soon as he landed, his trainers ran out and huddled around him. Amid cheers, one said, “We did it. You made history.”
Divyanshu Ganatra had just become the only visually-challenged Indian paraglider to have flown solo. “It was a spiritual high,” Mr. Ganatra told The Hindu before adding modestly: “I did it like everyone else does.”
A clinical psychologist who lost his sight due to glaucoma at the age of 19, Mr. Ganatra runs a counselling and corporate training organisation called ‘Yellow Brick Road’.
The flight was made possible by Templepilots, a paragliding club run by Avi Malik and his wife Anita Deshpande.
According to Mr. Malik, there are no official records of visually-challenged people having undertaken solo flights. A Master Instructor at the Association of Paragliding Pilots and Instructors, he stated that no other Indian had attempted this before. “There are probably one or two worldwide who have attempted this successfully,” he said. A hearing-impaired Belgian performed the same feat under his guidance last year.
For Mr. Ganatra, however, it wasn’t about the achievement or about proving a point to anyone. “I did it because of my love for the sport,” he said. For Mr. Malik and his wife, taking up his request was an “instinctive decision.” “The heart said yes first, the mind worked on it later,” Mr. Malik said.
What was most important was working together and having faith in each other. “I trusted them with my life. That is the only way I could have done this,” Mr. Ganatra said. Ms. Deshpande agreed. “It was about trust, and not about [never] flying anymore.”
The experience helped Mr. Malik stretch his own boundaries as a teacher as he sought to find new ways and means to guide Mr. Ganatra. “One way was using simulation, and working on other senses: touching, feeling and listening,” he said. To explain the concepts of aerodynamics, Mr. Malik asked Mr. Ganatra to use his hands to understand how the glider works.
In a ‘tandem’ flight with an instructor, he learnt what the experience could be like. An initial idea of using bells was discarded as Mr. Malik thought that audio signals broadcast through a radio would do the job. A quick and instinctive learner, Mr. Ganatra was ready for his flight after three days of on-ground training.
“The experience was an overwhelming mix of joy, fear and excitement. When you are in the sky, you taste freedom,” he said.

The best sheets
","My grandmother always stressed the importance of making the bed well, especially when one has house guests. To this day I love watching her make the bed, she makes it look effortless and the end result is beautiful. The sheets she uses are soft and sweet smelling, and have been collected over the years from trips abroad—good quality bed linen wasn’t always available in India as it is now. The bed linen is freshly laundered and ironed; first to go on the bed is the fitted sheet, a top sheet is then added and the corners folded back neatly and the sides tucked into the mattress, a pillow inserted into a matching case is placed at the head of the bed. When it is cold a blanket is layered over the top sheet. The finishing touch is a pretty counterpane that covers the bed and finally cushions are artfully placed on top.
I recently made a trip to a department store to buy some new bed linen, the number of brands, variety in design and material was astounding. Fitted sheets, pretty duvets, even things like mattress protectors were available.
“People are more open and willing to invest in home décor not just in terms of interior design but also the products and items they use when it comes to bed linens, pillows, bed runners etc,” says Arun Bhawsingka, CEO Creative Portico Pvt Ltd, their brand Portico New York which deals with bed and bath furnishings is available at most department stores. Home décor magazines, television shows and social media has heavily influenced and exposed people to the art of making the bed, “The influence of international trends and many brands now available in the market has created more awareness,” says Akanksha Himatsingka, Director of Atmosphere Furnishings which has stores across the country. “More importantly it is the visual influence of social media platforms such as Pinterest, Instagram, etc, that offer a variety of DIY bed linen ideas, which many are embracing and experimenting with.”
Portico New York prides itself on having bed linen to suit every budget, “We do solids and self-jacquards. We also have theme based designs, which could be teamed with matching comforters and duvets,” says Arun. Portico New York has also had fashion designers like Manish Arora and Neeta Lulla design bed linen for them.
Bed linen is all about personal taste and style, whether you want bright motifs or subtle prints, pastel colours or vibrant tones. “We have a range of solids, stripes and patterns in percale and satin sheets at Atmosphere,” says Akanksha “The products are versatile, most of our sheets can be coordinated with the various designs offered.” This allows you to mix and match bed linen. “We don’t believe in collections and trends. We add new items every year but they all belong to the same world,” says Yamini Namjoshi, Brand Director of Bandit Queen which is an India based luxury home-linen brand that is available around the world. “A lot of detail and time goes into creating our products so we want them to be timeless in design and usage.” Bandit Queen customises bed sheets based on size and if you want to feel truly special they can monogram your initials on the bed linen.
With summer upon us try to keep bed linen cool and light. “Summer bedding should be light and easy, it can be fresh solid colours or interesting multi-coloured stripes in light tones mixed with neutrals,” says Akanksha.
Cottons and linens or even cotton-linen blends work best for the season. Thread count is something we have all heard about when it comes to choosing bed linen. Thread count is basically the number of horizontal and vertical threads that make up one square inch of fabric. So the higher the thread count the softer the sheet feels, but it is important to remember that higher thread count also weakens the fabric.
“Thread count is important to a degree,” says Yamini. “But the more threads you have in one square inch means that the thread used is thinner, which could make the fabric weaker. So there should be a balance between the tactile feeling of the material and durability.”
When it comes to buying bed linen pay attention to quality along with design. Considering the number of hours we spend in bed, the material should be comfortable, feel good and most of all enhance sleep.
Because after a hard day’s work nothing beats the feeling of getting in to a bed made with comfortable sheets that smell of sunshine and forgetting the world outside for a few hours.
Pay attention to the quality of the bed linen
Don’t buy sheets that have a high thread count, the material will be weaker
While buying fitted sheets make sure you know the dimensions of your mattress so that you buy the right size
Change your bed sheets at least once a week

Water-level in Vani Vilas Sagar fast depleting
","Owing to the fast depletion of the water-level at the Vani Vilas Sagar in Hiriyur taluk in the district, there is a possibility that Chitradurga city and Hiriyur taluk could face shortage of drinking water in the coming months.
The Vani Vilas Sagar was constructed across the Vedavati, by the kings of Mysore during the 1890s to provide water for drinking and irrigation in the surrounding areas. The dam, however, has not reached its full capacity in the last nine decades owing to various reasons, including scanty rainfall in the region.
Presently, the water-level in the dam is about 68.5 ft against the full reservoir level of 145 ft, and the dead storage level is 60 ft. Silt accumulationThere is a considerable decrease in the storage capacity of the dam owing to silt accumulation. No steps have been taken to remove silt from the dam since its construction, sources said. The water available in the dam can be supplied for another two months, sources said. Apart from Chitradurga city and Hiriyur taluk, water has to also be supplied to premier institutes such as ISRO, DRDO and India Reserve Battalion as per agreements signed with them.
The authorities have also granted permission for the construction of barrages at some places across the Vedavati in Kallod and check-dams at certain places, which would further reduce the flow of water to the dam. Instead of granting permission for construction of barrages and check-dams, the authorities should first remove silt from the dam as it had considerably affected storage capacity, sources added.

Classically, Zubin
","‘Political Views Test the Harmony’, punned the New York Times’ headline in a  recent Arts-section lead story that ran — with the subhead ‘Conductor of Israel Philharmonic (Orchestra) Speaks His Mind on the Middle East’ — over a frowning photo of a pained-looking Zubin Mehta, eyes closed, baton raised. At 77, Mumbai-born, Vienna-trained Mehta leads the orchestra that is Israel’s premier cultural ambassador.
Hosted by the American Friends of Israel to play at Manhattan’s Carnegie Hall, Mehta gave a lengthy interview to the NYT in which he said, “I speak openly about a country that I see, from my private musician’s perspective, as going in the wrong direction (with) the settlements… They know I’m a friend and being in a democracy, I express my opinions freely.” Courageous words uttered publicly in a city whose powerful Zionist lobby rules its impressive cultural and intellectual worlds; tolerated because Mehta has proven his solidarity with Israel repeatedly. During the Gulf War, he played through the fall of Scud missiles while the audience donned gas masks — and stayed to listen. He played when Hezbollah’s rockets fell and, another time, rescheduled concerts so audiences could get home before the curfew.
The maestro’s association with the IPO harks back to when he was invited, at 25, to substitute for an indisposed conductor. He had never heard of the orchestra founded 25 years earlier, as the ‘Palestine Orchestra’, for talented Jewish musicians who were banned from performing in pre-Nazi Europe. At its inaugural concert in 1936, the legendary Arturo Toscanini, then the highest-paid conductor in the U.S. and a staunchly anti-fascist non-Jew, had volunteered to conduct the opera gratis. Later, the IPO named Mehta its Music Director and, in 1981, Music Director for Life. “That title’s just a handshake, there’s no contract,” Mehta explains. “I’ll stay as long as the players want me.”
Not just the players but all of Israel seems to want Mehta, an unlikely national hero as a Parsi who, despite a cosmopolitan life spent abroad, remains Indian at heart. (Moved, for instance, by hearing of Raj Kapoor’s death before a Moscow concert, Mehta shared the news with the audience and dedicated his performance to the Russians’ beloved superstar.)
As conductor of the redoubtable New York Philharmonic from 1978-1991, Mehta became a celebrity, lionised by the media, darling of socialites. Sexy and glamorous, ‘Zuby baby’ came from the Los Angeles Philharmonic to head the world’s best, most difficult orchestra. He had occasional problems with players and critics though never with audiences who idolised his musicality as much as his dashing stage presence. (Still handsome, Mehta has aged gracefully to embody dignity onstage.) He mentored and promoted young players, took his elite orchestra to Harlem, commissioned Ravi Shankar to compose a sitar concerto that they performed together at the Philharmonic where, on Saturday mornings, he introduced children to classical music. At one such ‘Young People’s Concerts’, he handed over his baton to a 12-year-old to conduct in his place! Visiting Parsis, attending Mehta’s morning rehearsals, would go backstage to be heartily welcomed by “
aapro (our own) Zubin” with jolly conversation and gifts of CDs.
When he declined to renew his contract after 13 years, everyone was disappointed. He left Manhattan’s rat race because “spiritually, it’s necessary to have time to study, to rethink.” He wanted to do “more opera, more touring, things out of my routine.” And he did that: He gained popularity with a universal TV audience by conducting the ‘Three Tenors’; now he heads the opera in Florence, Italy, and tours worldwide. Each year, he spent three months with the IPO. “Israel and its people remind me of India; people are always talking, arguing, laughing,” he observes. “The orchestra — the country itself — is like a warm close-knit family. It’s one of my spiritual homes; I’ve grown up with them, I’ve been there since 1961.”
Musically, too, he’s had serious disagreements with Israeli society: his passion for 19 century German composer Richard Wagner is not reciprocated. As Hitler’s favourite, Wagner is loathed in Israel where survivors still bear Auschwitz’s tattoos. “He was 110 per cent anti-Semitic,” Mehta concedes. “But, he’s half my world.” When the IPO played Wagner for an encore at a 1981 concert, Israelis booed and walked out. Mehta has not dared revisit Wagner, an opera lover’s dream. Still, “the relationship with my favourite orchestra is a lasting marriage” based on a shared devotion to music. When Mehta was honoured by Washington’s Kennedy Center, the IPO flew in from Israel to serenade him! On his — and the IPO’s — 70 birthday, they surprised him by playing “Happy Birthday” at their Carnegie Hall gala.
For years, Mehta has made music education a priority. In Mumbai, he honoured his musician-father by establishing the Mehli Mehta Foundation, which trains 300 children in Western classical music. In Tel Aviv, the Buchmann-Mehta School of Music trains Israeli musicians, while his ‘Mifneh’ programme caters to 250 young Arabs in the West Bank that he often visits. “With my Indian passport, I have no problem. The Indian ambassador in Ramallah sends his car.” Mehta’s dream is to find an Israeli-Arab to play in the IPO. “May be,” he muses, “music will help us come together.”

A tradition kept alive
","Temple festivals not only unite all communities together under a common platform and provide a space for youth to display their talents and courage but also ensure survival of traditional sports.
Double bullock cart race, locally known as ‘rekla’ race, was one such traditional and famous sports held as a part of the annual Chithirai festival of Sri Muthalamman Temple at Thummalapatti near Batlagundu near here. The entire village wore a festive look on Friday and people from Thumallapatti and nearby areas thronged it to witness the festival since morning.
The main road connecting Thummalapatti, Kanavaipatti Sri Lankan refugee camp and Pudhupatti Kamarajapuram was converted into a race track. Traffic was closed on this road.
Spectators converged on both sides of the road to witness the event.
Under big bull category, bullocks owned by Madhu Bala of Cumbum clinched the first prize.

Equal in every way
","On April 15, 2014, India’s Supreme Court took a major step in making India more inclusive and humane, by according legal recognition for the first time to the ‘third’ gender or ‘transgender’ people. The fact that these people do not belong to either the male or female gender should not be used, the highest court directs, to block their entry into educational institutions or employment. The judges went further to classify transgender people as ‘other backward classes’, thereby making them eligible for affirmative reservations in education and public employment.
The significance of this enlightened judgment — in reversing a long history of ‘unspeakable violence’ endured by transgender people since colonial times — is highlighted by a significant report titled ‘Transcending the Binaries: Transgender Exclusions in Law and Policy’ by Shubha Chacko and Arvind Narrain, for the forthcoming India Exclusion Report 2013-14 by the Centre for Equity Studies.
Transgender people, they explain, are people who live fully or partially the gender role ‘opposite’ to their biological sex. They quote Veena, a hijra in Bangalore, who declares, “I am a transgender, a woman, dalit, sex worker, socialist, and poor. I am all these things and much more. And I fight to build up a world where I will be accepted for everything I am.”
But the ambiguous sexuality of transgender people, their refusal to accept the sexual identity imposed on them by biology and birth, has led to a long history of social and official refusal to accept them as equal citizens or human beings. Instead they are treated — often violently — as the ‘other’, what the authors describe as ‘invisible, ridiculous, horrific or disgusting’. They are “often laughed at, shunned, rejected by their families, denied jobs, ration cards and passports, and exploited by others in the professions they are allowed into (for instance, seeking alms and sex work). They repeatedly face a host of problems from institutions as diverse as family to the medical establishment including the arms of the state, particularly the police. The social and cultural practice of discrimination coupled with poverty, illiteracy and limited opportunities of employment have led to increased vulnerability of these communities.”
The report highlights the many ways that both criminal and civil law in India have criminalised and legally withheld elementary rights from transgender people. The authors trace the contemporary criminalisation of transgender people to the 1897 amendment to the Criminal Tribes Act of 1871, sub-titled ‘An Act for the Registration of Criminal Tribes and Eunuchs’. Under this statute, a eunuch was ‘deemed to include all members of the male sex who admit themselves, or on medical inspection clearly appear, to be impotent.’ Any eunuch who appeared ‘dressed or ornamented like a woman in a public street….or who dances or plays music or takes part in any public exhibition, in a public street….[could] be arrested without warrant and punished with imprisonment of up to two years or with a fine or both.’ A eunuch was considered incapable of acting as guardian, making a gift, drawing up a will or adopting a son. Although this ‘law stands repealed today in theory’, Chacko and Narrain find that it ‘continues to exist as part of the living culture of law’.
There is the infamous Section 377 of the IPC which makes punishable ‘unnatural offences’ of voluntary and consenting sexual intercourse which goes ‘against the order of nature’. The Immoral Trafficking Prevention Act 1896 has been amended to be gender neutral and, in theory, does not criminalise sex work; but by making soliciting and running brothels illegal, sex workers are continuously vulnerable. The report finds that transgender sex workers tend to be arrested on charges of stealing and extortion rather than for sex work. Apart from sex work, the only other profession that society permits transgender people to enter is begging, but anti-begging laws, another colonial legacy, are used to arrest and detain transgender people who solicit alms for a living.
Chacko and Narrain also show how sexual non-conformity is used to bar access of transgender people to many civil rights, even though they in theory enjoy the same fundamental rights as people who accept the sexual identities that biology has assigned them. Prior to this historic judgement of India’s Supreme Court, “The Indian state’s policy of recognising only two sexes and refusing to recognise hijras as women, or as a third sex (if a hijra wants it), has deprived them, at a stroke, of several rights that Indian citizens take for granted. These rights include the right to vote, the right to own property, the right to marry, the right to claim a formal identity through a passport and a ration card, a driver’s license, the right to education, employment, health so on. Such deprivation secludes hijras from the very fabric of Indian civil society.”
Transgender people are excluded both by state and society. They are not protected by the state when raped, they are only offenders. Shubha Chacko explains that the state does not even count them, because they do not count. They trouble us so much because they force us to question body and desire; and their existence challenges — even subverts — patriarchy, which celebrates masculinity, while here is a group that rejects their biologically-given manhood. And it is a very lonely community. However oppressed you are, say as a dalit or a Muslim, at least you have your family to fall back on. But not transgender people. They have only people ‘like them’ to fall back on, no one else.
The progressive — even if greatly belated — judgment of the Supreme Court will not change overnight the destinies of people who do not conform to the sexual practices of the majority of the population. But it reminds us of the unacceptable ways that our society and law treat people of difference — with contempt, injustice and violence. It will hopefully pave the way for a more humane and inclusive world for people who may or may not be like you or me, but that in no way makes them less human.

Action plan sought to rebuild ‘T’
","Justice L. Narasimha Reddy of the High Court said that compared to the 1960s and the 70s, governance was at the crossroads.
With Telangana set to become the 29 State, what is required of the political executive is to formulate policies and for officials and administration is assurance of their implementation in letter and spirit.
He was addressing a gathering comprising members of the Telangana Commercial Taxes Gazetted Officers’ Association (TCTGOA) at a symposium titled ‘Perspectives on Telangana State & the Role of the Executive’ here on Friday evening,
In a market economy, the focus was on the standard of living of people, but what was more important was improving the standard of life per se and that would come only with an element of simplicity and sacrifice, he said.
This required an attitudinal change in employees and officers, he said, adding that they should view work as a service to people, without dishonesty in approach.
G. Vivekanand, MP, said the need of the hour was to chalk out an action plan with a half-a-dozen indicators for a start, in the endeavour to recreate Telangana State.
“Let us have just five or six points on which to work on. Land records management is an important task and titles will be crucial in the new State, apart from maintaining law and order. All these would create an atmosphere conducive enough for all to work together and make Telangana a development model for others to follow,” he said.
Other key speakers included Telangana Joint Action Committee chairman. Prof. M. Kodandaram, Telangana Employees JAC, G. Deviprasad, Prof. G. Haragopal, Chief Editor of the Telugu daily ‘Namasthe Telangana’, Allam Narayana, Convenor of the Forum for Telangana, Osmania University, Prof. G. Laxman, Chairman, Telangana Commercial Taxes JAC T. Vivek
TCTGOA General Secretary C. Anil Kumar presided over the occasion that was also utilised to felicitate Joint Commissioner (CT) N. Ashok Reddy on his superannuation.

Crude bomb explodes in Chidambaram, 5 injured
","Five persons were injured when a country—made bomb exploded in a residential area here on Saturday, trigerring tension even as the case took a curious turn when four of them fled from the hospital, giving the slip to the police.
The explosion comes close on the heels of Thursday’s twin blasts in the Guwahati Express train at Chennai Central station that claimed a woman’s life and left 14 injured.
The crude bomb went off in a house in a residential colony in this temple town, causing damage to the room atop the building in which five persons were injured including an employee of a well—known University.
Police rushed to the spot and admitted three of the injured to a government hospital and the remaining two in a private hospital.
The trio undergoing treament at the government hospital tricked the police and escaped under the guise of answering nature’s call and one of their associates did likewise from the private hospital, police said.
The police have launched a hunt for the injured and are keeping a watch on the lone person who remained in hospital and is suspected to have brought the bomb to the room where it exploded.
The injured, Mohan Ram, is an history—sheeter hailing from Dindigul, police said.
The employee of the university, identified as Arul, who is stated to have suffered damage to his eyesight, is among those who escaped.
According to Cuddalore Collector Kirlosh Kumar, who visited the spot, a country—made pistol and material suspected to be used in making explosives were recovered from the house where Arul was staying.
Police said they have launched a probe into the matter from various angles in the wake of the four making good their escape.
On Thursday, when twin blasts had rocked the train in Chennai, an alleged Indian Mujahideen operative from Rajasthan was arrested by the police of that State at Parangipettai in this district.

Angst through artistry
","As many as 25 artists came together for a two-day workshop organised by State Gallery of Fine Arts under the leadership of Sivanagi Reddy, Director recently. “The quality of work and the display of professionalism by such young women is astounding. They all had ideas to contribute, and made art their medium to communicate,” says Ramani Mylavarapu who also presented a collage titled ‘All roads lead to ...’ through which she highlighted her concern about the lack of safety of women after the Nirbhaya incident, and after a woman was raped in a car near Inorbit mall in Hyderabad.
Another of her works depicted a girl wearing a black belt, in a defensive pose suggesting that girls should be trained in self defence in schools. In the background to the left there were software companies in the abstract, and to right, ‘Jhansi ki Rani’ subtly depicts inspiration.
Another painter Anjali Das, who hails from a village in Ongole, likes to paint Indian culture. One painting that stood out was three women in black and white, one involved with the Sankranti festivity rituals, the other two gossiping. She works with oil and water colours. Her dream career is to be an art teacher where she can teach children about Indian culture and traditions.
Also featuring her works was K.V. Nagamani from Kukatpally. She started painting after her schooling and later, pursued her degree in Fine Arts from JNAFAU. One of her most talked about paintings is titled ‘Wedding Celebrations’ in Telangana.
One of her most beautiful works was a tribal woman with a large vessel on her head, belonging to the East/West Godavari belt.
Saakshi Sharma, a painter from childhood, gave a more formal touch to her passion by obtaining a Bachelor’s degree at JNAFAU. She now spreads her love for art, by holding evening classes at her residence and also teaching art at St. Francis School, her alma mater. “Colours liberate me, especially when I get to watch them play out on canvas,” she says.
She feels that being able to portray an emotion or a series of events on canvas is a way of communicating. “When I am done with the painting, I need to hear it speak to me. Only then I know it is complete.”
So far she has done two series of works. One is a collection titled liberation, and the other, contrasting harmony, dreams and perfect imperfection.
Calcutta is known for its cultural learning and contribution to the art vista in the country. To give exposure to A.P., a set of miniature paintings from Calcutta were brought and presented to the audience.
The display was a feast for the eyes, especially a few paintings that were of great calibre. The whole exhibition was called Miniature 101, which was first exhibited at Chemould Art Gallery, Kolkata last year.
This exhibition asks the painters to express their thoughts in a very small two dimensional format, almost as if to say ‘Small is beautiful.’

No bar to consider IPS officer’s bail plea
","The Madras High Court, on Friday, set aside the order of a Judge who directed the XI Metropolitan Magistrate not to proceed with the bail application filed by IPS officer R.V. Varun Kumar
Justice C.S. Karnan, who heard the criminal revision case filed by Mr. Varun Kumar, in his order said: “If any order is passed suo motu which is out of prayer by invoking Court’s inherent power, those orders should not be prejudicial to the interest of the opposite party. In this case, this court did not give an opportunity to the accused and stayed his bail application. As such it is unjustifiable.”
The order also states that after an intervening period of two years, the act of the police in seeking custodial interrogation of the accused can only be viewed as an afterthought.
The Judge further said the Apex Court had given an opportunity to Mr. Varun Kumar to move a regular bail application before the appropriate court after surrender. He had surrendered on April 28, 2014, and was remanded in judicial custody. Subsequently, a bail application had been filed. The same is to be disposed of with high priority, the Judge said.
He further said that Mr. Varun Kumar had sought bail before the trial and conviction and, as such, need not be incarcerated as he had received anticipatory bail.
Meanwhile, the bail application of Mr. Varun Kumar filed at the Saidapet court was dismissed on Friday evening.

The 40 cameras at various points of the station could have recordings for three hours up to the departure of the train, another senior police official said.
The police have obtained call details from mobile-phone towers near the station.
While a Railway Police team headed by a Deputy Superintendent of Police has left for Chennai from here, a special team comprising National Investigation Agency and Tamil Nadu Crime Branch officials has arrived in Bangalore to coordinate the investigation.

Chennai train blast: TN police ‘identify’ more suspects
","Some more suspects in the >twin bomb blasts in the Kaziranga Express have been identified, Tamil Nadu Police said on Sunday claiming it has got “positive” clues on the explosions that killed a woman passenger and left 14 others injured.
Perusal of CCTV footages at the Chennai Central Station, Bangalore City Railway station and those between Bangalore and Chennai has led the CB-CID police, probing the explosion to zero in on some “positive” leads, a senior official involved in the investigation said in Chennai.
He said “some more suspects have been identified” but declined to elaborate, saying it would hamper investigations.
The official said a police team sent to Guwahati was camping there and questioning some of the passengers who travelled by the train looking for more clues that could help them track down the perpetrators of the blast.
The CB-CID police have sought the help of experts to confirm whether a suspect who boarded the Bangalore-Guwahati express at Bangalore and who was masking his face with handkerchief, was the same person who was seen hurriedly alighting at Chennai, the official said.
Police are also looking at the possibility of the blasts being the handiwork of Indian Mujahideen or some sleeper cells, he said.
A police team is continuing investigation at Bangalore.
The CB-CID has also deputed a team to Patna against the backdrop of investigations indicating that explosions there hours before Narendra Modi’s rally, was similar to that of Chennai blast.

KSRTC bus fares may go up by 7 per cent in two days
","The Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) has decided to hike bus fares across the board by an average seven to eight per cent, and the formal announcement will be made in the next couple of days.
The last time the transport corporation increased bus fares (by 10.5 per cent) was on June 15, 2013.
Addressing presspersons here on Friday, Minister for Transport Ramalinga Reddy said that the KSRTC proposal to hike bus fares comes in the wake of increased diesel prices and maintenance cost.
The transport corporation had incurred loss amounting to Rs. 200 crore, and the implementation of the proposed hike was inevitable, he said. On April 24 this year, Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC) hiked fares across the board by an average of 15 per cent.
Asked about the quantum of hike, the Minister said, “It is very less; may be half of the BMTC bus fare hike.” The hike could have been avoided if the State government had extended tax exemption to all road transport corporations (RTCs), he added. With the extended deadline for installing emergency doors in luxury buses ending on April 30, he said that the department had launched a drive against buses plying without the mandatory exit doors. Buses without emergency exit doors, including inter-State ones, operating from the State would be seized. More than 50 private buses without emergency exit doors had been seized in the Majestic and Kalasipalyam areas in Bangalore and a few elsewhere.
He said that emergency doors would be added to all single-door KSRTC Pushpak buses.
Such doors have been fixed on 100 Pushpak buses and work was on to provide the facility in another 200 such buses.
In November 2013, the department announced that buses without emergency doors would not be allowed to operate after April 30, 2014.

Bangalore-Mangalore high-speed rail project may face many challenges
","The proposed high-speed rail connectivity between Bangalore and Mangalore could be the most challenging among such projects being planned to decongest the State’s capital.
Minister for Infrastructure R. Roshan Baig, who announced last week that the new infrastructure policy would be formulated after consultations with all stakeholders, had spoken about the need to bring investment to implement high-speed rail projects connecting Bangalore to Mangalore, Mysore, Kolar, Tumkur, Hubli and Belgaum.
G.G. Mohandas Prabhu, who formerly headed the infrastructure subcommittee of the Kanara Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said introduction of any more passenger trains on the Bangalore-Mangalore railway line would not be easy.
The tripartite agreement that Hassan Mangalore Rail Development Company Ltd. (HMRDC), floated to undertake gauge conversion of the line, has entered into with the Railways and the State government limits the movement of passenger trains on the line. The line capacity is to be used primarily for goods services, according to a key feature of the agreement.
The agreement says, “SWR (South Western Railway) shall be entitled to run on the project railway, the equivalent of the passenger services that already were operational on the MG (metre gauge) track … without payment of any access charges. Provided, however, that any new passenger service on the project railway shall be commenced only with the prior written consent of HMRDC.”
Mr. Prabhu, a member of the Konkan Railway Users Consultative Committee, said the State government would have to first take steps to ease the conditions in the agreement before thinking of increasing the passenger train service or talking about high speed trains.
R.L. Dias, leader of the Udupi Yathri Sangha, told The Hindu that it was impossible to run high-speed trains on the track which had deep slope between Sakleshpur and Subramanya Road. Passenger trains take about two-and-a-half hours to cover the 55-km stretch, with two locomotives used.
If the government was keen on high-speed trains, it would have to ensure laying of a line to Bangalore via Nandikur, Karkala, Ujire, Charmadi and Mudigere, he said. This proposal, he said, had been submitted to the Railway Board. The line could be linked to the Sakleshpur-Kadur line, which is under construction. Another new link line from Mudigere to Belur could provide a track that could take high-speed trains between Mangalore and Bangalore, he said.

BMTC agrees to extend bus services till 1 a.m.
","Finding public transport late in the night may not be impossible anymore. Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC) has bowed to requests by citizens to extend services on select routes till 1 a.m.
BMTC Managing Director Anjum Parvez has directed the corporation’s traffic department to conduct a survey to shortlist the routes. “This exercise is to be completed in 10 days,” said Kumar Pushkar, Director, IT, BMTC. Recently, the corporation had arranged for 20 per cent of its fleet to operate till 11.30 pm.
The BMTC’s decision to extend services till 1 a.m. follows the submission of a petition by ‘change.org’. The online petition to extend services till at least midnight received more than 15,000 signatures.
The petition was initiated by city-based lawyer Shashank Kumar, who met Mr. Parvez earlier this week to submit the same. In addition to the online petition, a survey of 6,800 Bangaloreans conducted by change.org saw 98 per cent of the respondents seeking extension of services. The result of this survey was also handed over to the BMTC.
A release by change.org said Mr. Parvez had assured them that some buses would ply till 1 a.m. on select routes and these services would originate from either Kempegowda Bus Station (KBS) or Shivajinagar. It added that ‘these special buses would operate on a trial basis to see the extent of demand from the public. The MD said that the routes would be changed as per demand. More routes would be added depending on the response’.
Mr. Shashank Kumar is expected to meet the BMTC’s traffic and planning team on Saturday. “The agenda is to figure out the routes. The MD has told us that due to labour norms, the buses will operate from 5 p.m. to 1 a.m. We will also discuss whether to deploy the new 36-seater Midi buses or the regular ones,” he said.

Clicking for a calling
","It’s noontime, baking hot, and I am passing by India Gate in New Delhi in an air-conditioned car. Thank God for it! Peeping out, I see the barricaded road leading to the early 19th Century monument — popular on tourists’ to-do list otherwise — nearly deserted. Who visits a roasting Delhi in May-June, after all?
And then I catch this sight — a bunch of eager beavers. With cameras hanging round their neck, they form an uneven line, just where the police barricade starts on the stretch of Rajpath that ends at the Gate, each flashing sample photos from albums. Pretty palpable is their hope for the odd tourist to arrive and hire their services.
No, they are neither a new phenomenon at India Gate nor have I spotted them for the first time. In fact, I remember reading a news item some time last year that the photographers of India Gate had been barred from entering the area. So they are back now!
A parallel thought also hits my head: even in the best of weather, who gets a photo clicked by them at a time when even the cheapest mobile phones have in-built cameras?
The question needs an answer, and I soon find myself amid them. They take me for that one odd tourist they have been waiting for; offer to click my photo with the edifice as the backdrop. “Rs.30, 40 or 50? See samples, photo in two minutes,” the offer is concise. “One for the memory, madam,” they try their luck.
I pose the niggling question to them. Soon names get exchanged, a conversation ensues and in that stream bobs the answer. Rather, the constant struggle, to find the answer. Impressive is their everyday fight to keep the means of livelihood ticking, even in the harshest of environments
“We are nearly 200 of us here. Every day, by 10 o’ clock, we arrive here hoping to make some money,” says Salim. No, he doesn’t own the camera, a Nikon D3000. “We are all employed by a group of people, some get a daily wage from them, some others get commission for photos clicked,” says the Sangam Vihar resident.
Summer is a terrible time for them. “In this heat, we wait the whole day. Hardly anybody comes,” states Salim’s mate Ajay. Ajay belongs to a U.P. village. “There is nothing there for me; I am somehow hanging on here. My neighbour in the rented room in Mandawali is in this job; he brought me to the employer three years ago,” he says. In tourist season, each of these men — in their 20s and 30s — earns between Rs. 5000 and 6000 per month. In summers, the amount dwindles to around Rs.4000. Pointing at another photographer, Salim says, “Vinod is married, has two children, it becomes very difficult for him at times.”
So how do they manage to deliver a photo to a tourist in two minutes? “We bring printers with us. There are about 40 portable printers at this point of time on the India Gate lawns,” pipes up photographer Sonu. No, they don’t own the printers either. Sonu points out a man standing some distance away, saying, “He is my employer. You can talk to him.”
The man — seemingly in his late 30s — identifies himself as Sandeep Rajput. “We have been in this business for the last 8-10 years. I have grown up playing at India Gate; my father, grandfather were balloon sellers here,” says Sandeep. His interest lies in outdoor photography, but he has not got a break yet. “I am carrying on here like this, can earn at the most Rs.15,000 per month,” he says.
Camera phones indeed put a spanner in his business. So does Police harassment. “We have to pay policemen every day to be here,” he says. In an attempt to join hands “to get permission from the authorities, maybe an I-D card,” 36 such ‘employers’ came together two-three years ago to form a union, he says. “It is a registered body named Photographer Welfare Association.”
Mukesh Kumar, the union president, says the biggest blow was when the Police banned their entry to the area just after the December 16 rape case. “When we came back, there were other people operating in collusion with some policemen.” They have been trying to approach Delhi Tourism, the New Delhi Municipal Council and Delhi Police, for permission to be on the lawns. “We also did dharna in front of Sonia Gandhi’s house, Sheila Dikshit’s house,” relates Mukesh.
“NDMC told us, fill forms, we will give you kiosks. It has been over a year now,” says Mukesh’s senior union colleague Sandeep. “We have never done anything illegal here. In fact, a fellow photographer, Raju, has been awarded a tamra patra by the Police Commissioner for alerting them about a bomb at India Gate some time ago,” points out Santosh, a senior union colleague.
Santosh has some fond childhood memories of India Gate. His father was also a balloon seller. “Those days, cars were allowed on this road. When it rained, we would run to one of the rooms under India Gate. Once, a bunch of us climbed till the top of the Gate,” he recalls, laughing.
NDMC has recently employed a private guard agency to help maintain security in and around India Gate. You can spot the men in uniform with sticks in hand moving about. “Their job is to chase us away, people who try and make a living by selling balloons, water bottles, a photograph for a memory. Each of these 36 union members employs at least five young men. So you can imagine how many people are depending on this means of livelihood,” says the old man. Before he walks away, he tells me something one can’t disagree with, “Those in authority should realise that the easiest thing to do is to crush those who don’t have a voice.”
Meanwhile, tomorrow is another day for Sonu, Salim and his ilk.

Native dog breeds have their day
","There has been an increase in the demand for native breeds such as Sippipparai and Rajapalayam at the Dog Breeding Unit of the animal husbandry department at Saidapet.
Records show that in 2012-13 nearly 50 puppies of native breeds and 11 pedigree puppies were sold. The year before, 32 native breed puppies and 10 pedigree puppies were sold. The demand for native breed puppies has been on the rise since 2010-11, when the unit sold 26 native breed puppies and seven pedigree puppies.
Animal husbandry department authorities said that with the increased demand for native breed puppies, the waiting time for each breed would be more than a year. As the department did not breed dogs on a commercial basis, they would not be able to meet the demand, they said.
The unit is one of its kind in the State and was started in the 1980s to promote native dog breeds such as Rajapalayam, Sippipparai, Kombai and Kanni. However, Kombais and Kannis are now bred only by private individuals.
With a steady increase in the demand for native breeds, the State government in 2012-13 allocated Rs. 30 lakh for the renovation of kennels in the unit. With the funds, the authorities created tick channels (as during the summer the canines suffer from tick bites leading to spread of diseases), fixed tiles on the kennel walls and floors and an exhaust fan for each kennel, and raised the height of each kennel to nearly three feet.
The authorities have also provided individual water supply for the kennels, mainly to reduce heat radiation, and clean water for bathing the canines every day, the officer said.   
A senior animal husbandry officer conceded that a couple of years ago, the condition of the kennels were very bad. With the renovation, they are better now, he said.
The unit launched the pedigree breeding programme in 1997 because of public demand. At present, the unit houses nearly 30 canines including five puppies.
The prices of some of the breeds at the unit are less compared to those quoted by private pedigree breeders. For example a male Rajapalayam puppy is sold at Rs. 1,500 and a female at Rs. 1,250. The same puppy is sold at Rs. 7,000 by a private breeder (with proper documents about the lineage of the breed) and Rs. 5,000 without the documents.
Except for the Dalmatians, the unit has fixed a nominal price for the rest of the breeds housed there.

Rs. 10 lakh for murdered Dalit boy’s family
","Four days after a Dalit boy was beaten up and killed allegedly by Maratha youths in Ahmednagar’s Kharda village, Maharashtra Tribal Affairs Minister Madhukar Pichad declared a compensation of Rs. 10 lakh for the victim’s family.
Mr. Pichad, who met the family of 17-year-old Nitin Aage, said: “The family will be given Rs. 5 lakh as compensation from the State government and Rs. 5 lakh from the Nationalist Congress Party as assistance.” He added that the State government would sponsor the education of Nitin’s sister.
Mr. Pichad, who is also Guardian Minister of Ahmednagar district, faced criticism for not having visited the family. “I am sorry, I was late in paying a visit. Justice will be ensured. No communal issue will obstruct the trial,” he told presspersons in Kharda on Saturday.
Nitin was beaten up and hanged from a tree by Maratha youths allegedly for meeting a girl from their family. Eleven people, including the girl’s brother, have been arrested.

Chennai blasts probe: NIA is on board, says Jayalalithaa
","Denying >reports that the Tamil Nadu government had rejected the offer of help from the National Investigation Agency (NIA) for investigating the May Day twin blasts on board the Bangalore-Guwahati Express at the Chennai Central railway station, Chief Minister Jayalalithaa said here on Friday that experts from the agency had reached Tamil Nadu to study the scene of crime.
In a statement here, Ms. Jayalalithaa said that on Thursday, to an offer made by a middle-level Union Home Ministry official to send bomb-disposal squads or bomb-defusing equipment, the State Home Secretary replied that Tamil Nadu would seek help, if required. “I would like to say that NIA experts well versed in cracking bomb blast cases have come to inspect the blast site,” she said.
Explaining the efforts made by the Tamil Nadu Police after the blasts that killed a young woman, Ms. Jayalalithaa said camera footage from all stops of the train from Bangalore to Chennai Central was being analysed to find out the place where the explosives were planted. “Preliminary inquiries have shown that the bomb may have had a timer device,” she said.
She had ordered an inquiry by the State Crime Branch-CID.
The possibility of the blasts occurring in Andhra Pradesh had the train run on schedule was also being looked into.

Twin blasts occurred on coaches not manned by TTE
","In a stunning revelation, it is now known that the twin blasts on the Bangalore-Guwahati Express here on Thursday occurred in coaches unmanned by any Travelling Ticket Examiner (TTE) between Jolarpet and Chennai Central.
Hence, investigators are trying hard to identify the unauthorised persons who had boarded the train, sources in the Crime Branch CID said on Saturday.
Police probes revealed that six TTEs boarded the train in Bangalore on the night of April 30, and three of them had got down at Jolarpet.
Sleeper-Class coaches S-3, S-4 and S-5 were left with no TTE till the train reached Chennai Central the next morning. “We have information that many unauthorised persons boarded the train without a confirmed or reserved ticket. They slept along the aisle or near the toilet of these coaches. Since their names or addresses were not available, we are finding it difficult to identify them,” a CB-CID official told 
The Hindu.
Random enquiry
It was during a random enquiry with some of the passengers who travelled in the affected coaches that the police came to know of unauthorised persons on the train.
Two bombs later exploded in quick succession, killing a woman and injuring 14 others.
Portraits developedInvestigators have developed two portraits of persons who were found to be moving in a suspicious manner at the Chennai Central and Bangalore railway stations.
While one man was seen running out of the coach soon after the train arrived in Chennai on May 1, the other was seen walking towards the train before it left Bangalore.
“The man in Bangalore is seen carrying a baggage and he consciously covers his face to avoid being caught by the CCTV…,” the official said.

From the heartland of humour
","
“Ticket ticket... Idhu LSS bus pa... edaiyile nikkadhu,” cautions the conductor on a crowded bus. “
Edaiyile nikkathunna?... Indha bus yenna polyester veshtiya?” a witty comment from a passenger eases the stifling atmosphere as those on board break into laughter. Such hilarious incidences are everyday happenings in Madurai, where everyone from kids to the elderly sport a funny bone.
It’s a city where every second person walking on the road may pass comments with no inhibitions. Humour runs in their blood, as the slang and the body language are amusing to any outsider. From the earlier times, this clan has thrived on the thinnai pechu and arattai culture. Time-pass here was always synonymous with the comical keli and kindal.
Whether in a family gathering or a temple festival, the ubiquitous nakkal and naiyandi can never be missed. Even during serious and solemn occasions people always find an opportune moment just to insert little humour. This is a trait that’s peculiar to the Temple City. Else how can one explain the fact that top comedians in Tamil cinema hail from Madurai?
Be it Vadivelu’s goofy and slapstick comedies or Vivekh’s witty and chucklesome humour, they all definitely stem from experiences and incidences in Madurai. Who can hold back laughter when Vadivelu lets out his trademark cry, ‘
vandhuttangayya… vandhuttangayya’? While Ganja Karuppu induces laughter with his typical facial expressions and the highly stretched out slang native to the region, Soori, a relatively new entrant is increasingly leaving the movie halls in splits with his dialogue delivery.
Actor comedian Vivekh says, “Humour can always be found in a place where there’s fearlessness. The audacious remarks and lively diction are something unique to the people here.” He says, the Vattara Vazhaku (local dialect) of the region can never be boring as it’s laden with subtle humour. “My inspiration for film comedy comes from here. Spend a day on the Madurai streets and you will be amused at the way these people speak and behave. They have an inherent ability to be hilarious,” vouches Vivekh.
K. Gnanasambandan, Tamil scholar and popular debate personality who has spent his childhood and youth in the villages, recalls numerous anecdotes. “These days, people pretend to be decent and have stopped cracking jokes. The urge to speak in English has also marred certain earthy and rustic Tamil words that are humourous,” says Gnanasambandan. “But, people in Madurai speak their mind. They are candid and convivial and give much importance to relationships. They are known for their timing sense and presence of mind.”
Historically, Madurai is where the Tamil language flourished and people gathered for trade and festivals. “Humour is born out of pain. People here laugh their problems off,” says R. Venkatraman, retired professor of history. “We have not given enough respect to humour and hence even our classical literature is quite serious, whereas, folk literature is more light-hearted.” He refers to Kutrala Kuravanji and the Pallu Padalagal that’s laden with plenty of humourous left-handed compliments and taunting called as ‘Yesal’ in Tamil.
Also, Madurai has a thriving theatre scene. Street-plays and koothu are an everyday affair, where people interact liberally. The arguments born out of these are laced with comical overtones. Like for instance, karagattam and pattimandram are known for their witty repartees. “The tremendous humour sense that we come across in common people has evolved over years. It comes out of melancholic experiences. When one sees life’s lessons from outside, they look hilarious,” says Popular pattimandram speaker S. Raja.
Stand-up comedian M. Christopher Gnanaraj points to the rural lingo that evokes laughter. “The villagers convey even serious matters in a comical way. They package advices in the form of a hilarious joke. These are called ‘
Solavadai’ in Tamil,” says Christopher. He gives few examples -- ‘
Konavayan kottavi vitta mathiri’ (One shouldn’t try to be too creative in difficult times and end up bringing upon more trouble). “Even a poor man would express his poverty in a humorous way with an evident nonchalance in the tone,” he says. ‘
Naan iruken thothala, yen veedu iruku pothala’ (My house is flimsy and my life is clumsy).

Madurai slang


posaketta paya : useless fellow

patraya podu: sit and relax

imbutukoondu: very little

roota kudukatha: Don't tell lie

yekkoi: Elder Sister

Madurai humour club

Stared in 1991 by K. Gnansambandan in association with the Madurai Meenakshi Mission Hospital, the Madurai Humour Club provides a platform to its members, both young and old, to share their jokes. The club encourages only clean comedies and is just a year away from celebrating silver jubilee. Gnanasambandan also publishes ‘Sirippu’, a laughter magazine.

Despite poverty, Assamese migrants feel safer in U.P.
","On April 16, Feroz endured a 36-hour train journey from Lucknow to reach his village in Barpeta district in Assam. Eight days later, he went to the Chenga polling booth in his village, Radhakuchi Habi, and cast his vote. He returned to the Uttar Pradesh capital a few days later. The entire trip cost Feroz around Rs.10,000.
Despite his meagre earnings, Feroz travels from Lucknow to Assam to vote in every election.
Ali feared, as always, the possibility of attacks by Bodo militants as the train passed Kokrajhar, a two-hour drive from Barpeta. “The Bodos not only burn our homes, they also attack trains and rob people. They kill us without any hesitation. We breathe a sigh of relief when we reach home,” says Feroz.
Amid the unfolding of fresh ethnic violence in Assam, migrants from the State living in Lucknoware anxious about the safety of their relatives back home. Their only source of accurate information is the television.
“It’s only a matter of time before the violence spreads to other districts,” says Feroz, who is seated in a small thatched hut on the outskirts of Lucknow. He lives with his wife, four sons and a daughter. The violence in Assam, though alarming, is remote. Abject poverty and the terror of floods caused by the Brahmaputra has, over the years, forced thousands of Assamese to migrate to other parts of the country. Around 40,000 Assamese migrants live in the U.P. capital.
The Assamese started arriving in Lucknow three decades ago. Their migration peaked as the Bodoland movement caught fire, says Roli Misra, an academic with extensive field experience on the migrants’ issues. In Lucknow, most of the migrants live in squalor. The majority of these migrants pick waste for a living. But their deepest hurt comes when they are tagged as “Bangladeshis” despite carrying valid identity cards.
It is the concern that his name might be removed from the voters’ list — virtually a loss of identity and cause for persecution — that drives Feroz to vote without fail. “If I miss the vote at home, I fear they will chop my name off the voter list. Then I will have no home, no identity. Here we are always suspected to be Bangladeshis,” he says. Their physical and linguistic resemblance to Bangladeshis makes these migrants easy targets of police harassment. “The society still views us with suspicion. We fear that if we ever get reprimanded, our identities will be used to persecute us,” says Feroz’s son Ali (name changed), who is struggling with his studies in a college in Lucknow.
18-year-old Ali, who follows news keenly, views the violence back home with concern. “How do the Bodos get weapons unless the Tarun Gogoi government is helping them? They aren’t economically better off than us. So who is helping them? Why do only our people die,” he asks. Ali requests this reporter to conceal his identity, lest his friends in college find out about his living conditions. “I tell my friends that I live in a rented apartment. If they find out I live in this condition, I will be mocked,” he said.
Despite difficulties in paying colleges fees, he hopes to find a decent job some day. But few migrants can afford private education.
Administrative apathy and strict regulations make it difficult for migrants to get admission in public schools. The transfer of their voter cards to Lucknow is also hindered by administrative conditions. “They aren’t able to get ration cards in Lucknow as the administration demands that they must first cancel their original Assam-based ration cards,” says Sandeep Pandey, Magsaysay Award–winning social activist. Cancelling their ration cards back home, however, would effectively extirpate their identity.
By terming these migrants as “Bangladeshis”, the administration abdicates all responsibility, says Mr. Pandey. In 2009, he undertook a drive to convince the administration that the people it was uprooting from slums in Lucknow were in fact Assamese.
While things have since improved, the stigma remains in their minds, says Mr. Pandey. Despite that, Zain (25), a waste-picker, is thankful that in Lucknow they have a stable means of living and are secure.

We are all going on a summer holiday
","Words of a song…but just the thought of a holiday is fun. When it rains, schools get rain holidays. As for people dying, surely the holiday may be to honour him but do you really think people actually mourn at home?
Weekends are holidays; the trouble starts because all week long you pine for the weekend. Holidays are only fun because there are other days in between when you work hard, you work long, you may not work smart but you work!
Think of the British who came and ruled us — they pined to go back “home” to England BUT especially before the days of fast jetting around that was out of the question. Every few years maybe one could go back or else people would have journeyed and holidayed more than they were able to work!
So instead they made chota Englands whereever they could: and how ingeniously they did it. First was the climate, it had to be cool for God’s sake to resemble ‘home’ and then it had to have hills and vales and when they could not find any such place they actually created them . And at what cost, to themselves and everyone else! You have to hand it over to them, creating small English village type of homes, calling them ever so Englishy names like Dingle Dell and Gables, and what have you! The roads or lanes were called after the biggest house on the road like Havelock Lane and Havelock House.
The staff who had never even learnt to read or write made English soups and Yorkshire puddings and were horrified to make a rasam as they knew only Mulligatawny soup which literally means Pepper water. I wonder if they would have been as enamoured if the skins of the masters and mistresses and the little babas were NOT white? Just a thought.
But the end result is that we have these little old English Hill Stations dotted around the country side where we can all feel we have gone abroad or something: The trick is not to nip in and out but stay for a reasonable amount of time and get acclimatized, get into a way of life as it were. When people ask, “What? going away for weeks, what will you do there?” you answer the same thing you do back at home in your own corner of the hot plains.
First you have got away from the hot weather, you can breathe easier, you can play golf or tennis or what ever you do, except swim, I suppose. I mean nobody ever asks you, “Good Lord you stay in the same place for years? What do you do?” Reminds me of a thrice married young lady who was in the midst of much married couple who was celebrating its 40th anniversary or so; not to be put out, she asked, “Aren’t you people bored with each other?”

Poaching gang busted; tiger, leopard cat skins seized
","  Officials of the Wildlife Crime Control Bureau, Southern Region, busted a gang involved in poaching in Tamil Nadu and seized tiger and leopard cat skins from it in Coimbatore on Thursday. 
The bureau’s regional deputy director (south), S.R.V. Murthy, said the four-member gang poached the tiger and the leopard cat skins in Kodaikanal forests. 
Palpandi (29) is the leader of the gang and Karpagavinayagam (30) is his aide. Both hailed from Kukkal in Kodaikanal. The two transported the skins by bus from Kodaikanal to Coimbatore.   
An officer from the bureau approached the poachers as a prospective buyer and asked them to come to Coimbatore. The gang asked for Rs. 70 lakh for the skins and demanded an advance of Rs 1 lakh. The official agreed and met them in Coimbatore and paid the advance.
Mr. Murthy said preliminary investigation revealed that Palpandi was a habitual offender and Karpagavinayagam assisted him during poaching operations. Arumugam, the mastermind, is at large. Soon he would be arrested.
Cases have been registered under various Sections of the Wildlife Protection Act of 1972, which included Section 3 (Prevention of Hunting), Section 27 (Restriction on entry into Sanctuaries) and Section 39 (Wild animals to be treated as government property), Mr Murthy said.

To dak runners with love
","Sher Singh is a dak runner employed by the Department of Posts and his job is to carry mail for 12 km from Raksham to Chitkul, the last village on the Himachal-China border. For the first time, his life has become the theme on which veteran journalist B. G. Verghese has based his book “Post Haste: Quintessential India”.
Stating that he wanted to demystify Bharat, Mr. Verghese said at the book release function on Thursday that he was inspired by the thought that the Election Commission spends so much money to ensure that even three out of millions of voters exercise their adult franchise. This means hiring the services of dak runners like Sher Singh who go to places fraught with danger so that every citizen is connected with the rest of the country. Former Union Minister Natwar Singh said: “I agree with George that the Indian democracy is flawed. But it is good in crisis management and reconciling contradictions.”
Addressing the gathering, which included a number of school students, Mr. Verghese said he was speaking on behalf of Sher Singh. “In 1982 he bought a radio and needed to renew his licence. So he went to the Post Office where he was told to apply for a job of dak runner…and his working language is of course Hindi.”
Asked by an enthusiastic school girl about the qualification of a dak runner, Mr. Verghese said: “His qualifications are grit and determination to fulfil his objective. He has to cross snow fields and cope with aberrant weather conditions. He also has to track the movements of wild animals and steer clear of them.”
Rajya Sabha MP Karan Singh said “the book is a must read because people these days are losing touch with their cultural heritage”.
Noted jurist Leila Seth said the book narrates stories through stamps.

India ranks third in contribution to global malicious activity: Symantec
","Alarming as it may sound, according to a report by data security solutions provider Symantec, India ranks as the third highest source of overall malicious activity globally.
Terming India ‘A Key Threat Frontier’, the annual internet security threat report said 5.1 per cent of all malicious cyber activities in the world originated from India in 2013. At the top spot was the US (20.33 per cent), followed by China (9.93 per cent).
India is followed by Netherlands (3.52 per cent), Germany (3.26 per cent), Russia (2.63 per cent), UK (2.58 per cent), Brazil (2.53 per cent), Taiwan (2.45 per cent), and Italy (2.35 per cent), as per the report.
Moreover, India continued to hold its position as the spam capital of the world.
An interesting trend that the report points out is that newer industries, rather than the traditionally targeted industries, are low-hanging fruits for cybercriminals.
In India, 39.92 per cent or nearly four in 10 attacks were carried out on non-traditional services industries like hospitality, business and personal services. This was followed by attacks on manufacturing (33.33 per cent) and finance and insurance (11.11 per cent).
Cyber criminals, the report said, are unrelenting in their focus on large enterprises with a staggering 69 percent targeted attacks carried out against them. “Despite stepping up their information security measures, businesses in India continue to be an attractive target for cybercriminals,” it noted.
As the same time, it points out that small businesses received the highest number of phishing and virus-bearing emails — almost three times as much as the larger targets.
“Small and medium-sized businesses often have less adequate security practices and resources.  Attackers are increasingly targeting smaller businesses that have a relationship with a larger company,” the report said.

Wandering prankster sent police into a tizzy
","A backpack with a laptop, two cellphones and 35 SIM cards obtained without identity proof — this was 23-year-old S. Sivakumar’s arsenal as he spread panic in the city with a bomb hoax. The native of Bangalore, who has been a pavement dweller on Walltax Road for the past few years, sent law enforcement agencies into a tizzy by claiming that a bomb was planted in Chennai Central station, five days after one person died in the twin blasts there.
Around 10 a.m., on Tuesday, Station Master Govindasamy of Chennai Central received an anonymous call. The man on the line said that a bomb would explode close to the main ticket counter. Bomb squads, along with city police, combed the station for a few hours before they concluded that the threat was a hoax.
With prank calls of this sort becoming a headache for the police, the Cyber Cell actively pursued the case.
“We were tracking the mobile number but soon, the prankster changed SIM cards although the handset remained the same. He kept shifting between Egmore, Waltax Road and Saidapet,” said an investigating officer.
When investigators contacted the prankster in the guise of bankers selling credit cards, his answer was simply, “I know you are cops. Catch me if you can.”
Police managed to nab Sivakumar by Tuesday evening. “He roams around the city and notes down phone numbers on posters of missing persons. He then calls on the number and claims he knows where the missing person is and will provide details in return for money. He has cheated many people this way,” said Deputy Commissioner of Central Crime Branch, S. Jeyakumar.
Five persons who were injured in the blasts were shifted from the Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital to the Railway hospital, Perambur. Seven of the 14 who were injured have already been released and two are recovering after surgery.
Anjaneyalu (29) of Andhra Pradesh, G. Hari (29) of Bangalore, Bijan Kumar (14) of Manipur, Bimal Kumar Das (43) and Saren Barman (31) of West Bengal were shifted to the Railway Hospital.

Khairatabad tops in property tax collection
","The Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) which had a windfall in the form of high property tax collections during the month of April had the maximum collections coming in from the Khairtabad-2 circle.
After announcing an early bird offer of 5 per cent rebate for those paying the property tax in April, the civic body netted a total of Rs.109.53 crore in the month which happens to be Rs.78.93 crore more than the collections during the same period last year. In the year 2013-14, the total collections stood at a meagre Rs.30.59 crore.
Of the 18 circles of the GHMC, Khairatabad-2 topped the list, collecting Rs.27.39 crore which is Rs.18.59 crore more than the previous year’s April transactions. Kukatpally circle with Rs.10.86 crore, Secunderabad with Rs.9.54 crore and Abids-2 circle with Rs.8.73 crore are the other toppers in the list.
Ramachandrapuram circle with property tax collection of Rs.85 lakhs stood at the bottom of the list along with Charminar-2 with Rs.1.69 crore and Rajendranagar with Rs.1.96 crore.
“The rebate offer which actually worked out for just 20 days since it was announced on April 9, got us Rs.78.93 crore more than last April. This high transaction happened during the busy election period when most of our staff were not actually going to field for collections,” said an official.
Since most of them were drafted for poll related duties during the last month, bill collectors could only net Rs.2.46 crore but interestingly, most property owners queued up at Citizen Service Centres of the civic body to pay taxes to the tune of Rs.60.39 crore and visited Mee Seva Centres to pay another Rs.32.43 crore.

Managing the monsoon
","Forecasts by the South Asian Climate Outlook Forum and the India Meteorological Department indicate that the south-west monsoon rainfall may be deficient. Also, there is a possibility of the evolution of an El Niño event during June to September. There is a 45 per cent probability that central, west, north-west and south India will receive below normal rainfall. There is also a 40 per cent chance that eastern States like Odisha, West Bengal, the north-east, and most of Jammu and Kashmir may get normal rains during the south-west monsoon period. Paddy arrivals in the market are also sluggish, indicating that actual production is either lower than the estimated production of 107 million tonnes of rice, or that some of the stocks is being held back in the anticipation of a higher price.
In the current scenario of climate change, predictions of extreme weather events are becoming difficult. In March-April this year, we had unexpected hailstorms and heavy rainfall in parts of central and north-west India. Outside India also, most of California is experiencing extreme drought with storage levels in the major reservoirs as well as lakes well below historic levels. Australia experienced what has been described as the Millennium drought which led to the growth of water markets and to renewed emphasis on water security measures.
In India, unlike in the United States and Australia, agriculture is not just a food producing enterprise but also the backbone of the livelihood security of nearly 60 per cent of the population. Therefore, there is no time to relax in the area of taking anticipatory steps to safeguard food, water, energy and livelihood security in rural India, in the event of an erratic monsoon. We should initiate proactive steps immediately to ensure food and drinking water security for not only people but also for the over one billion farm animal population. Aberrations in monsoon behaviour are not uncommon, having been with us throughout our agricultural history. What is new is the difficulty in forecasting caused by factors coming under the generic title, “Climate change.”
The recent report of the Inter-Governmental Panel on Climate Change has warned of higher mean temperatures and a rise in sea level if we do not take action on cutting down greenhouse gas emissions. The low carbon pathway of development still remains a topic for academic discussion rather than for political and practical action. International prices of food and other agricultural commodities tend to remain volatile. The right to food enshrined in the National Food Security Act can be implemented only with the help of our farmers, unlike the right to information which can be implemented with the help of files. Right now, the government has enough stock to fulfil the legal obligation of providing 5 kg of wheat, rice or millets per month to nearly 75 per cent of our population. With one widespread drought, the current food stocks may disappear. Even this year, market arrivals of paddy have been as low as 42 per cent in West Bengal, 34 per cent in Bihar and 23 per cent in Odisha. Hence, there is no time to relax in the areas of food production and safe storage
Fortunately, we still have a large untapped production reservoir in most foodgrains even with technologies available on the shelf. What is important is the mobilisation of group endeavour among farm families with small holdings in areas such as plant protection, water harvesting and post-harvest technologies. The new government must accord priority to both water security and water use efficiency. Water harvesting in homes, farms and factories must become mandatory. Tamil Nadu has already initiated steps in this direction. The rain-cum-solar energy centre functioning in Chennai is a source of credible public information on rainwater harvesting and solar energy use. Such centres need to be replicated in all our cities, towns and block headquarters.
The latest technologies for using the available water in the most efficient manner possible should be adopted. On fertilizer use efficiency, there are technologies such as those developed by the International Fertilizer Development Center (IFDC) in the U.S. which can help improve the efficiency of urea use by about 50 per cent. Methods of managing the triple alliance of pests, pathogens and weeds must be popularised.
Besides causing food and water shortage, deficient rainfall adds to the problem of energy shortage. In every calamity lies an opportunity for progress. Harvesting of the sun in homes, offices, fields and factories should also become mandatory; it can help increase energy supply in rural and urban areas. At the post-harvest stage, a national grain storage policy with these three components must be adopted — we should promote the use of small storage bins, like the Pusa Bin, at the farm level. Second, we should implement the rural godown scheme for safe storage of foodgrains and perishable commodities at the village level. Such a rural godown scheme was introduced as early as 1979, but the programme has yet to take off in a manner that can make a difference to preventing the loss of food items at the village/block levels. Third, we should establish a national grid of ultramodern foodgrain silos in at least 50 locations in the country, each capable of storing about a million tonnes. Unfortunately, there is still a mismatch between production and post-harvest technologies, with producers and consumers unable to get the full benefit of higher production.
For the food and water security of farm animals, we need to earmark potential areas for establishing cattle camps where the animals can be looked after during a drought emergency. These camps should have access to water. A suggestion I had made over three decades ago that we should identify and establish groundwater sanctuaries at appropriate places is yet to be implemented. These are concealed aquifers which should be tapped only when absolutely essential. Like a wildlife sanctuary, they should be protected from exploitation. The establishment of such sanctuaries — at least one each in the 130 agroclimatic zones generally identified in our country — will help us to save precious cattle and other farm animals, both from distress sale and starvation deaths.
As the speaker in the “Sardar Patel Memorial lecture” series on All India Radio, which I delivered in 1973, I had suggested that we should develop drought, flood and good weather codes to minimise the adverse impact of unfavourable monsoons and to maximise production in a good monsoon year. The drought code consists of a series of dos and don’ts during deficient rainfall. As in the case of drought and flood codes, seed banks consisting of seeds of alternative crops should be maintained. Seed reserves are as important for crop security as grain reserves are important for food security. For example, during the recent and severe drought in California, it was found that some of the earlier crops like millets had survived with a reasonable yield, while wheat or rice could not withstand the severe drought.
Fortunately in our National Food Security Act, there is provision to procure and supply under the Public Distribution System, local grains like ragi, bajra, jowar and a whole series of minor millets. Since such crops require milling, they have been referred to as coarse cereals. They should be referred to as climate smart nutri cereals. They are now being provided at Rs.1 per kg — an extremely attractive price from the point of view of resource poor consumers. Such underutilised crops are now known to be rich in macro and micronutrients and could help in the fight against protein hunger caused by the deficiency of protein in diets and hidden hunger caused by the deficiency of micronutrients such as iron, iodine, zinc, Vitamin A and Vitamin B. If the Food Security Act is backed by a nutrition literacy movement, the demand for climate smart nutri-cereals will grow. This will help in promoting the cultivation of crops which may do better under drought conditions.
In each of the major agroclimatic zones, at least two members (a woman and a man) of every panchayat or local body should be trained to be climate risk managers. They can help the rest of the community in implementing the provisions of the proposed drought, flood and good weather codes. The government has recently introduced a national policy on agroforestry. Agroforestry combines the benefits of carbon sequestration and local food security. The inclusion of fertilizer trees in agroforestry systems can help build soil carbon banks.
This year is the International Year of Family Farming. Family farming is both a way of life and a means to livelihood. India has probably the largest number of family farmers. Our aim should be to make every family farm a climate smart farm, equipped with the knowledge and technologies essential to manage the expected El Niño triggered adverse rainfall conditions.

Waterfalls come alive in Courtallam
","The residents of the district perhaps enjoyed one of the finest weather conditions of this year on Tuesday as the intermittent drizzle triggered by the low pressure in the Bay of Bengal continued for the second day on Tuesday.
Though the Meteorological department predicted heavy rainfall in the southern districts, the coastal district of Tirunelveli experienced only intermittent drizzle on Tuesday that may not help in any way to improve the groundwater table.
However, the weather was so pleasant throughout the day with the overcast sky.
Once again, areas close to the Western Ghats received some rainfall while other parts of the district had to be content with the drizzle.
The Main Falls and the Five Falls at Courtallam experienced flood after 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday following rains in the Western Ghats.
While the Five Falls had heavy inflow of water around 2.30 p.m., the Main Falls experienced flood 15 minutes later.
Police prevented tourists from taking bath in the waterfalls as water was flowing dangerously.
The situation continued to be the same in both the waterfalls even after 6 p.m.
However, tourists had scintillating bath at Old Falls and children at the Tiger Falls, thanks to the copious inflow.
Rainfall in the district (in mm): Servalar dam – 40, Gundar dam – 31, Tenkasi – 27, Shencottai – 21, Karuppanadhi dam – 17, Ramanadhi dam – 12, Palayamkottai – 11.20, Adavinainar dam and Tirunelveli – 10, Gadana dam – 5, Ambasamudram – 3, Alangulam – 2.60, Veerakeralamputhur, Cheranmahadevi and Nambiyar dam – 2, Sivagiri – 1.
Tuticorin district experienced widespread rain on Tuesday.
The rain that started around 7.15 a.m. caused inundation in lowlying areas, affecting traffic in several places. A tree at Chidambara Nagar here was partially uprooted following rain accompanied by strong wind.
Many country boats did not venture into sea since weather was unpredictable.

Coimbatore Corporation orders study of all water schemes
","Coimbatore Corporation has ordered the Tamil Nadu Water Investment Corporation to study the water supply schemes so as to make the best of what is available.
According to sources, the civic body issued the order to the Corporation about 15 days ago asking it to study the Siruvani, Pilloor I and II, Bhavani and Aliyar schemes.
The Corporation will study if the civic body is making best use of the schemes available, if there are lacunae in using the water from the schemes, what needs to be done to improve the water supply situation and if that requires additional infrastructure.
The sources say the study will also tell the Corporation if it needs to go in for an additional drinking water supply scheme – Pilloor III, as is being suggested at some quarters.
The Corporation supplies Siruvani water for 28 wards, Bhavani for wards in Kavundampalayam, Vadavalli and Veerakeralam and Aliyar for wards in the South Zone. For the remaining areas, it pumps Pilloor water from the Pilloor I and Pilloor II schemes.
The sources say that the Tamil Nadu Water Supply and Drainage Board implemented four of the five aforementioned schemes at various points in time.
The Corporation then implemented the Pilloor II schemes a few years ago under the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission scheme.
Now when a comprehensive study is being ordered, there will emerge a clear picture of how best to use the schemes as they all serve the purpose for meeting the residents’ needs.
When such a study is being done, the Corporation will know how to link the schemes, if localities in the city are getting water from the nearest reservoir, if not, does the city need new reservoirs or should the pipelines of various schemes need to be interlinked at vantage points, and much more.
The sources say that the civic body will decide on the next course of action based on the Corporation report and add that this will not overlap with the report already prepared for the implementation of the 24x7 water supply scheme.

Probe ordered into death of Srinagar youth
","Kashmir Divisional Commissioner Shailendar Kumar on Friday ordered a magisterial inquiry into the >death of a youth in firing by the Central Reserve Police Force on April 30.
Srinagar District Magistrate Farooq Shah was appointed the Inquiry Officer and asked to submit his report and recommendations in 15 days.
Twenty-four-year-old Bashir Ahmad Bhat of Gratabal, Nawakadal, died when the CRPF fired at unruly demonstrators near Nawakadal Crossing on Nallah Maar Road.
Officials maintained that the crowd had attacked a polling party carrying EVMs to the fortified SKICC counting centre, which was being escorted by the CRPF and snatched a CRPF constable’s gun.
“The miscreants snatched the weapon of a security force personnel. In the ensuing scuffle two persons identified as Bashir Ahmed Bhat, son of Ghulam Hassan Bhat and Nazir Ahmed Kaloo of Nawakadal were injured.
Bashir Ahmed later succumbed to injuries,” a Police bulletin said on April 30.
Three residents of Gratabal and Braripora neighbourhood in Nawakadal dismissed the official version as a “blatant lie.”
“We will thoroughly investigate how the civilian died in the firing. We will see if the Standard Operating Procedure had been violated,” Mr. Shah told The Hindu.
Meanwhile, half-a-dozen government vehicles were damaged and several officials sustained injuries in different incidents of stone-pelting in Kashmir since Thursday night. Official sources said that Superintendent of Police Srinagar Airport Manzoor Ahmad Dalal was injured and his vehicle was damaged in the incident.
Informed sources said that the demonstrators clashed with the police and the CRPF at over a dozen places. Curfew remained in force in downtown Srinagar on the second consecutive day on Friday.

A knee-jerk reaction?
","Each time there is a terror strike in the country, security agencies start taking steps to secure all possible establishments, especially railway stations and airports. However, all these are mere knee-jerk reactions at best. The hangover lasts barely a few days and soon it is back to “business as usual”.
As usual, the Delhi Police swung into action to make the railway stations secure after news of the blasts at a Chennai railway station on Thursday morning. In an attempt to make arrangements as fool-proof as possible, they even started video-recording in trains bound for long distances. With the idea to record suspicious elements and activities in trains, a constable was seen carrying a handycam to record the happenings inside the coaches. Another tagged along carrying a loud-speaker, announcing safety instructions to passengers.
The video-recording, according to the police, will serve a dual purpose. It will help detect suspicious activities on the spot as well as store the footage for future reference.
Another way to spot suspicious activity at Delhi railway stations involves police personnel dressed in civil clothes scanning the crowds with a pair of binoculars. The personnel scans the railway station with the binocular and informs the back-up team in case he spots suspicious activity.
In the past too the Capital has seen many such temporary security beef-ups at places where terror struck, but these measures were not lasting ones. For instance, after the 2011 Delhi High Court blast, the police claimed that the security had been upgraded at all court complexes. However, they arrested a gang planning to a murder an undertrial inside the Rohini court premises on Wednesday! One of the arrested men was caught while trying to enter the court in a lawyer’s attire. Interestingly, the arrest was made only because the police had prior knowledge about the murder attempt. Otherwise, lawyers are not frisked at entry points.
As for the latest security beef-up, how far and how long these measures work, only time will tell!

Railway security is a nightmare
","Four hours after two explosive devices went off on the Bangalore-Guwahati Express in Chennai on Thursday, the national capital’s iconic Old Delhi station was on red alert, or so television channels reported.
Passengers shoved their way, with their luggage, through a door-frame metal-detector, which beeped in protest uselessly. The police were putting up a brave show of searching some passengers’ bags, but it was a Sisyphean task: for every one held up, hundreds more passed by.
The bombing of the train has once again underlined that India’s economic lifeline — its railway system — is a security nightmare. The bad news is: there isn’t much that can be done.
India’s Railway Protection Force, mandated to protect trains along with the State government-controlled Government Reserve Police, has thrown its hands up. “Look,” one officer told The Hindu, “there are more than 13 million passengers transiting railway stations every day. How on earth do you search all their luggage, and frisk all of them?”
Government data show that cases of on-train robbery have grown from 382 in 2003 to 1,096 in 2013, while murders have gone up from 246 to 270 — suggesting all kinds of criminals, not just terrorists, have a free run of trains.

International problem

It isn’t only India which faces problems protecting its trains. In December, a suicide-bomber killed 16 people at the railway station in >Russia’s Sochi, the latest in a long string of attacks. In 2004, >an attack on trains in Madrid killed 191 and injured over 1,800 — numbers rivalling the >2006 bombings in Mumbai. London saw >suicide bombings in 2005, killing 52 commuters and injuring over 400.
Last year, the police in Canada charged Tunisian national Chiheb Esseghaier, an industrial biotechnologist, and Palestinian Raed Jaser, with conspiring to derail a high-speed train between Toronto’s Union Station and New York City, 550 kilometres to its south-east. Large parts of the track are unmonitored by closed circuit television, making such an attack easy to execute.
In 2009, the United States’ Government Accountability Office published a review of railway security measures. The study noted that the “the number of riders passing through a subway system — especially during peak hours — make the sustained use of some security measures, such as airport style passenger screening checkpoints, difficult”.
Though many operators in the United States have made investments in passenger and baggage screening operations, the costs are daunting. New research may change that — for example, systems capable of detecting weapons and explosives as passengers pass through turnstiles — but only in the distant future.

Tough challenge

Experts agree the answer is stopping terrorists before they reach the stage of executing an attack. In the Canadian case, the attack was pre-empted because intelligence services in that country and the United States were able to infiltrate the plot early on. “Effective offensive police and intelligence work targeting terrorists is best defence,” says Ajai Sahni, the Director of the Institute of Conflict Management in New Delhi.
It is also important to keep some perspective on the risks posed by terrorism to the Indian rail passengers. In 2013, a year when the rail system saw no terrorism-related fatalities, 103 passengers were reported killed in five major accidents.
In 2010, the year of the bombing of the >Gyaneshwari Express by Maoists, 117 died because of accidents. In most years, >accidents claim far more lives than terrorism — and railway passengers are far safer than road commuters.

Another man caught on cam in Bangalore
","Investigators probing the twin blasts on the Bangalore-Guwahati Express here on Thursday appear to have inched ahead in zeroing in on the culprits, with another CCTV footage showing a man hiding his face while going to board the train in Bangalore the previous night.  
“The man is seen carrying a piece of baggage, and he consciously covers his face to avoid being caught by the CCTV camera installed there,” a police official said here on Saturday.
The Tamil Nadu CB-CID Police have developed two portraits of persons who were found moving in a suspicious manner in the Chennai Central and Bangalore stations.
While one man was seen running out of the coach after the train arrived in Chennai on May 1, the other man caught on camera in Bangalore was seen hiding his face to escape the lens.

Unmanned coachesIn a stunning revelation, it is now known that the twin blasts occurred in coaches unmanned by any Travelling Ticket Examiner (TTE) between Jolarpet and Chennai Central. Investigators are hence trying hard to identify the unauthorised persons who had boarded the train, sources in the Crime Branch-CID said.
Police probes revealed that six TTEs boarded the train in Bangalore on the night of April 30, and three of them got down at Jolarpet.
The sleeper-class coaches S-3, S-4 and S-5 were left with no TTE till the train reached Chennai Central the next morning. “We have information that many unauthorised persons boarded the train without a confirmed or reserved ticket. They slept along the aisle or near the toilet of these coaches. Since their names or addresses were not available with the Railways, we are finding it difficult to identify them,” a CB-CID official told

CBI files charge sheet in trafficking case
","The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has filed a charge sheet in a case in which a woman was trafficked to the UAE through the Nedumbassery airport under a forged passport.
Seven persons, including two police officers, have been accused in the charge sheet, filed before the Ernakulam Chief Judicial Magistrate Court.
The case relates to the incident in which a 19-year-old from Kazhakuttam in Thiruvananthapuram was taken to Muscat through the Nedumbassery airport for sex work under a passport that belonged to another woman from Kattappana. The case, which was initially investigated by the Crime Branch, was handed over to the CBI along with three other cases of trafficking through the Nedumbassery airport.
The seven accused in the case are Santha, 46, of Punaloor, Kollam; Lissy Sojan, 43, of Karumathara, Thrissur; P.R. Shaji, 42, of Vallivattom, Thrissur; Raju Mathew, 44, of Lakkatoor, Kottayam; Sethulal of Kodungalloor, Thrissur; Prasanth Kumar, of Eriyadukara, Thrissur; and Varghese Raphael of Maradu. Varghese is currently absconding and believed to be in the Gulf. All the other accused were arrested and subsequently released on bail.
Two other accused, including the woman who was trafficked abroad, have not been charge-sheeted in the case.
The CBI report said Santha worked as an agent for Lissy Sojan, who operated brothels in the Gulf countries. She recruited the 19-year-old woman on behalf of Lissy after promising her a cleaning job in Dubai. Santha allegedly made a commission of Rs.15,000 for recruiting the Kazhakuttam native. Lissy wrongfully took possession of the passport of a woman from Kattappana and arranged for the victim’s photograph to be pasted onto the passport. Sethulal has also been accused of arranging the passport forgery.
Varghese Raphael, who worked for Lissy in the Gulf, sent the forged passport to civil police officer (CPO) Prasanth Kumar through courier.
He handed over the documents to Shaji, who took them to Santha.

Tamil Nadu comes under security blanket
","Soon after the bomb explosion in the Bangalore-Guwahati Express at the Central station here on Thursday, Tamil Nadu came under a security blanket, with additional police deployment, more checks at public places and special protection provided at places of worship and vital infrastructural installations.
In the temple city of Madurai, security was intensified in the Meenakshi Sundareswarar Temple.
The surveillance cameras at several points in that city “are being monitored round the clock,” though there was no specific threat to the shrine, said Madurai City Commissioner of Police, Sanjay Mathur.
Security was also enhanced at the other historic temples in the south including those at Tiruchendur, Palani and Rameswaram.
An extra eye is kept on key infrastructure in the southern districts, in particular the Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant (KNPP), the Indian Space Research Organisation’s Liquid Propulsion Systems Centre at Mahendragiri and VOC Port in Tuticorin. The KNPP site director, R. S. Sundar told The Hindu that adequate security was put in place in and around the Kudankulam plant in Tirunelveli district.
Tighter vigil was mounted at the historically famous Padmanabhapuram palace known as the ‘wooden palace’ in Kanyakumari district, after the Central intelligence agencies had alerted about a possible threat to the 18 century structure.
Many security personnel were on duty at counting centres where the EVMs’ have been kept and also in Kodaikanal hill station to guide tourists, police said.
In Nagapattinam district, security has been beefed up at all vital installations and places of worship with the police administration deploying close to 400 personnel for surveillance.
Special surveillance is on at Vaitheeswaran temple, the Thirukadayur Abhirami temple, the famous temple for Lord Saturn at Thirunallar, the Vedaranyeshwarar temple, the Velankanni Basilica and at Nagore Dargah.
In Karaikal, all police stations have been put on high alert, said Monica Bhardwaj, Superintendent of Police, Karaikal.
In Coimbatore, railway stations and other vital installations including the Coimbatore airport in the western region were brought under tight security following the Chennai blasts.
An intensive surveillance of vehicle movement was also on in Coimbatore city, said its Police Commissioner A.K. Viswanathan.
In Tiruchi, Thanjavur and Ariyalur districts, rail and bus stations came under an intense surveillance on Thursday with security personnel not ready to take no chances at all.
In a joint operation, the Tamil Nadu and Rajasthan police on Thursday arrested Ashraf Ali (40) of Cuddalore in connection with a bomb blast in Jodhpur recently. According to police sources, Ali was arrested from his hideout in Parangipet in the district. He would be produced in a local court for obtaining transit remand.

Objective behind Assam killings is to trigger communal conflagration: Shinde
","Pointing out that 31 of those killed in the Assam violence were from the minority community, Union Home Minister Sushilkumar Shinde on Sunday said the objective of the group behind the killings seemed to be aimed at triggering a full-fledged communal conflagration.
“During the last few days, there have been wanton acts of depredation leading to the deaths of 32 persons, mainly women and children. Of these, 31 belonged to the minority community. These innocent lives were lost at the hands of cadres of a certain group,” said Mr. Shinde, appealing all to maintain calm and peace.
Stating that the Armed Forces would definitely control the situation, Mr. Shinde also called upon public leaders of both the Bodo and minority communities to ensure that the situation did not deteriorate further.
These acts started only after the group began steadily losing its cadres either through surrender or eliminations during the operations when they opened fire at the Armed Forces, he said. “The Central government cannot remain unaffected by these killings and is determined to ensure the safety and security of innocent human lives. The determination is all the more important since these incidents are targeted at the minorities. I strongly condemn the acts of this group which is targeting women and children of the minority community,” said Mr. Shinde.
The MHA has already deployed 43 companies of Central Armed Forces and 10 more companies are being sent. “The Defence Ministry has also deployed 15 columns of Army comprising approximately 1,500 soldiers. These numbers are not fixed and can be increased as per requirement,” he added.
Condemning the act of violence, the Amnesty International India on Sunday said: “The first incident of shooting took place in a village in Baksa late on Thursday evening (May 1), and two other shootings occurred in Kokrajhar and Baksa the following day, with bodies continuing to be found on Saturday morning. All the victims were from Muslim families.”
The organisation said the Assam government and the police had alleged that the killings were perpetrated by an armed group, the Songbijit faction of the National Democratic Front of Bodoland (NDFB), which has denied responsibility. In July 2012, clashes broke out between the Bodo and Muslim communities, resulting in the killing of over 75 people and displacement of thousands, it said, urging the Assam government to protect the rights of all communities and bring the guilty to justice.
While Assam Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi has decided to hand over the probe into the killings to the National Investigation Agency, the agency is yet to receive a formal communication in this regard.

Dispute over Rs.3 costs litigant Rs. 20,000
","The Madras High Court Bench here has imposed a cost of Rs.20,000 on a litigant who initiated criminal proceedings against a government bus conductor and three managerial-level officers of Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation for having issued Rs.10 ticket instead of a Rs.7 ticket for travelling from Manapparai to Vaiyampatti in Theni district on July 1, 2013.
Dismissing a criminal revision petition, Justice P.N. Prakash ordered that the litigant should pay Rs. 5,000 to each of the four individuals, against whom he had initiated the proceedings, within two weeks. “The entire prosecution case is a clear abuse of process of law and an attempt to browbeat and intimidate the respondents who are public servants,” the judge observed.
The petitioner had initially moved a private complaint before a judicial magistrate court accusing the TNSTC bus conductor Saravanan, Cumbum Branch Manager Pandiyarajan, Deputy Manager (Commercial) Ganesan and Assistant Manager (Maintenance) Archunan of having committed offences under Section 166 (public servants disobeying law) of the Indian Penal Code.
The Magistrate recorded the sworn statement of the complainant and dismissed the private complaint on the ground that the latter had not made out a prima facie case against the accused for issuing process to them. Not leaving it at that, the petitioner had moved the High Court through the present revision petition and questioned the Magistrate’s decision.
“At the first blush, I thought that the Conductor was illegally demanding excess fare from passengers. On a close scrutiny of the case, it appears that the Conductor had given Rs.10 denomination ticket to the revision petitioner for the alleged travel from Manapparai to Vaiyampatti. I am at loss to understand as to how this action of the Conductor would amount to an offence under Section 166 IPC. After all, he is acting under the directions of the government by giving 10 rupees ticket,” the judge added.

Techie attacked for opposing encroachment
","While the traffic police are encouraging the public to take pictures of traffic offenders and post them on their website as part of their ‘Public Eye’ initiative, a 32-year-old woman software engineer, who tried to do just that, was allegedly assaulted publicly.
But MICO Layout police are yet to take action against the alleged attacker, while the traffic police have promised to act on her complaint against encroachment of a footpath by a car showroom.
The complainant, Shanthala Patil, works in an IT company on Bannerghatta Road. She said she was returning home from work and walking towards Sagar Apollo hospital junction on April 30 when she noticed that the footpath has been encroached upon by the car showroom, forcing pedestrians to walk on the busy road.
When she questioned the showroom staff, they promised to remove the cars. Ms. Patil waited for some time to see if they would remove the cars, but they did not.
Ms. Patil, who was aware of the ‘Public Eye’ initiative, began taking photographs of the encroachment.
Seeing this, one of the showroom’s employees confronted her. The argument between the two took an ugly turn with the employee allegedly trying to snatch the complainant’s mobile phone. He slapped and kicked her when she resisted, the complainant has alleged.
Ms. Patil called her husband and later the police. Some policemen arrived and tried to persuade the two parties to settle the issue amicably, instead of filing a complaint.
Ms. Patil insisted on registering a case of assault against the showroom’s staff and demanded an investigation. Eventually, a complaint was registered with the MICO Layout police.
Personnel at the police station described the incident as a trivial one and said that action would be taken after Sunday as they had to make security arrangements for the IPL cricket match at the Chinnaswamy stadium.
Additional Commissioner of Police B. Dayanand said that he was aware of the incident and would instruct the jurisdictional traffic police to clear the footpath of encroachment at the earliest.

Bringing them to justice
","What happens to the election-related cases registered by the police in the city, now that the crucial part of campaign and polling is over?
The question assumes significance in the backdrop of police claims of cracking down on attempts to lure voters with money, liquor or gifts. The seizure of Rs.90 lakh from a person travelling on an APSRTC bus at Bollarum led to the arrest of the TDP nominee from Peddapally Assembly constituency.
K. Kamala, wife of former Minister K. Parthasarathy, who is the YSRC nominee from Machilipatnam Lok Sabha seat, was arrested a few days after Rs.45.10 lakh was seized from her while she was travelling on a bus at Vanasthalipuram. Criminal cases were registered in both instances, but the investigation is yet to be completed and charge-sheets filed.
In another instance, the Cyberabad police seized Rs.8.32 crore at Palamakula near Shamshabad from two persons believed to be agents of ‘hawala’ operators.
The police top brass maintained the possibility of politicians securing this to influence the ongoing elections cannot be ruled out.
Though crores of rupees were seized during police inspections at different places in the city, these cases attracted the attention of the public as prima facie evidence was found against politicians in the first two cases. Police suspect the role of politicians in the third case too.
Investigators invoked provisions of the Representation of People’s Act and the Indian Penal Code related to the bribing of voters, but connecting the accused with the alleged crime is the crucial task.
On the day of polling too, police slapped charges against some contestants on cases that include slapping the activist of a rival party, obstructing a police officer on duty from discharging their duty, and threatening polling agents.
How many of these cases will be taken to their logical end is to be seen.

Taking diversion could prove dangerous

Regular weekend checks by traffic police have come to deter people from drink-driving. Fines and jail terms for those who test positive during a breathalyser test, are making people stay away from the wheel after a drink. This has also controlled rash driving on the city’s roads and resulted in less number of accidents.
However, many drivers are now familiar with the timings and points where the traffic police look out for drink-drivers. Some have also been giving police the slip by finding newer routes.
“The main roads are not the only routes where accidents take place. Deaths from road accidents on internal roads of residential colonies and other areas are also high,” say voices from the public.
Surprise checks with breathalysers would surely rein in those drink-drivers running riot on the city’s internal roads or distant localities, they say. Proposals to intensify checks involving local law and order police were also mooted.
For some inexplicable reasons, the idea was shelved. Of the over 1,600 persons getting killed in road accidents in and around city, some are reported on routes where the traffic police had never conducted the weekend special drives.
Change in the timings and routes of the drivers would surely help in further controlling the accidents and saving lives, say many.

Police request Facebook, Twitter to block Amrita-Digvijaya photographs
","The Delhi Police Crime Branch has sent an official request to social networking sites Facebook and Twitter asking them to block the circulation of intimate photographs of journalist Amrita Rai and Congress leader Digvijaya Singh.
The development comes a day after a case was registered against unknown persons for hacking into Ms. Rai’s e-mail account.
According to the police, Ms. Rai had requested them to block the circulation of the photographs as it was harming her reputation.
She also told them that she was being threatened through these pictures.
“Ms. Rai had filed a complaint on Thursday evening. We have registered a case under Section 66 of the IT Act and 509 of the Indian Penal Code against unidentified persons. We sent an official request to social networking sites on Friday to provide us with information about the origins and Internet Protocol addresses from where the photographs were being circulated. We have also asked them to block further circulation of the photographs,” said a police officer.
Talking about developments in the case, the officer said it was too early to determine the identities of persons involved or the motive behind circulating the photographs.
“The headquarters of these social media sites are based abroad and it takes time for them to respond or provide information. Our Cyber Cell has already begun investigations and we hope to find the source IP address soon,” said an officer.
Ms. Rai had also tweeted that someone had hacked into her e-mail account.
“My email/computer been hacked & contents tampered with. It is a serious crime in India and encroachment of my privacy. I strongly condemn it [sic].”
The officer revealed that Ms. Rai had in her complaint alleged that the hackers had created a fake Twitter handle in her name and that she was being harassed through abusive tweets. She also gave the police a list of Twitter handles from which she was receiving abusive comments and tweets.
Officers probing the case have not ruled out physical tampering of her laptop either.
“There is a chance that her laptop was tampered with physically, but as of now we think it was hacked through a wireless Internet facility,” the officer added.

Chennai blasts probe: CCTV image provides first clue
","In a find that could help crack the mystery behind the May Day twin blasts in a train at the Chennai Central railway station, the State police on Friday released the CCTV footage of a man running on the platform soon after the train’s arrival.
The Crime-Branch CID, investigating the blasts on board the Bangalore-Guwahati Express that killed a woman passenger and injured 14, disclosed here that the explosives planted in the train were similar to those used to trigger multiple blasts in Patna hours before the BJP’s prime ministerial candidate, Narendra Modi, was to address an ‘Hunkar rally’ on October 28, 2013.
The police’s announcement came after experts from the National Security Guards (NSG) inspected the scene and the materials seized from the damaged coaches.
Inspector-General of Police Mahesh Kumar Agarwal said remnants of clock pieces, batteries, metal pellets and a metallic pipe suggested that a timer device was used as the trigger. Releasing the footage, he said the “person’s movements were unusual and required verification.”
Crime Branch officials also confirmed that the train was running 90 minutes late and had it been on time, the bombs would have gone off after the train entered Andhra Pradesh. Mr. Modi addressed election rallies at five places in the neighbouring State on May 1, including Nellore, close to the Tamil Nadu border.
Any information on the man in the footage could be passed on to the CB-CID on (044) 2250 2500/10 or (0)77086 54202, he said. The man apparently got off the S-3 coach and ran away after the train arrived; we have not seen him getting into the train again,” Mr. Agarwal said.
He said the investigation so far had not indicated any link between the blasts and Zakir Hussain, a Sri Lankan national arrested by the State police three days ago.
Senior officials of the CB-CID rushed to Bangalore following a tip-off.

M.S. Pattabhiraman passes away
","M.S. Pattabhiraman (90), former vice-president of the Music Academy, passed away on Thursday afternoon.
Apart from his involvement with Carnatic music promotion in the Music Academy, he was an active Rotarian and supporter of social and religious causes and Chairman of the Kedarampatti Swamy Trust in Kancheepuram.
He is survived by daughter Tara Murali and two sons, Ramesh Pattabhiraman and P. Vasanthkumar. The last rites and cremation were performed on Thursday evening at Mylapore.
Narada Gana Sabha secretary R. Krishnaswami recalled Mr. Pattabhiraman’s association with the Sabha in the 1960s. “He was a supporter of good causes and during his two terms as a committee member of the Narada Gana Sabha in our infant stages, he was very supportive,” he said.
Veena maestro and Vice-Chancellor of Tamil Nadu Music and Fine Arts University E. Gayathri said that Mr. Pattabhiraman was a very fine gentleman and both Ms. Sulochna, his wife, and he were connoisseurs of music and art. “Though he held a very senior position in the Academy, he would not show it. I always regarded him in a special light,” she said.
Renowned Bharathanatyam artist and guru Sudharani Raghupathy recalled that Mr. Pattabhiraman was a great soul and loveable person.
“Inspite of his age, he would take the trouble to appreciate artists, including the very young ones. Usually people are very stingy with kind words, but he was a man who had a kind word for everyone,” she said.

FIR against Beni for objectionable remarks on Modi
","An FIR was registered against Union Minister Beni Prasad Verma on Saturday for violating the Model Code of Conduct by making “objectionable” remarks about Narendra Modi.
“The FIR was registered against Verma at Chhapia police station this morning for violating Model Code of Conduct by making objectionable remarks against Modi,” District Magistrate Vikas Gothalwal said.
“A person, who discriminates between Hindu and Muslim in this country and creates hatred between them, is not a human being, but a monster,” the Congress leader had said addressing an election rally in Maskanwa town on Friday night.
“Modi must tell whether he is a human being or not. On the massacre of the people in Gujarat you (Modi) say that it’s a reaction. You tease Muslims by stating that even if a puppy comes under you vehicle you feel sad,” he said.
The EC had, two days ago, censured Beni for his “insulting” remarks against Modi and warned that further violation could result in a ban on his campaign activity.
Beni said a person like Modi is an “enemy” of the country and democracy. “If such a person comes to power then self respect of 85 per cent downtrodden people of the country will end and dominance of handful persons will prevail in the society,” he alleged.
On April 8, another FIR was registered against Beni in Balrampur for calling BJP prime ministerial candidate the “biggest goonda” of RSS and that the party’s national president Rajnath Singh his “slave.”

Making her presence felt
","Amidst the glitzy green carpet bombing, Indian International Film Academy took time to breath and introspect about some real issues in Tampa. And what better way to reflect than raising the concern for education of the girl child. IIFA screened the Indian episode of Girl Rising, the evocative documentary by Richard E Robbins. Written by Sooni Taraporevala and narrated by Priyanka Chopra, it tells the story of Rukhsana, the daughter of a daily wage labourer in Kolkata, who draws strength from her father’s will to educate her against all odds. He sacrifices his basic needs so that his daughter could dream and Robbins blends those colourful dreams with the stench of cruel reality around Rukhsana with amazing dexterity. In the discussion that followed, Priyanka and Shabana Azmi reflected on how they drew from their parents to become people who care about the world they live in. “As a child I used to travel with my doctor parents in the villages around Bareilly to distribute free medicine to people who could not afford it. I was very particular about the number of tablets to be given,” Priyanka reminisced.
Priyanka said the girl child should not be considered as a burden and Shabana pointed out human development index is more important than GDP of a country and empowerment of women is a crucial factor in it. “During the course of my visits as UNICEF ambassador I come across girls who complain that that they are discriminated against their brothers in terms of education and even quality of food,” said Priyanka. The actress, who spent some years in Boston as a student, was quick to point out that Indian families in the US are no different when it comes to the girl child. “It was often said that girls have to be saved from the Western influence and hence they should go to the nearby school while boys were free to studies in universities outside the home state. Also the more you forbid the kid to do something, the more he or she would like to indulge in it and the chances to flounder increase. I am not recommending late night parties but when you are living in a society you cannot block the cultural influence. I found this fear strange and stifling.”
Shabana Azmi who runs Mijwan Welfare Society said that gender discrimination was deep rooted and insidious. “You just have to take a look at the books prescribed in the school curriculum. Most of them have two questions: Where is your mother? And the answer would be: She is in the kitchen. Then, where is your father? And the answer would be: He is in the office. I raised this issue in the Parliament that why it can’t be the other way or at least the answers could both are in kitchen and both are in office.”
For Priyanka the catalyst of change came one Janmashtami night. “I know it sounds filmy but it is true. We found a baby girl abandoned beneath my mother’s car. She brought her home and nursed her. For me she became my younger sister. I would take out the clothes of my younger brother and dress her up. And I cried when she was sent to an orphanage. It opened the world to me and I realised all girls are not as privileged as I am.” She pointed out that it was her upbringing that kept her reminding that she had to give back to the society when she was in position of strength.
For Shabana the moment to reflect came when she did Mahesh Bhatt’s Arth. “I grew up in a communist household. We had a hand to mouth existence but gender equality was a given. My mother used to work when my poet father was not earning much. It was when I did Arth and played a character who says no to her philandering husband even after he says sorry that I realised how big a step it is. First the distributors said the ending won’t work because it is too much for an Indian man to say sorry and still not accepted by the woman. Anyway, the film got released and did good business but soon I started getting letters from women who were facing trouble in their married life. The last thing I wanted was to become an agony aunt but I felt that the film has proved to be a sort of catharsis for middle class women who are yet distinguish between a character and a real person.”
She said at Mijwan she has been able to ensure that no girl below the age of 18 gets married. “We often think that we are too small to make change. But it doesn’t take much to ask the maid at home whether her daughter is going to school or not and if she is facing a problem on can come forward to help her out.”

Assam violence: Nine more bodies recovered in Baksa district
","Nine more bodies were recovered from a village in Baksa district on Saturday morning, taking the toll to 32 in the violence unleashed by >NDFB-Songbijit militants in Bodoland Territorial Administration Districts (BTADC) area in Assam.
The bodies of the victims, including four children and two women, were recovered from Khagrabari village under Salbari sub-division adjacent to the Manas National Park, official sources said.
Bodies of two children were identified as Ilina Khatun and Ariful Islam.
Three children, aged between seven and ten years, who were hiding in a forest on the banks of river Beki were also rescued, the sources said.
Besides Chirang and parts of Dhubri districts, >indefinite curfew has also been imposed in Kokrajhar and Baksa districts where 23 people were killed.
The Army has been staging flag marches in the >violence-hit areas to instil confidence among people and to bring the situation under control, the sources said.

A man of wits
","“I’m more interested in what is happening today than something that happened in the past,” he says. Pitted against stalwarts such as Tha. Ku. Subramanian, Gandhimathi, Rajaram, Ramachandran and Sol Vilangum Perumal, Raja had to and did exhibit his oratorical prowess.
From a quiet child in Keezhamathur village near Thuvariman, Raja reached the American College for under-graduation and ended up with a job in United Bank of India. But he went through a rough phase during his growing up years and that, he says, taught him quite a few important lessons in life, most important being how to fight challenges confidently.
Even in the wildest of his dreams, Raja had never thought that he would become a speaker one day. But he rose to celebrity status in debate programmes!
Raja travelled extensively with the team of Tamil scholar Solomon Papiah. “For more than 15 years I only listened to ayya’s (read Solomon Papiah) programmes. I still remember the days when I travelled on the lap of star speaker Rajaram to attend a programme in Keezhakuilkudi because there was no space in the car. I followed the team like crazy.”
Perseverance pays and he got a chance to speak at a debate programme as a substitute since the original speaker failed to turn up. “Ayya asked me to speak. I knew it was a make or break situation. I was neither prepared nor equipped to speak. But, I grabbed the opportunity and spoke confidently. The humour in my speech caught the attention of the audience. The first words of appreciation -- ‘Super...’ -- came from the person operating the public address system. He was my first fan,” he recalls.
Today, he is famous as Pattimandram Raja. “It is a result of the impact ayya has created on me over the years,” he says.

Pattimandram, the art of debating, flourished in Madurai with the help of literary associations but now with the continuous projection on television channels, the pattimandram speakers have catapulted to a star status.
Raja gained popularity with his logical arguments and he soon became the peoples’ representative on stage. “I credit this success to the members of ayya’s team. Even as a novice, I was given a free hand to speak,” says Raja, who many times had to take on much more experienced and established speakers. “Had they objected to my counter arguments, I would not have reached this far,” he adds, acknowledging their magnanimity in accepting him as a part of their team. “Their whole-hearted support and encouragement helped me to climb up the ladder,” he says.
Blessed with the gift of the gab, Raja strikes an instant chord with the audience. “I don’t have a literary background. My strength is my knowledge about the common man and his struggles. My daily dose of news from papers provides me with ample information about real life incidents,” he says, not forgetting the influence of ayya’s speech on him.
Raja believes in constantly updating himself because he feels if you are away from news, you become an island.
“I try to link the day’s news to the topic of the programme as public acceptance is more if the incidents are the most recent,” says Raja.
He also believes in speaking extempore. “We never discuss a topic. Everything is done on-the-spot. Many times, we are given the topic only after reaching the venue,” he says.
His witty arguments on television also fetched him an opportunity to act in films. Ever since popular filmmaker Shankar offered him the maiden chance, Raja has done 15 films. Raja also anchors Vaanga Pesalam on a popular satellite channel with co-presenter Bharathi Bhaskar discussing every topic under the sun, from science and technology to art and architecture. “It has attracted all sections. We try to share a lot of information and when we hear that it is useful for the students, we feel great. In fact, I have spent more time preparing for this show than for the pattimandram programmes,” he says.
Fully aware of his strengths and weaknesses, Raja is careful about the choice of his words on stage. “I always think from the audience’s perspective,” he says and adds, “I don’t advice, I only try to keep public in good humour.”

And it stopped, short…
","Bidding adieu to the clock-less clock tower in Russell Market, we head towards Palace Road. The clock tower in the Central College premises is perhaps the second oldest in Bangalore. If the Russell Market clock tower stands uncared for, surrounded by haphazardly built structures around it, the one in Central College is clouded by the Bangalore Metro project. As if to say ‘far from the madding crowd’, this regal clock tower stands quietly on the lush green campus. So quiet, that it doesn’t even tick.
“It must have stopped working more than ten years ago,” friendly souls on the campus offer. “The maintenance of this clock has been taken up by Titan. We have been asking them to set it right, somehow it hasn’t happened…,” the officer in the Engineering Department of the Bangalore University explains.
Central College was started in 1858 as Central High School with just about five students. In those days it was just a small shed with the Rev. J. Garrett as its principal. For a period of eight years, between 1876-1884, the vice-principal was Mushir-ur-Talim, grandfather of the great scientist Homi Jehangir Bhaba. The administrative block of the college -- as the small inscribed stone slab on the face of the building says -- was built in 1882, also the year in which the clock tower was built. The university itself was set up in 1886 on the same premises. The clock tower and other red sandstone buildings on the premises of Central College were constructed around the time when the Attara Kutcheri (now the High Court of Karnataka), Carlton House and the Cubbon Park library were built.
Most books on Bangalore’s monuments and historic buildings speak of this strikingly beautiful structure in glowing terms. One of the most accurate descriptions says this: “The Gothic style architecture is characterised by a steep roof of Mangalore tiles, topped with row of decorative ridge-tiles, iron crested towers, turreted parapets and gables, intricately done plaster motifs conspicuous in the elevation in a contrasting colour, cast iron railings and pilasters and parilions rising from the wing.” A. Jayaram, an expert on Bangalore, says the The Central College main block has many similarities with the St.Andrew’s Church on the Cubbon Road. The latter was earlier referred to as the Scottish Kirk.
It is interesting how the clock tower became a part of the life of people on the campus. In the Central College Centenary Souvenir brought in 1958, there are several references to the clock tower. In a joint article “Reminiscences”, C. Rajagopalachari and his close friend, the Kannada writer Navarathna Rama Rao write: “We knew intimately and loved everything in the College from the lawn and the cricket field -- Oh, what a cricket field it was, with a border of ancient trees which gave shelter to boys young and old while they watched the varying fortunes of the battle their soldiers were fighting on the field -- everything from the lawn and the cricket field to the venerable trees which bounded them, and from the straggling outhouses by the muddy pond, to the austere red College building with the gaunt clock tower keeping watch over it…”
The clock tower which has now entered the realm of ‘timelessness’ was an object of curiousity and questioning always. K. Dwarakanath records this in the souvenir. “When I came from the Maharaja’s College to Central College in Bangalore, this Gothic architecture was one of the first three features that struck my mind. Another was the clock tower which is unique in its own way. I remember how in many a general knowledge test, there was this question on how many clocks that the tower has, and many students gave wrong answers…”
We too did a small quiz as we stood there – beaming happy smiles, most said: “Oh, we don’t know…”

(This is second in the three-part series on Clock Towers in Bangalore)

Strange fish netted at Pamban
","A day after catching deep sea lobsters, considered a ‘prize catch,’ country boat fishermen have caught strange-looking rare fish, believed to be fully grown ‘Rhinochimaera,’ a deep sea fish.
Fishermen, who ventured into the south sea for fishing in a motorised ‘vallam’ (country boat) on Friday morning and returned on Saturday morning, caught the fish while fishing about 40 nautical miles south of Pamban.
I. Litisan, who owned the ‘vallam,’ said the fishermen had gone to the deep sea looking for a better catch when they caught the rare fish. Each fish weighed about six to seven kg. As the fish were not consumed, they were cut into pieces for drying, he said.
Sources in the Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute (CMFRI) said the fish belonged to the Rhinochimaera genus and Chimaera family. The exact species could be confirmed only after a detailed study, they said. These fish could have migrated from the deep sea, they added.
Mr. Litisan said fishermen in his boat also caught about 50 deep sea lobsters, totally weighing about five kg. They were sold at Rs. 1,000 a kg, he said.
“We get such rare fish species, giant lobsters and prawns as the sea is undisturbed when the mechanised boat fishermen are staying away from the sea since April 15 when the 45-day ban period began,” he told The Hindu.
R. Roosevelt, who was engaged in fishing and trading, said country boat fishermen in the Pamban region used to get a range of fish such as Groupers, Basslets, Goat fish, Anchovies, Travallies, whitings, Barracudas, Pomfrets, Seer and Halfbeaks, besides crabs and lobsters.
They said there were about 800 motorised country boats in Pamban area alone and the fishermen ventured into both the north and south sea for fishing. On a given day, 500 boats would venture into the sea and the average day’s catch from all the boats would be around 35 tonnes, Mr. Roosevelt said.
While crabs and lobsters were exported to foreign countries, the other varieties were sold in the domestic market, he said. About 7,000 families in the region depend on fishing for their livelihood, he added.

Six killed in accident on Grand Southern Trunk Road
","Six people travelling in a car, five of whom were of the same family, were killed in a road accident on Grand Southern Trunk Road at Madurantakam on Monday. The victims include an 18-month-old boy
The victims, hailing from Ginjee, were on their way to Chennai to attend a function. Kancheepuram district police sources said Maheswaran (30) was driving a Wagon R belonging to Baskar (35), a physiotherapist. On the bypass across the town, Maheswaran rammed a private bus that was slowing down.
The driver of a lorry that was travelling close to the car hit the brakes. However, as it was raining, the road was slippery and the driver was unable to bring the lorry to a halt. The lorry rammed the car that ended up trapped between the two heavy vehicles.
Maheswaran, Baskar, his wife Bhakiayalakshmi (30), a lecturer in a private engineering college in Tiruvannamalai, their son Harsha Aniruth, (18 months), and their two relatives Krishnan (72) and Karthik Balaji (24) died instantly.

Man, not sartorially challenged
","Twenty-two-year-old Arjun Gupta is disgruntled with the inadequate selection of ties in his wardrobe; he almost chokes at the thought of looking unkempt at a social occasion. To him, dressing suavely is a way of life and is not just a matter of choice anymore. And he is not alone. A rising number of Indian men today are making conscious sartorial choices. Men are embracing the wide variety of ensembles that are available in the retail clothing market. A few years ago, however, not many would follow suit. “Twenty years ago we didn’t have a steady fashion industry; let alone men and their fashion sensibilities. We’ve evolved from an era where men would go to a tailor for a three-piece suit to pairing their high street trousers with designer shirts. They are experimenting with their wardrobe choices,” says designer JJ Valaya who is also a founding member of the Fashion Design Council of India (FDCI). In the last few years, there has been a paradigm shift in the Indian menswear industry. Few aspects of this shift however, haven’t been seemingly obvious.

The Evolution

“There are two parallels to the evolution of the Indian menswear market. The first one is the ready-to-wear menswear market that has taken the same path as the rest of the Indian menswear industry. The second one is the wedding market. Here’s where we see a major shift. We’re witnessing a more traditional wedding market where men are investing in customary Indian clothing for a wedding ,” elaborates Valaya. Menswear in India is not heavily influenced just by the international markets and Bollywood. Today, we are tracing our steps back to heritage Indian clothing. The demand for traditional Jodhpurs, bandhgalas and Nehru jackets has been more than ever. Market experts say that the demand for suits for a wedding has almost died. Agrees designer Raghavendra Rathore, who is noted for his signature Bandhgala designs, “Nehru style jacket worn over kurta; embroidered waistcoats with Jodhpuri pants, strategically embroidered shirts and jackets embellished bundies and Bandgala jackets in vibrant shades is more widely accepted in order to look different yet classic,” says Rathore.
This revolution comes only with increased awareness and accessibility. “The possibilities are infinite when it comes to styling. We also have a lot of options for accessories. The introduction of multinational clothing brands has only been a positive addition because men don’t need to travel to far off countries to shop for international brands anymore,” says Valaya.

The Modern Consumer

The advent of fashion magazines and Internet has contributed to this widespread sartorial awareness. The new media and the emergence of the fine dining culture too has encouraged us to go out more often than usual and been instrumental in bringing about this awareness. The average Indian man’s attention has shifted from making safe style choices to the intricacies. “They are more careful about the detailing now. We’ve grown from a point where the style sense of a man was limited to a classic blue shirt and khaki pants to this coming-of-age modern consumer who is more aware . He is not afraid to throw on a linen shirt with a printed tie,” says Nikhil Mehra of the Shantanu and Nikhil designer duo, who have been instrumental in amalgamating Indian heritage with western sensibilities through their designs.
It is no wonder then that fashion weeks in India too reserve a 20 per cent slot just to showcase menswear.

The Future

Where exactly do we see this market heading?
“The menswear industry is speeding ahead with a higher percentage of retail investment in this market. Although, it is necessary that we focus on making menswear more accessible and available in tier II cities because there is a growing demand,” believes Mehra. While accessibility of major brands remains questionable in a lot of Indian cities, the demand for them remains high. The market remains untapped in the smaller metropolises in India. Prolific brand strategies and an increase in the number of store franchises are areas that the marketers need to focus on. “70 per cent of the retail market today is menswear and we need a firm stage to display that. In addition, we also need more places dedicated to just menswear just like Aditya Birla Group’s multi-brand venture The Collective,” says Valaya. While the growth of the Indian menswear industry has been great, the industry needs investments to further augment this growth.

Enchanted woods
","
‘I sit silent and alone from morning till eve in the deeper silence of the enchanted old forests… the hours go on neither short nor long, glorious for imagination.’

Naturalist John Muir (1838-1914) on the Petrified Forest, Arizona.
After a trip to a tiger sanctuary, it is usual to hear an excited ‘Did you see a tiger?’ As if tigers had nothing else to do but come and be seen. Or ecstatic accounts of how the sighting of some bird/mammal was the culminating point of the trip. Do foresters feel pressurised into making sightings happen to attract more people? So that the chosen few can pat themselves on being ‘nature lovers’ who have sighted the tiger ‘in the wild’?
Most people don’t realise that seriously marvellous things happen in forests over time. To be with the forests is to feel the cool wind in the trees; to hear the swish of leaves spiralling down, the sudden cackle of the giant squirrel or the hoot of the langur, the chirping of the cicadas; to see and feel the play of light on giant trees and seemingly frail lianas that bear remarkable weights, the myriad lives inside tree trunks, the immaculate straightness of a dead tree or the silvery lines of spiders’ webs. Art is seldom so multi-sensory; every minute is a living landscape in process.
A forest is a phenomenon so diverse and widespread that it needs to be understood in totality. But seldom is there any front page news from the forest apart from the occasional fire or storm. Do we understand that the good of a tree is only half over at its death, when it provides nesting cavities, perches, food for birds too? Being in a forest can mean absolute stillness, yet continual dynamic change. Historic past is encountered in the present.
But many city dwellers actually want to experience the city everywhere they go, even inside wildlife sanctuaries. I realised this after an exhilarating trek in the Parambikulam Wildlife Sanctuary in Kerala. When we reached a forest guesthouse, I saw the following entries in the guest book: “We need TV facility, otherwise it is boring after we reach”, “Provide room service”, “Allow other mobile operators to install towers”.
We need to respect forests and sanctuaries for the wonders that they encompass, to accept the blessing of a sighting when it happens. Not rush around disturbing the peace because you ‘have to sight’ what you thought you should before you leave. What we need are individuals who can appreciate the roughness of the forest floor and the smoothness of the mulch as much as the coolness of the river or the gentle heat of the sun through the canopy; who revere the smallest insect or frog or bird along with the largest mammal; who are as grateful to sight only a black-naped hare amid the dry deciduous Melghat Reserve in Maharashtra or a jungle cat in the moist deciduous forests of Uttarakhand’s Corbett Reserve! Can we just be, and experience our forests?

SC asks Centre to furnish information on black money
","The Supreme Court on Thursday directed the Centre to disclose >all the information it received from Germany on 26 individuals who had stashed away their black money in LGT Bank, Liechtenstein.
On Tuesday, Solicitor-General Mohan Parasaran >disclosed the names of 18 persons to Ram Jethmalani, who is the petitioner. However, the list did not contain details of the amount each individual had invested. Information of 26 persons was given by the government in sealed covers.
Mr. Parasaran said of the 12 trusts that involved 26 individuals, investigation in 18 cases had been concluded by the Income Tax department and prosecutions had been launched in 17 cases (as one person is dead). The SG said investigations on eight other persons found no evidence of tax evasion in terms of Indian laws. He added that their names were in the second sealed envelope, and its contents weren’t shared with the petitioner.
A three-judge Bench of Justices H.L. Dattu and Ranjana Desai and Madan Lokur told the SG that it would decide on disclosing the contents of sealed covers.
When hearing resumed on Thursday the Bench passed a brief order directing the Union government to furnish all the details to Mr. Jethmalani within three days. Sources said the Centre had raised a demand of about Rs. 40 crore as income tax from the individuals against whom the probe was completed.
The Bench also appointed former apex court Judge M.B. Shah as Chairman of the Special Investigation Team, following the inability expressed by Justice B.P. Jeevan Reddy to head the SIT. The Bench appointed retired apex court judge Arijit Pasayat as vice-chairman of the SIT.
The Bench reiterated the order passed by the court in July 2011 specifying the terms of reference for the SIT.
The order said, “The SIT shall take over the matter of investigation of the individuals whose names have been disclosed by Germany as having accounts in banks in Liechtenstein and expeditiously conduct the same. The SIT shall review and assess whether investigations have been properly conducted before concluding if there is a need for further investigation.”
The Bench said, “The SIT shall also be charged with the responsibility of preparing a comprehensive action plan, including the creation of necessary institutional structures that can enable and strengthen the country’s battle against generation of unaccounted monies and their stashing away in foreign banks or in various forms domestically. The SIT shall be charged with the responsibilities and duties of investigation, initiation of proceedings and prosecution, whether in the context of appropriate criminal or civil proceedings of all issues relating to the matters concerning and arising from unaccounted monies of Hassan Ali Khan and the Tapurias. All other matters with respect to unaccounted monies being stashed in foreign banks by Indians or other entities operating in India may arise in the course of such investigations and proceedings.” The Bench asked the SIT to file periodic status reports to the court.
The Bench directed the Centre to issue notification on the constitution of the SIT within three weeks and posted the matter for further hearing on August 20.

Media coverage on gender identity issues draws flak
","The media can be a positive force for improving human rights, health of homosexuals and transgender people in South Asia, says a new report developed by Centre for Advocacy & Research (CFAR) and UN Development Programme (UNDP).
The report, ‘A Framework for Media Engagement on MSM and Transgender Persons in South Asia,’ provides direction for how homosexuals and transgender communities should engage with the media and how the media itself should leverage its influence to reduce stigma and discrimination, educate and raise awareness of human rights issues and support strategies, programmes that improve the political, social and legal environments for homosexuals and the transgender people.
Examining media reporting in Bangladesh, India, Sri Lanka and Nepal, researchers found prejudiced, inaccurate and sensationalised news coverage that increased stigma and distorted public perception on sexual orientation and gender identity issues. It also enforced stereotypes and not reported community issues accurately.
“Though media coverage of HIV has increased over the last two decades, the coverage of issues relating to sexual orientation and gender identities has often been weak and objectionable,” said Edmund Settle, Policy Advisor at UNDP Asia-Pacific Regional Centre.
“By engaging with communities, raising awareness among media practitioners and wielding their powers for good, the media can influence public opinion and policies and programmes, and contribute to a more effective HIV response in the region,” said Mr. Settle.
The report recommends that community organisations create partnerships with all levels of the media – local, state and national – to improve accurate reporting and representation of key issues.
Taking the appeal forward, Akhila Sivadas, Executive Director, CFAR, said: “Today, more than ever before, there was both an imperative and an opportunity for community-based organisations to systematically harness the media, in particular the local language and district media and engage them in impacting policies and programmes with the decisive aim to advance social inclusion of and affirmative action for homosexuals and transgender persons.”
The authors and researchers of the report, CFAR, also noted reasons for hope. “Sexual and gender minority communities in the countries studied have made huge strides in recent years. On several occasions, they’ve been key ‘newsmakers’ and driven intensive periods of national discourse around key community issues.”
In India, media sensitisation workshops have improved coverage, as have partnerships between community and media to raise issues on HIV, human rights and human interest stories.

In fight to save sister, woman takes down a caste panchayat
","After a year of determined struggle, Durga Gudilu, 22, has won the fight to save her sister from a marriage decided by a Vaidu caste panchayat here.
Ms. Gudilu succeeded in changing the minds of the panchayat members, all men, and on Sunday, they dissolved the panchayat to form a development panel instead, for the social uplift of the community.
“I opposed my sister’s marriage which was decided when she was born,” Ms. Gudilu told The Hindu. “Our parents educated us and we grew up in Mumbai. My graduate sister didn’t want to marry an uneducated man. That was her choice, and I supported her.” Ms. Gudilu’s family faced a social boycott. A woman of the socially and educationally backward community challenging the panchayat’s order was unheard of until then.
Ms. Gudilu approached her friends for help. “My parents were so scared to speak against the panchayat that they even threatened to kill themselves,” she said.
The Maharashtra Andhashraddha Nirmulan Samiti (MANIS), founded by >Narendra Dabholkar, the rationalist who was murdered, helped Ms. Gudilu. “We decided to hold discussions with senior panchayat members. Many were unaware of the fact that their work pronouncing punishments or deciding child marriages was unconstitutional,” said Krushna Chandgude of MANIS.
Swami Vaidu, a panchayat leader, said the decision to scrap the panchayat was in keeping with the changing times.

Shoot-at-sight after Assam massacre
","The Army has been called out and an indefinite curfew imposed in the Bodoland Territorial Area Districts (BTAD) of Kokrajhar and Baksa in Assam after >militants killed 20 persons and injured 10, all Muslim migrants, in three separate attacks on Thursday night and Friday.
Unofficial sources, however, put the death toll at 23. The militants torched over 30 houses in four villages in Baksa.
Shoot-at-sight orders have been issued. The Army took out flag marches.
The Assam Police said the National Democratic Front of Boroland (Songbijit) carried out the attacks.
Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi called the attacks a cowardly act. Union Home Minister Sushilkumar Shinde spoke to Mr. Gogoi, and promised to send 10 additional companies of Central paramilitary forces sought by the State government.
On Friday evening, militants attacked Narayanguri village and adjoining areas near the Manas National Park in Baksa, killing nine persons, official sources said.
Eleven persons died in two attacks on Thursday night. Around 9 p.m., militants gunned down three persons in Baksa. Around half past midnight, five or six militants descended on a village in Kokrajhar and opened fire indiscriminately, Inspector-General of Police (BTAD) L.R. Bisnoi said. Eight persons — six women and two girls — were killed.
Mr. Bisnoi said the militant group had targeted civilians to avenge the killing of three militants of the outfit in an encounter with a joint team of the police and the Central Reserve Police Force in Sonitpur district on Thursday.
He said the outfit targeted civilians belonging to religious and linguistic minorities when it suffered reverses.

Low price leaves acid lime farmers with a bitter aftertaste
","For the farmers of Pudukottai district, the good yield of acid lime recorded this year hasn’t turned out to be a reason to celebrate, as poor price for their produce plays spoiler.
Despite severe drought conditions prevailing in the district for the past many months, acid lime farmers of more than 20 villages in Alangudi taluk, have registered good harvest, thanks to water from borewells.
The daily harvest from the villages stands of 15 tonnes is collected by the local commission agents and marketed in areas, including Tiruchi and Madurai. The cultivation cost has increased manifold due to various factors, particularly drought condition and load shedding.
Farmers adopt various methods for raising the crop. While a compact area is brought under comprehensive cultivation practice by some farmers, several others cultivate it as an intercrop. It is also raised in their backyard for commercial purpose.
Though the wholesale price for the fruits has shot up from Rs.15 per kg last year to Rs.50-Rs.60, the hike has not been enough to support the cultivation cost, say a cross section of farmers of Alangudi taluk.
What has come as a big shock to farmers is the exploitation by commission agents, who market it at Rs.150 per kg. There has been a good demand for the fruit this summer with patronage from juice stalls, says Selvam, a farmer of Senthangudi village.
The villages in Alangudi, Keeramangalam, Seriyalur, Kothamangalam, Kulamangalam, Senthankudi, Nagaram and Panankulam are the major areas noted for acid lime production in the district. A majority of the commission agencies are located in Keeramangalam, Kothamangalam, Vadakadu, Pulichangadu Kaikatti, Panankulam, and Kulamangalam.

When bullets rained on Muslim families in Bodo village
","“It was around 4.30 p.m. when we heard rattling sounds coming from the western side of our village. The continuous sounds of rapid firing advanced on us. There were about 40 of them, some in battle fatigues and faces covered with black cloth, and some others wearing khaki. All of them held weapons. They torched houses, fired indiscriminately at people and hacked those had fallen to bullets. Some people jumped into the river to save their lives. But the militants fired at them also. I just managed to flee the scene and snatched our old trunk and jumped into the Beki river. Holding on to the floating trunk, I swam for about 20 minutes and reached here,” said Rezia Bewa, 60, a widow of Nanke Khagrabari in Baksa district of the Bodoland Territorial Area District, giving a firsthand account of the massacre of 18 persons, most of them women and children, by suspected militants on Friday afternoon in her village of migrant Muslim families.
Ten bodies were recovered on Friday night and eight others on Saturday, some floating in the Beki and some lying on the banks of the river. The village is located on the fringes of the Manas National Park.
Moidul Islam, a Class V student, said a bullet whizzed past him even as he saw one man being hit by another bullet. Moidul was not able to trace his mother Maibul Nessa and five-year-old sister Jaigan Nessa till Saturday afternoon while he fled into a nearby jungle and stayed there until he was rescued by villagers. The villagers said more than 20 persons were still missing.
Kasem Ali, 30, who was home, first mistook the firing for gunshots fired by forest guards at timber smugglers. “Some of us ran towards to the forest camp. But more firing came from the camp direction. I ran to the nearby jungle and hid there and came out only when someone told me that the Army had already arrived at the village,” he said.
Fakhruddin, 52, had just arrived at the Bhangarpar market on Friday afternoon when he suddenly got a call from his 11-year-old son Sariful Islam that militants had attacked the village.
“My son told me to get back and save them. As I turned back, I saw the houses in my village across the Beki going up in flames. I jumped into the river and swam to rush back home. By the time I reached there along with some others, all houses including mine had been reduced to ashes. Bodies of women and children were lying here and there in pools of blood. I could find none of my family members anywhere in the village,” Fakhruddin told The Hindu on Saturday. His two minor sons were rescued by the villagers as they were holding on to a log and swimming in the river on Saturday morning. However, Fakhruddin’s 12-year-old daughter Alia is still missing.
Most of the male members of Nanke Khagrabari had been at the daily afternoon market here, about 35 km from Barpeta Road town in lower Assam’s Barpeta district, when the militants swooped down on their village. They watched helplessly as their houses went up in flames.
About 500 people, including 200 minor children of the village, have taken shelter in a relief camp opened by the Baksa district administration at Narayanguri Azadpur L.P. School. The administration also brought rice, salt, dal and mustard oil for distribution among them.

One critically injured in Chidambaram blast
","Despite Tamil Nadu coming under a security blanket after the May 1 twin blasts on a train in Chennai, a bomb blast rocked Cuddalore district on Saturday. A 34-year-old person was badly injured while he was allegedly making bombs in a house near Annamalai University at Chidambaram. The police are on the look-out for five of his associates, said to be at large.
The incident has raised safety concerns among people in this constituency reserved for Dalits, with barely two weeks to go for counting of votes polled in the recent Lok Sabha polls. Post-poll, minor incidents of caste clashes occurred in the district.
Only on Tuesday last did the ‘Q’ Branch CID of the Tamil Nadu Police arrest 37-year old Zakir Hussain, a Sri Lankan national suspected to be an agent of an ISI operative, in Chennai, and seize photographs of vital installations and counterfeit currency from him.
While the twin blasts on the Bangalore-Guwahati Express on Thursday eerily brought the shadow of terror to Chennai’s doorstep, the same day the Anti-Terrorist Squad of the Rajasthan Police and the Tamil Nadu Police arrested Asraf Ali, an Indian Mujahideen operative, at Porto Novo near Chidambaram.
Saturday’s blast occurred in a house at Annamalai Nagar, Chidambaram, which was rented out by a retired professor to Arul, one of the university staff. On hearing a loud sound around 11 a.m., the neighbours alerted the police. The blast shattered the window panes of the house, and blood was found splattered across its floor.
Even as the police and Fire Service personnel rushed to the spot, five inmates of the house took the injured in an auto to hospital. Thereafter, they disappeared. The police now do not see any conspiracy, but initial investigation revealed that the injured was a rowdy element and allegedly involved in several murders in Dindigul and Theni districts.
Speaking to 
The Hindu, SP A. Radhika said: “It was a country-bomb blast of low intensity. The injured is identified as Mohanram from Dindigul, and he was allegedly involved in murder cases in Dindigul and Theni districts. The investigation is on.”
Mohanram was allegedly involved in 13 criminal cases, and he was manufacturing country-bombs in his friend’s place. He is believed to have lost both his eyes in the blast.

Art for all
","My hand is trying to arrest the wobble,” says 12-year-old Surabhi. She is shaping a small clay pot on a potter’s wheel at Rainbow Fish Studio in Kotturpuram. She, along with Suchit, Adia, and friends, are learning pottery from Potrarasan, as part of a summer course at the newly-launched visual art school. The art studio is filled with clay masterpieces the children made — they have sculpted crocodiles, fish, penguins…Another batch of students is learning graphic designing — they are making posters to promote Paris.
Rainbow Fish Studio is an art school with a difference — they have art and design courses tailored specifically to develop an eye for art in children. Be it a session on ‘Shapes, Figures, & Strange Machines’, ‘Jungle art’, or ‘Maps and Info Design’, their courses aim to urge a child to appreciate art that surrounds him/her.
Sara Vetteth, who started the school, wishes that children open their eyes “to the incredible beauty around them.” For instance, in India, almost every street corner has a temple — but do children really stop to admire them? Art should go beyond being just a hobby, feels Sara.
At Rainbow Fish, children learn about portraits, self- portraits; hear of Van Gogh, Picasso, and Munch; explore folk art styles; understand the components that make up building architecture…the courses are tailored for kids aged from five to seven, seven to 10, and 10 to 14.
Sara, who holds a Masters degree from Parsons School of Design in New York, says that Rainbow Fish will not stop with their summer programmes. She hopes to develop “after school design courses” that children can enrol for. She is backed by a qualified team of instructors to help her do so. Actor and photographer Sunder, for instance, will teach the kids photography, architect Kalpana Balaji who runs her own design firm with her husband in the city, will hold sessions on the principles of architecture. In the long run, Rainbow Fish will become a place where “schools outsource their weekly art classes,” says Sara. She feels that even one art class per week during the course of the year will make children “enjoy and appreciate the world around them much more.”

KSRTC increases bus fares by 7.96 per cent
","Fares of the Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) buses were hiked by around 7.96 per cent from Saturday midnight.
A day after Transport Minister R. Ramalinga Reddy told reporters that a hike in KSRTC bus fares was inevitable, the corporation announced the hike to “off-set the increase in financial burden” arising from the rise in fuel prices and increase in dearness allowance to its employees.

Diesel price hike

In a statement here, the KSRTC said the financial burden on the corporation due to the hike in diesel price was Rs. 105.05 crore a year and increase in dearness allowance to its employees amounted to Rs. 102.77 crore a year.
The KSRTC expects to garner additional revenue of Rs. 123.87 crore from the fare hike. The deficit of Rs. 83.95 crore a year would be mobilised by improving efficiency of operation, the statement said.
The North-Western Karnataka Road Transport Corporation and North-Eastern Karnataka Road Transport Corporation fares had also been hiked.
The increase in ordinary bus fares is, however, limited to only 7.66 per cent to reduce the burden on rural passengers, the statement said.

Volvo buses exemptedThe premium Volvo and Rajahamsa bus services have been exempted from the hike, a KSRTC official said.
“The fares of Volvo and Rajahamsa bus services are increased seasonally depending on demand. Their fares were revised in April for the peak summer season. The fares for these two services are dynamic, as they are different on weekdays and weekends,” the official added.

Where getting married at three is not unusual
","Neelu (name changed), an eight-year-old, speaks like one and her eyes have the gleam and wonder of a little girl.
The only aberration here is that Neelu, a class IV student who loves studying English and Maths, has been married for five years.
“
Shaadi kab ho gai, kuch yaad nahi [I remember nothing about when I got married],” she says.
Neelu, like several other young girls, was married off on Akshaya Tritiya or Akha Teej, the third lunar day of the Indian month of Vaishakh.
Considered extremely auspicious, Akshaya Tritiya — it fell on a Friday this year — is best known in Rajasthan for the large number of child marriages that are solemnised on this day.
In Neelu’s village, Chittorgarh district’s Ganpatkheda, getting married at three is not out of the ordinary.
Child marriage, despite the discourse on social development and progress, is still rampant in Rajasthan and cuts across regions, caste groups and districts.
This age-old social practice, which was based on mutual economic benefit, has now grown to be used as a way to impose control over female sexuality.
About 400 km from Neelu’s village, Nathi Bai, a 57-year-old woman from Bagon ki Dhani near Jaipur, uses a unique brand of logic to justify child marriages.
“I was seven when I got married. Earlier, young girls were often married off along with their elder sisters in order to save money,” she says.
“They just understand more these days...in our time, girls and boys would roam around naked till they were 10, but now they are attracted to each other very early on,” she says.
Community members concede that it is strange for child marriage to persist to this day but maintain that the rationale behind the practice has changed. Whereas earlier financial and logistical concerns would necessitate the practice, parents today perform child marriages because technology has led to a rise in precocious sexual maturity, they said. “Money is not an issue anymore; everyone has money. But there is the mobile phone and the Internet and WhatsApp available to children [today]. Everyone has access to pornography, and there is this heightened sexual urge among children these days. So, parents want to marry them off early,” says Dayal Bairwa of Renwal near Jaipur.
Curiously, popular perception holds that child marriages helps deal with the rapidly falling sex ratio. “If a boy isn’t married off by 21, there’s a good chance he will stay unmarried... because there are so few girls left,” says Laduram Chaudhary.
“We think girls should be married off by 15 as [unlike] earlier girls and boys understand stuff [today]... now they know everything,” he says.
The efforts of the police and administration continue to be limited to issuing circulars and alerts. The Jaipur district administration recently issued an order that anybody participating in a child marriage — including caterers, musicians or priests — would be liable to be prosecuted under the State’s new Child Marriage Act of 2006.
“We had issued a circular alerting all police stations about this issue...if any such case is found then a FIR is registered,” says ADG (civil rights) R.P. Singh.
However, social activists say formal complaints/FIR against child marriages are few and far between.
But there are those that have dedicated their lives to confronting the pernicious practice.

>Bhanwari Devi, a grassroots social activist who was allegedly gang-raped for raising her voice against child marriages, feels things are changing.
Bhanwri, who received the full support of the people of her village Bhateri on issues ranging from literacy, health, education and rape, found herself alienated and ostracised when she spoke out against child marriages.
“Back then, it was very difficult. Nobody would listen to me and you know what happened then,” says Bhanwari, whose case led to the framing of the >Vishakha guidelines on sexual harassment of women at the workplace.
“Even now, things are not easy and I am still looked at with suspicion. But there has definitely been a huge change. Now, parents want their girl children to study and then get married at the right age. It is not a complete transformation but these things take time,” she says.

Minor raped at gunpoint in U.P. village
","A 14-year-old girl was allegedly raped at gunpoint by five youths in Nanu village in Uttar Pradesh’s Sardhana area on Thursday. The girl was on her way to a neighbour’s house when the youths pulled her into a nearby house and assaulted her, police said.
She was also beaten when she threatened to report the matter to the police.
When the victim returned home and informed her parents, they initially preferred silence given the stigma.
However, news spread after the alleged rapists began to loiter around her house. When relatives and friends tried to catch the culprits, they slipped away. Sent for medical exam Members of the community then persuaded the family to take the girl to the Sardhana police station. An FIR was registered against Iqbal, Monu, Baju, Maujood and Sahjad on Friday and the victim was sent for a medical examination.
“We are investigating the case and efforts are being made to arrest the accused persons and unravel the truth,” Captain M.M. Beg, SP Meerut (Rural) said on Saturday. He added that the medical examination report of the victim was awaited.
Rights activist Sarika has urged the police to get the statement of the victim as requried under Section 164 (Code of Criminal Procedure) as required by the anti-rape law amended in the aftermath of the 2012 Nirbhaya gang rape.

Suspected IM operative taken to Rajasthan
","Ashraf Ali, a suspected Indian Mujahideen operative who was nabbed on Thursday from his hideout near a mosque at Port Novo in Cuddalore district, has been taken to Rajasthan for further investigation.
According to police sources, his involvement has been ruled out in the twin blasts that rocked Chennai Central on Thursday.
The police version is that Ali had sneaked into the State in the guise of a volunteer of the Hazrat Nizamuddin Dargah in Delhi to offer religious lectures in different States. He had adopted this modus operandi to avoid suspicion.
The Rajasthan Anti-Terror Squad zeroed in on his whereabouts in Port Novo on Thursday evening after a nationwide manhunt spanning several weeks.
The 40-year-old Ashraf Ali is the main suspect in the setting up and running of sleeper IM modules in Jodhpur. Ali, who belongs to Uttar Pradesh, was running a footwear shop in Jodhpur. The sleeper module in Rajasthan was busted by the Ant-Terror Squad and the Delhi Police Special Cell in March.
Following the arrest of two terror suspects in Jodhpur with explosives last March, Ali immediately left Jodhpur for Delhi by train, and from there he arrived in Chennai by train and was lodged there for a while.
The interrogation of the arrested terror suspects in Jodhpur led the police to clue in on the likely involvement of Ali.
Monitoring his mobile records, the Anti-Terror Squad traced him to Port Novo. ATS sleuths, with the assistance of the Cuddalore district police, accosted the suspect while he was loitering around a mosque at Port Novo.
The suspect was taken to the Thukkambakkam police station where he was grilled by the Tamil Nadu police who probed various angles, including whether he was involved in Thursday’s blast on the Bangalore-Guwahati Express.
After extensive inquiry, Ali was produced before Chief Judicial Magistrate Kingsley Christopher for remand.
While he was waiting in the court, he swooned. The police had to sprinkle water to bring him back to his senses and produce him before the magistrate. Passing an order on the plea for transit remand, the court directed the ATS to produce him in the local court in Jodhpur within five days.

The past train tragedies
","The erstwhile composite Tiruchi district witnessed three major train bomb blasts in the last few decades.
The explosions involving the Tiruchi-Erode passenger (1986), the Chennai-Tiruchi Rockfort Express (1987) and the Chennai-Madurai Pandian Express (1997) claimed more than 30 lives, besides injuring about 160 passengers.
Bomb culture was something unheard of in the State till an explosive went off in a carriage of the Tiruchi – Erode passenger at the Mutharasanallur Railway Station, seven km from Tiruchi, on December 23, 1986. One person was killed and 25 were injured.
In a tragedy that shook the whole nation, about 25 persons were killed and over 150 injured when the diesel loco and eight bogies of the Chennai - Tiruchi Rockfort Express met with an accident over the river Marudaiyar bridge between Ariyalur and Sillakudi Railway Stations at 4.40 a.m. on March 15, 1987. A bomb blast caused it.
The blast was a case of perfect and consummate planning. The entry of the engine on the bridge coincided with the blast at the other end of the 600-feet-long structure. The loco had fallen perpendicularly just outside the bridge, with the following eight bogies telescoping into one another.
The entire rails to a distance of about 30 to 40 feet had been pulled out and the base steel structure of the bridge got twisted.
The bogies were seen hanging topsy-turvy on the bridge. One bogie had landed on the dry river bed, while the others were found hanging in a precarious position.
The intention of the criminals seemed to blow off the bridge when the Rockfort Express reached it. In yet another incident that took place on the Babri Masjid demolition anniversary day of December 6, 1997, a powerful bomb ripped apart a second class sleeper coach of the Madurai-bound Pandian Express just minutes after the train arrived at the Tiruchi junction at 4.45 a.m. Four persons were killed and eight were injured . On the same day, two other blasts took place in the Coimbatore-bound Cheran Express near Erode and the Alleppey Express entering Kerala.
All the three trains had started from Chennai the previous night.


The artilce has been corrected for a factual error.

MDMK stages protest, urges govt to implement RTE
","Members of the Marumalarchi Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam staged a protest in Sulur on Friday urging the State Government to implement in full the provisions of the Right to Education Act after making the necessary changes.
A release from the party said that the Government must issue a new Government Order replacing the existing one so that the intended beneficiaries get the benefit from the RTE Act, bring about a single window system of admission under the RTE Act. It said that the Maharashtra Government had implemented an online admission system.
The party through the information obtained under the Right to Information Act had clearly established that 90 per cent of the 2,163 students who were admitted under the RTE Act were not as per law. Across the State, 19,971 students were admitted under the RTE Act. It had also established that due to the deficiencies in admitting students under the Act, the real beneficiaries – students from families from economically weaker section – had not benefitted.
The party then sent the information to the State School Education Minister, the head of the State Commission for the Protection of Child Rights, the district administration and also the Chief Education Officer, Coimbatore. It had also sent a representation to the State School Education Minister that the Government Order issued for admission of students under the RTE Act (GO 60) was not clear and proper and that it ought to be changed.
But, there had been no response from the recipients of the letter and complaints.
The Government ought to have paid to the schools the tuition fee of the students admitted under the RTE Act by September last year. But to date the Government had not disbursed the money. This was because the Government was yet to determine the school-wise fee, the release said and pointed out that Karnataka had allocated Rs. 45 crore for the purpose. The inaction on the part of the Government was condemnable and it was to highlight this that the party had staged a protest, the release said.

Filtering content on the internet
","On May 5, the Supreme Court will hear Kamlesh Vaswani’s infamous anti-pornography petition again. The petition makes some rather outrageous claims. Watching pornography ‘puts the country’s security in danger’ and it is ‘worse than Hitler, worse than AIDS, cancer or any other epidemic,’ it says. This petition has been pending before the Court since February 2013, and seeks a new law that will ensure that pornography is exhaustively curbed.
The petition assumes that pornography causes violence against women and children. The trouble with such a claim is that the debate disintegrates into binaries; the two positions being that pornography causes violence or that it does not. The fact remains that the causal link between violence against women and pornography is yet to be proven convincingly and remains the subject of much debate. Additionally, since the term pornography refers to a whole range of explicit content, including homosexual adult pornography, it cannot be argued that all pornography objectifies women or glamorises violent treatment of them.
Allowing even for the petitioner’s legitimate concern about violence against women, it is interesting to note that of all the remedies available, he seeks the one which is authoritarian but may not have any impact at all. Mr. Vaswani could have, instead, encouraged the state to do more toward its international obligations under the Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW). CEDAW’s General Recommendation No. 19 is about violence against women and recommends steps to be taken to reduce violence against women. These include encouraging research on the extent, causes and effects of violence, and adopting preventive measures, such as public information and education programmes, to change attitudes concerning the roles and status of men and women.
Although different countries disagree about the necessity of banning adult pornography, there is general international consensus about the need to remove child pornography from the Internet. Children may be harmed in the making of pornography, and would at the very minimum have their privacy violated to an unacceptable degree. Being minors, they are not in a position to consent to the act. Each act of circulation and viewing adds to the harmful nature of child pornography. Therefore, an argument can certainly be made for the comprehensive removal of this kind of content.
Indian policy makers have been alive to this issue. The Information Technology Act (IT Act) contains a separate provision for material depicting children explicitly or obscenely, stating that those who circulate such content will be penalised. The IT Act also criminalises watching child pornography (whereas watching regular pornography is not a crime in India).
Intermediaries are obligated to take down child pornography once they have been made aware that they are hosting it. Organisations or individuals can proactively identify and report child pornography online. Other countries have tried, with reasonable success, systems using hotlines, verification of reports and co-operation of internet service providers to take down child pornography. However, these systems have also sometimes resulted in the removal of other legitimate content.
Child pornography can be blocked or removed using the IT Act, which permits the government to send lists of URLs of illegal content to internet service providers, requiring them to remove this content. Even private parties can send notices to online intermediaries informing them of illegal content and thereby making them legally accountable for such content if they do not remove it. However, none of this will be able to ensure the disappearance of child pornography from the Internet in India.
Technological solutions like filtering software that screens or blocks access to online content, whether at the state, service provider or user level, can at best make child pornography inaccessible to most people. People who are more skilled than amateurs will be able to circumvent technological barriers since these are barriers only until better technology enables circumvention.
Additionally, attempts at technological filtering usually even affect speech that is not targeted by the filtering mechanism. Therefore, any system for filtering or blocking content from the Internet needs to build in safeguards to ensure that processes designed to remove child pornography do not end up being used to remove political speech or speeches that are constitutionally protected.
In the Vaswani case, the government has correctly explained to the Supreme Court that any greater attempt to monitor pornography is not technologically feasible. It has pointed out that human monitoring of content will delay transmission of data substantially, will slow down the Internet, and will also be ineffective, since the illegal content can easily be moved to other servers in other countries.
Making intermediaries liable for the content they host will undo the safe harbour protection granted to them by the IT Act. Without it, intermediaries like Facebook will actually have to monitor all the content they host, and the resources required for such monitoring will reduce the content that makes its way online. This would seriously impact the extensiveness and diversity of content available on the Internet in India. Additionally, when demands are made for the removal of legitimate content, profit-making internet companies will be disinclined to risk litigation much in the same way as Penguin was reluctant to defend Wendy Doniger’s book.
If the Supreme Court makes the mistake of creating a positive obligation to monitor Internet content for intermediaries, it will effectively kill the Internet in India.

11 killed in militant attacks in Assam
","Heavily armed NDFB(S) militants unleashed violence in two districts of Assam falling under Bodoland Territorial Administration area, killing 11 people, including three children, and leaving three others seriously injured since Thursday night.
A group of 20 to 25 NDFB-Songbijit militants, armed with AK-47 rifles, swooped down on three houses at Balapara-I village in Kokrajhar district in the early hours on Friday and fired indiscriminately killing seven persons on the spot, the police said.
IGP L.R. Bishnoi told PTI that two children and four women of the minority community were among the seven persons who were gunned down.
The body of a three-year-old child identified, who was also killed in the attack, was recovered from the area later this morning, he said, adding two men were also seriously injured.
Family members of the victims said the insurgents attacked one house after another, firing indiscriminately creating panic in the area.
This was the second attack by the militants since last night.
Three persons of a family, including two women, were shot dead and an infant was seriously injured by NDFB-S militants in neighbouring Baksa district on Thursday night.

A silent killer that’s not an election issue
","In March, the World Health Organization released its latest study which estimated a total of 7 million deaths worldwide in 2012 caused by exposure to air pollution — one in eight of all global deaths. Indoor air pollution was linked to 4.3 million of the deaths that occurred in homes which depend on biomass or coal for cooking.
In August 1997, on the eve of India celebrating 50 years of independence, the Energy and Resources Institute, in a detailed study assessing the country’s record of environmental protection and conservation of natural resources during that period, found that a total of 2.5 million premature deaths took place in 1997 alone as a result of air pollution, both indoor and outdoor. The majority of these were caused by pollution indoors that stemmed from cooking on inefficient cookstoves burning largely inferior forms of biomass.
India is currently voting in its general election – the world's largest democracy began voting on 7 April and finishes on 12 May – but if the record of previous governments is any indication, environmental issues are unlikely to be a priority. There is, no doubt, a credible framework of legislation in place in India to support any attention give to environmental issues, but the institutions and processes that translate intent into action remain weak and ineffective.
(On the subject of climate change, the government announced its a national action plan in 2008, the provisions and contents of which were put together over the following two years in a rigorous exercise involving governments of all states, members of civil society and various thinktanks. However, the implementation of the plan remains far below stated targets and goals.)
Apart from the serious and widespread problems of water pollution – both on the surface and below the ground – erosion and degradation of soil, and loss of forest density and biodiversity, the problem of air pollution in several parts of the country is alarming. While outdoor air pollution gets some attention from the public and decision-makers, indoor air pollution, which afflicts at least two-thirds of Indian homes, remains neglected.
More than 300 million people in India have no access to electricity, and those that do still do not have a stable supply. As a result, kerosene lamps and candles are used widely in many Indian homes, with high levels of air pollution affecting hundreds of millions. Women and children are particularly vulnerable because they spend more time at home. Perhaps even more serious is the dependence of around 700 million people on the burning of biomass in their homes, using inefficient stoves that emit large quantities of smoke, leading to high doses of air pollution.
Fortunately, some solutions have been devised. As part of its Lighting a Billion Lights campaign, the Energy and Resources Institute has reached almost 3,000 villages in India and Africa, introducing the decentralised use of photovoltaic panels. An important apsect of this campaign is that a local female entrepreneur is trained to set up a central charging station in a village using solar panels on rooves. She charges lightweight, LED solar lanterns, with a socket for charging mobile phones. After charging the lanterns for the whole village in the daytime, she rents them out at night. This provides the entire village with clean, efficient and reliable lighting, based on a sustainable, market-oriented model. Similar programmes have been launched with improved stoves in a large number of villages, reducing indoor air pollution drastically.
Unfortunately, elected governments in India have largely failed to come to grips with the problem of indoor air pollution, and those campaigning in the ongoing election show scant understanding of this pervasive problem. With irrational subsidies on kerosene, the transition to cleaner fuels in many Indian homes may, therefore, remain slow. Fortunately, with falling solar power prices and the demonstrated success of the Lighting a Billion Lights campaign, many NGOs and even the private sector are now emulating the lights model. This promises well for the future.

Love of singing
","“We all used to meet at the same bar and for us the glass that we were having was obviously half full. The essence to us was the love for music and our story has always been about friendship and music and the opportunity to live new experiences,” said Sharif D Rangnekar, one of the voices of the band Friends of Linger.
The band performed at Hard Rock Cafe, Saket, recently. They have always shared the common dream of performing live on stage, a desire that has become real thanks to their tenacity and due to the help of the renowned professional guitarist Adhir Ghosh.
As the band is new, they play mostly covers, and they do it in a very democratic way. The experience of this group, in fact, is quite unusual since there are five amateurs singers – Sharif, Craig Cranenburgh, Deepak Sharma, Devyani Shankar and Varun Kapoor – and none of them is the leading voice: while performing they switch from one genre to another according to the skills or the feelings of every member. Asked about the difficulties arising from the vocal limitations of the members and to the criticism they make about each other without quarrelling, they in unison commented: “Once in the studio, the larger part of our egos is left outside the door.” All of them have very different working experiences and, as the only female voice Devyani said: “We sing because we love singing. Our experience is purely fun based.”
The band is also working on self-produced songs and one of those, titled “Head held high”, is nearly at the end of the creative process. While having fun with covers, the group wants also to spread messages through their music. They would like to play a role in building a tolerant society willing to accept and making the people aware on how they can contribute.
“Head held high” has a human rights approach and it is about the LGBT community which has been in the limelight in recent times and the problems faced by them currently in the Indian society. The message, as Craig said is, “At the end of the day it does not matter if a couple is made by a man and a woman, by a man and a man or by a woman and a woman. The only thing that matters is that there are two human beings who love each other.”

Ready to serve life term if ill-gotten money is proved: A. Raja
","Former Telecom Minister A. Raja, accused in the 2G spectrum case, has said he is ready to live his entire life in jail if any ill-gotten money is found with him.
Mr. Raja, who is contesting the Lok Sabha Elections from The Niligiris in Tamil Nadu, cited a report published an English daily in 2011 quoting CBI sources that he had kept Rs. 3,000 crore abroad.
“The same day I went to the judge, showed him the newspaper report and said I want to challenge Income Tax, Enforcement Directorate and CBI if they find one rupee or a dollar in my name, I will not contest the case and I will live my entire life in jail,” India TV quoted Mr. Raja as saying in a release on his interview.
Mr. Raja was arrested on February 2, 2011 and is under trial in an alleged mutli-crore 2G scam by CBI. He is out on bail now.
The Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) had estimated that 2G licences allocated to companies under the tenure of Mr. Raja in 2008 caused the government a notional loss of about Rs. 1.76 lakh crore. The calculations were based on the auction price that government got for 3G spectrum in 2010.
“The CAG failed to differentiate between 2G and 3G. 2G is meant for voice and 3G is meant for data (internet) transfer. You can’t compare PDS rice with Basmati rice. The rates will be definitely different,” Mr. Raja said.
The Supreme Court of February 2, 2012 cancelled all licences allocated in 2008 and ordered fresh auction to allocate spectrum at market determined rates.
The auction of spectrum in November, 2012 and March, 2013 fetched bids of about Rs. 13,000 crore. The last auction for 1800 Mhz (widely known as 2G spectrum) in February fetched government bids worth Rs. 37,572 crore which as per present policy can also be used for 4G services.
Mr. Raja said whatever media portrayed as the biggest corruption is largely based on assumptions and not on the basis of record.
The former Telecom Minister alleged business cartels, whose business were going to be affected by 2G spectrum allocation, have targeted him.
“I think they might have been afraid of what Raja was going to do will have complete aberration on the business network that was created by these people. They may be afraid of, (and) injected through the media that Raja is doing this, this wrong,” Mr. Raja said.
Mr. Raja claimed that it was because of him telecom call rates lowered to 50 paise per call. Basic call rates, without any scheme, are now 2 paise per second across most of the mobile operators.
“I am challenging through this forum. Let all these institutions come together (and say) Raja did wrong, Prime Minister’s Office, Union Cabinet, Parliament, Planning Commission, CAG, CBI, Supreme Court, in all factors that were indicated in the charge-sheet,” Mr. Raja said.

Prison diaries
","On December 22, 2012, Chetan Mahajan reached Bokaro to reason with angry parents of students enrolled in Everonn, the Chennai-based IIT coaching chain. Mahajan had been with the company for just three months. The Bokaro branch of Everonn had begun losing teachers to other institutes that paid a higher salary. Increasingly uneasy, the parents of enrolled students demanded a refund; rumours that the company was shutting down only served to compound the problem.
Mahajan, in Bokaro for what he thought would be a meeting with parents, found himself arrested and jailed. Mahajan spent the next month in Bokaro’s prison. From that experience came Mahajan’s first book, Bad Boys of Bokaro Jail (Penguin), an account of both his prison days and an inside view of the state of Indian prison and justice system. “I always wanted to write, but didn’t know that this would become my impetus,” he says. Completely blind-sided, Mahajan initially expected to be out of jail within days, even hours. “I wasn’t legally liable for what had happened. I hadn’t cheated the parents or taken their money. I was only an employee and I thought the whole thing would clear up soon. It didn’t sink in till I actually found myself being taken to the jail.”
Incarcerated in an under-trial jail, Mahajan met and interacted with people he never thought he’d meet. The book begins with a series of text messages he exchanged before and during the initial procedure that led to his arrest. “I changed my phone recently, but my old phone had all the messages stored, and I wanted to include them.” The frantic worried tone of the messages underline Mahajan’s growing panic that day.
The feeling only worsened in jail, with his phone, laptop and other means of communication taken away. “For the first few days, I didn’t know what to do. I was afraid and confused.” He adds that he remembers the watershed moment when he chose to write his experiences down. “I knew that to survive inside, I’d have to turn this negative, crushing experience into something positive.” On his brother’s next visit, Mahajan asked him for supplies — notebook, pens, to begin documenting his life in prison.
In the acknowledgement, Mahajan thanks the students and the Jharkhand police, admitting that he looks at what happened to him as a sort of blessing in disguise. “I am a different person because of this experience. I look at people differently. I am kinder, more accepting, more understanding of poverty and hardship. I understand that everyone deserves a second chance, and this chance can change their lives.”
Mahajan encountered many different people during his incarceration. Some became friends whom he has returned to the prison to visit. “That place is very familiar now. And some people I wanted to go back and keep in touch with. I want to know what’s happening to them.” Mahajan has changed names to protect identities. “I can’t protect the jailer’s identity, whose sympathy I was grateful for, but there were certain prisoners who helped me in ways that, if their names were revealed, would land them in trouble.”
Mahajan describes the illegal but expertly constructed ways in which prisoners survive the harsh environment, with everything from cell phones to cigarettes coming at an absurdly inflated price.
For his family, “this is more than a book. This is a window into my life and what happened to me when I was separated from them. Each one of my family and friends tell me that they’ve read it in a single sitting.” Mahajan hopes that his book will strike a similar chord with readers too. “Initially, after my release, I was barely functional. I was asocial and had nightmares. It took me very long to snap out of it.”
A lot has changed for Mahajan and he has shed the bitterness and anger. “I was angrier with my employer than with the justice system. It was them I expected help from, but it was too late coming.” In that one month, Mahajan did not once face a judge. His comparatively short stay in an under-trial prison became an example of a much bigger problem facing the country: life as it is for the crores of under-trial prisoners in Indian jails.
While Mahajan doesn’t plan to change the course of his career — education being his chosen path — he wants to help change and improve the lives of those inside prisons. “If there are groups working towards this goal, I’ll be more than happy to do my part.”

Down to earth
","These wriggling, weak-looking worms hardly trigger respect on sight. But looks can be deceiving, and these down-to-earth worms could actually hold the key to reinstating soil vitality. That is because earthworms eat huge volumes of leaf and all kinds of organic litter (as much as three to five times their body weight, every single day) and cast out nutrients that are easily absorbed by plants. In fact, vermicompost (organic wastes composted by earthworms and associated organisms is considered to be the most nutritious of all manures), while vermiwash (water run through columns of organic matter and cow dung composted by earthworm and microbial activity) has been found to promote plant growth, thanks to the presence of the plant growth hormone IAA in vermiwash. Earthworms also secrete a slimy fluid that contains nitrogen, a plant nutrient. And in the process of burrowing, earthworms mix up the top soil with the bottom soil which distributes manure and moisture throughout the soil. The burrowing action also aerates the soil, which is crucial for plants’ growth.
In conversation with us is Dr. Sultan Ismail, international expert on earthworms. This Chennai-based soil biologist, ecologist and founder of Ecoscience Research Foundation is the one who first coined the term vermitech, the technology for composting organic wastes using earthworms. ""Earthworms are the pulse of the soil. The more earthworms there are in the soil, the healthier is the soil,"" says Dr. Ismail. Here is how we can welcome earthworms into our gardens and potted plants. For more, check out www.erfindia.org

What earthworms can we introduce in our garden or potted plants?

Local worms are recommended rather than imported worms because local worms burrow better and are more adapted to survive in our soil. I recommend Perionyx excavatus (surface dwellers) and Lampito mauritii (subsurface burrowers). A mix of surface and subsurface worms is ideal.

Where can we obtain earthworms?

You can collect earthworms from your neighbourhood. One can also contact the local agricultural department, municipalities, and nurseries of the forest departments, and select horticulture shops for earthworms. Alternatively, you can use cow dung sold in cow sheds. This cow dung will have eggs of local worms. Acquire this cow dung in a semi-dry condition, neither as fresh cow dung nor as dry cakes.

How can the soil be readied to sustain earthworms?

Keep mulching the soil. Don’t clear away the fallen leaf litter. This mulch layer is crucial and will protect the soil’s moisture and beneficial microbes and attract earthworms. Keep the soil moist but not waterlogged. For this, sprinkling of water once a day will do. Native trees attract worms, so plant native trees rather than exotic species. Remove construction debris from the soil. And don’t spray synthetic pesticides. This kills earth worms.

What is the food that has to be supplied for these earthworms in the soil?

Besides naturally falling leaf litter, you could add semi-composted kitchen waste to the soil occasionally and mix it with the soil lightly. Soon worms will multiply and arrive at an ideal sustainable number.

Can earthworms spread any disease?

Earthworms do not cause any plant disease. They don’t spread any plant infection, unless the infection is already present in the vicinity. And they are absolutely harmless to human beings. In fact, earthworms are used in Siddha medicine.

Can we introduce earthworms to soil in pots?

Yes, but keep watch and remove a few worms, in case they become too numerous for the soil and loosen the soil. Dead earthworms needn’t be removed. They decompose fast and become part of the soil.

Will earthworms crawl into our houses from soil in potted plants/gardens?

Earthworms prefer to stay close to soil with food source and moisture.

Earthworm trivia

Earthworms can grow back segments or parts of their body that get severed!
Common earthworms are just a few centimetres long, but the the Giant Gippsland Earthworm found in Australia reaches a length of 4 metres.
Earthworms are hermaphrodites, have both sex organs within the same individual.
So fascinating are earthworms that the grand old man of evolution, Sir Charles Darwin studied earthworms for over 44 years and put up his observations in his book ‘The Formation of Vegetable Mould Through the Action of Worms, with Observations on Their Habits’, which instantly became a best seller.

I am… Manjunath – School resource person
","I am passionate about working with children. But before I discovered my love for children, I worked in Canara Bank and took voluntary retirement in 2001. I started pursuing my hobbies which had taken a backseat earlier. So from sitting behind counters, it was off to following my passions like cricket, theatre, music, reading, trekking and other adventure activities.
After a couple of years I started working with my wife in a school as a parent volunteer. That’s when my bond with children began. We did theatre, sports and other games and activities for children in schools. Then we also started working on science by using waste material and making toys as well as teaching children to do simple experiments. That was also when my sister-in-law started an organisation which had a branch called Balavihar that reached out to schools, including government, aided and unaided, that lacked certain facilities. We realised that some of them did not even have a library. So we started creating libraries, which later led to the building of our mobile library. This opened a whole new world of books for children. Then we tied up with an NGO called Asha For Education. This opened doors for us to reach out to schools with theatre and other cultural activities. We teach yoga, music, theatre and so on.
During one of these sessions, a parent from a well-known Montessori school saw my work and I was invited as a resource person. There began my journey independently, sans the group. Once a week, I work with Balavihaar and the rest of the week I visit schools like Creative, Magic Puddles and Namma Shaale. Since I am a voracious reader, story telling too became a part of my repertoire.
My work with children led to extensive theatre and voice exercises, exposure to the lives of people like Gandhiji, Einstein, Galileo and to know our own states like the heritage of the Cauvery river, History of India, the British Raj among others. When it comes to performing a play, I allow the children to take the lead in deciding the roles they want to perform as through the training they recognise their own strengths and weaknesses.
It’s a fulfilling and a challenging job, which is like a workout… painful while you are at it, but the end result is brilliant.

SC rejects plea seeking action against police
","The Supreme Court on Friday rejected a contempt petition filed by an advocate against the Kerala police for not registering an FIR against the Mata Amritanandamayi Math after a former inmate wrote a book alleging sexual abuse at the math.
A Bench of Justices Ranjan Gogoi and Madan B. Lokur dismissed the plea after K.K. Venugopal, appearing for Kerala, submitted that no cognisance could be taken on the basis of statements made in the book (
Holy Hel
l).
In his contempt petition, Deepak Prakash alleged that the “rape” happened in a religious place and the victim was a foreign national. He said he had lodged a complaint with the police after the victim sent him a mail corroborating the averments in the book for registration of an FIR. Mr. Prakash said the Karunagappally police on February 26 refused to register an FIR. He said he forwarded the complaint to the Police Commissioner and the DGP for immediate action.
He said: “Unfortunately, because of political pressure, till date, no action has been taken. This amounts to collapse of law and order and violation of the apex court judgment in the Lalita Kumar case, in which the court mandated registration of FIR on receipt of complaint.” The petitioner said the police was duty-bound to register an FIR and investigate the matter.
The petitioner wanted the apex court to initiate contempt proceedings against Justin John, SHO, Karunagappally police station, Kollam; Debesh Kumar Behera, Kollam Police Commissioner; DGP K.S. Balasubramaian, and Principal Home Secretary L. Radhakrishnan.
Mr. Prakash said: “It is true that she has revealed her bad experience through her book and even after 15 years, the revelations amount to a clear case of rape in captivity. When the media asked her about the delay, the victim had said that it took years for her to overcome the mental trauma and write a book on the ordeal . Moreover, the Indian judicial system takes many years to complete the legal procedures.”

Master plan drawn up to upgrade Adumalleshwar mini-zoo
","Based on the instructions of the Central Zoo Authority of India (CZAI), district Forest Department officials submitted a master plan to upgrade the Adumalleshwar mini-zoo in Chitradurga district.
The plans, estimated to cost Rs. 2 crore, include expanding the cages, creating walking paths as well as a separate play area for children.
The master plan was submitted two months ago and work will begin once the CZAI gives approval.
The sources said that every year, the department received a revenue of Rs. 4 lakh owing to the large number of visitors. After the zoo was upgraded, the entry fee would also be revised and the department would start getting more revenue, they added.
According to official sources, CZAI officials visited the Adumalleshwar mini-zoo in May 2012 and expressed their dissatisfaction over the facilities. They also criticised the lack of play area and walking space. They instructed the Forest Department officials to prepare a master plan to upgrade the zoo by utilising 25 acres of land. At present, the zoo is located on 10 acres of land. The officials had also set certain norms pertaining to the size of the cages, separate space for canteen, walking path and play area. As per their directions, a team of officials, led by the District Forest Conservator Kumarswamy , visited the Mysore zoo to conduct a detailed study of the facilities there.
According to sources, the officials interacted with the Mysore zoo authorities to prepare a master plan that would ensure that the animals in the mini-zoo were provided with better facilities.

Coastal tourism to get a boost
","Several beaches in Karnataka are set to get a facelift with the Union government approving Rs. 45-crore phase one of a project to develop tourism in ‘Coastal Karnataka Tourism Circuit’.
This is one of the four circuits identified in Karnataka for tourism development.
In Dakshina Kannada district, beaches at Uchila, Someshwar, Ullal, Tannirbavi, Panambur and Surathkal are likely to be taken up for development apart from some islands. They will get facilities such as approach roads, toilets, and watchtowers, according to sources in the Tourism Department.
While Director of Karnataka Tourism G. Satyavathi confirmed that the Centre has approved the Rs. 45-crore project, official sources said this was only the first instalment of the bigger project envisaging expenditure of about Rs. 500 crore to develop more than 140 beaches. In the next three years, about Rs. 150 crore is expected to be spent, with bulk of it coming from the Union government.
Though the plan was to provide cottages along the beeches, there is no government land outside the Coastal Regulation Zone (200 m away from the high tide line) in Dakshina Kannada. The department, however, hopes to encourage private players to build cottages for tourists.

Four circuits identified

A study conducted by Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services Ltd. for the government of India’s Tourism Department has identified four circuits for development in Karnataka. One of them, the Coastal Karnataka Tourism Circuit, comprises destinations in Dakshina Kannada, Udupi, and Uttara Kannada districts along the coastline extending up to Goa.
The study said, “Based on the carrying capacity assessment, tourism potential, and discussion with the Department of Tourism, Karnataka, the Circuit 1 (coastal tourism) … has been proposed as the priority circuit.” It listed Mangalore’s good connectivity with domestic and international destinations via air, rail and road network as a key advantage. It said tourism destinations in the three districts have good connectivity with Mangalore, with NHAI having taken up the project to upgrade the national highway from Talapady to Kundapur into a four-lane road.

Key positives

Significant tourist inflows, diversity and quality of tourism assets in terms of beaches, scenic destinations, backwaters, wildlife sanctuaries and adventure tourism, and historical monuments were other key positives for the circuit.
The poor state of approach roads, and lack of drinking water facility, parking, food and beverages outlets, quality wayside amenities and public conveniences on the way to some of the tourism destinations were mentioned as weaknesses.
But the coastline circuit had significant potential for development of beach tourism, “given that Karnataka shares the same coastline with Goa and Kerala”, the study concluded.

An adventure sport that children love
","This summer, let your child have loads of fun by experiencing something different at LEPL Icon Multiplex on Ring Road. Imagine the joy of the child when he walks, crawls or even rolls down in a transparent colourful ball floating on water.
Zorbing, the adventurous sport which originated in New Zealand, is a reality in city now. Since the water sport concept is new here, a large number of schoolchildren, with their parents in tow, throng this multiplex in the evening hours to facilitate their wards to play inside the ball.
Even while the kids are making the best of the opportunity, their parents capture their ecstatic moments inside the zorbing ball by clicking pictures.
“There is an overwhelming response to the new addition. Close to 400 children play and enjoy the sport every month,” says K. Mohan Murali, Manager of the SVM Gaming Centre at Icon. He says the turnout increases in the weekends when families visit the multiplex either for shopping or for watching a movie.
“The game involves rolling down in a large plastic ball known as ‘Zorb’ made up of transparent plastic. The rider is “trapped” inside the transparent inflatable ball, which rolls down. It floats on water while the rider uses ball’s momentum to direct it,” he says, pointing to the ball placed in a 16X16 feet tub filled with 3-feet-deep water to enable the zorb float easily.
“We are taking necessary precautions before a child can get inside the ball,” Mr. Murali says, adding that children aged between five and 15 years are allowed to play. A fee of Rs. 50 is charged per head. “My kids enjoy it thoroughly as it is a new game introduced recently,” says a happy parent.

Experts to inspect injured wild elephant
","The Forest Department will submit a formal reply to the Kerala High Court on Tuesday on the health condition of the injured female wild elephant that is staying put in waters of the Idamalayar reservoir for the past 25 days.
The department will also inform the court on the action taken during the past 25 days to treat and feed the elephant and also the action planned to save the elephant from its agony. In this connection an expert team comprising veterinarians, wildlife experts and forest officials will diagnose the condition of the elephant on Sunday.
The High Court intervened in the issue following a petition from Daya, an NGO. The animal is being tended to on daily basis by Forest Department officials attached to the Idamalayar Forest Range office. The elephant which is unable to forage is being fed with fruits and palm fronds which it readily accepts from the forest officials.
Chief Wildlife Warden, G. Harikumar, told The Hindu that preliminary diagnosis of the elephant showed that it has a serious injury in its left foreleg. The leg is badly swollen and it is limping heavily. He said that it is not clear why the elephant chose to take refuge in the waters of the reservoir.
But the animal keeps standing in the water most of the time and occasionally comes out of it for short breaks. Mr. Harikumar said that the health condition of the animal has appreciably improved compared to the condition in which it was first found. It has now got used to the forest officials who arrive there regularly to provide food.
The officials have to travel more than one km in a boat from the dam site to reach the location where the elephant stands. Initially on prescription from a veterinary official, some oral medication was administered by concealing it in pineapples given as food to the elephant.
But it was later withdrawn since it was suspected that the animal was allergic to the medicines.
Animal rescue experts said that the elephant standing continuously in water can create other health problems. But rescuing and relocating the elephant from the site where it presently stands will be a herculean task.
The location is such that it will be difficult to bring in cranes or other such equipment. But the Forest Department is doing its best to ensure the well-being of the injured animal, Mr. Harikumar said.
The course of action to be taken will be based on the report to be submitted by the expert committee after its visit on Sunday, he said.
It was Adivasis of the area who first found the elephant in the reservoir.
On noticing that it was injured, they informed the Edamalayar Range Forest officials about it. Adivasis told The Hindu that as they did not see any external injuries, they suspect dislocation or fracture of the affected forelimb.

Hit-and-run case: Salman Khan was in driver’s seat, say eyewitnesses
","Three key eyewitnesses on Tuesday told a sessions court that they saw actor Salman Khan getting down from the driver’s seat of an SUV, 12 years after it ran over a group of people in Bandra. One person was killed and four others were injured in the >accident on the night of September 28, 2002.
The eyewitnesses — Mannu Khan, Mohammed Kalim Iqbal Pathan and Muslim Shaikh — were among those injured. They were all workers of the American Bakery outside which the accident took place.
Khan was present in court. Even while the actor’s lawyers have argued for more than a decade that he was not at the wheel, the witnesses said they saw Khan getting out from the driver’s side of the Toyota Land Cruiser a little after 2 a.m. on September 28.
While one witness said he saw the actor getting down from the front door on the right hand side, the other said he had seen Salman getting down from the driver's seat. Another witness said the actor had got down from the vehicle but did not remember from which side he got down.
At the end of the proceedings, the Bandra police moved an application to the court saying that Shaikh had received a threat calI. Inspector Rajendra Kane of the Bandra police station said that a case had been registered and the investigation was underway.
“Shaikh told us that he had received two anonymous calls asking him to back away from deposing. The court has directed us to investigate the complaint and submit a report by May 19. We are tracing the caller,” he said.
“We were sleeping and there was a huge noise and a car came over us. Kalim, Muslim, Nurullah and I were beneath the car. I started screaming for help. Many people came there. Somehow they pushed the car and rescued us. I had an injury on my right hand. People were saying ‘Salman come out’. Salman Khan got down from the driver's side…The bakery people caught Salman. Salman was so drunk that he fell down, then he got up and ran away,” said Mannu Khan.
Through the day-long proceedings, Khan dressed in a white shirt and jeans sporting a French beard, sat in the accused box at the end of the court room following the trial.
Flanked by his sisters Alvira and Arpita, Salman was seen dozing off.
A 22-year-old fan from Pune who said she has been attending all the proceedings made the journey to Mumbai.
If convicted, the actor faces imprisonment of up to 10 years in jail. In 1998, Khan spent a few days in prison for killing blackbuck deer, an endangered species, in Rajasthan.
In the accident, the actor’s SUV allegedly jumped over a footpath where the victims were sleeping. Khan was earlier booked for rash and negligent driving. But later, the court observed that he could be charged with culpable homicide not amounting to murder.
He then moved an application for fresh examination of witnesses on the grounds that the witnesses were previously examined for lesser charges against him. His application was granted by the court and a re-trial was ordered.
So far, four witnesses have deposed in the >re-trial. One among them is a panch witness and the other three are eye witnesses. The prosecution led by Jagannath Kenjralkar will examine other three witnesses on May 19.

Six-laning of Bangalore-Mysore highway not the solution: MGP
",": The Mysore Grahakara Parishat (MGP) has said the State government’s decision to convert the Bangalore-Mysore highway into a six-lane road may not be a solution to reduce the commuting time, and the need of the hour was flyovers at critical junctions.
It also called for straightening the existing highway which has too many curves. In a release, R. Chandra Prakash, president, MGP, said the proposed move to upgrade the Bangalore-Mysore highway to a six-lane road reflects its “typical ostrich-like approach to important issues”.
“But it is obvious from this proposal that the government is oblivious to the problems of this highway. How will the public benefit by such upgrades when the problems have not been understood?” Mr. Prakash said. He said the road was widened from two to four lane a few years ago, but that has not decreased the travel time between the two cities and on occasions the time taken is longer than what it used to be prior to four-laning of the road.
The MGP has said that every bypass along the highway has been encroached by commercial establishments which forces vehicles to slow down.
“The examples are Maddur, Channapatana, Ramnagaram, Bidadi, and Kengeri. There are more than 70 speed bumps between the two cities. If the bumps are necessary, they should have been at junctions of cross roads to prevent sudden entry of vehicles onto the highway. Congestion at the entry points of Bangalore, starting from Nayandanahalli and at BHEL factory, adds to the delay,” said the release. Mr. Prakash said inadequacy of trains on the Bangalore-Mysore route compared to the demand has increased the number of buses plying between the two cities, which has added to the problem.
Further, Mr. Prakash said, instances of blocking the highway adds to the delay. Hence, widening the road will not resolve any of the problems.
Hence, the MGP has suggested flyovers at all those bypass roads. It has cited the examples of flyovers enroute to the Bangalore airport and said this has helped in smooth flow of traffic.

Smooth out rough edges
","She was crowned Miss India in 1972, walked the ramp with the likes of Meher Castellino, Persis Khambatta and Phyllis Mendes before she went on to create a successful career for herself as a fashion choreographer and then a grooming expert. Today as her three sons – Siddharth, Aditya and Kunal Roy Kapoor – take over tinsel town, Salome Roy Kapoor continues to be a force to reckon with. What else could explain the demand for her skills as a grooming expert at finishing and fashion institutes across the country.
In the city for the launch of designer James Ferreira’s fashion institute, Salome Roy Kapoor is looking forward to lending her expertise as faculty member at the design school.
Incidentally, Salome is the one who gave James his first assignment as a designer in the fashion industry over 40 years ago.

 An ill groomed individual can wear the most expensive outfit and make it look like a rag. How one carries oneself matters 
Ever since, the two have shared a wonderful professional rapport and it was only natural for James to ask her to come on board when he launched his own institute. “When James asked me to come on board as the grooming expert, there was no way I could refuse. When he called up and told me about what he had planned, it sounded very exciting and here I am,” she says.
Salome, who conducts grooming and etiquette workshops across the country, will have her hands full with teaching at the Deccan Institute of Design. “I’m slated to come to the city four times a year to conduct my classes. That is our initial plan. So it should be quite doable,” says the expert whose course module is usually a mix of dance, drama, personalised grooming and fitness tips.
“It is important to groom oneself from the inside as well as from the outside. For instance, an ill groomed individual can wear the most expensive outfit and make it look like a rag. How one carries oneself matters. Another thing that I will cover during my course here will be etiquette. Things like conversations dos and don’ts, voice modulation, diet and exercise as well,” she explains.
Ask her why it is so important to groom oneself and she says, “It is important because it makes the over all character of a person. It smoothes out the rough edges and makes one more prepared to face a career and society in general.”
The trend of going to a grooming school has always been there but the awareness levels have increased of late, says Salome.
She adds that grooming is for everybody and not just folks in the fashion industry. “I have everyone from teenagers to housewives and working professionals come to me for grooming tips. It deals with different aspects like diet, exercise, conversation skills and analysing one’s positives and negatives. It is important to be able to judge oneself and highlight one’s positives and play down the negatives.”

Coimbatore Corporation reschedules water supply
","From once in two days the Coimbatore Corporation has decreased the Siruvani water supply to once in four days. But, the duration of supply of four hours continues.
The Corporation is forced to decrease the supply to meet the summer demand, sources say and add that at this rate it will be able to extend the supply till the first week of June this year.
As on Friday, the Corporation received 62 million litres a day (MLD) as against the full supply of 87 MLD from the Tamil Nadu Water Supply and Drainage Board. The Siruvani Reservoir has 8.75 feet water.
The Siruvani water reaches 28 of the 100 wards in the city.
As for the supply from the Pilloor I and Pilloor II schemes goes, the Corporation receives 48.27 MLD and 86.43 MLD respectively. In the Aliyar supply again there is a dip as against the designed quantity of 7.5 MLD, the Corporation received only 4.5 MLD.
The sources say that where there is deficiency in water supply, the Corporation is diverting Pilloor water. In Thudiyalur in the North Zone, the supply has improved from once in 10 days to once in five days because it had recently linked the Bhavani water supply pipeline with the Pilloor pipeline for diversion of water as work was in progress.
The supply will further improve once the Tamil Nadu Water Supply and Drainage Board has completed the water supply augmentation there and is likely to open the pipeline for supply in the next few days.
Meanwhile, TWAD Board sources say that through the Coimbatore Corporation it has referred to the Tamil Nadu Government the Kerala Government’s request for sealing an exit pipeline that is below the dead storage level. The Kerala Government has been keen on sealing the pipeline alleging that more water was flowing through the pipeline and that it need the water for environment conservation to meet animals’ drinking water needs.
Last year, too, a similar situation arose but it was solved at the secretary-level talks the two Governments held.

Rationalists oppose, NIMHANS concurs
","Agreeing to the objections raised by Mangalore-based Federation of Indian Rationalist Associations, Bangalore-based NIMHANS has cancelled a scheduled event on its premises.
In an open letter to NIMHANS Director, P. Satishchandra, copies of which were released to the press, president of the Federation Narendra Nayak had objected to renting out the NIMHANS convention centre for holistic karma healing planned for May 11. Acting quickly, Mr. Satishchandra has cancelled the event.
Mr. Nayak had asked whether karmic influences have any role in neurological disorders and said the NIMHANS Convention Centre has been rented out to an activity which goes totally against and in fact denies evidence-based medicine. He had urged the director to reconsider the permission granted pointing out the 2004 judgment of the Supreme Court which stated that unrecognised, not evidence-based so called “therapies” should not be given any sort of recognition or support by the government. NIMHANS being a government-funded body was covered by this definition, he said.
Dr. Satishchandra said he fully agreed with the contention of the rationalist and had called the organisers of the event and offered to refund the entire amount. He said the venue was booked “like a chowlty” (without his prior knowledge). He had acted the moment it was brought to his notice.
It was the philosophy of NIMHANS not to allow such psychological healing on its campus. “We cannot allow such spiritual thing,” he said.

It takes a lot of courage to ask a friend out. Since you’ve rejected him, he’s probably feeling disappointed and embarrassed to talk to you. Don’t over-analyse the situation. Try talking to him normally; if he hesitates to respond, give him some time (days, not hours!) and try again. If you still get the silent treatment, then may be he wasn’t as invested in your friendship as you were. That means it’s time to put the whole thing behind you and move on.

Police rudderless in the case of blasts: Karunanidhi
","In the absence of the Chief Minister in the State capital, the police force “is directionless and unable to act decisively,” DMK president M. Karunanidhi said reacting to the train blasts at the Chennai Central.
In a statement, Mr. Karunanidhi said the police arrested an ISI operative, Zakir Hussain, two days ago. But even if the police were efficient, they could not take precautionary measures in the absence of the Chief Minister from the capital at this critical time and act with precision. This led to the twin blasts on a train.
 “The police are clueless and directionless,” he said. The blasts could have been averted if investigation was carried out properly after the arrest of Zakir Hussain. The police should take action based on inputs on terror plots from the intelligence wing.  Quoting media reports, Mr. Karunanidhi said the State was reeling under drought and worsening in law and order situation. The power situation was also bleak, he said wondering if the government was functional.
 DMDK founder and Opposition leader Vijayakant questioned as to what the police were doing to avert the blasts even after warnings from Central intelligence agencies. He also wondered why Chief Minister Jayalalithaa was in Kodanadu when the State was facing crisis on multiple fronts.

","An alleged IPL cricket betting syndicate was busted in Outer Delhi’s Rohini area with the arrest of four men including the kingpin of the gang who is a mechanical engineer, police said on Saturday.
The accused, identified as Rakesh Sethi (45), Bantu Nagpal (33), Sanjay Hasija (32) and Vishu Sethi (22) were arrested from a house by the Crime Branch during its crackdown against betting syndicates operating during the ongoing IPL season.
“We have recovered 40 mobile phones, one TV set, a mobile signal booster, one laptop, printer, voice recorder along with notebooks for entering the bets from the accused,” said Joint Commissioner of Police (Crime) Ravindra Yadav.
An information was received by police that there will be betting on IPL cricket league match to be played between Sunrisers Hyderabad and Mumbai Indians on Wednesday. It was also learnt that the racketeers also provides betting lines to other bookies.
“On a tip off that a betting racket is being run from H.No. 86, Green Hill Apartment, Pocket-1, Sec-23 in Rohini an immediate raid was conducted after fulfilling necessary legal formalities and the four persons were nabbed,” said Mr. Yadav.
It was learnt that accused Rakesh Sethi is a Mechanical Engineer. The accused were accepting bets in person as well as through mobile phones. They were also providing lines to several other bookies. Three mobiles phones were being used to broadcast rates to the bookies, police said.
“The betting amount in the match till the time of the raid was Rs. 25 lakh approximately and the gang has so far accepted betting amount to the tune (of Rs.) 1 crore in the ongoing IPL season. On integration, the accused persons disclosed that they used to put bets on cricket matches. Subsequently, they decided to work as bookies as well as to provide betting lines to small bookies,” said Mr. Yadav.
The accused were earlier operating from Sonipat, Haryana but local police was suspicious about their activities so they decided to shift to Rohini area to run their operations in rented premises so that their activities remain unnoticed in a new locality.

The selfies of the book biz
","We were sceptical at first. “But won’t you miss the smell of old books or the joy of pressing pretty flowers between the pages of your favourite novel?” we asked. As Gulzar writes in one poem, what of asking for books, dropping them or picking them up as excuses for forging relationships with complete strangers? (“
magar woh jo kitabon mein milaa karte thay sookhay phool, kitabein maangne, giraanay, uthaane kay bahaane rishtey bante thay, unkaa kyaa hogaa, wo shayad ab nahi hongey). “How will we write profound love notes and advice on books we give as gifts?”
The pragmatists gave us their reasons. “Technology is the way forward; think of all the space you will be saving at home/office.” How unromantic, real estate as the trade off for books.
Slowly, however, reasons for embracing e-readers like Amazon’s Kindle are emerging. “Think of all the trees we can save,” they say. True. And here’s another compelling one: for the sake of discovering interesting writers who are publishing exclusively on these e-readers. There is a quiet revolution apparently and we may lose out on reading some good books if we don’t catch up now, we hear.
Ok, here’s a compromise. How about, we keep our libraries and book shelves filled with novels, poetry, memoirs and magazines, while also peeking at these new-age e-readers every once in a while, to read what emerges in the future?
And here are four of Amazon India’s biggest successes explaining to the reader, why they chose to self-publish through Kindle Direct Publishing.

Sri Vishwanath

Ranked among the 50 most popular authors in the “Mind Body and Spirit” section by Amazon USA consistently for the last year and with over a quarter million books downloaded in the last 14 months on Amazon Kindle, Sri Vishwanath is among the best examples of Kindle Direct Publishing platform’s success in India. The 42-year-old cost accountant and company secretary, born and brought up in Mumbai, lived and worked in the United States. At 33, he came back to Mumbai leaving a job in the United States to venture into book writing.
“I had no clue about the book industry yet was very keen to get to the top tier in the spiritual/transformational book league,” he says. Vishwanath has written 13 books in the last seven years. Of the 13 books, titles such as Give Up Your Excess Baggage: 24 Simple Mind Exercises That Great Men & Women Effectively Use Every Single Day, The Power of Visualization - Meditation Secrets That Matter the Most, Seven Common Signs of A Spiritual Awakening have seen great response. His latest book is titled Stolen Idol.
“I have had over 500 reviews combined for my books in Amazon USA. So the response has been phenomenal,” says Vishwanath. “Like everyone else I went through traditional publishers initially but simultaneously also explored the self-publishing route. I kept writing books got close to securing big deals with a New York publisher but for some reason or the other the deal would not come through in the end. Eight years later, after completing 13 transformational titles I uploaded all my books on Amazon Kindle two years back. And readers in United States, UK and other countries loved it,” says a proud Vishwanath.
Ask him why he chose Kindle and pat comes the answer: “They have the simplest system for self-publishing. You can upload your book in less than five minutes if you have all the details and it gets published in less than 12 hours. They have got internal traffic as millions of Kindle users search for books.”
Vishwanath has even helped his son Vignesh publish on the platform. “He is 13 years old and wanted to publish a book. He had collected quotes of Vivekananda, Ramana Maharishi and others. He put it all together and we put it up on kindle. I never did any promotion other than helping with the title. He has sold over 600 books which is great,” he says.

Parvathi Ramkumar

Parvathi is a full time writer, professional book critic and now author of a fantasy novel The Grove of the Sun. “Writing, especially imaginative fiction, has always been a passion for me since I was a little girl,” she says. Born in Thiruvananthapuram, she began school in Los Angeles and has since then lived in Cochin, Hyderabad, Jaipur and Bangalore. The Bangalore-based author is also the granddaughter of noted Malayalam litterateur V. Madhavan Nair (Mali).
“My book, The Grove of the Sun, is a standalone high fantasy novel, unique in its setting and approach. It has Indian elements that are not drawn from mythology. It is about Order and Chaos in the whimsical land of Chimera, and one man’s discovery that all that he’s believed about his homeland may not be the truth after all,” says Parvathi. It took her over seven years to research, write and edit The Grove of the Sun.
“Fantasy, especially one that is not based on mythology, is relatively new in India,” she explains. Since the genre is new to India and the response of traditional publishers was lukewarm, Parvathi decided to go with KDP. “The Kindle store has worldwide reach. It gave me an opportunity to present my book to an international audience with a single upload. The book is available in India, the US and UK, Australia, Canada, and many more countries. There are also no extra costs nor any middlemen involved, and as a whole, it is a quick and attractive way to market my writing,” she adds.
About the response to the book Parvathi says, “It’s been pretty good so far. I’ve had interviews and great reviews in newspapers and magazines, as well as blogs, from readers and critics in India and abroad.”

Rasana Atreya

Rasana Atreya, who holds a Masters in Computer Engineering, worked in IT for a few years until the yearning to be a writer got too strong to ignore. “I started off with technical writing and later moved on to freelancing for newspapers,” she says.
“My first book is about superstition, our (Indian) obsession with the colour of one's skin, and the power of manipulation. This novel came about because Indian television is overrun with advertisements from manufacturers of fairness creams that promise everything from good grades to nirvana, if only you use their particular brand of product. This annoyed me enough to I wrote out a tagline - 

Fairness Creams: Finding Solutions to Life's Vexing Problems, One Application at a Time. Then I proceeded to write a novel around it. I worked on it for three years,” she says. The manuscript of her book Tell a Thousand Lies was also shortlisted for an award.
“I chanced upon the Tibor Jones South Asia award in 2012. This award was unusual in that they were asking for unpublished manuscripts. Getting shortlisted for this prize by Amit Chaudhuri and Urvashi Butalia did wonders for my self-confidence. I'd also been watching self-publishing stars Amanda Hawking and Joe Konrath,” she adds. Rasana wanted to self-publish but was quite nervous about it. “Around that time I was also offered a publishing contract by a publishing house. Ironically enough, it was these two things (the award and contract) that gave me the confidence to strike out on my own.”
She chose to self publish because, she says, many, authors - mid-list writers, not necessarily superstars - are making a living solely off of Amazon. “And their 70 per cent royalties don't hurt,” she adds. And her book has been received very well by readers, she insists. “It was much more than I'd hoped or expected. I've received fan mail from places as varied as Mexico and Pakistan. I've had people request me to ramp up my writing speed because they can't wait for my next novel. My book has been well reviewed on Amazon and Goodreads with a combined 300 reviews on these sites.” 
“Since my book has been doing consistently well, the Jaipur and Hyderabad Literary festivals invited me to be part of their panels in 2013,” she adds. Rasana, who has also helped her daughter self-publish,
explains that the beauty of self-publishing lies in the fact that you can track your sales by the hour. You can tell exactly how many people have bought your book, and from which country. You can also track exactly how much royalties you've earned each month.” On some months she has also sold more than 1,000 books online.

Ajay Jain

Ajay Jain is a full-time writer, journalist and photographer based in Delhi. He has written travel books like Peep Peep Don’t Sleep, and other titles such as Super Brand You.
“I initially published on KDP as that was the only major e-publishing platform. More importantly, Amazon ensured there were no barriers from day one. You could be an author, an independent or a big publisher, and you could be anywhere in the world - it allowed you to upload and list the book without any fuss. You could even decide your own pricing. Even after all these years, KDP remains an easy to publish platform,” he explains.
Ajay also enlists the fact that despite e-reading catching on fast, Kindle continues to remain a popular e-reading device/app. “I am also able to tap into an international audience, set prices in multiple currencies and also vary the same according to the purchasing power of various markets,” he explains, “In a nutshell, the distribution and simplicity of the platform ensures there are minimum barriers for publishers, authors and readers to come together.”
Ajay says that the response has been terrific to his books. “I was pleasantly surprised to see a deep penetration in the Indian market,” he says.

Social activist Suraiya Bose presented Yudhvir award
","Noted social activist Suraiya Hassan Bose, who worked for the revival of the Deccan handloom industry and the welfare of weavers, was presented the 23 Yudhvir Memorial Award by The Yudhvir Foundation.
At a function organised in this regard on Thursday, where she was felicitated, distinguished guests recollected Ms. Bose’s rich contribution to the handloom industry. Accepting the award, the activist said she intended to revive the khadi industry in various parts of the State.
On the occasion, a lecture was delivered by Padma Shri award winner and social activist Bilkees Latif on Our People...Tragedy and Triumph. She expressed concern that there were no values in today’s politics as a large amount of money was being used to bribe voters. Something had to be done to bring about a change in the present form of politics, she said.
Focusing on various issues plaguing the country, she said, “16 lakh children died of starvation last year in the country and about three lakh newborns die annually due to malnutrition. These figures are decreasing when compared to previous years but even then the issue is serious.”
Talking about her work in Dharavi slums and other tribal and Dalit areas in Maharashtra, she said the role of NGOs was very crucial in creating awareness and also in keeping a check on the irregularities in government schemes.

Care to take a stand?
","
It’s Never too Late, Priyanka Baranwal’s debut novel, talks about how we live deluded lives — lives where we think we are safe, where we believe nothing bad can happen to us.

The plot thickens

The story revolves around Maya, whose picture-perfect life is cruelly destroyed by two insensitive delinquents. She married Rajat, the love of her life, and watched their beautiful bundle of joy, Sejal, grow. They were happy in their little bubble, until that horrific night.
Will Maya have the strength to fight her fate? Will she be able to save her five-year-old and herself in Rajat’s absence? Will she be able to break stereotypes and face the male-dominated society after that fateful night? Will Rajat stand up with her as she decides to battle her fears and ensure the culprits are severely punished?
In a nation where women are taught to be submissive at every stage, where a woman is repeatedly told that she needs a man to protect her, where she is forced to stay closeted from the rest of the world, Maya stands out. In a society that faults women for heinous crimes like rape, Maya stands up.
The story starts by portraying the relationship between Maya and Rajat, one of love and respect for each other, in simple, yet captivating language. All too soon, there’s a twist in the tale and the book is hard to put down till one knows the outcome.
Maya is an inspiration to readers with her strength in the face of adversity, smart thinking, courage and the will to go on. What struck me as novel was the series of facts at the end about rape in India. It may seem morbid but it’s the sad state of affairs in the country.
I believe the plot has been written with the intention of making a difference — not just in the lives of women, but everyone, the central theme being to face our fears, emerge victorious over them by never giving up, to keep trying no matter how desolate the future may seem. Fate won’t ever give you something you can’t handle.

Bomb hoaxes at Central station, private hospital
","In the aftermath of the twin bomb blasts at Chennai Central Station on May 1, the city is witnessing a spree of bomb hoax calls, causing great anxiety.
On Thursday, Chennai Central Station and a private hospital were the latest ‘targets.’
A senior official of the Government Railway Police said their helpline received a call around 10 a.m. about a bomb in Central station.
The bomb disposal squads of the Railway Protection Force (RPF) and Chennai Police were alerted.
After searching the entire station and finding nothing, security officials concluded that the call was a hoax.
“After analysing call details, it was found that the caller is a resident of Bangalore, who is involved in petty crimes, and uses several SIM cards to avoid detection,” he added.
An RPF official said that two sniffer dogs and 12 persons were pressed into service to conduct checks at the station.
Similarly, a person called the police control room and alleged that a bomb had been planted in a private hospital in T. Nagar.
A squad was sent to inspect the hospital, but it found nothing of significance.
A senior police official warned that stern action would be taken against those who make such hoax calls that disrupt daily life and cause panic.

Auto drivers demand water point, loo at stands
","Though the recent fare hike has alleviated their financial concerns, autorickshaw drivers said problems of parking spots, scholarships for their children and life insurance coverage still remain.
At the annual meet of Dakshina Kannada Zilla Autorickshaw Chalakara Sangha (ARCS) at Town Hall here on Tuesday, Alphonse D’Souza, president of the association, said the district administration should establish autorickshaw parks with basic amenities in the city.
Out of the 320 points where autorickshaws stand, the district administration had only recognised 140, he said. “None of the autorickshaw stands have lavatory facilities or drinking water facilities. This is a problem for both drivers and passengers,” Mr. D’Souza said, and added that the organisation demanded facilities be developed at 50 autorickshaw parks. Insurance — both as government schemes and from the Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) — remains a concern for the autorickshaw drivers. Mr. D’Souza said enrolment into the State government’s accident relief scheme had been stopped due to technical faults at Nemmadi Kendra.
Similarly, though the organisation had more than 1,000 members, only 410 members have insurance from LIC, said Subhash Kavoor, secretary of ARCS. “The government should enrol more drivers under the LIC’s Aam Aadmi Yojana,” he said.
Another major demand presented at the meet was an increase in scholarships given through LIC for the children of autorickshaw drivers. At present, children get Rs. 1,200 per year between class 9 and till the completion of pre-university college as scholarship. “LIC has limited the scholarships to just 15 per cent of the applications received. Until three years, it was 100 per cent,” said Prakash V.N, the general secretary of ARCS.
The association also sought a drive against those illegally plying in the city; regulating those who rent out autorickshaws to drivers for high rent; and supply of uniforms at a concession.

Lax security at City railway station a cause of concern
","Even though security has been tightened at the Bangalore City Railway Station in the wake of the twin blasts onboard the Bangalore-Guwahati Express on Thursday, much of the security apparatus at the railway station remains defunct.
All the three door-frame metal detectors at the entrance of the railway station are not functioning. The Railway Protection Force (RPF) personnel posted at the entrance have been given hand-held metal detectors to scan passengers and luggage. A senior official pointed out that the railway station is not equipped with baggage and vehicle scanners.
The hand-held metal detectors beeps at almost everyone passing by with a key bunch, said a security personnel, adding that “It is impossible for us to physically scan everybody especially during peak hours.”
Besides, of the 100 CCTV cameras installed under the Integrated Security System, only 40 are operational and the rest are yet to be connected to the control room.
So lax is the security at the railway station that a few months ago, the information display monitors were stolen. Though the CCTV camera footage showed a man stealing the display units, he could not be identified due to bad quality of images, according to a senior police officer.
Now, post-Chennai blast on the Bangalore-Guwahati Express train, at least 15 unauthorised entry points to the City Railway Station is a cause of concern. A senior officer of the Government Railway Police (GRP) said it is impossible to provide foolproof security to the Bangalore City Railway Station spread across a radius 2.5 kilometres with over 20 entry and exit points.
Apart from the two authorised main entrance and exit gates, people can walk into the station from various points that are unguarded. “Providing security cover at these points is impossible unless the Railway authorities put up at least a 10 ft. compound wall with barbed wire to prevent unauthorised entry,” he said.
Senior Divisional Security Commissioner, Railway Protection Force (RPF), S. Louis Amuthan said that there was staff shortage, and that they are managing the show by cancelling leaves granted to personnel and seeking reinforcement during emergencies.
The GRP and RPF have been complaining of staff shortage. “There are 10 platforms in the City Railway Station and even if one constable is deputed on each platform, we may need at least 20 personnel for the round-the-clock security,” the official said.
The 20-member GRP staff is not only expected to provide security at the entry and exit points, but also provide security on moving trains. A senior police officer of the GRP said 60 per cent of the posts in the department are vacant and that they have written to the authorities about it.

Student who stabbed teacher sent to home
","A student, who stabbed his teacher in a classroom of a school in Parry’s Corner in February 2012, was ordered to be sent to a special home in Chengalpattu by the Juvenile Justice Board on Wednesday.
The family of the victim, R. Uma Maheswari (39), which was in the Juvenile court premises, said their intention was not to have the child punished, but wanted him to change. The boy, who was then 15 years old, had stabbed his teacher because she had reportedly reprimanded him for not doing well in studies.
Uma Maheswari was teaching science and Hindi for close to a decade at the school. On February 9, around 10.50 a.m., she was sitting in the first floor room for the class IXA Hindi class, when the boy attacked her. She was taken to a nearby private hospital, which referred her to Government General Hospital. But she died on the way. The boy was sent to the juvenile home where he was held for 40 days. After that, he was let out on bail.
On Wednesday, he along with his parents arrived at the Juvenile Justice Board in Kellys around 11 p.m. A three-member board, comprising Judge Lakshmi Ramesh, and members Girija Kumarababu and Selvi Isabel, heard the case. The board’s order read: “Therefore, having regard to the nature of offence committed and the circumstances of the case, this board feels it expedient to make an order directing him to be sent to the special home for the period of two years.” Further, it said that allowing him to participate in group counselling, perform community service, or imposing a fine on the parents would not serve his interest, or change his attitude, nature or behavioural patterns.
The board said that, considering his age and conduct, the juvenile be housed in a special security government special home. However, as there is no such home, the board addressed the government to establish such a facility with adequate infrastructure and staff.
It also directed the authorities to ensure that he received necessary psychological support and completed his class XII studies with French as a subject. He is also entitled to go on leave and will be engaged in yoga, meditation and repeated counselling.
Later, the Judge and members told the boy that it was a rehabilitation measure. “You cannot change what has happened, but you can direct your future. Hence, use the time to reflect and decide what to do in the future,” said one of the members.
C.V. Ravishankar, the victim’s husband, said he was not keen on seeing the boy punished. “He has to realise his mistake and change,” he said.
Amritham, Uma Maheshwari’s mother, said that the boy would have committed the crime unknowingly. “I wish and pray for his welfare too,” she said.
Assistant public prosecutor S. Dhiraviaraj, who appeared for the government, said the boy had been sent to the special home in Chengalpattu on Wednesday.

SUVs, posh villas, pricey plots purchased from NSEL funds: Enforcement Directorate
","High-end vehicles, posh villas and flats, expensive plots, shares in beach-side hotels and vast tracts of agricultural land are some of the purchases made by the accused of the multi-crore payment scam in National Spot Exchange Limited (NSEL) through money laundering.
The trail of money that went into the alleged illegal purchase of these assets from genuine NSEL funds has been investigated by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) which has been probing the Rs. 5,600-crore payment crisis in the bourse that got public last year after investors claimed they were cheated.
An investigation report of the agency submitted in the court has identified the modus operandi deployed by a firm — Mohan India Pvt. Ltd. — and its subsidiary units in “laundering” the funds of the stock exchange.
“Generally, layering is the process through which the laundered money is channelised for its ultimate integration into the system.
“In this case, it is evident from the evidence gathered so far that the defendants (Mohan India and others) have attempted to layer the proceeds of crime generated through their criminal activities in various manner like purchase of high-end vehicles like Range Rovers, luxurious villa for their use which have no relation with their legitimate business activities,” the ED report accessed by PTI reads.
The ED, a few months ago, had attached assets worth Rs. 125 crore in the name of the firm and its other business associates under the provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA).
The Central probe agency has identified these assets to be the “proceeds of crime”.
Mohan India Pvt. Ltd. is one of the large defaulters of the scam with initial liability of Rs. 922 crore and according to latest data it owes Rs. 600.08 crore, of which it has paid Rs. 52.85 crore to the exchange.
The ED probe found that while Mohan India group of companies had “received funds in their settlement accounts from NSEL purportedly on account of sale of sugar..., they were eventually transferred to various individuals and entities and payments were made to car dealers, developers, construction firms etc by way of transfers, NEFT/RTGS payments/pay orders.”
The agency, in a voluminous report, has furnished the documentary proof of the movement of all this money sourced from NSEL to the end purchase of real estate or cars by tracking bank transactions spread across various parts of the country.
“Investigations under the PMLA have revealed that the defendants (Mohan India Pvt Ltd and others) were dealing in sale and re-purchase of sugar without having any physical stock of sugar. They had received funds from NSEL on account of sale of sugar which they have not delivered to NSEL at all.
There was no question of NSEL allowing them to invest these funds in real estate,” the probe report said.
The agency has also recorded a number of statements of the officials of the NSEL and Mohan India Pvt. Ltd. under PMLA before preparing and submitting the first investigation report in this case to the court.
The ED said it attached luxury vehicles like a Toyota Fortuner, three Range Rovers, flats in Gomti Enclave in Lucknow, eight plots of land in Karnal in Haryana, a posh flat in Mumbai’s Borivali, plots in costly addresses like Mehrauli, Hauz Khas, Jor Bagh and Sainik Farms in Delhi and other such assets as “there was a likelihood of immediate sale or disposal of such high-end vehicles and luxurious properties (by the firm in question) and the non-attachment of the same would have frustrated the proceedings under the Act (PMLA).”
“It was revealed that funds obtained from NSEL were diverted for the purposes other than the purpose for which they were obtained raising the suspicion that the said amounts were laundered by MS Mohan India group,” the ED said in its report.
The agency has also relied on a report of the I-T department against the firm that said that the “godowns which were declared to NSEL (by the firm) as designated warehouse had no capacity to store the quantity of sugar traded by them (Mohan India and others) on the NSEL platform.”
The ED has said that its probe in this case is “still in infancy at this stage” and further investigation is on.
The Rs. 5,600-crore payment crisis at NSEL and the alleged scam is being probed by different agencies like the Mumbai Economic Offences Wing and the Income Tax department.

Indian FB users end up hacking own accounts
","Some Facebook users in India were tricked into hacking their own accounts by a scam claiming to reveal the passwords of their friends.
The scam compromised the user’s account by tricking them into using some code that takes control of their account and exposes their friends’ data in the process.
“What really happens when you paste this code into your browser console window is that a series of actions are performed using your Facebook account without your knowledge.
“Behind the scenes, your account is used to follow lists and users, and give likes to pages in order to inflate the follower and like counts defined by the scammers,” explained Satnam Narang, a security response manager for Symantec in a blog post.
The scam employs an instructional video explaining “Facebook Hacking”, which links to a Google document that contains some code.
The code allows users to see friends’ Facebook passwords, according to the scammers, with the instructions attempting to convince users to paste the code into their browser console window. The instructions explain that the code will take two hours to work.
In reality, the code performs actions behind the scenes using the would-be hacker’s Facebook account, including following certain users and liking pages. No doubt the scammers are being paid to artificially inflate the follower or like counts of some users and pages.

Mum’s the word
","After the cultural extravaganza in my college, I was almost ready to face the forthcoming unit tests. I had to carry my ID card to write them. On my way to college, I realised that I had not kept my ID card in its regular spot in my bag. I panicked thinking it was in my other bag. Hoping against hope, I reached over to the normally empty side pocket. And lo! There lay my ID card. I knew my mother had kept it there. I had, as usual, thrown it on the table.
That evening, when I came home, I gave my mother a hug and thanked her. She just complained about my carelessness. But what is life without mothers complaining about our childish behaviour, right? This is my way of saying thanks to my mother for her love and tolerance towards my carelessness.

Police blame NHAI for increase in accidents
","The Tumkur district police have blamed the National Highways Authority of India for the increase in the number of accidents on national highways in the district as they say the NHAI has failed to provide the required infrastructure.
The police have identified 71 “black spots” on the three national highways passing through the district (36 “black spots” on the Bangalore-Pune National Highway; 29 on the Bangalore-Shimoga National Highway; and six on the Bangalore-Mangalore National Highway).
According to the police, in the last three years 1,469 people have been killed and 6,304 people injured in 5,844 accidents in the district.

Fatal accidentsIn 2011, 107 fatal accidents took place on Bangalore-Pune National Highway, 67 on Bangalore-Shimoga National Highway and 37 on Bangalore-Mangalore National Highway. While in 2012, the figures were 92, 71 and 45, in 2013, they were 106, 84 and 40 on these national highways, respectively.
According to the police, the NHAI has not not provided signboards to warn commuters. Even speed bumps and blinkers have not been provided.
Further, the police said, appropriate steps had not been taken at intersections and near village approach roads.
At many places, people walk across the highway as there are no underpasses or footbridges, leading to accidents, sources in the police said.
Referring to an accident that took place near Heggare on April 20 when a motorist died on the spot after colliding with a KSRTC bus, Additional Superintendent of Police R. Lakshman, told The Hindu,
“We registered a case against the engineer of the NHAI on April 20 for failing to take action to prevent accidents near Heggare on Bangalore-Mangalore National Highway.”
In January 2014, a meeting of the police and officials of the NHAI was held in which they were told to provide the required infrastructure.
Mr. Lakshman said that though they had promised to take action within a month, nothing had surfaced.
Assistant Executive Engineer of Bangalore-Shimoga National Highway Benjamin Samuel said that “if we lay speed bumps on this national highway, it will cause inconvenience to long-distance commuters and hence, we have to see the points and then take a decision on it.”
He said that signboards at some points had been put up and if additional signboards were required, which would be provided shortly.
Mr. Samuel said he was not aware of the police having registered a case against the NHAI officer. He said that he would speak with the officer about the issue.
An official from the NHAI told The Hindu, “Every day people of nearby villages open the median to cross the road, making it difficult to keep a watch and close it immediately.”
He said that they had responded to the Police Department and the remaining work would be completed shortly.

ATM robbery foiled, suspect flees
","In a daring attempt to rob an Automated Teller Machine (ATM), a young man used explosives to try to blow up the machine in Tiruporur, about 35 kilometres from the city, on Old Mamallapuram Road, past midnight on Saturday.
A police inspector attached to the Bomb Detection and Disposal Squad was injured while attempting to defuse an explosive left behind by the suspect. Kancheepuram district police sources said the suspect reached the ATM belonging to State Bank of Mysore, functioning from a private building, on a motorcycle, a little past 12.30 a.m.
Investigating policemen attached to the Tiruporur police station, who have picked up some clues, said the suspect, wearing denim jeans and a T-shirt, had masked his face with a plastic bag. He tied explosives around the cash vault and triggered it to explode. However, he was unable to break open the cash box.
After a resident, who was woken up by the sound of the explosion, came to the spot, the suspect sped away on a motorcycle. On receiving information, policemen reached the ATM and recovered a live explosive device, left behind by the suspect.
In the morning, bank officials came to the ATM and confirmed that there was no damage to the cash box or loss of money. On Sunday, they had placed a large amount of cash in the vault.
C.Vijayakumar, Superintendent of Police, Kancheepuram, said that inspector Swaminathan sustained minor injuries on his hands while attempting to defuse the low-intensity explosive that was made with petroleum jelly. The culprit had used some small voltage capacity batteries to ignite the explosive material – called `flurry’ – normally used to trigger low-intensity blasts in mines.

Palk Strait sees its first Kayak crossing since 1935
","The Palk Strait witnessed its first Kayak crossing since 1935 and Sandra Helen Robson, an Australian sea kayaker became the first woman to paddle across.
The 46-year-old Robson, who was kayaking from Germany to Australia, became the first woman kayaker to paddle across the Palk Strait on Thursday evening after circumnavigating Sri Lanka as part of her expedition, which began in 2011.
“I am pretty happy that I became the first kayaker to paddle across the Palk Strait after German canoeist Oskar Speck had achieved the feat in 1935,” she told reporters after touching the shore at 4.15 p.m. here.
She left Talaimannar at 6. 45 a.m. and touched the shore at 4.15 p.m., paddling for nearly nine hours. She was escorted up to the International Maritime Boundary Line (IMBL) by Lankan Navy and from there by the personnel of Mandapam Station of Indian Coast Guard, she said.
Retracing Speck’s journey from Germany to Australia (1932-1939), she began her solo kayaking from Ulm in Germany in May 2011. Last year she arrived in Mandapam from Gujarat after paddling her way in the western coasts and reached Vedaranyam.
Ms. Robson took a break at Vedaranyam to paddle around Sri Lanka, but had to wait for three weeks in Chennai for getting permission for paddling from Danushkodi to Sri Lanka and return. The authorities were too busy with the general elections and there was no sign of permission, she said. As she was running out of time, she flew to Sri Lanka on March 21 to circumnavigate Sri Lankan and cross the Palk Strait to reach Danushkodi. She took 33 days to paddle around the island nation and it was in this expedition, she had the longest paddling of 109 km non-stop, she told The Hindu.
Ms. Robson who had paddled to the southeast coast of India was planning to cover the east coast and the northeast in the third and fourth stages.
“I will set out for 13 months to paddle through Bangladesh, Myanmar, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia,” she said, adding she has planned to end her expedition in Australia in September 2016.
Her mentor had covered about 50,000 km, but she would end up with about 23, 000 km when she reached Australia as she could not paddle in the Middle East and did not get permission to paddle in Pakistan and some parts of India, she said.
Jehan Driver from the team of Quest Expeditions, which sponsored Robson’s journey in India, received her when she reached the shore here.

Lapses make them vulnerable
","A visit to the major railways stations here following the blasts in Chennai on Thursday morning revealed various lapses in the security set-up. Though a number of measures have been initiated by way of deployment of personnel and equipment to prevent terror strikes, the Capital’s stations remain as vulnerable as ever.
At each of the New Delhi railway station’s six entry points — three from Ajmeri Gate side and three from Paharganj side — there is a baggage scanner and a metal detector manned by police personnel. A spot visit from the Ajmeri Gate side revealed that the main baggage scanner at platform number 16 was not functional. When the rush was less, security personnel deployed at the gate were seen letting passengers in without frisking. However, they started frisking them once the crowds grew.
The other baggage scanners were functional, but the security personnel seemed lax in checking passengers. Upon entering the station from Paharganj side, the careless attitude of the personnel was once again on display. They simply sat next to the baggage scanners and metal detectors, two of which were out of order.
While there are six designated entry/exit points to the railway station, there are other points of entry and exit too. Another baffling sight was to see the public walking across the tracks from adjacent areas like Tilak Bridge and Shivaji Bridge. No policeman was seen patrolling these open areas.
When asked, the personnel said that it was a tough job to check thousands of passengers each day.
“Thousands of commuters board trains from the New Delhi railway station each day. How much can we check each person? If we start checking thoroughly, passengers start getting impatient and fight over the delay in boarding their train. If people want better security, they need to co-operate with us,” said a personnel deployed at the New Delhi station platform.
The situation was the same at Hazrat Nizamuddin railway station.
However, security arrangements at Old Delhi railway station were marginally better. The station has four entry and exit points — two from the Chandni Chowk side and two from the Kashmere Gate side. All baggage scanners and metal detectors were functioning. However, the station does not have walls stretching beyond the platforms — as is the case with the New Delhi station too. Anyone can enter the station premises from nearby localities.
“This station is more vulnerable due to its location, as anyone coming from Chandni Chowk, Old Delhi or nearby areas can enter the premises from the adjoining roads. On an average, we discover three bodies on the tracks each day,” said a police officer deployed at the Old Delhi railway station.

Help pouring in, rebuilding homes gets easier this time
","There have been seven fires -- both major and minor -- over the years in Masoodpur village of South Delhi’s Vasant Kunj, including last Friday’s that gutted 700 jhuggis here. But area residents say this is the first time that the response from the government agencies has been so well coordinated and efficient that they can focus on re-building their homes.
“Perhaps lack of an elected government has kept the politicians away and the model code of conduct continues to be in force so the work has been on smoothly without anyone trying to take credit for it,” said a resident.
Anand Bonik, who runs an electrical shop, said there have been no shortcomings in the facilities provided by the Delhi Government after the slum residents lost all their belongings to a fire that engulfed the area after a cylinder exploded in one of the huts. “Food, water, medicines….all facilities have been arranged for us here,” he said.
The government agencies reacted very quickly, said Vasant Kunj resident Rakesh Sapru, who was among the first ones to help jhuggi dwellers on April 25. “The administration has tried its best to work together and even a minor mishap that took place recently was dealt with efficiently. The only time we saw any politicising of the issue was when a representative from a regional party from West Bengal made an appearance here to rally support from the jhuggi dwellers who are mostly Bengali migrants,” he said.
Mr. Sapru’s gardener, Hamid Ali, is a resident of the slum cluster. He was at work when he heard about the fire and so rushed back home. “Now we are all helping each other re-build our homes,” he said.
A survey initiated by NGO Balvikas Dhara has numbered the jhuggi plots over the last week and has helped reach clothes and utensils to each family. “It is really good to see the administration care about the jhuggi dwellers. Previously, we had incidents when they have been termed Bangladeshis and some of them have been randomly picked up and taken to the police station,” said Debender Kumar Baral from the NGO.
On a visit to the site on Thursday morning one saw canvas tents provided by the Sub-Divisional Magistrate’s office and the Delhi Disaster Management Authority sheltering several families from the harsh sun, tankers of the Delhi Jal Board lined up, a tent dedicated to health facilities with a doctor and medicines, a contingent from the Delhi Police and Civil Defence personnel helping people and numerous NGOs and smaller organisations coming forward to help, especially with food.
Bamboo sticks were being erected and tied together to form the outline of their new homes. “Previously, contractors controlled a certain number of jhuggis but this time the area residents will build their own homes,” said Mr. Baral.
The jhuggi dwellers, however, express their dissatisfaction with the ex-gratia amount of Rs.5,000 per family that was sanctioned by Lieutenant-Governor Najeeb Jung.
“Local councillor Omwati has been denied a meeting with Mr. Jung, especially over increasing this amount,” said Mr. Sapru.

Mr. Elango, who was named interim chief executive in August 2012 when the firm’s face Rahul Dhir resigned, cited “personal reasons” for the decision to step down, Cairn said in a statement.
The move came as a surprise as Mr. Elango, under whom Cairn touched 200,000 barrels per day of output from its showpiece Rajasthan oilfields, was widely tipped to become the full-time CEO of the company.

I am no object, do you hear?
","Having had a fairly conservative upbringing in a Tam Brahm, artistically-inclined household – although we lived in the north and later, in cosmopolitan Bangalore – I am rather naive when it comes to picking up inappropriate behaviour. Oddly, my family discussed subjects such as sex and dating quite openly. My siblings and I, however, had no inclination to date or party.
After an all-girls school and college education, I went overseas to study and work. In the decade I spent there, I got accustomed to walking to my car in my swimwear after a swim. I wore western clothes quite comfortably and assumed that the freedom of personal space I enjoyed was a given everywhere. And then I settled in Chennai as the man I married lived here.
My social circle was exclusive and I was frankly tired of being cocooned again. After working for myself for a few years, I decided to find an employer. I liked my work and the routine that went with it. I found the conservative attitudes at my office, amusing though. My work wardrobe comprised only saris and salwars with dupattas for a purpose. I saw it as a way to blend in. In the first two years, I found that my friendliness and cordiality left the men confused. I would smile and wave at the watchman just as I would a colleague or the boss.
When I walked into the lunch room, I would find many roving pairs of eyes following me, checking me out openly in a way that made me question myself. I would furtively check if my kurta was torn or if my bra strap was showing. A lot of men would ping me about work on chat and I would reply efficiently and breezily thinking I was being professional.
The same guys wouldn’t look me in the eye if they passed me at lunch. One time, a senior colleague who always stopped by my workspace for a chat, said, “I don’t ever see you in a sari. Let me know when you wear one.” I mumbled a reply and ran to my cubicle. A few days later, he returned to ask me when I would be in a sari. “You can’t be serious!” was my indignant reply. And to this day, when I do wear a sari to work, I wonder if he thinks it’s for him.
Another senior colleague I respected and admired came crashing down from the pedestal when he pinged to say he wished to speak to me every evening at 8 p.m. and then asked for my number. I froze and changed my chat status to ‘busy’ and discreetly sought help from a couple of young male colleagues. There was a time when I relied on these two to escort me up to the door of the restroom – I was that nervous. I continue to be cordial to him and am relieved that the matter ended there.
Then there was this colleague who seemed to strike a seemingly harmless conversation about work on chat and then suddenly phrases such as “orgasmic delight” found their way into his typed messages. I was no prude but such familiarity assumed a certain comfort level which was absent.
And recently, during the lunch hour, a male colleague made an insolent remark about a young girl’s attire, “Look! She seems to have stepped out of the shower in a towel!”
It fairly summed up the weird mix of people I work with. I have come to realise that for many men, my friendliness and extroverted nature are a sign of “availability”. I am wiser now, I recognise the signs of inappropriateness more quickly but I refuse to change. And for every weirdo out there, I am thankful for the handful of great men in my office who look me in the eye and treat me like a person.

HC deplores police dharna, accepts apology
","Policemen staging a dharna in a court complex is a disturbing trend in society. Those entrusted with the task of enforcing law, themselves were instrumental in breaking law and order.
This is what the Madras High Court has observed in its order on a petition about suo motu contempt against nearly 90 police personnel who staged a dharna on the premises of the District and Sessions Court, Puducherry on December 19, 2008.
However, the First Bench comprising the Acting Chief Justice, Satish K. Agnihotri, and Justice K. K. Sasidharan accepted the unconditional apology tendered by the police personnel and closed the contempt proceedings with a warning that such things should not recur.
Trouble started after a Sub-Inspector of Orleanpet police station, Sreedharan, was denied bail by a Special Judge. He was arrested by the CBI’s Anti-Corruption wing, Chennai unit. Protesting the denial of bail to their colleague, policemen raised slogans and used derogatory language against the Special Judge. The agitating policemen even lathicharged photo journalists who took pictures of the protest. Some journalists were injured and their cameras destroyed. The agitators even refused to obey the orders of their superiors, including Inspector-General of Police.
The Special Judge (CBI cases) submitted a detailed report to the High Court. Following this, suo motu contempt proceedings were initiated against the policemen who were involved. Even though there were about 200 police personnel who were involved, only 92 could be identified.
The Bench observed that sit-ins and shouting slogans against the Judge were all intimidating tactics to exert pressure on him which could not be countenanced. It was rather astonishing that the police did not obey even the Inspector-General of Police’s direction.
Since the policemen tendered an unconditional apology, the Bench said, it was taking a lenient view of the matter. The Bench quashed a Union Territory G.O. of December 26, 2008 appointing a Commission of Inquiry to go into the incident, without consulting the High Court.

For art’s sake
","Madrasters (Mad-rastres or Madras-ters) is Chennai’s very own Photoshop User Group, an Adobe-authorised community for designers and art enthusiasts. Started by Jack Anto and Prabhagaran, it helps bring together likeminded people who are keen to share their love and knowledge for art and design. Explaining the idea behind the name, Prabhagaran says, “Photoshop is a Raster-based software and also a design-connected word. For us, Madras denotes emotions. We put the two together and that’s how Madrasters came up.” NXg talks to the duo to find out what drives this online community for creative souls.

What triggered the idea to start this community?

We are Visual Communication students whose only vision and dream is design. As freshers, when we started our careers, we came across people who were very critical of our work; they were rude! So we thought it was time for us to start Chennai’s PUG (Photoshop Users Group). As a first step, we got in touch with Adobe and got our community authorised. We wanted to show others the right way to go about designing. We wanted our work to be both criticised and appreciated by fellow designers. After we started, the number of members grew rapidly! From 28 to 74 to 120… suddenly we were a 1000-member group. That’s when Jack and I knew we had done the right thing!

What do you guys do?

Our community meets are for members of Madrasters. We also have open workshops for everyone. Our meets happen every Saturday and we discuss industry updates, have fun activities like Sand Art, Picture Perceptions etc. We have the Founding Team, Level 2 and 3 Contributors. Everybody pitches in and the quality of these discussions has been very good! We also plan for our upcoming workshops.

Why Madrasters?

Photoshop is a Raster-based software and also a design connected word. For us Madras denotes emotions. We put the two together and that’s how Madrasters came up.

Why move from PUG to Madrasters?

Photoshop is the glamour word for designers and non-users alike. People joined PUG because it focussed on Photoshop users. We wanted to broaden our horizon. Design is not just about Photoshop, so we decided to open this community to all art enthusiasts. We went from being PUG to Madrasters; however, we are still a group powered by PUG.

How has the response been?

The response has been phenomenal! Every day we have enquiries about our next meet.

Are there other such communities in Chennai?

We are the only ones. This has also raised our expectation bar from members and others really high.

What are your plans for the community?

We want to start an academy. We are looking for sponsors. Our dream is to be “THE” voice for all designers. Design rights are missing, prior credits need to be given — there is a difference between copying and deriving inspiration. Most designers have low incomes and little freedom; they are not given the freedom to think and execute; ideas are pushed down our throats. We want to be the place they can bring their problems to; we want to be able to help them get a lasting solution.

What are your upcoming projects?

We have two workshops lined up for May on Web UI Design and Typography at IIT Research Park.

An archive of archives
","Dayanita Singh’s File Room opens with an image of a lot of closed bundles, containing what we imagine might be files. The walls are peeling; no one has been in here for decades. Though the photographer is present, there is no sign of her, because, though the composition is precise, the perspective is neutral. Light enters from a sole window, which we do not see in its entirety, yet the camera has likely illuminated the photograph. Like the light of the moon in the dark. Immediately, there is no source, no centre. This image seems to instruct the viewer on how to read the book: we will see parts of a whole that may not exist, so desire not to piece this puzzle.
A series of images recount stacks of things; the repetition of the action of flipping pages mimics the repetition of what we see on them. Though the files, the cabinets that contain them, the men who handle depict a culture of the serial, each image is differentiated. The book, sans page numbers and a title on its cover is anonymous, it is also an editioned object. This tension between the standard and the singular permeates every side of paper. While its ideas are heady, they are also human, never initiating but not precluding the culture in which these stories are made, and the stark Indianness of governmental rooms, the way they date themselves in wear and tear, and the bureaucracy that they have come to represent.
The series is only interrupted by two passages by Aveek Sen, but the writing, in its sensual objectivity, mirrors the images, till the lines between that which is to be viewed and that which is to be read blur. ‘A Forest of Paper’ is told with the conceit of the author researching the smell of the whittling paper, and weaves us into the deep, chaotic, worm-ridden, rodent-infested corners of the rooms in which the photographs are taken. Yet, the place described does not seem to be decaying as much as bursting with life. The predators, lizards, bats, rats, play out their earthly dramas “in that moonless forest of paper, together with the rustle of its less tangible ghosts”. Truth is tucked deep into the files, so that the more that is concealed, the more is revealed. Sen’s words, “to lie unread in the dark is to last a little longer…” seem to resonate with all the ideas that are flipped on itself in the book at large.
The second story tells the tale of a woman, presumably Dayanita, who has spent her life with files, fighting a battle over land in the courts. The files seem to multiply, indexes, dates, waiting time repeating themselves and in vain. They seem to have a life of their own, and suddenly these files come to mean real lives on the line, vast spaces in dispute, a test of patience, love and priorities. The files become objects of idolatry, woe, sentimentality, hope. Paper is personified.
When we continue flipping through the pages of photographs of files, they no longer remain as stoic as they did before. The last image we see is of a room of bundles, this time, not as condensed, more haphazard, windowless. This moving finale is followed by a conversation between Dayanita and the curator, Hans-Ulrich Obrist. She describes that first photograph at the outset of the book as “bodies, they are like families” before Ulrich describes the room as “a morgue, or there’s something very death-related about it. The bundles make it related to death”. These individualised interpretations reflect the lack of a generic code in the very archival system represented. They measure the humanity of a hall, the whim of a wall.
The size of the book is unusual, large, register-like, yet the design is pristine, self-aware. This “monument of knowledge”, as an archivist in the interview calls it, is a trove of secrets that smell of the earth, secrets that were perhaps long sent away into the skies, never to be retrieved. And then are the things that stay with you at the end of the book, things omnipresent and everywhere.

Room without a View

Dayanita Singh opens up about the making of the book and how it turned out to be her most biographical work. Excerpts from an interview:

As a child, how did you occupy yourself? 

The usual — making sketches, re arranging furniture and making rooms within rooms, houses in bunk beds, and baking cakes.

Give instructions to your reader. Now give instructions to any reader, of any book. (What does it mean to read?) 

I read to travel and gather all kinds of experience. Equally I gather to study form — from Calvino and Geoff Dyer the form of making a new form for each work, from Ondaatje the art of withholding and so on. I think there are many ways of reading and underlining and re-reading.

How do you archive that which cannot be seen?

In the finest literature I think…

What playful bookmaking is next? Will it be contained in a portable, unfoldable museum, like 
File Room
 is contained in the Book Museum? 
The book has to be substantial in itself and then when it can also be an object, it becomes part of a larger object; that’s an extension. A wonderful bonus. But, the core is the book and that must be solid. That’s why I kept bringing you back to the book. It’s full of circles and secret layers. The next book is full of chance; in fact it’s called Museum of Chance!

I found myself feeling absurdly melancholic after closing your book. I was not simply thinking about memories and records and preservation at its end, I was thinking about the essential existentialism of living, I was wondering about love, the future, gardening. Can you read me back into your book and tell me why I felt like I did? Do you think this book can make you live better? 
Not sure if it’s for me to say if the book can make you live better, but certainly it’s a book about forgetting and remembering and by now you must have read my own biography in it. And to think I started off thinking I was finally making an objective documentation of paper to find this was my most biographical work. Yes I can imagine it can bring on melancholia and dizziness.

Elephant herd kills man in Tripura
","A herd of wild elephants on a rampage killed a man and destroyed crops in Khowai district of Tripura. The forest department has deployed guards in the affected area in Kalyanpur, some 70km northeast of Agartala, to push the herd into forests.
Bhupendra Debbarma, 35, of Godaibari village in Kalyanpur police station limit died at the GB Panth hospital in Agartala where he was admitted after sustaining grave injuries in an attack by the elephants on Thursday. The tribal man was collecting firewood when the incident occurred. “We have engaged our men to drive away the elephants. Forest department is conducting a probe on the death of the villager and family of the deceased would be awarded financial assistance as per norms”, local Forest Ranger Lal Mohan Das told The Hindu over phone on Friday.
Khowai district has been witnessing rampages by affected elephants that go to berserk mainly during summer. Alarmed by frequent influx of wild elephants into villages for search of food, state forest department is implementing a central government aided scheme to create two elephant reserves.

Poor vigil poses threat to railway passengers
","Even as intelligence sleuths alert police over possible terrorist attacks on railway stations and infiltration through trains, no foolproof measures have been taken to enhance vigil at busy stations.
In 2013, the Intelligence wing had cautioned the State Police against suspected terror groups targeting public places, particularly railway stations and had even pointed out that a ‘recce’ had been done on the Vijayawada railway station.
Subsequently, the Railways, Government Railway Police (GRP), Railway Protection Force (RPF) and the civil police were told to install surveillance cameras at parking lots, lounges, canteens, ticket and enquiry counters. They were also directed to streamline checking at entrances to railway stations. However, the directive was not properly complied with.
The GRP took several Bangladeshi nationals into custody at the Rajahmundry railway station for travelling without visa and related documents last year.
In fact, an Intelligence Bureau official had cautioned the railway authorities and police against infiltration through trains from neighbouring countries. “On information, we checked the Bangladeshi passengers at the Rajahmundry railway station, and we found that they were travelling without valid documents,” said Vijayawada Division GRP Superintendent of Police Ch. Syam Prasad. The Nagayalanka police arrested a Bangladeshi national in Krishna district in June last year. Police seized more than 2,000 gelatin sticks and wire bundles at the Guntur railway station late last year, but the case was undetected. In June, 2013, the Vijayawada City Police seized Pakistani currency, which was smuggled into India through trains. Two persons were arrested in this connection. “Owing to poor vigil, trains and railway stations have become targets for anti-social elements. We request the government to install more CC cameras and sanction the required staff to step up vigil at stations and on trains,” Mr. Syam Prasad said.

The ‘cost’ of urban living
","What does living in the world’s second most populous city mean for your mind and body?
While the Capital’s graph on its health status and environmental well-being doesn’t read too well, healthcare providers say that physical health takes a hit due to being exposed to high pollution levels, unhealthy eating habits, shrinking green spaces, harsh weather and the stress of making a living.
Establishing a strong link between rising pollution levels in the Capital and the resulting health problems, Centre for Science and Environment (Research and Advocacy) executive director Anumita Roychowdhury said: “Despite the several measures being taken to control air pollution levels, Delhi has gone back to the pre-CNG days. We are seeing dangerously high levels of air and noise pollution, and sadly we are now dealing with multiple pollutants known to cause cardiac and respiratory problems and long-term exposure can lead to cancer and metabolic problems.”
“Current data [which is still under investigation] suggests that expecting mothers who have been exposed to high levels of air pollution or are living near roads [where there is constant exposure to vehicular pollution] have babies with reduced brain size,” Ms. Roychowdhury added.

Research study

It is, however, not the physical well-being alone that takes a hit.
A research study on urban mental health by the Indian Council of Medical Research has indicated that city life, with its work and social stress, has resulted in an increase in the number of people suffering from psychiatric illnesses and sub-syndromes like headache, tension and insomnia.
Fortis Hospital’s Mental Health and Behavioural Sciences director Samir Parikh said: “Urban living increases stress because of the kind of lifestyle, poor work-life balance and lack of support systems.”
Meanwhile, speaking about the changed diet of the urban population, Indian Dietetic Association president Rekha Sharma explained: “For over 99 per cent of the urban population, the city offers very limited space for exercise, which added with our vastly changed dietary habits is very dangerous for the physical well-being of the people.”
“Gone for urban dwellers is the opportunity and access to eat a variety of grains, including maize, millet, ragi, etc., and wholegrain foods. Instead, we are forced to use fine carbohydrates, extensively processed calorie dense foods and even the type of fats we eat now have changed. Today we consume higher percentage of saturated fats. This, over the years, has seen a rise in lifestyle-related diseases in a much younger population.”

Book love in the time of cinema
","Such are the accelerated times we live in that I wondered, in a moment of panic, if this essay might be too late. It was spurred by the demise of Gabriel García Márquez on the afternoon of 17 April, a Thursday. But that was fifteen days ago. On Friday, as the news reached these shores, my Facebook timeline was filled with sad reminiscences about yellow butterflies and perfumed crows. A day later, however, the week’s big Bollywood release, 2 States, had begun “trending” – even Márquez had to give way to Bhagat.
Imagine the irony. The author who kept reminding us of the vastness of time – those one hundred years of solitude; the bachelor who, after nine decades, decided to gift himself an adolescent virgin; the lifetime that Florentino Ariza spent waiting for Fermina Daza – was, post mortem, resuscitated in the social media for a mere twenty-four hours.
Authors die, but they leave behind work that lives forever. There can, therefore, never be a too-late tribute to Márquez, who, with Nabokov, went to war against the distressing modern-day tendency to view language as a loincloth, a functional invention that went about its job in the least ostentatious manner. Language, to these writers, was a queen’s wardrobe of silks, and they celebrated its riches lavishly.
We are advised, for instance, that alliteration is bad. Nabokov gave us, in successive sentences in Lolita, “globules of gonadal glow” and “Canoeing, Coranting, Combing Curls in the lakeside sun,” and Márquez, when recalling the first man Fermina Daza heard urinate, spoke of the “sound of his stallion’s stream.” I could carry on in this vein, but this is a column about cinema and it may be more pertinent to change tracks and revisit that old question: Can a movie hope to capture the essence of a book, especially when language is such a crucial component of the book’s essence?
Márquez didn’t think so. He said, in an interview, “I can’t think of any one film that improved on a good novel, but I can think of many good films that came from very bad novels.” Still, if we replace the question “Is this film a good adaptation of the book?” with “How does this director go about adapting this book?” – in other words, if we replace judgement with inquiry – the movie may end up worthwhile after all, if not an exact reproduction of the book, then perhaps a version of the book, one that exists honourably in a parallel dimension.

Lolita is certainly one of those films for me, and its opening scene is among my favourite of all time. The book opens with the famous words: “Lolita, light of my life, fire of my loins. My sin, my soul.” The movie opens with a man’s hand applying nail polish on a woman’s toes over a swooning piano score. Humbert Humbert’s devotion to Lolita, his servitude, his thralldom to her beauty, his helplessness, his obsession, his intent to shape her in the image he carries inside his perverted head – the themes of the novel are all here, in under two minutes. Even if we don’t hear the words “light of my life, fire of my loins,” we sense them.
Márquez, I think, would have approved of this film. At least, he would have been happier with Kubrick’s struggle with Nabokov than with Mike Newell’s attempt to put Love in the Time of Cholera on screen. Márquez’s first chapter is ostensibly about the death of Dr. Juvenal Urbino, but it is also about so much else: the scent of bitter almonds, a corpse under investigation, the old slave quarter, the parrot that learned to speak French like an academician, Fermina Daza’s loss of the doe’s gait of her younger years, the couple’s “trivial everyday miseries,” and a few dozen other things, including Schubert’s Death and the Maiden.
A film that stayed faithful to all these details would never end, and yet, it’s in what the filmmaker chooses to keep and what he leaves out that we get a glimpse of the film’s eventual success or failure. Newell opens with the parrot on a tree. Dr. Urbino climbs a ladder. He falls. He dies. Where Kubrick gave us mood, Newell gives us plot. A queen’s wardrobe is reduced to a loincloth.

Nature writer non-pareil
","By the time I learnt that my favourite wildlife writer Peter Matthiessen was in India — he was studying the migrating cranes that gather annually in the village of Kichan, Rajasthan, for his book The Birds of Heaven: Travels with Cranes — he had already flown out of the country. I missed a chance to meet him. Now comes the news of his death at the age of 86.
Novelist, explorer and Zen monk, Peter Matthiessen became known in India after his epoch-making book Snow Leopard in 1978. Joining wildlife biologist George Schaller in his expedition to look for the rarest and most beautiful of all cats, Matthiessen trekked in the snow-bound Himalayan ranges. Though he never sighted the elusive leopard, Matthiessen’s account of travel across the Himalayas turned out to be a quest for the meaning of being, particularly the Buddhist point of view. He learnt from the sherpas and documented their wisdom. “The great sins, the sherpas say, are to pick up wildflowers or to threaten children.”
Matthiessen developed a style of nature-writing that makes the reader pause and look at the external world with all its life forms. Meticulously researching on the subject at hand, be it rhinos or turtles, he encapsulated his observation with magical descriptions. He showed that one of the purposes of a writer is to make people awake, to be alive… when he wrote about trekking in the hills, his reader trekked too. Through his lyrical prose, he passed on the essence of his experience in these searches.
In The African Silence, he wrote about his search for the pigmy elephants and The Tree Where Man was Born is a gripping account of the wildlife of East Africa. He wrote about India and its efforts to conserve wildlife in The Birds of Heaven.
There are two kinds of nature-writing. One is to write intuitively reacting to nature and its myriad forms of expression, like Thoreau, and the other is to look at wildlife from the point of view of a biologist, like George Schaller. In his works, Matthiessen effectively combined these two approaches with his imaginative literary technique. In his book on cranes, Matthiessen put down his philosophy: “One way to grasp the main perspectives of environment and biodiversity is to understand the origins and precious nature of a single living form, a single manifestation of the miracle of existence; if one has truly understood a crane — or a leaf or a cloud or a frog — one has understood everything.”
The most well-known of his novels is At Play in the Fields of the Lord, which is set in the Amazon with two American missionaries as the protagonists. Even when writing fiction, he remained a nature-writer nonpareil. It was made into a memorable film with the eponymous title.
However, his most plucky venture was his exploration of Zen. He began studying and practising Zen and became a monk. He set up a Zendo, a meditation centre, near his New York home. He recorded his insights in the book Nine-headed Dragon River. He acknowledged, “Anything written about Zen inevitably separates itself from Zen’s ‘instantaneous’ spirit. In using dead words to say that Zen is this or that, a separation is created and the freshness of the Zen moment is lost.” Yet he succeeded in bringing Zen as close to the reader as possible through his words.

Myriad shades of reality
","An easy chair sits pretty in a corner near the entrance. The chair takes a step backward to narrate its story of lost souls. Artist Diptej Vernekar looks on as the spotlight falls on the chair and one sees a newspaper clipping which blends to form an empty tea cup. As the cup gets filled with tea, in appears a cocktail glass filled ice cubes. “The lost chair in a way talks about our culture in a fix – not able to forget the past yet not adopting modernity,” states young artist Diptej, who has been selected for Khoj International Artists’ Association, Delhi. His work is part of an exhibition titled ‘The Flight – Up, Up & Away’ put together by outgoing students of the department of fine arts, Sarojini Naidu School of Arts and Communication, University of Hyderabad. Diptej who hails from Goa has brought out the cocktail quality of his native place. “This 25-year-old chair made by my father was lying in my uncle’s backyard. This is like a rebirth to the chair,” he says.
As the budding artists of the university get ready to move out and spread their wings, they have created works as diverse and distinct as their sensibilities. The foyer looks like a mini-India with youngsters from Uttarakhand, Gujarat, Assam, West Bengal, Odisha, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, Karnataka, Goa, Chandigarh and Chhattisgarh. The interesting part is the way these young artists have also integrated mixed media, motor induced mechanisms, performance and sound and video projections to enhance the visual experience for the onlooker.
Monika Bijlani, a freelance artist from Bhopal speaks through her abstract work. “I try to seek perfection through my lines. The pressure of being a single parent comes out; the roughly done edges speak about the need for perfection,” she says. Afza Tamkanat asserts her identity as an artist and shuns away negativity through the earthen pots. On the walls are her water colour works with tea wash. “The earthen pots is a reaction to the feedback I got to my works,” she laughs. All her childhood memories of growing up with pets and surroundings and her artist father are reflected in the work.
Also standing majestically on a rhino is God of Shunya by artist Sujeesh Oncherry. “When I came from Calicut to Hyderabad, I found emptiness in this new place. Slowly the emptiness faded away. Rhino looks a powerful animal but is not. I wanted to depict the emptiness and in India, one is never short of gods,” he smiles. At Kartar Singh’s zone, there are ‘brains’ and Gandhi topis made of plaster of paris strewn around. “One intends to take something positive from every source but gets different kinds of information – positive and negative — from various sources. Everyone says they are aam aadmi but when they see power, they worship it,” says the artist from Chattisgarh.
Atindra showcases his life with family and friends on a canvas titled ‘I’. The Pictures have been interestingly pasted with benzene on mirror pieces cut as squares. “I have my school and college friends, my family members and others too here. I have left one square empty for people to walk in and be a part of my life,” he says.
Monica sums up the exhibition as an amalgamation of different thoughts and influences. “This shows how much professionalism we have acquired and our desire to work towards it.”
The exhibition by these 34 young artists is on till May 4 between 10 a.m. to 8 p.m.

Train blasts shatter Chennai calm
","In a May Day shocker, >two blasts in a train as it arrived at the Chennai Central railway station on Thursday morning claimed the life of >a woman passenger and injured 14, raising concern about the peaceful conduct of the two remaining phases of the Lok Sabha election in neighbouring Andhra Pradesh and other States.
Shortly after the Bangalore-Guwahati Express pulled into platform nine, two low-intensity bombs went off, one in the S-4 coach and the other in S-5, at 7.08 a.m. Parchuri Swathi, an information technology professional bound for Guntur, was killed on the spot.
Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Jayalalithaa >transferred the case to the Crime Branch CID for investigation, as the State was not keen on an investigation by the >National Investigation Agency.
Eyewitnesses said they heard two explosions in quick succession. Shocked passengers ran out of the train to safety. Several others escaped the blast as they had stepped out to have breakfast during the 40-minute halt. The three affected coaches were detached after which the train left for Guwahati five hours late.
“Some injured persons were in a state of shock and could not move. We shifted them to safety with the help of some porters. The damage would have been devastating had the blast occurred when the train was moving,” Vijay Kumar, travelling ticket examiner, said.
Parrying queries on whether the >explosions were targeted at Andhra Pradesh where the BJP’s prime ministerial candidate, Narendra Modi, addressed election rallies on Thursday, a senior police official said the focus now was on nabbing the culprits.

Snag delayed train


Sruthisagar Yamunan reports
A snag in the braking system that delayed the Bangalore-Guwahati Express by 45 minutes between Krishnarajapuram and Bangarapet on Thursday morning perhaps prevented the blast occurring on a speeding train with possibly graver consequences.
According to a Southern Railway official, had the train run on schedule, it would have been between Tada and Sullurpetta in Andhra Pradesh at the time of the blast (around 7.15 am).
Significantly, BJP prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi was scheduled to attend a public meeting in Nellore on Thursday evening.

The Queen of May
","As we enter the month of May, with roses blooming all over and May Queen contests being planned in hotels, restaurants, clubs and residential colonies, one’s thoughts go back to the 1890s which saw Delhi’s first May Queen being selected. This is as per hear-say. Some however claim that the first such event did not take place during the viceroyalty of Lord Curzon but when Lord Lytton as Governor-General came here in 1877.
Going by what Norah Nicholson used to say till her death as a nonagenarian many years ago, the first May Ball was held at Ludlow Castle, where the European Club had been moved from the Town Hall because of a plague epidemic scare in 1898. She had, as a young girl, heard from her grannies that the function saw the crowning of Miss Ball as May Queen. Could have been a memory lapse for the contest winner’s father (Ball Sahib) was a noted magistrate at Agra in early 20th Century and later migrated to South Africa where he set up a lucrative legal practice. His daughter (living in the house on the hill) became May Queen in the city of the Taj in the 1920s, long after the famous contest was held at the Savoy in Mussoorie. According to the late Mrs Roberts, born in 1880, the name of the dimpled girl who won the title in Delhi was Heather Jones, and when she was crowned her admirers went wild with joy, while her rival Charmain Miller’s supporters gulped down their disappointment with large pegs of whisky on a night which was unexpectedly cool for that part of the year because of a strong breeze blowing from the Ridge.
Among those present were the Houghtons, Campbells, a visiting writer, Miss Saunders, Mr Maidens, who founded Maidens Hotel, a number of CMS clergymen and a Catholic priest of St Mary’s Church. This reverend Father impressed on the gathering that the first-ever May Queen was the Virgin Mary, to whom the month of May is devoted. Present also were the proprietors of London Stores, Spencer’s and Carlton’s from Kashmere Gate. Some Punjabi Muslim shoe merchants (who came to Delhi during the time of Shah Alam) and the Khatri businessmen, who settled down during the reign of Shah Jahan, also managed to enter Ludlow Castle hall. It’s worth mentioning that the Qaum Punjabian’s main face at that time was the Hanafi Siddiqui, whose family was more interested in setting up printing presses, madrasas and building mosques. The Khatris were headed by Lala Chunna Mal who, along with other elite, both Muslim and Hindu, used to “take the air” in the spacious Kashmere Gate area, then the lungs of the city. The most boisterous were the Tommies from the Red Fort and Daryaganj. They had come in their one-horse carriages, sounding trumpets, blowing whistles and raising hurrahs before parking their Ticca gharries at the hackney carriage stand on Ludlow Castle Road, which continued to exist till the early 1970s.
If one were to go by the treatise, “Delhi between Two Empires”, that was the time when many of the Mirzas and Mirs had come down a step or two from their high pedestal to become school teachers and clerks because of income constraints. Better off than them were the karkhandars or owners of small factories. One wonders how many of these neo-rich managed to be at the club which had presumably relaxed its rules for the much-touted May Queen show. According to historian Naryani Gupta, the Civil Lines had ceased to be the main residential area for the Europeans by then and “second-class Europeans” had begun to settle down north of Qudsia Garden and Nicholson Park. They were mostly Telegraph and Railway employees, like the ones depicted in the film “Julie”, in which Om Prakash plays the role of a bottle-happy Anglo-Indian dad. To select the May Queen may not have been the railwaymen’s prerogative but their presence at the renamed Delhi Club could not be overlooked as Heather’s father was a senior railway engine driver. Charmain Miller, first runner-up “and taller by far, burst into tears, burying her sweet face in her delicate hands as her boyfriend tried to comfort her with umpteen kisses,” recalled Mrs Roberts in the 1960s. The May Queen contests now are more lavish and popular but somehow one always thinks that the cultural pastures were greener when the Civil Lines was the centre of fashion, with hotels like Lauries, Cecil, Suisse and Maidens vying with each other. Railwaymen did not usually frequent them but still they formed an influential community since New Year’s Eve 1867, when the first train arrived in Delhi and its whistle was heard in the Walled City.

Thinking outside the frame
","A cheery painting here, a sculpture in a corner, an installation art there, a mural at the entrance… This is how new-age conference halls, boardrooms, executive lounges, office lobbies and college corridors look like. These areas once meant stiff leather chairs, notice boards and a staid painting or two that merged with the wall. Now, these are the new spaces for art. And, heralding this aesthetic change are executives with an artistic bent of mind, and those who believe art is a soothing, enriching experience.
Visitors to the expansive lobby of Le Meridien, part of the Starwood Hotels & Resorts network, are greeted by two large multi-media murals, created by Santhanam, a local artist. It showcases local agricultural traditions and serves as an introduction to Kongu culture. Inside, the rooms abound with decals bearing motifs of cotton, the staple crop which gives Coimbatore the moniker of Manchester of South India.
The art work, says P. Ramachandran, hotel manager, is in keeping with Starwood’s policy of recognising and showcasing local art. They also have plans to provide some space to local artists to sell their creations.
Industrialist Ravi Sam’s office in Sowripalayam is a gallery of sorts with elegant sculptures, water bodies, vibrant cushions and lots of wall art. Art, he says, frees up the mind and calms him down.
His staff loves the workspace too. “They are very proud of their workspace, and often, I notice them showing people around, and explaining the aesthetics,” he says.
Shankar Vanavarayar’s love for art, photography and artefacts is evident in his workspace. Once his collection crossed a certain number, he decided the art was not going to be just for his eyes; it would embellish public spaces. Some of the works hang in family-run enterprises, besides Kumaraguru College of Technology, of which Shankar is joint correspondent.
The visitors’ lobby, conference halls, and even some corridors in the college boast works by local artists. An entire wall has been dedicated to the works of renowned wildlife photographer T.N.A. Perumal. “Students love this display of art, and they seek to replicate it in their homes,” says Shankar. It makes art more accessible, and triggers curiosity, he adds.

Local touch

Pricol is another corporate where the walls have been home to art works for more than two decades now. A mixture of abstract, realistic and contemporary art has been showcased in the passages, offices and even factory. Most of these have been created by artists in Coimbatore and Chennai. Vanitha Mohan, vice-president, says it breaks the monotony and serious look of an office and lends it colour and life.
People have always invested in art in a private capacity, but why do they bring it in the public domain? After you acquire a certain quantum of paintings, you just feel the need to share their beauty with the world. How long can you look at something yourself, asks a collector.
So, they circulate the works, and shuffle them around the office space. This way, every work gets displayed, and it also lends a new, dynamic look.
Ravi Sam started collecting art when he was just out of college. “Initially, I was more into traditional art such as bronzes and Tanjore paintings. There was very little focus on contemporary art,” he says. Today, some of his collections are in storage; the rest are sprinkled around his work space. “For office, I choose something that can be easily understood by all. So, I opt for near-realistic paintings,” he says.
Shankar started displaying his art collection about five years ago. He says two reasons act as a trigger for wanting to take art outside personal spaces — when you have a sense of satisfaction in sharing your collection, and when you want to promote a local artist.
This is why he visits and purchases at exhibitions held at Kasthuri Sreenivasan Trust (KST) featuring student artists, especially those from the Government College of Fine Arts Chennai, and Kumbakonam.
Coimbatore has two main galleries — the 25-year-old KST and the more recent Contemplate Art Gallery, started by Rajshree Pathy, besides some new entrants. D Sarath Chandran, managing trustee, KST, works out an office where a painting of five horses takes over a wall. At the KST gallery, the focus, he says, is on regular buyers who value the ‘visual’ impact and don’t really buy art as investment.

Unique statement

In some spaces, art is bought en mass to suit the décor; it does not make an individual style statement. Shankar says art must not be there for effect. “It must not be an impersonal effort. In many ways, art affects your mood and your mood affects what you display. I do not believe in stacking a lot of stuff on the walls, just for effect. They must have a purpose. They must inspire, and educate.”

Choosing art for public spaces

hang works that will strike a chord with people
Realistic works draw attention
Avoid disturbing images; choose paintings that spread cheer
Keep rotating works; it keeps interest alive

When you already know it
","Imagine yourself travelling to a new country on a vacation and while you’re touring a famous monument, the feeling of having been there before thrills you.
Or, while you’re discussing a football match with friends over dinner and suddenly you experience that you’ve already gone through this very thing — same friends, same dinner, the same topic.
This very feeling is déjà vu — a French term which literally means, ‘already seen’.
Elaborating such experiences of déjà vu from his life comes bestselling author Arpit Dugar. His his new book “Not Yet to Be Disclosed” — launched in the Capital recently — revolves around the character Avnish who, from time to time, experiences déjà vu. The urge to discover the reason behind such experiences compel him to travel across the world to places unobserved, only to meet a girl after which his life changes dramatically.
Dugar, a native of Jaipur, has written a prequel to the book titled Nothing For You My Dear, Still I Love You. He admits that the character in the latest book is a reflection of his own-self. “The incidences that happened with me inspired me to write as they were never believed by people when told verbally because they were so weird and surprising. The concept of déjà vu is somewhat scientific in content and many people don’t know much about the topic. Before penning it down, I discussed it with psychologists and psychiatrists,” he says.
Dugar believes in the philosophy of “busy is a person who has time for everything!”
Bearing resemblance to its prequel, the book has an attractive bright red cover with a couple trying hard not to show what’s happening under the cover of their umbrella. The 270-pager holds much more beyond what the cover page conveys though.

Kani tribe uses age-old techniques to good effect
","At a time when the Forest Department is using various methods such as erection of solar fence to prevent wild animals from entering villages and raid crops, Kani tribe in the Western Ghats of Kanyakumari district follow age-old techniques to good effect.
Madhavan Kani of Padupparai Kani settlement says the techniques are passed on from one generation to the next. He says they have developed tools using bamboo and wood to chase animals back into the forest before they raid agricultural crops. They use ‘stone bow’ — a bamboo bow with two strings — using which they shoot stones instead of an arrow to chase animals such as monkeys, langurs, squirrels and birds that may destroy their crops.
They also use ‘Kulikkai,’ made of bamboo. It is two-feet long. A wooden stick is kept in place in the middle cross-wise using a rope. When the tool is moved left and right, the wooden piece in the middle strikes on the hollow bamboo and creates noise. On hearing this noise, animals get scared and leave the fields.
Another tool of the Kani tribe is ‘adi-udukkai.’ It is made from a two-feet-long bamboo piece. A slit is made in the bamboo for half an inch where the slit portion remains as a separate piece, but remains attached to the major piece at one end. When the bamboo is shaken upwards and downwards, the slit portion strikes at the major piece, the vibration of which creates noise to scare away animals from their fields. This tool is used during daytime to scare away squirrels, monkeys, and birds. At night, it is used to drive away wild boars and small nocturnal animals.
Chathan Kani of Velampi kani tribe settlement says four to five feet deep trenches are dug to prevent elephants from entering agricultural fields. Because of its large size, an elephant cannot step down into a narrow and deep trench and come out of it, he says.
